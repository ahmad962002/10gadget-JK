<span>I was expecting this to be a pain to set up simply because I had never security camera system before. But I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was and the installation went off without any issues!</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>After customer service became abysmal from Lorex as a whole, we were elated to find these in stock for our clients. But what we got was nowhere near the quality we use to get from this company. Batteries at full charge only lasting about 10 days, in a busier area only lasting about 19 hours. Even the hard drive went bad at a clients home within a week so we had to replace the hard drive ourselves due to the importance of the camera system.<br/>I am not sure what happened to these, because we absolutely loved Lorex. But after their performance now, we are going to stop using and selling these to our clientele.</span>

<span>The battery system seem to be Ok but, the recorder box was outdate and never worked, I paid $400. to Geek Squad at Best Buy to make it work and they also failed to make the connection to my PC.<br/>Attn. Seller What are going to do with this Sec. Camera Outfit that failed??? Can I returned and get my money back?</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Product was advertised with a long unobstructed receiving range, however, with the antenna integrated with the recording unit, you cant put it outside for better reception. Pictures are clear, works great with ipad and iphone however it does have about a 10 second lag before the cameras come on line. Client 13 does not work with a PC. Tried both Windows 7 and 10, had a brief picture with 7 but nothing with 10. Never got 7 to work again. Will call support. Bought it for farm security, max range is 200 feet if antenna is outside.</span>

<span>I upgraded from a lower tier system by a company moving away from NVR's to the cloud only.<br/>The NVR in this system is solid and exactly what I was looking for.  I got an additional 8-channel NVR like I had in my previous setup despite 16-channel NVR's being available.<br/>The cameras are well built and an upgrade to my previous ones in many ways (dual band, resolution, access, image quality, etc.)  Dual hand connectivity was a big selling point for me as I really wanted to move away from all 2.4 GHz devices as I could.<br/>I couldn't physically run POE back to the NVR but I could run Ethernet cables from most of the cameras back into my wired network since I already had power ran to everywhere the new cameras replaced my previous ones.  Out of 16 cameras, I was able to wire all but 5 of them.  The remaining wireless ones are getting good signal strength.  The cameras were very easy to position and install.  I only had 2-3 tricky places.<br/>App support is good and the Alexa integration was super easy to setup and works like my previous system.</span>

<span>Love the system. Tech support was helpful. He to re engineer some of the antennas to get it to work. The main camera I needed the system for is approximately 170 feet from where the system is located. Had the purchase a directional antenna and elevate it to connect. The second camera, on the front door, I had the change to a 9 dbi antenna for it to connect.  Once those corrections were made, it works great</span>

<span>Update....so it hasn't even been a year and 2 of my 4 cameras have stopped working. We have tried reaching out to the company to get this fixed and never have gotten a response. So while the system is great when it is working....you are out of luck when they stop working. This system works really well outside despite snow or rain. The only issue I have had with the system is that the camera located the furthest away from the main box sometimes looses signal but not for long. I love the fact that I can pull the cameras up on my phone from anywhere to check on my home. Some of my other family members have this system as well and we can link our cameras together and keep an eye on everyone's homes. This system is well worth the money. Only thing you need besides this camera system is an HDMI cable as that is not included.</span>

<span>This is definitely a great system. The picture quality is amazing. Installation is simple since I didn’t have to run cables between the cameras and recorder. All I had to do is install the cameras and plug them into power. I only needed help to set up remote viewing, I called REVO’s customer support and they helped me set it up on my phone. I was up and running in a few minutes.</span>

<span>Great picture for not being a 4K. They are pretty self explanatory on setting up. I didn’t want to run a bunch of Ethernet wire so I opted for the wireless version. Only have to supply camera with a 110 outlet. Photos day/night speak for themselves. You will have to adjust the motion detection, especially for outside ones. Flying bugs set it off pretty easily out of box. Which then activates the spotlight and brings more bugs.<br/><br/>Only drawback that I have with them is the signal strength. These models have no external antennas to help with that. They have to run through your wifi to be able to view/control them remotely with app. But, that’s a semi easy fix. I bought a wifi signal booster to amplify my signal strength to reach other end of house from my router.</span>
