                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I was interested in getting one of these for my car for a while. Not necessarily this model. Just a computer I could put in my car. The problem is I didn't know which one to get. So, I figure just buy the cheapest one you can get first to see how easily it will be to get it working. Most of it was easy to install. The radio works, I can Bluetooth my tablet or phone to listen to music (which is good for MP3 playback or iHeartRadio), and it allows the addition of a USB drive. I can, literally, have up to 8000 songs in my car at once (32 GB / 4 MB a song = 8,000 songs).<br/><br/>The problem lies in the fact that it came with a camera that I haven't been able to get working and a GPS. Now, I didn't get it to utilize the camera (and it was a used item that cost me $150, so not bad anyways). However, the GPS software wasn't easy to get working. It uses iGO Primo GPS (the car version of their software) of which iGO themselves discontinued. The software they offer customers to update their PDAs or SD card with maps won't even recognize the SD card I got to hold the maps. They still offer the app version of their software, of which the software was last updated back in 2009 (the software not the maps). To find some maps, I had to go to gpspower.net to see where I could find some. Furthermore, you're going to need to buy a Micro-SD card to put the maps on.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>To begin with the item I received was in great condition as far as packaging and quality. After installing the screen was unresponsive. After reaching out to a support agent, I received an exchange order and the replacement I was sent worked as soon as it was installed. This was primarily bought for Apple CarPlay to use for company purposes and we can confidently say that we are satisfied with this purchase.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I installed it on my class A Motorhome and this system is seen to be fast and very responsive to apps but, once you connect to CarPlay, it disconnect from the wifi, you can’t use both at the same time.<br/>I will return it as I want to be able to connect it to my Rv wifi while using CarPlay for phone calls and other things</span>

<span>I am very impressed with this radio.  It has all the features you could want.  It does have wireless and wired for both Android Auto and Carplay.  It is android 11 not 10 now.  I highly recommend doing the online update.  It really makes it work great.  If I was to complain about anything the screen sensitivity is weak.  I have to double press buttons sometimes, but it is minor.  I was able to get the steering wheel controls working with no problem.  I put a sim card in it and it works, but so far I am only getting 3G on AT&amp;T.  I am working on resolving that.  As you can see in the pics it matches the style of my outlander exactly.<br/><br/>I really recommend this radio!</span>

<span>Great bang for your buck. Where else can you find a built in DVD player, back up camera, GPS and Bluetooth? No where.<br/><br/>Let's go through the installation process, I bought a wiring harness and female connectors and it was a breeze with the previous striped wires PYLE gives. Mounting was easy with a purchase of the face plate on amazon. The only thing difficult, and not really difficult just time consuming, was hiding the wires to the back up camera.<br/><br/>Once installed everything works great, good equalizer on the sound, nice picture on the DVD player and gps. Easy to connect our phones with very easy instructions. I hope this helps anyone thinking of purchasing.</span>

<span>received  the item in good condition and earlier than I expected.. Very thing works as advertised. Bluetooth paired easily, back up camera is clear, GPS works well. It installed easily but due to my own fault had to get a new GPS antenna (cut my antenna coax by mistake) contacted Pyle and had a new one in 4 days. The guy at Pyle was very helpful. Only glitch is how to wire the "Key1 &amp; Key2" wires to my stearing wheel control wire harnes. could use better instruction here. Looks good,, works good. good value. just wish I could figure out how to wire stearing wheel control interface.</span>

<span>Good for the price, could be more user friendly. Display is kind of lame but looks nice and clean. Static on the radio channels but clear on bluetooth.<br/>Connecting the bluetooth can be difficult. Will not let multiple devices pair and you have to reset the pass code everytime you want to switch phones. I could be doing it wrong but either way it's not that user friendly. Back up camera is clear, when mounted on a larger truck the lines for parking are way off the ground. I could adjust it but then my view is limited. I noticed a few reviews complained of the back up camera not automatically turning on when put in reverse, other users had to put the vehicle in reverse then push the camera button on the unit. Mine does not do that, it automatically switchs to the back up camera when put in reverse like it should. It does have really annoying alerts that come on when speeding, it shouts at you at full volume. Thankfully there is a option to turn off alerts.<br/>Otherwise for the price can't really complain, I went cheap on the head unit but put Alpines in all 4 doors so I think its a good combination. Lastley don't forget to buy the wire harness and dash kit for your year/make/model of vehicle that does not come with it. Common sense but still figured I'd mention it.</span>

<span>Beware, I was not able to get the backup camera to work (automatically when car is in reverse). I can put the car in reverse and press the "camera" button on the home screen - and that works. So the camera is properly wired to reverse signal, and comes on - but when the stereo is playing music, and you put the car in reverse - the camera does not ALWAYS come on automatically - defeating the purpose of the backup camera. Not a bad stereo - and has a lot of bells and whistles that more expensive cameras have. You get what you pay for though - and it is not "pretty" with the interface. But it does the job. No real complaints other than I wish the backup camera worked! Also, I had to re-tell it where the GPS software was, for some reason it lost the setting... oh and the main home clock doesn't want to stay synced to the GPS time, it flips to AM when it is PM - weird.</span>

<span>First off this is a great unit nice screen and has a decent sound. But the issues make it hard too say I made the right choice.  1 dash cam records but unable to playback video.  2  Z link wireless works when it wants to.  3 you have to close out all your apps because they will start up one by one when you turn the unit back on (example) if you listen to the music  player then decide to listen to bluetooth they will both play at the same time the next time you turn it on.  4  the screen will freeze on me like every two days which is really annoying. If these issues can be resolved with some kind of update then this is by far one of the best on the market......  Update:  had the unit for a little over a month now joying kindly gave me an update it did not really fix any of the problems but with that being said even with the issues I listed above it's still a great unit. That's why I'm bumping it up to three stars.  Hopefully they will come out with another version of this unit and work on the issues this one had. I dont wont to  Discourage any one from getting this unit maybe I just got a defective one you might have better luck!!!</span>

<span>I've had this radio installed in my wife's car for about 2 and a half months now. Once installed it worked fine for the first week or so. Then the screen started to get jittery. This now comes and goes. Then it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. I unplugged the wires from the unit and plugged them back in and it was fine. Hoped that was it, but it has stopped working again. I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, but I can tell you I am very disappointed with this unit. I was looking for an affordable name brand unit and it looks like this brand is not it. It is possible that I have a defective unit, but this is just disappointing from what I thought was a decent car radio manufacturer.</span>

<span>I spent several months looking at units for my daily driver truck which is quite old and ultimately settled for this unit due to the amount of features, the overall average reviews, the fact my truck is old/not worth much investment, and low price of this unit.<br/><br/>A detailed write up of my observations/experience so far with this unit (go to bottom for tl;dr):<br/><br/>1. Install<br/>-Very straightforward if you've installed systems before and really there's no need for a manual since the wiring harness is marked as long as you buy the wiring harness adapter for your vehicle and/or look up the correct wires.<br/>-The rear view camera appears to be activate on video, or activate via signal cable via reverse. I used the activate on video signal as I already had the backup camera wired to the reverse lights and it powers on automatically.<br/>-The antenna input is in the unit and so far works fine, don't forget to run power to your power antenna if you have one, or you might not get great reception. I tied in my power antenna power cable to the unit power so it activate with the vehicle power on. No issues with radio reception at all.<br/>-Inputs/Outputs - I'm not currently using these but they are there.<br/>-has rear/front USB ports.<br/>-auxillary microphone, this unit comes with the auxillary mic and adhesive. It plugs into the 3.5mm jack on the harness. The mic reception is great, I installed it through dash, up the pillar, and behind the rearview mirror near the center front of the vehicle on the windshield. It is one of the best microphones I've used and calls are very clear for both me and the other person(s).<br/><br/>*Note: If you want to bypass the video restrictions you will want to wire your parking wire to something that's always activated while the vehicle is on such as the power. Do at your own risk, but a nice feature if you have passengers/kids and want the video to play while moving for them.<br/><br/>2. Functionality<br/>-Bluetooth - connects quickly and supports audio pass through. auto activates if you have an app open. The only downside is that some contacts don't seem to display the name from my phone book on the head unit for incoming calls- not sure if that is my device, and/or some technicality in the way the phone number is saved or this actual unit. The unit supports having multiple phones added, but is a bit weird in switching them. This unit does not support any Android Auto or iPhone Driving integrations, but it doesn't claim to so no problems here.<br/>-Radio - tunes well and presets are easy to set, just hold down and it saves the stations.<br/>-DVD/CD - haven't used this yet.<br/>-Front Micro SD Card Slot - I tried a few times to use a 128gb micro sd card for some random test videos, the product states it only supports 32gb so maybe it's just my fault, but if not all I get is incorrect media format errors or I can see the videos, but they won't play.<br/>-Front USB - same issue as SD Card slot, not sure if my video formats, but won't play my .mp4 or .mpeg videos of 64gb USB Stick.<br/>-Touchscreen/Responsiveness/Readability - never seems to lag works well for me. Has brightness adjustment, I never have issues with glare, but never did as this unit is not mounted at an angle. Supports auto-dim if your vehicle has the dim feature when headlights go on for night driving (most new vehicles do).<br/>-UI/Icons/Usuability - works well, icons not customizable, you can't put the most commonly used icons on the first screen, instead you have 3 hard coded home screens. Not a big deal for me. One downside is that there is no menu option to change the led color of the head unit buttons.<br/>-Backup Camera - touched on this earlier, but this works well and automatically activates on reverse if installed properly.<br/>-remote - works well and comes with a batter, I don't use it much though, just tried it out a few times.<br/><br/>tl;dr - works well overall on major functions, lacks ability to customize home screens or button backlight colors. Comes with microphone, harness, and remote. Have had issues with MicroSD/USB but probably just me. Bluetooth quality great, supports Bluetooth passthrough and phone calls.</span>

<span>MY VOICE IS HOARSE, I CAN NO LONGER SCREAM AT IT!<br/><br/>The installation was not easy (2009 Toyota Venza).  The radio comes with thousands of mounting holes (Not literally).  But of all the options available I couldn't find ONE that fit.  I had to modify my mounting bracket - what a job that was.  But I finally got it mounted (and wired).<br/><br/>Let me start with what I like (sort of):  The radio accepts input from my steering wheel.  However, the options are not user friendly. Sure, I can scan up and down and can turn the volume up and down, but the mode button, which I can assign various functions, could not be used to select between "MODES". GO FIGURE!  NO "MODE" OPTION!.  OK, so you have to touch the screen.<br/><br/>Now on to some of the lesser appreciated features - the touch screen.  It's almost like a tactile button, you have to PUSH the screen to get it to do something.  And yes, for those of you who might wonder 'did he take the protective plastic screen off?' Well, YES, I DID.  Touch screen is difficult but not impossible.  And I know my wife is going to insist I put back the factory radio within days of using it.  OK, so that's one negative about it - the touch screen.  The NEXT negative thing I have to say is the USB and the SD chip slots:  They're difficult to get things into - especially if you have fat fingers like I do.  OK, got them in.  BUT:  Try playing random tracks.  FORGET-ABOUT-IT!  I DID get it to work a few times, but when I came out of the store it was back on Radio (which I was playing USB at the time).  Sometimes the radio actually comes back on USB - oh, and yes, for some of you who are wondering 'did he wire it right?' Yes.  The yellow wire goes to battery positive and the red wire goes to ACC.  The radio DOES retain radio station memory, so it's not mis-wired.<br/><br/>I don't know why but every device I plug into the radio always starts with Crosby Stills &amp; Nash! (unless it's not on the disk)  It ignores Alice Cooper, Boston and anything else with a lower alphabetical rating.  And I just spent a couple hours preparing a brand new SD card (32 GIG)(C10).  Got all the music I wanted just the way I wanted it.  All the radio had to do was simply PLAY them.  Aside from starting at CSN, when I forced it to select Blue Oyster Cult (three songs on the album) the display showed 1 of 6, 3 of 6 and 5 of 6.  THERE'S ONLY THREE SONGS IN THAT FOLDER!  tracks #2, 4 &amp; 6 are "Audio File Unsupported".  And the frustrating thing about it is that some files will play without the annoying pause while it decides the file is unsupported.  And in some cases it would go from unsupported to unsupported to unsupported to unsupported before it finds something it likes to play.<br/><br/>Ever play the lottery?  You surely HOPE to win but you don't EXPECT to.  Well, I read several reviews and saw that a lot of people like theirs.  Some didn't.  And many of the complaints I thought could be traced to user error.  Well, I've been around long enough to know how to install a stereo. In fact, I've probably installed 20 in my lifetime and probably 8 in the last 10 years.<br/><br/>I thought I'd get lucky and be one of the satisfied customers.  I'm NOT buying any lottery tickets this weekend - that's for sure.  Oh,and the name?  I didn't realize it at first, this is a "BOSS" radio.  NOT a BOSE radio.  Apparently there's a BIG difference. And not just in price. AND I'M NOT THROUGH COMPLAINING YET!<br/><br/>Assuming the volume control works from 1 to 30, 30 being the loudest it gets.  As you go from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 and so on you expect the volume to go up in a linear fashion.  NOT MINE!  It goes up (for example) from (lets start with something you can hear - SEVEN).  OK, so it goes 7 to 7 to 9 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 13.  With the stereo volume knob AND with the volume control on the steering wheel.<br/><br/>This radio is in my wife's car.  And she gets short tempered with things that don't work like they're supposed to.  I KNOW I'm going to be pulling this thing right back out.  After all the time I spent altering the brackets to mount the radio in the right location (two day installation), properly and with high quality, I soldered and shrink sleeved all the connections from the radio harness to the installation kit I also bought (not impressed there either).  Paying attention to every detail I made a professional looking wire harness that just plugs in.  Well, all that hard work and I'm probably going to be pulling this piece of junk back out of her car.<br/><br/>Well I'm going to quit my BlTCHING about it and go watch TV.  Maybe Mork &amp; Mindy is on tonight.  Something more intelligent than the radio.<br/><br/>Should you buy it?  This is just my opinion but I think you should look elsewhere - somewhere that manufactures REAL radios, not something that LOOKS like the real thing. The only "Real" thing about this radio is that I'm sorry I purchased it.  I'll be talking to the supplier in short order - no doubt!  Well, there's another thing I'm wrong about - I THOUGHT I'd be talking to the supplier but they don't want to talk to me.  I can find no way to contact them.</span>

<span>Just installed this unit yesterday in my 2008 Altima Coupe.  So far it works great, but I was a little disapointed in some areas.  First for the positives.  Installation was a breeze.  If you've ever installed a car stereo before, it should be pretty easy.  The only curve ball I got was with the DVD player.  There is a light green wire that you're supposed to connect to your parking brake light, but rather than rip my whole car apart trying to do that, I simply grounded the wire so it works all the time.  The functions are easy to use, and the touch screen works well for the most part.  Syncing my phone to the bluetooth was easy too, only took a coupe seconds, and it's still synced after turning the car off and turning it back on.  I haven't tried making any calls yet, but I'm confident it'll work just fine.  It also comes with a microphone you're going to have to run from behind the unit to somewhere on your dash in order to make phone calls.  Everythings labeled on the back of the unit if you plan on installing a backup cam or a sub as well, which i plan to in the near future.  For the negatives, which are very minor.  The equalizer is somewhat limited from what i can tell.  You're only able to change the treble and the bass, and it only comes with "pop" "rock" and "classical" presets.  Obviously this is good enough to get by, but I was hoping to be able to customize the sound more.  For me this could also be a good thing, because it gives me less to worry about really.  I always try to get the most perfect sound, and if there's more options, then I'm always messing with the equalizer.  Also, unless you use the remote, you're music automatically stops when you return to the home screen to play with the equalizer, which is annoying when you're trying to get the sound right.  Another dissapointment was when I plugged my iphone in the USB port...and nothing happened.  Turns out this USB drive only supports USB flash drives with media stored on them, not phones/ipods.  It didn't even charge it.  There's also a USB wire on the back of the unit that I plan to experiment with, but when I plugged my phone into that it would charge for a second, then stop for a second, the charge for a second, and stop again and so on.  The dissapoinment was the blue tooth quality.  This might have to do with my install, but playing music through the blue tooth mode produced a significantly lower quality than a CD or AUX chord.  There was some static and it just didn't produce the same bass.  I'm sure it's fine for phone calls, but I'm going to stick with an AUX chord for now.  Don't let these negatives scare you away (unless you only want this unit for these specific features I'm talking about).  I love the unit so far, and I can't wait till I get all my other goodies install as well.</span>
