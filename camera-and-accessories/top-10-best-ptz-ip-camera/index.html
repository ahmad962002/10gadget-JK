Monitoring a large area comes with its share of obstacles. Usually, it requires several security cameras to ensure proper coverage. However, the Lorex LNZ44P12B 4.0 Megapixel Super HD PTZ IP Dome Camera can overcome many of these issues. With its ability to pan left and right, tilt up and down and zoom in incredibly close thanks to a 12x optical zoom lens, this PTZ camera can do it all. Control the camera’s movement remotely to view the entire scene from your Lorex NVR or from a connected smartphone, tablet or computer! Color Night Vision delivers full color nighttime video for clearer identification in low-light conditions. Plus you can see in complete darkness up to 330 ft. with the camera's IR night vision range. This camera also features vivid 2K resolution recording, along with a fully weatherproof exterior for year-round protection. Plus, there's no need to run special wiring to install this camera—power to the camera, video transmission and PTZ controls are all provided by the included 100 ft. Ethernet network cable for easy setup. For larger installations, you can extend the video signal up to 300 ft. with a single run of standard Ethernet cable (CAT-5E or higher) for flexible installation. You can install the camera further than 300 ft. from your NVR with an accessory PoE+ switch (sold separately).

<span>Great camera. I can read a lic. plate 1/2 block away.<br/>Only drawback is the requirement to log on as admin before being able to pan/tilt/zoom. Trying to find a way around this. Well built and solid construction.</span>

<span>Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2022<br/>Camera comes with a 1 year warranty. I purchased my first PTZ camera Sept 10th , 2020. It stopped working Sept 16th, 2021. I requested a warranty claim since it was only 6 days out of warranty. Lorex said no exceptions.<br/>I purchased a replacement camera Sept 21, 2021. It stopped working Sept 26th, 2022. I requested a warranty claim since it was only 5 days out of warranty and this was the second camera I purchased. Lorex said no exceptions PERIOD!<br/>I have purchased multiply systems from Lorex over the past 6 years. I currently own 3 complete systems with 37 cameras for various properties. There camera quality is good BUT their equipment is short term so when it stops working do not waste your time trying to get support or warranty. Prior to Sept 2020 they gave a two year warranty. After Sept 2020 it became a 1 year warranty. My experience 1 year is all you can count on. Customer service is HORRIBLE. I will never buy Lorex again considering I need to replace a $500.00 PTZ camera every 12 months &amp; 5 days.</span>

<span>One of the two cameras that I bought did not work out of the box.  Upon connecting the camera I saw that the image is red.  i.e. the color on the image is not right.  I am not talking a little red.  It looks as if you had a red color filter on the lens and the image is un-usable.  I called support and they would refund my money and would not replace it.  I bought this camera on-sale and with an upgrade promotion and therefore I do not think that I should pay more for a product that was defective out of the box.  Very dissapointing experience.  I am considering sending the entire system back for a refund.</span>

<span>First off, i thinking about returning it because of firmware problems. Was told it would be fixed in the next release which is 3 months away. Not good if your writing custom app for it. About a 3 weeks after that i started having a problem with tilt not going to full 90 up. When i did decide to return it i was 3 days past the Amazon time frame.<br/>Was getting tired of the Optics telling me no one else was having a problem like i was. Well, so what. Mine is having a problem with the tilt. Sent an email requesting an RMA to send back, after 3 days had not heard back so called them.<br/>that's when i was told about no one else has that problem. Finally they did offer to give me an RMA.<br/>I an't gonna worry about it now. I'll do this one, like i do all the other items i buy when something like this happens, dump it in the trash and buy something better. I will say, i'll miss that 30x zoom on it. Thinking about it, i did find some with 40x and 50x. Have to go back and have a look them. They are not PTZ Optics.</span>

<span>We installed it very high up in our church, so the remote control for the PTZ functions is great. After setting the presets 0-9, all you have to do is point at the camera  and press the number for the desired camera preset.<br/>In the camera web interface you can set up to 254 presets, but anything numbered over 9 must be accessed through this interface. Over all it has been a great choice for needs.<br/>Our camera is 75 feet from the altar.

<span>The only two things I do not like about this camera is. 1st the way it turns on and off is frustrating. Had this camera in for 3 weeks now to live stream a church service, and no one can seem to tell when it is powered on or powered off to use.  2nd issue is you have to be directly in front of this camera to turn it on or off. We really wish there was a way to turn this on from the side. But just like a TV, you have to be mostly in front of the unit to turn int on or off. Other than that, we really are please with this camera and the image quality, and would recommend this camera to others</span>

<span>Well, I've been trying for two hours just to connect to the network and have given up. Their help is all highly technical.<br/><br/>You would think plugging an ethernet cable directly from the camera into my modem/router would work, but no. The Mac software they suggest requires latest operating system, which I can't run because of other incompatible software. The app for iPhone / iPad doesn't help (I discover after paying $10).<br/><br/>This number one basic step is proving impossible, and their help videos hardly mention it, all focusing on the great features down the line.

<span>This is my first time using network cameras, etc.  I bought this at the same time I purchased two network NDI cameras for the church I attend.  Initially, I thought I had wasted $899 when I discovered I could control the cameras by entering their IP addresses in a web browser.  However, I was glad to find that this was not the case.  By using the Super Joy, I don't have to switch between applications on my laptop, and I am much less likely to get the cameras mixed up.  I also have much finer control over movement and zooming of the cameras by using the Super Joy than by pressing buttons in a web browser.  In addition to using the joystick to zoom, there is also a rotary dial for zooming and focus, and you can set the speeds for each feature.<br/>Having instant access to all the camera presets is an added bonus.  These are the same presets you would enter with a remote control, etc.  I found it nice that you can call a preset by simply pressing the number button for the first nine presets.  For higher presets, press the call button first and then enter the numbers and the enter key.  I am able to enter up to 256 presets for each camera; I think that's a feature of the camera more so than the Super Joy.  Enter your most commonly used presets in 1-9 to avoid having to press the call and enter buttons.  By the way, you can set the presets with this as well.<br/>The Super Joy will handle several cameras and groups of cameras.  There are various Super Joy models available.  I purchased this model because it supports the NDI cameras I have, while the less expensive models don't.  All I had to do to set this up initially is enter the IP addresses of the two cameras and a couple other numbers, and it found them instantly.  Both the Super Joy and my cameras are PoE, so all I had to do was connect them to the network which supplies PoE, no additional power cords needed.  It comes with the power cord if you don't have PoE, but it also warns you not to supply power from both at the same time.<br/>A worthwhile investment for regular users.<br/>T</span>

<span>The picture quality is awesome, easy to set up.,  you can simply plug this thing in, hook up an HDMI cable to your encoder and WALA you have a picture..Ready to go!  OR  you can configure IP settings and bring in signal over CAT5.  It can be powered by an ethernet switch or the AC adapter that is included.<br/>The only bad I would have to say is i have not found an app to control this model via mobile device.  The ir remote that comes with it works well to do presets, but yo have to have line of site.  Thanks Amber from Avipas for fielding my numerous phone calls before and during configuration.</span>

<span>I was somewhat skeptical when purchasing this camera but am really pleased so far.  It is POE with 10X zoom.  I control the unit with a joystick so I can PTZ effortlessly. The picture is very clear and the control motor is quiet.  A great camera for the money.</span>

<span>So I got this camera to monitor a stray with a severely fractured pelvis that I am fostering. It’s in a 30” kennel mounted in the top corner that’s covered by a sheet often. It’s always what we be considered “low light” so probably the least ideal conditions and I still love it. I have not one ounce of regret. Could it be better? Sure, but I have a feeling most of my cons are addressed in the higher tier items so I’m not complaining at all.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1 it just works! I didn’t have to fuss and fight with it, didn’t really even read the manual aside from what app to download. I had to try a few times to scan the QR code on my phone, it still only took 3 or 4 minutes.<br/>2 the clarity of the picture in normal &amp; IR mode. It’s gives a nice defined image from close like I have it or across my apartment like when setting it up. it will work great when he’s all healed to maybe catch some fun cat antics in my apartment.<br/>3 on that point the connectivity on the wifi and cellular is fantastic!!! I haven’t had a single issue with it not connecting or behaving improperly once connected. It even warns on cellular that it may use alot of data. Take notes Wyze I think I could go on vacation and actually connect to this camera, I have been converted!<br/>4 It is great in low light, especially if you use the IR light in pitch black situations! I don’t because although the internet says cats can’t see infrared light my kitten disagrees when he tries to hide from the camera when I turn the IR on.<br/>5 the included mounting stuff works great. I may have made a frankenstein out of it now, but once it’s not in the cage that hardware will work great.<br/>6 it does well at all the normal camera stuff it should like adjusting focus, adjusting lighting, moving without binding, taking pictures and videos from the app, reviewing footage… all the normal stuff.<br/><br/>Cons, they are slight and if I used it like a normal camera all but one wouldn’t be an issue.<br/>1 when you move the camera with the app the camera itself can make a very slight sound. Through the app, it’s a pretty loud sound. It wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t 16 inches or less from a hurt/scared kitty… it doesn’t surprise him after 2 days but he notices. Again it’s really barely noticeable.<br/>2 it sometimes makes a slight “clickity clack” when adjusting the focus when say I reach my hand in the cage. This might not be a thing if mounted more than 2 feet from something. It also may be switching to the non IR night vision (B&amp;W). Again not real loud unless you’re right there, still not a problem.<br/>3 this one is the app, but again it’s probably because of the small kennel it’s in. I wish the motion detection could be less sensitive than it can currently be. Again when 1/3 of the image moves there’s not much you can do.<br/>4 this one isn’t specific to my situation, but I just wish the degrees of rotation for every camera movement up or down/side to side wasn’t so drastic. Not a complaint as the slightly higher priced offerings from WansView probably have finer rotation, I’m just cheap 😁<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a great camera! I will recommend it to anyone that wants a camera to monitor something whether that’s property, pets, people, nature or the inside of a small kennel. It’s just great. Not just good for the price just good. 10/10 I would buy again</span>

<span>Was cautious about this camera because of the price, but I can tell you I was surprised as to the simple set up and the operation of this camera.  The directions are straight forward and the instalation and set up of the camera qas done in about 5 minutes.  I use it to check on my pets at home.  Experimented with the motion alert and was able to adjust the sensitivity enough that it detected my cat walking across the room.  Definitely would have no issues with detecting a child or adult moving around.  Using the on screen pan and tilt controls on my android phone works great.  Slight delay but works very well to pan across the room.  The night vision is very good.  In a completely dark room, the camera is able to show great details within the room.  Over all I am impressed with this camera and all its capabilities.  I plan on ordering two more for my house.</span>

<span>This is great camera for those locations where you need active monitoring.  I carry a couple with me as I travel to use at a location doesn't need a full blown camera security system, but just a way to remotely monitor an area or employees.  For that these cameras are great.  Setup can be done in about 5 minutes, and the ability to remotely move the field of vision is a great feature on such an inexpensive web camera.  Picture quality is also great, and the night vision works well too.  I which the desktop software worked better and was easier to use, as I would rather store my video locally than in the cloud.  Overall though if you need a quick and cheap monitoring solution, this is it.</span>

<span>I got these cameras on sale a few weeks ago and so glad I did! I have one set up in my main living room as well as my basement living room and LOVE how clear the images are!  The app is super easy to use and I really enjoy being able to move the camera to see around the rooms.  The night vision is fantastic, almost looks like daytime with very clear images.  I have blink cameras and I like these Wansview cameras much better - better picture quality, easier to use and can continually watch without being asked to “continue watching?”  In general these cameras were easy to set up, the app is easy to use and I enjoy the quality of the images - highly recommend.</span>
