<span>Gas prices are too high to be spending $100+ on trail cameras. Especially if you need a few of them. Does what I need it to do. I’ve had three out that have been through a few storms this summer and they held up nicely. Picture quality isn’t the best but it’s definitely good enough for me. I’ll never understand why people want super high quality pictures, I just care about the information I gain from it.</span>

<span>Bought two of these last september and it worked ok then i went to set it up in my shop six months later to try and detect a predator and the camera kept going of after a few minutes. I reset it multiple times used new batteries a still kept shutting down after just a few minutes. I would not recommend this camera to anyone its a waist of money !!!!!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Pretty much garbage compared to most other trail cams. I have 6 trail cameras. This was the first one I bought. I bought it without doing any research. That was a mistake.<br/><br/>First, it lights up red at night when taking pics/video. It also makes a click sound at the same time. Most doe’s don’t seem to mind, but every buck will stop instantly, stare at the cam, and then never return. Not one buck has came back after seeing and hearing this camera. It spooks them.<br/><br/>Second, it has bad motion detection, and bad range. The animals have to be pretty close for this to actually trigger. (Like 20 feet or less). And alot of the time, it doesn’t trigger at all. I swapped this cam with a different brand in the same exact spot and went from getting 3 pictures a day of deer, to 15 pictures a day of deer. This cam just doesn’t trigger like it should.<br/><br/>I have bought 5 more cams (different brands than this) since, and they all are wayyyy better, for the same price.... For the same price, you could get a cam with far better image quality. Quicker trigger speed. Much better range. With actual invisible night vision, and even with sound, which this cam does not have. The other cameras I have bought since this, even have a built in picture viewer. (All for basically the same price)<br/><br/>So all in all, it’s junk. They probably haven’t updated their tech in 10 years or something.?</span>

<span>I've been running the camera for almost 30 days WITH the solar panel battery combo.  My First impression is pretty high but there are just a few things I think can be improved upon.  First the good..<br/>Battery life: After 30 days, the 12 lithium batteries I installed are still at 100%.  This tells me that this camera will be maintenance free for a very long time!<br/>Setup: Super easy, I got the ATT version and it logged into the network in seconds from first power up.<br/>App: very easy to navigate and thing are laid out in a simple manner.<br/>-----------<br/>Improvements I would like to see<br/>On demand photo: It would be fantastic to log into the app and force a snap shot at any given time.  There is an option to set up timed photos but that not quite the same.<br/>My app randomly crashes while swiping photos in the "Gallery".  It could be my phone but it's an S22 top of the line so there a bit of work to do there.<br/>Aspect ratio:  I understand this is a "Game Camera" and it has a very WIDE angle which is great.  The problem is I'm trying to catch People on my property.  It has a fairly narrow height compared to it's width.<br/>Their photos are 16:9 and that's great, but a 4:3 I think would be a better ratio that would catch taller object like humans better.<br/>-------------<br/>I've attached two photos, one is the standard one you get immediately, and it's size is 85k, the second is the HD version you can download and it's 1.7m in size.  Huge difference, but as you can see I zoomed in and captured just a portion to show you the difference in the quality between the standard definition and the downloading the HD version.</span>

<span>I like the simplicity but that is most trail cameras.  This is, however, in black and white.  WildLife innovations is what I usually use and it was in color years ago, not sure about now.  I know that I assumed it was color and I'm used to reviewing clear, colorful videos.  That alone is why it is 2 stars.  It's expensive enough to be in color.</span>

<span>This absolutely does not have a 16MP sensor and uses interpolation fakery to generate 15.5MP files.  640x480 seems more probable.<br/><br/>I found the kit version locally on sale with 8 AA batteries, 16GB SD card and strap for $39.  At that price point I don't feel too ripped off and just wanted something basic to catch some things in an area without electricity.<br/><br/>One issue for me so far is very poor low light capability.  It does switch to night mode even when it's still light out, and this is a pretty obvious attempt to cover for the limitation of the sensor.  But even then, unless you have a lot of light, the photos have tons of motion blur and noise.<br/><br/>But the BIGGEST issue as others have mentioned is that the IR LEDs put out quite a bit of visible light!  So there is not much "stealth" to this camera especially at night!  False advertising?  Well, they will claim that the name of the company is "Stealth Cam" but the camera itself isn't "stealth".  Ah well, I'll steer clear of this company going forward...</span>

<span>Have used this camera daily for over a week now.  It's a decent camera with fair quality night time pics and good to very good day time images.  The problem is the IR illumination system is almost as bright as a traffic light.  No subtlety at all.  BRIGHT red when compared to other trail cams.  Batteries are still showing 100 percent even after 50+ hours of use.  Pre-set image capture programs do not meet my needs and programming is cumbersome but do-able.  The .8 second lag to initiate recording is noticeable compared to other cameras I own that begin recording after .2 seconds.  If you walk quickly into the field of view at 10 yards, you're past center image when the recording actually begins.  This camera may not catch a running dog/deer/elk.  It's a bargain basement camera.  I would probably not purchase again because I bought this thing for home security and the IR illumination is simply too bright for that purpose.  Other uses seem fine.<br/><br/>Animals don't seem to be spooked by the rather bright IR lighting.  Intruders would be.</span>

<span>This is my third trail camera of this brand in roughly this price range.  The first two died after a year to two years of use.  This one is functioning after two or three months, battery life looks as though it should be decent, it probably picks up most motion, although I haven't tried to test that. Illumination at night is adequate up to about forty feet.  Resolution is not especially good. Overall if it only lasts as long as the other two I would say it is what I would expect of a camera that cost about half what this lists for, mainly because of the image quality.  But I only paid about half what it lists for, and Bushnell has stood behind their warranty on the one occasion when I used it, so I'm satisfied that I'm getting what I paid for.</span>

<span>Folks , this camera is better than my 4 other brand name camera's,easily !It's simpler to use and program.It is clearer and has better sound . And it does night video as good as daylight ! I have been using trail cams for years,this one is cheaper and better,then Wild game,Moultrie,and Stealth,and Bushnell .It's detection sensor is Remarkable to say the least,It actually picks up a cat at over 40 feet at night! I have never seen another camera even come close to this,never!And it was a black cat to boot.For the price ,this is my new Brand.It truly is a step ahead of everyone else,other camera's claim new for 2019,and the picture quality is still 2015.This one is an eye opener,I have not received a penny, or free camera for this review. Be nice though! Winks! I actually had a deer squinting,literally,at this camera,like did I see something,but kept on eating,never seen a deer squinting.It really is a steal,at this price.I am buying more of them,you can't lose on this one folks,hands down,a Fantastic camera,fantastic detection sensor.It really is a great night time camera,and the sound is great too! The new 940 Ir works better than 850 Ir ,this might just catch Bigfoot ,animals could see 850 Ir this one has them squinting to see if they see something or not,none of the other</span>

<span>I bought a set of 4 of these about a year and a half ago. Setting them up and getting the service plan was all pretty easily accomplished. Once they were out in the field, they mostly were pretty consistent. A few times, I had to go reset one of them or reposition for better sunlight.<br/><br/>After 1 year of use in Texas, all four had stopped working completely. Two of them had taken on so much water that when I opened up the cases water actually spilled out. Customer service was very polite about it and replaced all 4. Now with the second batch, one was dead on arrival and one of the others doesn't seem to be holding a charge like the rest of them.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: I was hoping for this price point to get a little more reliability out of the product. I don't really have faith that these things will last more than a season or so at a time.</span>

<span>Bought the dual carrier model, thinking it would be like many dual carrier or "dual sim" phones on the market. It isn't, despite the box itself claiming "Dual Network Operation" it only can run 1 network at a time, and you need to choose from the 2 sims you are provided AT&amp;T &amp; Verizon. This strikes me as very deceptive.<br/><br/>The box also clearly states it comes with "90 days unlimited free" and it does not, it gives you a free 30 days and then you have to pay. I contacted Stealth Cam about this and have not received a response yet.</span>

<span>FEEES!! Running this camera is like playing a mobile ap game. Pay to play. Everything costs extra. I pulled up the pictures today and could only see really crappy grainy looking photos. It looked like deer or maybe a dog. I started trying to figure out what was wrong and realized I had to pay more money on top of the unlimited monthly plan to get “HD photos”. Which meant pictures that aren’t garbage. JUST STICK WITH THE STEALTH CAM.<br/>I’m running 15-20 cameras at one time if not more. I have several different brands. This is the only one that needs a tiny micro SD and the only one that didn’t come with the SD card. Seems petty but that’s annoying.</span>

<span>Not horrible. Not great. Picture quality leaves much to be desired. I get a full month on batteries.<br/>App has glitches lately, not getting pictures. Have to reload the app 2-3 times a week to get pictures.<br/>Only one out of 3 is sending pics.yet the status shows 100% signal and 80% battery.<br/>Will try a firmware update and see if that solves it.</span>

<span>After trying it out with the 100 free photos, I decided to buy the premium unlimited photos. The photo quality is not the greatest but at least I get notified immediately when motion is detected. I bought this to watch over my camp lease. So I paid an extra 5 dollars for 50 HD photos. If you have a photo you want to enhance to HD quality, just pick the picture and click on the HD option and now that picture will be a little clearer. I'm just hoping if someone walks unto my property, I'll get a clear enough face shot to identify them.<br/>  I chatted with tech support about some questions I had before buying the premium and they were very nice. It took 15 minutes maybe for someone to come online but they eventually did.</span>
