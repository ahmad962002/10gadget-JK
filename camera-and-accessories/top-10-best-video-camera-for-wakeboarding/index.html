Equipped with a 20x Optical Zoom LEICA Dicomar lens and 5-axis Hybrid Optical Image Stabilization function, the Panasonic 4K Ultra HD Camcorder HC-VX981K brings simplicity to the 4K recording experience. It adds in-camera editing solutions such as cropping, panning, zooming and subject tracking stabilization that can enable anyone to capture and produce content without the need for complex software. An innovative HDR mode captures clear shots with excellent detail in both bright and dark areas. The Wi-Fi functions make the camcorder competent in a variety of tasks: remote shooting and view via the Panasonic smartphone app, picture-in-picture style video recording with your smartphone as a sub camera. For those without a 4K display option, the HC-VX981K offers in-camera down sampling to 1080p displays for convenient playback. Connectivity technology: USB: 2.0 Hi-Speed, HDMI: Micro, Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11b/g/n. Motion Image 4K: 8.29 megapixels [16:9], Full-HD: 6.10 megapixels [16:9] (Level Shot Function OFF or Normal).

<span>Super impressed by this camera. It's lightweight and yet so beautifully designed to look bulky.  It has image stabilization which is a huge plus. The touchscreen features come in hand during operation.  Replacing the Panasonic VC-770s we use for broadcast in the church.  The controls are so similar that we were able to get up and shooting right away.</span>

<span>I would have kept this camera if would have suited my purposes of getting professional sound out it, and it came SO CLOSE, but not close enough. I need to plug my mixer into a camcorder as I am doing Youtube demos of guitar pickups, using 2 XLR microphones into a stereo mixing board. I did get really great sound, but not at higher amplifier volume levels. The audio meter in the camera is just about worthless, very crude. I had to turn my mixer down literally almost to nothing or the camera's audio board would clip in a real ugly way. I have to use manual settings because auto gain control wouldn't give true sound for what I need to do. Otherwise, its an excellent walk around camcorder with a ton of great features. Battery life wasn't all that great, barely an hour, but most of them are like that anyway. I am sending it back and rather sad about it, but I ordered a JVC professional camcorder that has XLR inputs and a line input and a big level meter in the display, so its costing me double money to get that, but I need what I need and this camera just doesn't go there. So, if you read people plugging mixers into this camera, forget it. It can work but is just too primitive and hard to get it right. There was no level that I set that would stop the audio from peaking and distorting. But buy one if you want great 4K and aren't recording loud concerts of need to do pro audio.</span>

<span>This is unbelievable. At first, I was a little annoyed that you have to pay so much for a camera that lets you set manual iris/focus/sound etc. But I finally but the bullet and paid 4x as much as a regular fully auto HD cam. I'm so glad I did. I just tested all of the fancy bells and whistles that I was skeptical about. Holy crap, they all work! I got this camera for recording my own concerts. The audio is on par with some of the field recorders out there. The 4k resolution means that I can leave this at a wide angle from across the venue and later in editing, zoom into my bandmates it as if it were a second and third camera. On top off all that, I don;t have to run out into the audience to press record right before the show and then run out after the show. I can control it from my phone (this is what I was sure wouldn't work properly but it did)! The wifi range isn't long enough for a large venue or festival, but you can tap into a wifi router which I already have on stage for our sound gear.<br/><br/>I only got this camera because of it's manual control. Don't try shooting concerts with an automatic camera. The cameras don't understand stage lighting and it will look horrible unless it's a well lit outdoor show (of if the stage lights never change). Plus, they alway automatically focus on the stupid little toys and signs and beach balls that pop up from the audience. Manual settings solve all of that. You can get that with several different Cannon and sony cams for around the same price. But this camera absolutely CRUSHES it with the extra stuff. I am amazed.<br/><br/>Tip: don't bother buying the expensive larger battery. Get a usb backup charger. The kind that you can use to power a phone or tablet. I have a heavy duty one that will outlast any camera battery. If you're using a tripod, you just rig up a place to put it and you're gold.</span>

<span>This camera generally pretty good but may not be for everyone. The most impressive feature is the quality of the video/picture when playing on your big screen TV at home. Second is its zoom quality.  If you are filming things like kids sports you’ll need a tripod to keep the picture steady. The feel of the camera is kinda like a plastic toy not a high end camera if that matters to you. You’ll want to buy an additional battery because the filming time with multiple pause and recordings is approximately 45 minutes on the battery it comes with.  The worst feature is the touch screen. It’s very frustrating scrolling through your clips.</span>

<span>Subwing was delivered in less than 48 hours, NIB.  Product is as described and very good quality construction. Most importantly, this thing flat out works as advertised!  First day out, was easy to master and a blast to "Fly".  I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and rarely bother to rate or review, but this was such and excellent purchase/product I had to chime in.<br/><br/>I'll add some pics if I can get out of the water long enough to grab my GoPro.</span>

<span>I'd been interested in picking one of these up since they first released the carbon and fiberglass models, but the pricepoint of those earlier models was discouraging for me to take the gamble on a crazy new watersport toy that I may or may not like... I was so excited to find they made a new model more accessible to most budgets and quickly scooped one up.  This thing is SO much fun.  I'm an avid SCUBA diver and watersport enthusiast and I was initially really skeptical because I live in the Pacific Northwest where the waters are far darker and more turbid than the crystal clear tropical waters shown in all Subwing's promotional videos; it seemed visibility would be a real limiting factor and that it would be easy to hit an obstacle or hurt myself in our emerald waters... Not the case!  The Subwing is towed far slower than videos would have you believe and it is highly responsive even at these slower speeds.  (On the boat, we were going about 4mph-- quiet and mellow enough for boat passengers to enjoy their own conversation and a beverage). Underwater, it feels much quicker, but by no means uncontrollable.  I can also attest to it working well off of small fishing boats as well. I've taken it out several times in the dark waters of The Puget Sound as well as a few times in different lakes and it has been a blast every time!  It's nothing to store, and a cinch to maintain (Just taking the swivel apart from the wings and rinsing everything.). There's no reason in my book that everyone that enjoys being on the water shouldn't have one of these in their watersports arsenal.<br/><br/>Note to seller:  I do wish Simon and his team would sell some sort of a stainless/titanium swivel to attach between the tow rope and the Subwing lines, so after several barrel rolls the lines don't twist up...  And preferably with a quick 'carabiner' style attachment clip. [This is by no means a problem, as you can just roll the opposite direction, but would be a nice option as I for some reason seem to have a bias toward rolling clockwise...]. Awesome product though; thank you, Subwing team!</span>

<span>We went to the lake and the subwing was amazing.  We have friends that couldn't get up on skis or wakeboards but they could do this and loved it.  Also with being able to do this sport at such a slow speed people on the boat can just chill(obviously not the spotter or captain) and enjoy the view</span>

<span>I've had the system for more than two years now and to be honest, it's pretty good.<br/>A- Though limited in exactly how far it can see at night, (From garage to end of driveway just beyond my parked vehicles), it triggers nicely.<br/>B- I love how where in the view, you can set the motion tracking. (There's a grid you can use to tell it where to watch for motion in the image. AKA: I can filter it to NOT trigger off my neighbors headlights)<br/>C- I love being able to bring up the live view of any camera on your system. (It takes a few seconds and it will ask you after about 10-15 seconds if you want to continue, so there's that.)<br/>D- It's weird how I keep getting videos popping up from previous nights, (not last night, but several nights previous). And sometimes the replay injects weird, full daytime looking imagery in the playback.<br/>E- Love how I can upload from within the app to my YouTube (or wherever) channel.<br/>F- IT IS A REAL BATTLE swapping out batteries.<br/>F1 - Once the camera is dismounted from the base, it's super easy to unscrew and replace batteries, and closing it back up.<br/>F2 - Snapping it back into their mounts is a real (expletive)ing battle. Knowing I have to tackle that makes me dread the battery change.<br/>F3 - If I were to add a photo to this review, it would be of my grimacing painfully while trying to pop the cameras back into their base.<br/>G - Yes, the Lithium batteries do last 2 years... but it's dependent on how much you use the cameras interactively. If you use them to look at blind spots around your house, the batteries for those particular cameras will poop out faster, but that's a minor nit, though I try to use them sparingly to not have to deal with issue F!!!<br/>H - Love how I can talk to someone through the cameras and hear them very well.<br/>I - I DO NOT appreciate the fine detail when a nighttime spider rudely crawls across the lens!  Ick.<br/>J - I live in the HOT and FREEZING desert and they've held up well through the seasons so far.<br/>K - Love how I can customize exactly when the system will turn on and off.<br/>That is all I can think of for the moment.<br/>OH - I wish I could access my cameras from a desktop and not be limited to just my phone.<br/>OK.. now that is all... for now.</span>

<span>When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):<br/>PROS:<br/>&gt; #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams.  POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.<br/>&gt; So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.<br/>&gt; The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few "advanced features" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas  and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.<br/>&gt; Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.<br/>&gt; Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.<br/>&gt; Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.<br/>&gt; No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.<br/>&gt; Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.<br/>&gt; Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.<br/>CONS:<br/>&gt; So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.<br/>&gt; The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.<br/>&gt; You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.<br/>OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.</span>

<span> FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data..  I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨<br/><br/>UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.<br/><br/>The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.<br/>👇😕<br/><br/>This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍<br/><br/>The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.<br/><br/>So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.<br/><br/>Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.<br/><br/>After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐<br/><br/>This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍<br/><br/>UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.<br/><br/>Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.<br/><br/>I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.<br/><br/>Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.<br/><br/>The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍<br/><br/>Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.<br/><br/>Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.</span>

<span> We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.<br/><br/>Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.<br/><br/>The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.</span>

<span> I love this camera!!! I know it doesn't have 4k, but for what I do this camera is more than enough. It has beautiful color, works great in low light, and the 400 digital zoom is great!! I do a lot of outdoor run and gun videos, and this camera is solid! I wont buy any other brand, canons rule!!<br/><br/>This video is zero edits. Straight from the camera to the upload. 😉</span>

<span>I had done research before purchasing 2 of these. We were looking for a good camera without breaking the budget for our church’s livestream. These cameras set bar REALLY HIGH. Our stream quality has improved 100% with these. The clarity you get even on a tight zoom is mind blowing. The way the color adjust to the lighting is awesome as well. If you are looking for a decent camera without forking out a lot of dough, look no further.</span>

<span>I love this camera.  While I have used other brands and styles (DSLR, EX1, etc.) over the years, I come back to this Canon version.  It works fantastic in low light as well as a great zoom.  I used for a few years shooting school plays, which you can imagine didn't have the best lighting and I had to shoot from the back of the auditorium, yet the video was crisp and clear.  I especially love the instant auto-focus/manual focus button on the screen, that allows me to quickly refocus a shot and then turn back to manual.<br/>You'll need to go into the settings to adjust the exposure for low light.  Once you get to know the settings, you'll love this camera!</span>

<span>So....I have bought two of the Canon HF G60, and returned one and strongly considered returning the second one.  The issue is that this camera, despite the picture, does not have infrared/night vision. It is super odd because every picture shows that when you flip out the LCD screen there is an infrared/night vision ... let me tell you friends... it is not there. This is very disappointing because - believe it or not - it is one of the reasons I decided to buy the Canon HF G60.<br/><br/>After I got past the mission infrared/night vision issue - I am mostly happy with the camera.  The larger sensor provides a level of higher picture quality (color and sharpness) over the 1/2.3 in previous models.  The IQ is pretty noticeable though, enough so that I decided to keep one of the cameras.<br/><br/>Notes -<br/>- PQ/IQ is solid - it isn't to the level of the MFT cameras (like the GH5), but it is a noticeable step up from other Canon handhelds<br/><br/>- Again the infrared/night vision is missing... this annoys me since I have waited over a month to post this review (after notifying the seller that the description is wrong) and it still shows the infrared/night vision toggle.<br/><br/>- Dual memory slots that are top-loading. They seem to be a bit small.... it is a very tight fit to get my Sony Tough cards into the slots.<br/><br/>- To record in 4k at 150mbs you will need a true 299mbs write-card.  I tried using a Sony Tough 150mbs write-card and I ended up getting speed errors.  Sooooo.... you are going to want to have extra cash set aside to buy the 299mbs write cards. Be warned... they are expensive<br/><br/>- I won't go into too much detail, but the controls are a bit cumbersome. I have never been a huge fan of Canon's menu screens.  I wish they would give you a directional pad.<br/><br/>- At top quality, the video files are very large, but you probably knew that!<br/><br/>- Microphone... I need to do some more experimenting, but the native mic picked up a ton of wind noise. I thought I had the filter on... but maybe I did something incorrectly.  If you are going to use an external mc it will need to be passive (someone please leave me a comment if this is incorrect!).  The Canon HF G60 does not have an XLR mic input. Overall, the native mic worked ok... pretty typical.<br/><br/>- ergonomics.... not bad for a handheld.  It is also relatively light... no issues<br/><br/>- LCD screen - nice and bright!<br/><br/>- Stabilization... others have complained, but I think it does a surprisingly good job for stability. It is not like having it on a DJI gimbal, but it does seem to be pretty dynamic.<br/><br/>- adjustments to be made... I did not like the pre-set color that is in the default settings. It was unsaturated and not very pleasing. I went with the vivid setting (which was surprisingly hard to find) which shot up the saturation and made the footage look, and honestly, more realistic.<br/><br/>- Pro or consumer level camera?  This one is kind of a tweener. The general consumer may not be able to set the camera up in order to take advantage of its advantages (I mean if you record at 35mbs instead of 150mbs you have lost a lot of the advantage).  Pros, on the other hand, may not enjoy the menu set-up and the overall lack of customization.<br/><br/>I am sure there is a lot more to go over, but I think I hit most of the stuff that I noticed rather quickly.<br/><br/>Final verdict...  I am going to give the camera 3 stars. I am knocking off one full star for the missing infrared/night vision and another because of the 1)menu set-up 2) memory card slots tightness 3) generally being good at a lot of things but necessarily great in any. I would recommend it to anyone who does not need the night vision feature.</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>The Mevo Start is a great camera for live streaming or for recording.  It is good for those getting started in streaming.  It is reasonably priced and has a lot of great features.  You can live stream to most any service.  The camera can be connected via Wi-Fi or with Ethernet (requires a separate adapter).  Wi-Fi works well if you have good access points and signals.  Streaming quality will depend on your upload speeds.  Recording are saved directly to the camera but you will need get a micro-SD card as it does not come with one, but those are so affordable.  You will need an Android or iOS tablet or phone to work with the camera.  There is an app that controls and configures the camera.<br/>There is a built in microphone that works well.  You can also alternatively connect an external sound source to the Aux 3.5 mm jack.  It is configurable for Mic level input or Line level input (like sound board).  There are level controls for audio within the app.  It fits on most any tripod (standard 1/4 screw).  I found battery life to be 4-5 hours which should be good in most cases.  There is a USB-C connector on the camera that can be used for external power or ethernet adapter.  Indicator LED on the front of the camera tells you the connection status and I believe can also act as a Tally light.<br/>One of the nice features is digital zoom.  You can view what the camera sees from within the app.  The app also lets you zoom the camera view in and out.  You can also move a zoomed box around with the full field of the camera, so it almost like having PTZ.  The video feed is quite good and there are settings for things like low lighting and outdoor.<br/>Camera looks and feels well built.  There is no lens cover so you might want to get a case for it.<br/>The camera can also be configured as an NDI source and it works great with OBS, zoom and all.<br/>Good starter and can still be used in more advanced setups (like OBS).  Keep in mind that the app can only be used with one camera at a time (you can move back and forth between cameras).  A multi-cam app is being developed and is currently in Beta at this time.</span>

<span>So, I tried these during a cookout outside and they were great. Very clear, great audio.

<span>I wasn't sure how to rank this.

The micro usb is deep so most cable will not connect and as you put in the cable it goes deeper. After 1 month of use I have to press the thing and hold it to get the file. It's a horrible design.<br/><br/>Also no Micro SD card.

<span>Overall, I like these glasses. One can always wish it was cheaper, and the build quality leaves a little to be desired with the skin-facing cover panels being loose and ill-fitting.... But the photo and video quality was reasonable, battery life was at least the hour promised.<br/><br/>To change settings, you need to write a very specific text file, then upload it to a particular place in the file structure, but it works. I assume you can leave the time off, but if you don't, it'll set the time when you first turn it on, so you have to do that on schedule.<br/><br/>Biggest complaint: There's no SD card, so your only option to get the movies off is with the provided woven micro USB. I tried several others, and none of them worked. A genuine USB-C would have been way better, but really, just something that worked.<br/><br/>Given that I could lose or damage the cable, I returned the unit, but would buy another if they fix the above issues.<br/><br/> It was comfortable to wear, and I used them even when not recording. Lenses were polarized and on the darker side without being extreme. One I RTFM, it was easy to control. The case was nice. The frames are easier to scratch than the lenses, so be aware of that.<br/><br/>Lastly: No one seemed to notice I had video glasses. I wore them around a fair amount and never got questioned - even though I can see the lens quite plainly (and you can make a good argument it's not hidden), even in extended face to face conversations no one said anything.<br/><br/>I found the camera to point ~10 degrees more skyward than I would like, it's harder to see your own hands.<br/><br/>Almost a really good product, if you can live with the cable, it's worth getting.</span>

<span>These glasses are extremely underdeveloped and for a $200 gadget, not good quality, too cheap materials, the camera is less than great and the way to code the image and FPS quality on the .TXT file is for advanced users so get away if you’re not a computer savvy user. This is not a plug and play. Gave me less than the advertised 1 hour of battery  (47min after charging 8 hours NEW PRODUCT)…<br/>Not a great buy. Too expensive for the quality offered. Maybe $79 would be an expensive price for these, at $200 is out of the game.<br/>I’m returning them very disappointed after watching all the reviews this is way less than expected.</span>

<span>I was looking for a rope that was sectioned so that I could utilize the different lengths in wakeboarding.  Specifically, I wanted 45', 55', 65' and 75' just like this item states it has.  However, that is not what I received.  It states there are 3 "removable" 10' sections, but in reality, there are only two.  The handle is part of a 10' section in itself, but you have to have a handle, so that can't be removed.<br/><br/>The sections I received are a 10' long section with the handle permanently attached; a 45' section; and two 10' sections.  That means you have 55', 65' , or 75'.  You can not do 45' as advertised, which is a standard for certain elements in wakeboarding.  Technically, you could remove the 45' section and have a 30' rope, but no one goes that close to the boat.<br/><br/>They should have provided the 3 removable 10' sections as advertised, but they don't.<br/>I have not tried the rope out yet, so cannot address performance.</span>

Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<span>This is truly a junky camera that will become a totally inoperable brick after the first upgrade patch.  This glaring patch problem has happened to me several times and each time Wyze has done nothing to resolve the problem.  Microphone and speaker are unusable static.  So-called new and improved night vision is a joke. Wyze used to be a good bargain because you didn't have to sign up for monthly services now they require you to sign up for monthly expensive services for their junk camera.  Junkie product with increased prices makes it a horrible value. The only thing Wyze wants to do is take your money and give you nothing in return.  Stay away from !</span>

<span>Version 3 of this Wyze indoor/outdoor cam is a bargain.  The high resolution and low-light color sensitivity of the new Sony Starlight imaging chip, which it uses, is amazing.  It is significantly more sensitive than my own vision at dusk and dawn.  The camera nevertheless also has infrared imaging capability, which I do not need for my applications.  These features coupled with a multitude of other features, too many to list, and overall care to design details make this a superb choice at its current price.  There are, however, things to consider that might depend on intended application.  1. The short focal-length lens provides a 130-degree field of view.  This is great for surveillance applications, but it introduces significant barrel distortion.  Although the camera has digital zoom capability, this is at the expense of otherwise great resolution.  A version with a longer focal length lens (narrower field of view) would suit my needs better.  2. The camera is suitable for some outdoor applications but can also shoot through windows (IR imaging off).  The camera has a white body that makes the black window mount, sold separately as an accessory, a must.  It would be nice if Wyze introduces a black version to limit window reflections, as it did for the earlier Version 2 of the camera.  3. You must buy a subscription to the Wyze Cam Plus cloud service, currently as low as $15 per year per camera, to make full use of the many surveillance detection and recording features.  The annual cost is likely to go up and be significant with multiple camera installations.  4. Wyze is developing a web-based browser application, which is currently in beta.  For now it has limited functionality compared to the Android and Apple smartphone applications.  Sadly, you must subscribe to Cam Plus to access even the beta version.  Wyze should definitely make browser access free.  Time will tell how much of a long-term bargain this camera will be.</span>

<span> EDIT: I uploaded a video of the camera's sound quality in action, so if you view the video turn on your sound BUT KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN (initially). No need for bleeding ears.<br/><br/>During the Wyze portions of the video I was sitting roughly 20 feet away and six feet below the camera; There should be no feedback at that distance.<br/><br/>During the iPhone portion (where I filmed the same space as the one the V3 is normally set up to film) I was roughly six feet away and six feet below the camera. The point was to capture the same sounds in the same room.<br/><br/>All the videos were taken very early in the morning, with no traffic or human noise outside, and with what I'd call regular ambient interior noise (the humming of appliances, the running of a computer in the vicinity, etc). No other people were present to make noise inside.<br/><br/>The first portion of the video is the sound that the V3 produces when I am viewing the live feed. It was screen-captured with my iPhone.<br/><br/>The second portion is a comparison demonstrating the sound my iPhone picks up in the same general space, at the same general time, in the exact same conditions, and with the exact same ambient noise in the background as in the first portion; This is not to show how much better the iPhone's mic is than the Wyze (obviously it's better) but to give you an idea as to what noise and sounds were actually present in the room while I was viewing the V3's live feed of the same room, and capturing it with my phone camera.<br/><br/>The third portion is the same space with the same ambient noise, plus conversation from the television that is eight feet from the V3. I chose a scene that sounds a lot like regular conversation, set it to conversation volume, and it has some light score that comes in at the end.<br/><br/>The final portion is what my iPhone picked up in the same space during the same time and conditions, and while playing the exact same scene/conversation on the TV at the same volume as while capturing it on the V3. If you listen VERY carefully you MIGHT be able to pick up a word or two in the V3's video that you can compare to the iPhone's. Maybe. It took me three tries. Hint: listen for the word "Garrett".  Hope the video helps you make a more informed purchasing decision!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Picture is ok. Night vision/low light is very good. Motion detection is spot-on. The camera looks good, design-wise.<br/><br/>Why the one star?<br/><br/>Because that's where the good ends.<br/><br/>The problem is the mic/sound quality is appalling bad. That's such an old, tried-and-true tech I have no idea how they managed to bungle it so much, but managed they did.<br/><br/>Maybe they are using the very cheapest, most absolute garbage quality components on the face of the earth, which sucks, because better components don't cost that much, especially wholesale. They're just squeezing every penny out of profit and selling garbage wrapped up and promoted as quality.<br/><br/>Frustrating.<br/><br/>So, what sound does it pick up?<br/><br/>From what I've read online there are various audio manifestations/issues ranging from nearly no sound at all, all the way to my problem, which is the sound picked up becomes a garbled, distorted, feed-backed  jumble of sometimes jarring noises that maybe sort-of could be interpreted as words (in the case of people taking) but nearly nothing's decipherable by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Pet noises, like barks, meows, growls, etc. are literally non-existent. If it picks it up at all it's just converted to "noise".<br/><br/>All other sound is just as bad. Sometimes there's these random-seeming staticky "bangs" every once in a while. Who knows what that is.<br/><br/>I hate it.<br/><br/>You hear that developers?<br/><br/>I. Hate. This. Camera.<br/><br/>And I wish I didn't because otherwise I like so much about it.<br/><br/>But, alas,  I need sound so I am able to use the function where you talk to someone through the camera and hear them when they respond. I also need to be able to hear what's going on with my pets.<br/><br/>I need to be able to hear when the camera's motion-detection is tripped and the cause of the trip has moved out of the line of the camera but is still out there rustling and bumping around, or otherwise making noise out on my porch and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>If I had children I wouldn't be able to hear them, or speak to them through the camera. or hear when one is crying.<br/><br/>So, be forewarned, if any of the above is one of your needs/goals you probably won't be able to do that with this camera. Buy elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's incredibly stupid they didn't fix this problem before releasing the V3. A lot of people online report the V2 being awful as well, so the developers knew. That means you shouldn't put off buying one for when the next gen comes out (whenever that is). They probably won't fix it.<br/><br/>The worst part, I think, is it doesn't support the use of an external mic, which would be such an easy solve. There's no input port and the simple hardware and software to support that, and that really is stupid AF. If it did allow the connecting of an external mic all I'd have to do is plug one in and I would have the sound I need. At least then I wouldn't be writing this scathing review. It would be a win-win for everyone!<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>Finally, apparently contacting customer support is a total waste of time, and the people you talk to (bless their hearts, it isn't really their fault) have no tech experience or understanding whatsoever of how these things work. I don't know about you, but I find that exhausting. If one were to spend the time necessary to troubleshoot all the garbage products we wind up with one would never have time to do anything else, and even with that effort 95% of the time it results in no improvement, and no resolution. I'm tired of it. Just make a solid product, and when something goes wrong, replace it or refund the money, don't make anyone jump through hoops.<br/><br/>Finally, fix the issue, fast. And don't repeat it in the next iteration.<br/><br/>Long and the short of it is I need a camera with a functioning mic and/or that has an input for an external mic. The end. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even at the price-point these cameras are at.<br/><br/>I regret buying these, as now they're going to be tossed after I buy another brand (according to message boards even cheapo Chinese no-name brands have a better mic than these things!). What a waste of time, money, and resources.</span>

<span>Much improved over 1st version.  Night picture is much clearer.  I use them outside under eaves, porches &amp; patios.  Last one has been there 4 plus years &amp; was still working. Temps ranging from 110 degrees to zero.  After seeing the new vision I’ve replaced all 15 cameras at both homes.  2nd home is a cabin in the mountains so I get many videos of lions, deer, raccoons, skunks &amp; birds.  Some have even captured mice.  My biggest complaint is the constant upscale pressure of their longer cloud videos.  Whenever I replace an old camera I 15 days of their free longer videos &amp; I hate them.  Do not need to see the trees blowing for 5 minutes.  Then when free trial expires you have to figure out how to get free cam lite videos which are 12 second snapshots.  Longer videos are recorded on a 32 gig micro sd card which you access in the phone app.  So if you need the longer video it’s there you just need to look at sd card from your phone &amp; it’s there.  Works great for what I need.  Many false events outside but I realize they are an inside camera.  I’ve tried their wireless outside version &amp; they’re horrible.  They eat batteries miss the wildlife &amp; other events.  They do not have any range of wifi so they are junk.  They lack the ability of seeing the sd card from phone app. so you need to retrieve card to download events.  Never have even done that cause it’s a hassle to pretrieve card.  Just been viewing the 12 second videos.  If I had to pay to use them for videos I would change them all out for different brand.  The price point for cameras &amp; 12 second videos can’t be beat.</span>

<span>So this happened to me in two different houses with two different sets of blink mini cameras. when i was setting up the camera, it would not connect to wifi. it would blink blue and green and then the light would go to a steady red and after a couple mins the app would tell me it couldn’t connect to wifi and that it’s usually poor signal or incorrect password. Sometimes the lights on the camera would just turn off and it would be unresponsive. I retried so many times with same outcome. I reset my wifi countless times and changed the password and reset the cameras and even got right next to my router for maximum connectivity, because according to the internet that’s what I’m supposed to do. Well it’s actually the complete opposite. After some research, these cameras connect to 2.4 GHz band. Some wifi routers give off both 2.4 and 5.0GHz, some have two separate routers for each band. I have spectrum wifi so my one router has both bands. Anyways the point is the 2.4 covers larger, further out areas but with lower signals. 5.0 covers less area with better signals. So in order for the camera to connect you have to go the furthest away from your router to be able to connect to the 2.4 GHz band. So if you have a similar sounding issue try connecting furthest from the router. Also i did contact blink support but no response and i went to Best Buy to ask and they didn’t know what to do. maybe blink should include this info in the instructions</span>

<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<span>We bought a set of these on sale to help keep an eye on our dogs while we are away/ to keep an eye on the baby cribs when the children go to nap.<br/><br/>They work great for the dogs but it took a little adjustment for the babies. The reason is because at night the cameras have to switch to night mode when activated. This causes the camera to make a slight ticking noise. Of course babies being babies, picked up on this right away and were originally weary of the camera.<br/>However, they got used to it quickly and now have no problems with the camera.<br/><br/>I can say that the night vision works well and I like the alerts provided when movement is picked up.<br/><br/>Another slight hiccup I've experienced a few times is that if the motion alert is activated, you can't turn the alerts off until the camera is done with its 10 second recording.<br/>Not the biggest deal but it makes it challenging to time it correctly to deactivate the alert.<br/><br/>Overall, I think its a good budget camera and it works well with the rest of our Blink system.</span>

<span>I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.<br/><br/>Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.<br/><br/>I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!<br/><br/>Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.</span>
