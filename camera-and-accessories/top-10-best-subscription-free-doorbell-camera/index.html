<span>The Remo is a good value and works well.<br/><br/>My only installation problems were: 1. I had to solder longer wires onto my existing doorbell wires in order to have enough length to connect to the screws on the back of the Remo. 2. I dropped and lost one of the tiny security screws. Then I dropped and lost the other one at the hardware store looking for a replacement. Ugh! Customer Service sent free replacements.  After the fact, I realized the screwdriver included would probably have prevented this. It has a tiny magnetized Torx tip to install the security screws.<br/><br/>We had to take our door wreath down. It was an attraction for birds to our porch. Even with it removed we still have somewhat of a problem with birds activating the camera. This would be a problem with any doorbell camera.<br/><br/>I have the top third of the Motion Zone turned off to minimize motion detection on the street in front of our house. Even with that setting it is sometimes triggered by fast vehicles passing by and headlights toward the house from a facing street at night.<br/><br/>You will have to experiment with daytime and nightime Motion Sensitivity to find the best setting for your house.<br/><br/>I have Video Quality set to Average and Night Mode set to Auto.<br/><br/>The Bright Region setting has three options and is supposed to minimize shadows and dark areas (There is no explanation in the instructions.) The three options are All, Horizontal and Vertical. The Horizontal setting shows a band across about 25% of the horizontal middle of the viewed area.  Vertical does the same across a band of the vertical viewed area.  I tried all three and took screenshots of them for comparison. The "Vertical" and "All" settings appear to be identical. However the Horizontal setting is significantly brighter for the entire field of view.  I leave it set at that.<br/><br/>I use an Amazon Echo 5 Show to view the doorbell from the living room. I'm a little disappointed in this, however.  When you tell Alexa you want to view the doorbell it comes up instantly just like it does on a cell phone. However it takes 14 seconds before it focuses. This is probably due to Alexa, not the Remo.<br/><br/>Overall I'm happy.</span>

<span>This review is based on my exprience installing it. I have a working Heath Zenith TR0070-BX electronic chime with a push button doorbell and decided to upgrade to a video doorbell after some research at Amazon. I was able to configure the Remobell S with the Heath Zenith chime after long hours of painful process of troubleshooting.<br/><br/>(Skip this if you know what is mechanical chime or an electronic (digital) chime)<br/>Before you buy the Remobell S door bell, first determine whether you have a mechanical or an eletronic (digital) doorbell chime. You will need to open your chime to find out the chime type, the voltage VAC it uses(it should be written inside the chime) and also get the model of your chime. You have a mechanical chime if it produces a dingdong ring (and without any speakers in it) while you have an electronic chime if it plays a tune (and the chime has speakers inside it). Once you have the chime type and model, then go to the manufacturer's website (https://remoplus.co) and check if your chime is in the INCOMPATIBLE LIST.<br/><br/>The remobell S has installation instructions for a mechanical chime only. If you decide to buy the remo doorbell S, please take note that there are no instructions if you have an electronic chime. You will be on your own and install at your own risk.. or you may hire an electrician to install it for you. You may or may not require a diode or a relay or a transformer depending on the chime model. An electrician would know.<br/><br/>Luckily I was able to find and download the manual of the Heath Zenith electronic chime. The chime required a 16VAC transformer with my old doorbell, which I assumed a 16VAC transformer has been installed in the house since the old doorbell was working properly.  According to the Remobell S manual, the Remobell S will work with a voltage of 16-24VAC, so I assumed this will work with my current Heath Zenith electronic chime.<br/>The old doorbell has a diode installed in it. Normally the diode is needed in the doorbell with an electronic chime according to the Heath Zenith manual. For curiousity, I tried installing the diode in the Remobell S doorbell, which was from my old doorbell, (and without the powerkit) but it didn't worked. The end result was the chime would not stopped ringing.<br/><br/>Here is the configuration that work for me after a lot of trial and error. I almost gave up and was ready to return this doorbell. Even though the Remobell S manual mentioned to install the powerkit in a mechanical chime, I took the risk and tried installing the powerkit in the Heath Zenith electronic chime, installed remobell S doorbell without the diode and then executed the configuration steps in the Remobell App. In the app, I selected the "Digital" In-home Chime Type. There was a warning when I pressed "Digital" that "If the improper chime is selected it may cause the doorbell to malfunction, resulting in device failure or fire. If you do not know the chime system you have, please consult a licensed electrician." I still took the risk and continued selecting "Digital" despite the warning. Once the remobell S configuration was completed, the Remobell S was working like a charm --- the electronic chime played a tune inside the house and the Remobell S doorbell would ring a dingdong sound outside to signify the visitor that the doorbell is working.<br/><br/>I also tried selecting the chime type as "mechanical" in the app even though I have an electronic chime. The Remo bell S still works but the chime would not ring nor sound off so I reconfigured it back to "Digital". You will need to select the correct chime type in the app to make it work.<br/><br/>I like that I dont have to pay monthly fees with this doorbell and it has a cloud storage good for 3 days. Voice conversations between the phone and the doorbell are loud and clear. The video quality is not the best but is ok for my taste. I can live with the video quality. As what other reviews mentioned, there is no option to turn off the dingdong sound on the remobell S doorbell when you pressed the doorbell button and the instructions are poorly written so I am taking one star off. I cannot comment if this is working properly with a mechanical chime as I do not have one.</span>

<span>This is our first video doorbell so I have no point of reference for comparison to others but I'll share my experience.<br/>This is a nicely packaged and presented product. All that you need for installation is included.<br/>While the directions are sufficient it helps being comfortable connecting this to your mechanical chime as was my case. I was concerned about this part since I have a three story home with 3 mechanical chimes. I connected the power module that comes with it per directions and connected it to the chime that is connected directly to the transformer. (I knew my transformer was more than sufficient voltage since I had to upgrade it when I installed the three chimes).<br/>Another thing to know is this operates on 2.4 ghz so I needed to sort out and split the passwords on my dual router so it wouldn't try to connect to the 5 ghz side. Once this was done I still had trouble connecting to my wi-fi. After many failed attempts I contacted their service. You'll have to leave a message. I must admit I was getting discouraged at this point.<br/>I got a call back about two hours later and was told that my Android phone was probably the issue and I should sign in using another device and that would correct the problem. I used my wife's iPhone to download the app and sign in and it connected. I was then able to connect with mine also. I don't understand why this worked but ok. Next I went to Device on the app and accessed the settings. This is where you set the quality of the video, the motion sensor etc. Most importantly your mechanical chimes won't work inside your house unless you indicate that in your app.<br/>This was about a 6 hour install from start to finish. Adding the power module to the chime and installing the doorbell was pretty straight forward. The difficulty was on the technology side with the attempts to connect, waiting for a callback etc. Now that everything is working I am pleased with the results. The doorbell unit is attractive and well made with a blue light that is constantly on surrounding the button. The two-way talk works well, although it can be loud so no need to speak in anything other than a normal voice. Also when the doorbell is pushed, the visitor hears a doorbell sound that is generated through the speaker. This is loud and I'm not sure it's necessary but there is no way to change the volume or silence it. Video of course is better in the day and with an outdoor light at night. At night without a light source not so great. I really didn't care about long term video cloud other storage so this 3 day storage window is fine.<br/>I could have spent more for a Ring or another device and maybe had a better product or experience but this Remo is doing all we need it to do for now. Identifying who's at the door and being aware of package deliveries etc. was the goal.</span>

<span>Let me first start by saying I had high expectations for this device. It has high praise from PCMag and other reliable sources, but the customer reviews are leaning more and more towards the negative. Now that I am literally 6 days outside my return window, and trust me, it needs to go back, I am writing a thorough review.<br/><br/>First the Pros:<br/>Easy to install<br/>Great Mounting Options<br/>Good Video &amp; Image Quality (see cons below)<br/>Everything Needed Is In The Box (unless you have a low voltage doorbell)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Glitchy Images Periodically<br/>Wind Freaks It Out<br/>Shadows Freak It Out<br/>Drops Wifi Regularly<br/>Headlights From Driving Vehicles Freak It Out<br/>Not Reliable<br/><br/>So here's the actual scoop on this thing. I installed it on 12/28/19 when it arrived. Everything you need for the most part is in the box. That is, if you have a fairly modern doorbell system. Our home is pushing about 30 years old and has the original hardware and it was up to snuff. It took longer to connect it to the network than it did to make the 2 different connections (1 at the mechanical bell, 1 at the actual unit itself outside). Many have reported they have to turn off their 5ghz network to connect it, that just isn't the case. You simply have to be connected to the 2.4ghz channel on your mobile device to get it to recognize, otherwise you'll get an incorrect password error. So that was easy honestly, just slow.<br/><br/>Initially, for the first 2 weeks or so, it was pretty good. Getting it dialed in is time consuming since it really doesn't give very solid directions on adjusting zones for motion, bright lights and so on. It's more a trial and error thing honestly. But the first real issue came 1/13/20 when my neighbor's daughter who is autistic, came to our door at 4:50am frightened (her dad went to the gym while she was sleeping). She rang the bell and it didn't go off, nor did it notify my phone or my wife's, didn't trip the motion sensor, and didn't ring our mechanical bell. That's a problem. I didn't know she was even there until much later in the day when I was clearing other notifications and videos.<br/><br/>The next problem stuck its ugly head out just a couple weeks ago with the winds we get this time of year. Our neighbor has a queen palm in her yard that's a good 20 feet or more away, but it casts a shadow across our yard. When the wind blows, the tree sways and the shadows trip the doorbell. Literally every 15-20 seconds I get a notification of movement detected. So I go into the app and try to adjust the zones, but of course the zone maps for bright light areas and movements are generic as all get up. You can't see a live view that correlates to what the camera sees, so you don't know exactly what is what and you just have to keep messing with it until you get lucky and get it right, or you get frustrated to no end, like I did, and just kill the motion sensor until the winds die down, rendering it partially useless. It also loves to be triggered at night and early mornings when vehicles drive by and their headlights trigger it too.<br/><br/>Now my latest issue and what led me to look at returning it, but alas, I am 5 days past the return window conveniently, it started dropping network connection. No big deal, right? WRONG! You can't simply go in the app and reset it, oh no...That would be too easy and too smart. No, you have to delete the device, remove it and reset the thing, reinstall, re-configure the app and EVERY SINGLE SETTING you spent days to weeks getting situated..Ya, it's beyond a headache. It started all that network nonsense yesterday, and let me tell you, it's real frustrating for me, which I am a techie and good with the physical/handyman work as well, so I can only imagine how bad it would be for someone who is less familiar with networks and such. I started with a 2 star, but the more I thought about it as I wrote this, I had to drop it to a 1 star, simply because it would be that bad for those who have little understanding of setting these things up and have to hire a handyman or call a neighbor or relative to handle it. Simply put, avoid it until Remo can get it dialed in. Give a live view of the zones on the app to make it more fluid for setup, definitely reconfigure the app to not require the deletion of the device and settings if you experience a network issue. It's kind of a 2nd rate setup in comparison to others available. I will reach out to Amazon and see if they will work with us to exchange this for a different device as this simply isn't what we expected.</span>

<span>We have a front door that drivers keep leaving packages at despite an easy to read "Please deliver all packages to back door" sign mounted at eye level in front of the steps to the door. We also have a non-functional front door with steps, railing, and door knob all removed that they've left packages under. Sometimes even on the door to our deck on the opposite side of the house from the driveway (with no sidewalk leading there). We got 2 of these doorbells to see where TF they go in the front of the house when packages are not delivered to the back door as directed, and to monitor the back door. The front door had a wired bell with a bad button so it barely worked. The rear door did not have one so we previously used a simple wireless doorbell. After missing a UPS package that required a signature, we found the chime batteries were dead and decided it was time. With the Blink cameras we could at least monitor battery life via the app, and get alerted to a delivery if we weren't close enough to hear the chime. Or if the package was just dropped without ringing the doorbell.<br/><br/>We love being able to see what's going on, or what activity there was near a door, and even get an alert when someone pulls into our driveway due to the range of coverage.<br/><br/>However, the documentation is confusing. With both wired to our existing chime the cameras report "external power OK" instead of "Battery OK", so I'm not sure how to monitor battery life. Documentation on that is lacking, and the notification settings don't match what I see in Android 12. Documentation states the doorbell always runs on battery though, so the change in monitoring is confusing at first glance until you dig through FAQs for the official answer:<br/><br/>The Blink Video Doorbell closes the power circuit of your existing chime system, it does not provide power of any kind. If the chime system loses power for any reason, the doorbell only plays the Blink Chime sound and your existing chime will not activate.<br/><br/>I don't recall if this was covered in the FAQs/documentation I read before buying, but I found out during the install that I didn't need to make any changes to the wired chime like with Wyze (requires you to bypass the chime making it no long function so the doorbell can be powered) and other models. Install was so much easier than I expected, aside from having to run a new wire to our back door just to tie that doorbell into the wired chime. Now we'll be able to add another doorbell to our side door to monitor the deck without any wiring, and the sync module saves us the monthly cloud fee.<br/><br/>Motion capture has been a bit weird. I have field of view blocked off from the house side of the front sidewalk to the top of the view to ignore the street and nearby tree branches. Yet we still get motion alerts from the occasional car passing by on the street. Seems more frequent at night, especially vehicles with reflective paint/stickers (police cars, school buses, etc). Front door view is kind of dark, despite a nearby street light, but I don't want to turn up the IR intensity if it'll generate more alerts from traffic. I also walked the dog across the entire front lawn (the whole area I have set to monitor) during the day and it did not trigger a motion alert.<br/><br/>In the end, it's great getting the alerts we do. It was more than we got before, and the doorbell chimes should be more reliable now in addition to getting the phone alerts when out of hearing range of the wired chime. All for a reasonable price, with no monthly fees building up.<br/><br/>Edit 8/27/2022: The "false alarms" for the front door camera due to headlights from passing traffic at night, setting sun, etc have been eliminated with an angled mounting bracket. With the doorbell angled down, those alerts have stopped. And its better anyway as it covers more of the steps down from the door.</span>

<span>I bought this doorbell with the required sync module so that I could have a doorbell with video and audio at a separate building from the main house.  The main house has an ASUS router and I also have one Blink mini connected to that wifi, and it has worked fine all along.  The doorbell and sync module have been a problem but seem to be working ok now.<br/><br/>Here is what I learned in case it is helpful to someone else.  The second building is served its wifi via a Netgear router configured as an AP (access point) only.  The ethernet connection from the main house to the AP is provided via the TV cable using MoCA 2 connectors, which has always worked fine.  I the past I have not had any problems with other things connecting in that building and just letting the router use the assigned IP via DHCP .  For the Blink doorbell and sync, this did not work, it dropped out frequently and failed to reconnect.  After much frustration and various attempts trying different things, here is what I have now and it is so far working.  I gave the AP itself and all of the Blink accessories fixed IP addresses.  I moved the sync module from near the main router to near the doorbell (thus also connecting via the AP).  I have only had one drop since and it reconnected itself like it should.  So that is what is working for me.<br/><br/>A note about tech support from Blink, there is basically none.  I have several messages back and forth with them, and the only advice anyone could provide was to turn various things off and on again.  Gee thanks, never would have thought of that.  Some of the messages back came addressed to someone else’s name, and none seemed to understand my system and what I was dealing with.  So assume you are on your own in trying to get these things working.  If you are installing in a single building using one router, it all may work fine, good luck.  If not, try what is working for me.<br/><br/>As for the doorbell itself, it works OK, it rings via the mini installed in the main house, and the video and audio are acceptable.  The lag in starting the camera is several seconds so for instance if a car drives by, it only captures the back as it heads away.  Doesn’t really matter for my purposes.  Also, the sensitivity setting range seems off, as anything above 4 or 5 out of 10 sees shadows of branches from the wind and other useless notifications, so for me 5 should be 10 to allow better fine adjustment.  I don’t plan to continue the cloud based service once the free 30 days expire, will try it without and see how it goes.  The cloud service is pretty expensive particularly since you pay for each camera.<br/><br/>I will update this review if anything changes.</span>

<span>The night vision isn’t great.  And I have a bit of an overhang so when a person walks up to the door, as soon as they hit shade, camera takes a second to adjust.<br/><br/>It has a lit up circle to see where to press.  But the chime only sounds outside—not inside.  So, either have a Bluetooth device to chime inside or order the interior Blink mini.  I ordered the mini but I do NOT want an interior camera there, as it will set off every time I walk by.  So I set it and gray out areas of my livingroom to not record and it’s still recording.  That is annoying.<br/><br/>The first time I checked the recordings I think I got 43 videos to check.  The grayed out areas are still recording.  I grayed out more areas and it still went on and records areas I grayed out when I turn a light on.<br/><br/>I think I’ll get an echo speaker to use as a chime and NOT the Blink mini.  I feel like I’m being spied on.</span>

<span>After reading the reviews I was very hesitant me and my fiancé aren't really good with electrical work. I wanted it to work as a door bell and camera. I LOVE THIS DOORBELL. The directions provided weren't the best. we looked up a you tube video and it was super simple. everything we needed came in the box nothing was broke and we were even rough on some of the screw (men being men) and they were fine ( i read a review saying the head snapped off of their nails). The camera quality is amazing the night vision is good and its really sensitive to motion. I have indoor blink cameras and had to turn my door bed sensitivity down. The doorbell rings on your phone, inside the house, and on the doorbell itself. 10/10 would recommend for a cheaper ( but doesn't look or act cheaper) doorbell security system.</span>

<span>My  suburban neighborhood is generallly very safe. That said ,I am starting to see more people hanging out at shopping  areas/ convenience stores for what appears to be no reason. Also am seeing more people walking around  neighborhoods that don't seem to be going any where.  Thus was looking for some way to monitor perimeter of my house, particularly during the night time and get notified of anyone around my house My back yard is pitch black at night as well. I have added some solar lighting around my house that comes on at night to address this problem.<br/><br/>Bought the blink cameras- one for the front and one for the back of the house. Easy to install and the app is pretty user friendly with options for scheduling  and setting up specific picture zones to avoid motion detection of tree branches blowing. Also battery saving options which I like and a couple options for storing video clips.  Notifications are timely when motion is detected. I mounted each camera in spots that protect it from sun and weather . Also put a protective case around each camera to get some extra protection from the elements.<br/><br/>So far so good. It works for what I want.  Do I pick up some unwanted motion? Picked up a cat walking across the patio last night so yes.  But its not a big deal to me . I just want to know if someone is wandering around my house, primarily at night.<br/><br/>Biggest test will be winter months and how well will it work when snow, big time cold and wind chills hit. ...thus 4 stars at this point for a rating. Will be 5 if it works thru the winter weather.<br/><br/>Overall for now, glad I bought them. May buy 1 or 2 more for sides of my house on prime days if price is discounted enough. BTW, I have vinyl siding and bought the clips you can use to attach cameras/lights to your siding without drilling holes. They work great and easily allow you to move the camera around a bit if you need or want to .</span>

<span> We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.<br/><br/>Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.<br/><br/>The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.</span>

<span>I’ve had this camera for about 6 weeks now. I like it so much that I just ordered 2 more. It’s great that I can access it from the app on my phone, which works very well, and it doesn’t cost me anything. Simply plugging in a usb drive to the sync module allows you to save recordings without paying for the cloud service, which is great!</span>

<span>I didn't know I had animals crossing my gate day and night.  Now I know about it and I see everyone who comes to deliver a package (Amazon, of course) or leave a flyer.  I can download or forward each clip, or simply delete the clips I no longer need.  Super easy to charge and install the camera and manage the system with my cell phone.  There are several adjustable settings, like clarity of night vision and length of clip, which may affect the battery charge, but it's easy to pop off the mount and recharge when it says low battery.  I like the black color and the size, it's visible if you look at it, but not obvious, otherwise.  I did a lot of research on the different brands and subscriptions available.  I am pleased with this purchase.</span>

<span>It took a little time to install, and the location of the old doorbell wasn't a very good spot for this larger doorbell. I made it work ok, but the doorbell isn't as secure on our outside vinyl siding as I would have liked it. It was difficult to secure safety screws. Maybe include a clear plastic security case to cover the doorbell so it's not stolen and keeps out of the weather. You could use the special screws to secure the cover. Doorbell has worked very well and it's really nice to know when deliveries are at the door since delivery people seldom ring the doorbell. Motion sensors are really nice just wish the camera showed our porch better so we could see the packages. Highly recommend this product.</span>

<span>The motion detection is not like the additional Ring cameras we have installed throughout our property. It doesn’t detect someone until they are almost to the door.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is my review for:<br/><br/>Ring Video Doorbell Wired<br/><br/>I tried to keep my review short but there was a lot of information here so I added headers for easier reading.<br/><br/>Background:<br/><br/>When the first Ring doorbell came out, I really wanted one, but it was a bit too expensive for my taste, so I went with a cheap knock-off. I have been using that knock-off since then and I hate it. The image quality wasn’t awful, but it had a lot of bugs and it didn’t play well with “Alexa”. I kept automating my home adding echo’s, lights, switches, cameras, you name it and every time I circled back to the doorbell I would think: “I already have a video doorbell and the Ring doorbell is still pricey; maybe I should buy some other automation toys”. Well, this new Ring came out, and it was less than 100$ thus I said, let’s try it…<br/><br/>Appearance:<br/><br/>Dimensions wise, this one is pretty small (5.1”x2.4”x 1.1”). The button is very noticeably a button; to me this is important as with my old knock off doorbell, people would constantly push the camera lenses thinking that they rang the doorbell.<br/><br/>Differences between this Ring Doorbell and Previous versions:<br/><br/>I did some internet research prior to deciding for it, and I could only find a few things: (1) it supports only 2.4 GHz networks instead of being dual band, (2) it only works as a fully wired setup (3) it has a single faceplate and (4)it is way cheaper than previous models.<br/><br/>To me, it wasn’t a big deal the doorbell not being dual band, I planned on using the 2.4 GHz band anyway as I have been with my knockoff brand doorbell. There are several obstructions along the way (two thick walls and some furniture between the door and my repeater, and my router is in the basement), and the 2.4 GHz network is usually better for that albeit a bit slower.<br/>This doorbell requires to have an existing wired doorbell setup, unlike previous iterations that you could have fully battery powered doorbell. Yet the setup is only needed for power. You will be bypassing the existing doorbell chime, thus, you will either need to purchase the model that include the Ring Chime (+20$), purchase a separate Ring Chime (30-50$) or use a compatible Alexa device as the speaker(s). I am using a few of my echoes and I like the setup a whole bunch.<br/>The Ring Video Doorbell has a single face plate (black) vs 4 different color ones for the Pro. I did search online for other faceplates and I found a pearl white one going for about 15$ but I am sticking with the black one.<br/>The newer model is about 70% cheaper. About 60$ vs the 200$ MSRP for the Pro.<br/>Issues so far:<br/><br/>I haven’t had a lot of issues, but I already had one. I had some connectivity issues right of the bat. The fact that this doorbell bypasses the hardwired chime exacerbates this. No connectivity means no doorbell whether you have power or not. A few resets, I moved my repeater closer and it appear the problem was corrected. However, I point it out because when compared to my old 2.4 GHz knock-off video doorbell, I never had an issue. I am considering this as a one off but I will update my review if this issue persists.<br/><br/>Bottom line<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/>Compatibility with Alexa. When Amazon acquired Ring a while back, I just knew that integration with Echo devices would probably only improve but even knowing that, I was impressed. You can define specific devices you want them to work with. It allows for tons of customization including ringtones.<br/>I currently have two echo dots and an echo spot serving as my alerts and this setup works great. The video playback on the Echo Spot is smooth as silk with minimal Lag. I will be linking it up to my new Echo Show when it gets here, next week. I don’t envision any issues linking it up, but I will update my review if needed.<br/>It features an advanced motion detection system that allows for customizable alert motion zones. It is extremely intuitive to setup. Thumbs up, all the way.<br/>It was very easy to install<br/>It looks elegant yet sleek.<br/>It is cheaper than any previous Ring Model.<br/><br/>What I dislike so far.<br/><br/>It supports only 2.4 GHz networks. This is not a major negative as 2.4 GHz networks usually allow for a better range, especially if there are obstructions along the way. Still, it is worth mentioning.<br/>I have a hardwired doorbell chime that is useless now. If my WIFI fails at any point, my doorbell is dead in the water.<br/>I already had connectivity issues. They might have been a one off so I am not necessarily overreacting to them but I will update my review if needed.<br/>The first two negatives were design choices that allowed lowering the price point and they were something I knew coming in. However, they are still significant enough that I called them out.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, this is actually a very good device. If you already have a Ring doorbell, this item is not for you. If you don’t, and you are ok with a fully WIFI driven, hard wired power doorbell camera, I strongly recommend it.</span>

For such a low cost I can't believe how much better the motion detection is and most of all how much better the night vision is. Very satisfied customer.</span>

<span>So  I had the older satin nickel ring doorbell. That things was a piece of crap. I got it, charged it and once I hooked it up within 6 weeks the charge got down to 13%. Who wants to take this down every time and charge it? Plus it takes over 24 hours to charge. I called Ring customer service and they told me the doorbell receives a  " trickle charge". Well I never got a trickle charge. The doorbell just continued to lose battery so I got rid of it and got this one. BEST THING I EVER DID! Once I watched the youtube video on how to install this , it tooks minutes to hook up and I havent had a issue since and it been over a month. Video is clear, I hear  the voices well and I haven't had a charge/electric issues.</span>

<span>Overall, pretty happy with this Eufy 2K wired doorbell. This is the second Eufy wired doorbell that I've installed (one for my father and one for me), and this particular Eufy replaced a Ring Doorbell Pro - so most of my review compares the Eufy to the Ring.<br/><br/>Installation process: My Ring was actually a replacement for one that was DOA, and I spent a lot of time on the phone with Ring trying to troubleshoot that first DOA one before determining it was just a bad unit. Installation of the replacement Ring was without too much hassle, but I'd say that installing the Eufy was very straightforward. I'd give the edge to the Eufy. My only real complaint is there are probably lots of people that dump their Ring doorbells for Eufy, and it would've been appreciated if the Eufy mounting plate had the same hole spacing as Ring. (I modified the mounting plate to avoid drilling more holes in my brick, and it was a real challenge and took over an hour to make the mounting plate modifications and get the Eufy to click into place afterward...would've been so easy for Eufy to provide extra mounting holes or slots with their mounting plate to begin with.)<br/><br/>The Eufy 2K has good video quality (2K); the Ring Doorbell Pro was 1080p and totally adequate, but not quite as sharp.<br/><br/>Compared to the previous Ring I owned,  I especially appreciate that no fees are required to access stored videos on the Eufy! Here's why: On both units, there is some lag from when a delivery person is first seen by the doorbell and when I get notification on my phone about the delivery person (seemed like the Ring lagged worse). For Eufy, I get a nice alert notification on my phone showing a picture of who is at my door. If it's a picture of the UPS guy, great...I just know that a package was delivered. And if I want to see the video, the Eufy uses onboard memory to store the video...which I can download if I want to. In the same scenario with Ring, I would get a text alert on my phone that someone was at my door, but no picture - I had to actually go into the Ring app to see who it is. By the time I was able to access the Ring live view on my phone, the delivery person was long gone and I couldn't even see the delivered package because it was right next to the door and outside the view of the camera (BTW, seems like both Ring and Eufy should make their videos in portrait mode optional so the camera could see a short package sitting on your welcome mat). So with Ring, you are pretty much REQUIRED to pay like $30/year for the privilege to see your stored video in the cloud to know who came to your door.<br/><br/>Integration with Alexa: Ring does this quite well. With Ring, my Echo devices would tell me "Someone is at your front door" as the Ring saw someone approaching my front door, and I don't believe that Eufy does this. (11/22/21 Update: Actually, the Echo DOES tell me that someone is at the front door with the Eufy; just need to have the Eufy skill lined to Alexa and go to Alexa Devices/Cameras/Doorbell/Settings and turn on "Motion Announcements".) If you have an Echo Show, you can ask it to show your doorbell with either Ring or Eufy and get live video. These features are both kind of neat, but also kind of "who cares".<br/><br/>Integration with existing home wiring: Not a big deal, but I think Ring has a slight edge here. My house came with two doorbell chimes (one upstairs and one downstairs) and Ring would ring both chimes. With Eufy, you get a chime that plugs into the wall; it does not ring the prewired chimes in your house. So with Eufy, I have to find an available outlet to plug the chime into and sync the chime to the doorbell. To hear the doorbell ring both upstairs and downstairs, I'll need to buy another chime from Eufy ($30). (11/22/21 Update: Or just have the Alexa app do Motion Announcements and Doorbell Press Announcements so your Echoes all tell you when the doorbell is pressed.)<br/><br/>Security: Ring is a bit better, but not sure it matters for me. The Ring videos are stored in the cloud, whereas the Eufy videos are stored in the doorbell. If your doorbell gets stolen, I guess you'd be out of luck with Eufy. And I think it's a little bit easier to steal the Eufy compared to the Ring - to remove the Eufy you stick a pin into its bottom to release it; to remove the Ring you use your special security screwdriver, after popping off the cover plate, to remove a special screw. In either case, I think if someone wants your doorbell, they can just rip it off without too much effort, so that's why the Ring is theoretically better (with videos in the cloud). And I think the Ring app does a great job of integrating with other Ring users in surrounding neighborhoods and really liked that part of the experience. With Eufy, there's no "neighborhood" feature that I'm aware of.<br/><br/>Durability: Too soon to know, but I'll go out on a limb and give Eufy the advantage. I have had Eufy wireless security cameras for a couple years and they've worked without any issues. For Ring, the first Ring was DOA. Its replacement worked for about 2-1/2 years before I got a spinning white light of death (bad wi-fi). Reading Ring reviews, seems like they're just more fragile.<br/><br/>So overall, both Ring and Eufy are nice to have, but I actually think the Eufy looks better and works better. If you don't mind paying the annual fee to Ring, it's fine too and you do get something for your money, I suppose. But after a few years of paying for the Ring cloud service, you could've just bought the Eufy and been done with it.</span>

<span>Edit to original review: Some neighborhood punk kids decided to steal something off of my porch and they didn't know that I had the video doorbell. I was able to find the kids rather easily since they weren't that smart and they hung around the neighborhood. I used my iPhone to record my confrontation from them, told them they better take me to their parents instantly or I'm going to call the cops. They took me to their home and I had a chat with their parents about how their kids stole things off of my porch. Without this camera I wouldn't have known who did it, so just for this instance alone it's well worth the money. It's been on 24/7 for the past few months and has worked wonderfully with no issues.<br/><br/>I've wanted a doorbell camera for a while now for various reasons including, but not limited to, dogs doing their business on my lawn, seeing who's coming to my door when I'm not home, but most of all, for people trying to get into my house either through malfeasance or idiocy. It seems like every other week someone was trying to walk into my house by turning the doorknob (particularly at night) and it seems that one of my neighbors has late night guests that can't read the house number and apparently just walk into homes without even having to knock. I keep a shotgun close just in case but that's of course as a last resort and I always keep my doors locked with multiple locks. Maybe I'm a little paranoid since my city has an extremely low crime rate, but honestly I don't care because my families safety comes first.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the doorbell. I was ultimately looking at getting a Nest doorbell camera from Costco because the quality seemed better and the deal they had seemed too good to pass up as it included 12 months of the premium online camera service (after 12 months you have to pay for the subscription). I was about to pull the trigger but the sale ended and I wasn't going to overpay for something that would probably go on sale again. I started looking into other cameras and saw a video on YouTube about this camera and considering the price and that it came with a chime too (where you have to pay extra for the chime with ring or nest unless it's in a bundle) I decided to get this doorbell camera. Another positive for me was not having to pay for a subscription to utilize it to it's maximum effect. I don't mind that the storage is local because if someone were to steal or break it purposefully they'll have their face recorded prior to breaking it. I look at my system on every alert so I would be able to save the footage needed if they tore the whole doorbell out including the on board storage. All those made it an easy choice and thanks to having an electrician in the family, I was up and running with it in about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>I bought this camera in August so I have plenty of time to see the good and the bad and I'm not going to run through every little thing, but there's a lot more good than bad. The bad is that it takes maybe 4-6 seconds to get a notification of the motion, be it a car or the swaying trees or someone coming to the door. That's about all of the bad I can think of. The camera itself is excellent particularly in areas where I was unsure any camera doorbell would do well, direct sunlight and night vision. The night vision is pretty good. It's not perfect but for the price it's very clear on what you can see. I have a large field of view directly out of my front door and I think I can see at least 50-75 feet away using the camera. It's not going to be a crystal clear face but you can see motion and human figures which I think is good for a night vision. Direct sunlight is something I was worried about since some cameras are terrible at it but this one is excellent. I live in the desert and in the summer months, particularly August when I bought the camera, the sun is extremely bright and extremely hot. I am very impressed with how the camera handles direct sunlight. it seems like it's almost designed to "block" the sun so you can see the street, driveway, etc. in front of your house. it's hard to explain but the sun doesn't interfere with what you see and that's a plus to me.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, I think it's a great device if you're okay with local storage. I am and I'm going to continue to enjoy this doorbell camera. The only thing I'll add is to update your firmware as soon as you can.</span>

<span>This is one of those products that deserves a comprehensive review so buckle up.<br/><br/>Short version: This is a phenomenal doorbell and security camera. The camera quality is excellent, audio is crisp, setup is easier than you'd think, and you'll be using a product by a company that actually tries to respect your privacy.<br/><br/>Long version:<br/><br/>Like many people I have been very concerned with the position Ring has taken on user privacy. Recent media reports say that that they are freely sharing footage with law enforcement and are even working on being able to identify people on a "watchlist with their cameras. This combined with the constant recharging, monthly storage charges, and poor video quality of my Ring left me looking for an alternative.<br/><br/>Eufy's device is different than Rings. It appears that Eufy has designed the doorbell to store the footage locally on the device in an encrypted manor. This theoretically means that you, and only you, will have access to your footage. It also means that there are no monthly service charges. Yay!<br/><br/>Installation: I'll admit I was initially worried about the installation. My home was built in the 70s and the doorbell system is from that time period as well. Thankfully, the installation was incredibly simple. The included instructions were clear and required simple steps like removing screws, plugging in wires, and tightning screws. I was up and running in 30 minutes with a new sleek doorbell mounted on the included angle mount that gave me a better view than the Ring device I was using.<br/><br/>App: The app is well designed and walks you through most issues you'll encounter. If the wiring scares you - it shouldn't. There are very simple diagrams and anyone with a sliver of DIY ability will have no issues. The app responds instantly and I haven't had a single issue with it. Settings are clearly laid out and everything is accessible.<br/><br/>Video/Audio: The video quality on the camera is superb and the audio is really impressive. The device holds a good wifi signal and there is almost no delay in footage. Additionally, when someone triggers a motion alert the doorbell crops out their face and it appears in the notification on my iPhone. The sound is perfectly synched up with the video and it is much much clearer than what is on the Ring doorbell. Eufy's HDR works well for me but should only be used in a dim environment. One feature I was thrilled with was the ability to remove "fish-eye distortion". This helps people who mount their device next to a ledge or column. The software automatically flattens the image to compensate without hurting the view of the camera. This one check-box made my video much more useful. The sensitivity of the camera is great and already I'm not getting notifications from passing cars on my road. Another win over Ring.<br/><br/>Chime: The interior doorbell chime is good, although I wish it had a way to adjust the volume or play different rings. It's also unclear if it can be battery powered and, if so, for how long. Eufy should probably clarify this.<br/><br/>Now i'll talk about what I would change. It may seem like a lot, but none of these items hurt the experience of this excellent product. As Eufy's first doorbell I want to give them suggestions for the next version. At this point I know whatever they put out, I'll be buying it.<br/><br/>Here are some minor suggestions I have for the Eufy team:<br/><br/>- Since there is no doorbell company competition in the privacy sector, It would be good for consumers to know if anyone at Eufy ever has the ability to access any footage. I know Eufy says they don't - but do they have the capability? Is any footage accessible in the cloud at all? After all, this is a Wi-Fi connected device. As an IT professional, it would be nice to have a more detailed explanation.<br/><br/>- The doorbell could use some fun new rings and a way to adjust the volume<br/><br/>- It's unclear in the instructions if it is possible to use the doorbell with the home's internal chime.<br/><br/>- 5GHz WiFi is really important these days. Especially when many people are in crowded environments the signals can be jumbled. Thankfully the 2.4GHz transmitter in this device is EXCELLENT but it would be nice to have the new standard available.<br/><br/>- The doorbell could use HomeKit and/or SmartThings functionality to tie it into the rest of my house. HomeKit Secure Video would be awesome as well.<br/><br/>- 4GB of local storage could use a bump. It's a little low. The ability to use a MicroSD card would be awesome and may help Eufy keep their costs down.<br/><br/>- A temperature sensor would be nice to see what the temperature is outside<br/><br/>- Exclusion zones simply give a small red box that can't be increased in size. I've tried multiple times.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great product. Not only does it deliver on privacy and security but it also smashes the competition in functionality, video quality, setup, and ease of use. I really can't recommend it enough. Great job, Eufy!</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>After reading all of the negative reviews, I opted to order the Arlo Wired Video doorbell anyway.  We had a Ring, and it was terrible.  If you haven't figured it out yet, Ring can be easily defeated and no one would know where your package went.  Many times things showed up on the door without warning.  Stuff could just as easily disappeared without knowing.<br/><br/>Back to Arlo.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>Excellent recording and minimal gaps - less than 3 seconds. (Ring was over 90 second gaps.)<br/>Much better field of view. You can see from the floor to the ceiling on the porch.<br/>Much clearer imaging, even when zooming in.<br/>Far superior communication with my I phone.<br/>Much easier to stop the notifications of every car that drives by.  While it still records and stores the video, you do not get notified every time.  I set the field to only notify when a person gets close to the porch.<br/>If someone rings the doorbell, my phone rings.  No delay in that notification.  I can then speak to whom ever is at the door, whether I am home or not.  No need to open the door to tell solicitors to leave.  Arlo even has a siren.  It is a bit cumbersome to set off, but would definitely tell a solicitor that you are not interested!<br/><br/>Cons -<br/>The biggest complaint I have about the Arlo doorbell, and the reason for the 4 star review, is the mounting bracket.  It fits the doorbell like a skin, leaving no room for error with screws, or placement for the wire.  If you have a small amount of wire tucked behind the doorbell, or the screws are not perfectly seated, you will fight to get the doorbell into the mount.  This could be easily remedied if they made some space in the bracket to allow for for mounting inconsistencies.  The other issue with the mounting bracket is that it is plastic.  This also causes mounting problems.  If everything is not exactly plumb and square, like one screw to tight, getting the doorbell into the bracket is difficult.  Being plastic, and tightening a screw to mount to a wall is just waiting for a failure.  No room for washers, or mistakes here!<br/><br/>Delay in motion notification.  While you always get the notification and the complete video, it is not instant.  There is a few second delay between motion happening, and the notification arriving.  If the button is pushed, there is no delay (see earlier comments).<br/>It only takes a paperclip to remove the doorbell.<br/><br/>Summary -<br/>While the Arlo Wired Video doorbell has a few flaws, it is far superior to the Ring v2 video doorbell we had.  I like the look of the Arlo, just not the mounting.  The rest of the cons are likely similar to all video doorbells on the market.  Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase, and the results.<br/><br/>A few notes.  I did upgrade the transformer to make sure that we had a solid 24vac to the doorbell.  I added in an aftermarket mount to rotate the doorbell to a better field of view.  There is a monthly subscription, but it is about the same cost as the annual one with Ring.</span>

<span>Doorbell works great, but it’s wasn’t setting off the chime in the house; it’s a new house and the original doorbell worked perfectly. We followed the directions through the app and then on YouTube, tried multiple times, back tested and retested; online arlo troubleshooting couldn’t find a solution. Ended up having an electrician friend come by to solve the puzzle. The doorbell itself looks clean, ordered a backplate to help conceal the larger hole in the stucco. Synced nicely with my existing arlo power station. Responds nicely and it just does what it’s supposed to do. I would like the to be able to adjust the voice and volume of the voice from the doorbell, but it works fine now. It’s an added security camera for the front door and it’s serving it’s purpose.</span>

<span>This is my first Video Doorbell. I had some issues while connecting it to the network (only 2.4 GHz networks are supported and my "user friendly" router don't have the option to choose between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks). Arlo customer service was not very helpful, but things worked out in the end. Also, there's a lag when someone rings the bell, it takes more time than it should to notify you somebody is at your door. There's a Ring Doorbell at my work, and that one immediately shows you when somebody is there. Now I'm questioning me if Is should have got that one instead.</span>

<span>I replaced a top of the line Skybell with this Arlo wired.  The Skybell's lag time was so bad, people would be leaving before I was notified on my phone that the doorbell had been activated.<br/>The Arlo is instant, so instant I can finally use the communication feature that I was never able to use before.<br/>The Arlo does not need a subscription to work.  I have the Arlo cameras with the hub.  The easy to follow instruction for connecting to the hub were easy, and I now have my recordings for 7 days, free.  If I want to save them, save to my hard drive...done.  With a newer Hub, it will save to USB or mini SD card  Why spend a monthly fee for a cloud to do it for me?  The Arlo puts the Skybell at double the price to shame.<br/>I read the 1 star reviews, they don't even come close to what I receive and installed.  The working of mine is awesome.</span>

<span>I've had this a month now, and I'm really happy with it. I chose it over ring because there is no subscription. I was concerned it might not get a good camera view because as you can see in my photo, my doorbell is in a tight corner. I used the included optional angle mount piece and was amazed it captured my entire porch view. I was also easily able to set it to pick up a certain area so the semi-truck that occasionally drives down my neighborhood street wasn't tracked. The night vision with my porch light on works great as you can see in the picture. The set up was easy, and fortunately I was able to cut my glass door trim piece a bit so it fit in my existing doorbell wired spot. When the lights go out, it sets itself back up with no help from me. I bought this because I had just moved in this house and someone would ring the doorbell and run off. I figured it was neighborhood kids, and sure enough I got good video of it. I'll deal with that later LOL!!!. But, for now, I'm happy to have this added security.</span>

<span>Originally had a cheaper version of a no fee door bell that worked for several months then would not stay connected. Tried another one that did not tell you that you could not view the doorbell unless you payed a high monthly fee. Sent that one back after finding out after instaling app you could not use it.<br/>Decided to try this one after a lot of research and this is the one you want. It has easy install and the detection system is better than anything I have tried or seen adverstised.<br/>The app set up is easy but if you need help there is a great Youtube video that walks you through everything. The picture/video quality is very good. Notification through phone works great.<br/>Bottom line if you want a great video door bell that has human detection and can be used without paying monthly this is it.</span>

<span>My doorbell wiring was giving me fits when we had power outages, I got tired of replacing the transformer. The wireless version is not a simple plug and play to the mounting brackets from your wired doorbell.  You will have to redrill to mount your mounting brackets and be prepared to pay for cloud hosting with the new wireless install. That said, it’s worth the extra effort as the picture quality is terrific and the rechargeable battery seems to be holding its own - looks like several months of use between recharge. Sadly, this is nowhere as long as my Blink cameras, but still reasonable given the intensity of use at the front door. Overall, I’m very pleased.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I am an older woman and I installed this KASA video doorbell myself with no difficulty.  The KASA app provides easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions.  The most time-consuming part of the installation was figuring out which switch in my electrical panel powers the doorbell.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>Easy installation with clear instructions.<br/>I did not even have to drill new holes—it fit into the existing holes from the old doorbell.<br/>Very reasonable price (I paid $53).<br/>No monthly subscription fee.<br/>The picture quality and the night vision are very good.<br/>I CAN record video clips and save them to my phone withOUT a subscription. In both the live view screen AND the various recorded alerts, there is a red box that you can press to either record a live clip or a section of one of the alerts and when you stop recording, it automatically saves the video clip to my phone pictures.<br/>I have no problems with faces of visitors being too dark or glare, but my front porch is covered and I do not have glaring sun in my view.<br/>It accommodates a 128 GB micro SD card which is large enough to record a LOT (must be purchased separately).<br/>Pre-recorded voice announcements that I can activate at the press of a button (if I am on a phone call and cannot speak to the person at the door, I can press a button on my phone to choose one of several pre-recorded announcements like “I’ll be there in a minute.”)<br/><br/>What I don’t like:<br/>The provided “wedge” is only a 15 degree angle.  My doorbell is mounted on the side wall, so that wedge is small.  I CAN see the front door area with this wedge in place, but an option for greater than 15 degrees would provide a much better view—especially of the area in front of the house. With the 15 degree wedge, I have an annoying view of the edge of the wood door itself.<br/>It does NOT provide a view of the entire door mat area, so I cannot always see if a package is at my door.<br/>You cannot edit the pre-recorded voice announcements.<br/><br/>Also, I did not yet have my micro SD card when I installed the doorbell and assumed I could easily insert it later—that was a mistake that cost me more time than I planned. It was VERY difficult to remove the doorbell with the little release pin the seller provides. I reviewed the installation instructions numerous times and also searched for instructional videos but it still did not come off easily. When I finally got it off, it would not recognize the SD card until I did a factory reset and then reinstalled the doorbell from the start, including formatting the SD card. I was using a top brand 128gb SD card. I strongly recommend that you install your SD card at the time you install the doorbell—not add it after like I did.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this KASA video doorbell is a bargain and I am very happy with it.  My main complaint—which is a pretty big one if your doorbell is mounted on a side wall—is that the provided wedge should be greater than a 15 degree angle to provide a better view.<br/><br/>I took several photos to show you.<br/><br/>I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you!</span>

<span>Wanted to address what would have been a serious issue for me that was mentioned in other reviews, namely that you had to remove the SD card from the doorbell and plug it into a computer to offload video.  I just installed the doorbell cam and after a few hours, looked at the recording in the app.  In the lower right portion of the playback image is a red record button.  Cue up the event you want to offload and press record, then press stop when you have the whole thing.  The file shows up in your image downloads, or at lease it does in my Pixel 3XL as shown in the picture.  It plays back fine on my phone.<br/><br/>With that figured out, I'm happy overall with the performance of the device.  Installation and setup, however, is a bit of a mess.  Instructions for different steps are scattered all over in various videos and downloadable .pdf's.  I got it figured out without too much trouble, but a single set of WRITTEN instructions would make the process a lot more straightforward.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why people (including TP-Link support) thought you had to remove the card to offload recordings- maybe there was a firmware update after all the complaints?  Anyway, it's fixed now.</span>

<span>While I love the various products I use including 10+ outlets and 2 other cameras, I am finding the mobile app difficult to use due too my age.<br/><br/>Would love to see a web based app that I could use on a computer or laptop where I can control the display!<br/><br/>When using the Kasa Care cloud services, there is no way to select all recordings (that I could find) and delete them all at once.  You have to select each recording and make 3 screen taps to delete each one.  10 recordings, 30 screen taps.  Annoying.<br/><br/>The camera is SUPER clear even at night and that is FANTASTIC.  The sensitivity is almost TOO sensitive.  And as shown in the screen shots, I have the sensitivity tuned way down and an activity zone set up yet it still picks up people and cars on the street.  I wake up to 15 or so recordings regularly of headlights, people walking their dogs and cars motoring by.<br/><br/>Overall I am very happy with the product but there is room for improvement.</span>

<span>I switched from another doorbell camera to the Kasa line to stay with one app viewing. I had purchased several cameras for indoor and outdoor use and having them and the doorbell in one app is wonderful.  I’m pleased with this doorbell with a couple of exceptions. I want additional chimes but they are not providing them at the moment. I would also like the phone notification of the doorbell to use a specific tone. Camera quality is great and I don’t get notifications of cars and ghosts passing by like my previous device.</span>

<span>Update 24 Aug 2021: We now have a Ring Doorbell 4. It has been a night and day experience. I would gladly pay the difference. If you'd like to knoW why and my opinion comparison the update is below this original review.<br/><br/>(Original Arlo Review 20 July 2021) I had thought the Prime deal with an Echo Show would overshadow the many (many) negative reviews. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Avoid the product. I was really wrong. On opening this product it seemed easy to set up. Within days I had noticed that the image quality was extremely poor. I have Xfinity and I removed basic devices like wifi printers, coffee makers and stuff to reduce crowding on the network's bandwidth. Still, poor quality on images. Contacting customer service was unhelpful at best. All of their responses were copy/pasted and I had a new representative for each email. Some even repeated the same questions. It felt like I was being ignored. My takeaway from this product below (my notepad):<br/><br/>✓ Easy to install. Basic parts, added wires if you do want to wire it too. Second angled plate in case your doorway needs it.<br/>✓ Simple instructions to pair and install.<br/>✓ App is required. It is an internet required device.<br/>✓ Indicates upload of 6Mbps as a minimum for the video quality. This is not adequate for 2k or the product is defective for my experience and many reviewers.<br/>✓ Adding constant current to a rechargeable lithium battery damages it and lowers the life of the battery.<br/>✓ Poor image quality. Pixelated, delayed and tearing. Images within a couple feet of camera recognizable but further away useless for personal or professional/criminal.<br/>✓ Alerts chime but opening app has a delay. Actual live feed also has a delay.<br/>✓ Advertised 2k actual &lt; 240p observed through phone app, Chrome and Firefox browser. Can't even see chunky labels for grocery products feet away.<br/>✓ The app video was square and had a fisheye distortion. Even though the camera could capture further to the side and I could turn my phone which is wide screen to the side the app would not widen the frame of the view. I could zoom in but still the effect was distorted.<br/>✓ Reduced fisheye distortion on PC but still noticeable. Larger screen area on OC area with the same tools to zoom, record, pause and view. Similar blotchy pixelation from browser viewing.<br/>✓ Monthly/annual fee for most all basic features.<br/>✓ Extremely short clips. Catching just the tail lights of a vehicle pulling in at the edge of a frame or a person/large pet walking out of frame. Triggered fully by weather.<br/>✓ Repetitively triggered by the exact same thing. Person standing on the porch or sidewalk triggers alerts within 5-10 seconds even if silenced.<br/>✓ More often it records 10-15 minute triggered clips. Some are a bit longer but none are magical foresight ones. This can mean it will miss the most important part of the action or key parts that give information about what happened in the video. For example a car pulled up but you cannot see the people inside who got out. Not a huge deal except our area has had issues with mail theft, catalytic converter theft and other issues. Looking out for odd cars is helpful. When a neighbor asks if our camera caught something and then I look and all of the clips are of blurry people, illegible license plates, out of frame cars and people who pop in/out of frame it's just useless. Also a waste of monthly fees.<br/>✓ Manual recordings interrupted if you are signed in via app. The app notifications pop you right out of manual recordings on the PC and the same is true on the app. You can't do any actions on either at the same time even after authenticating. It's great to be extra secure but a little frustrating. I found this out while handling a support case with Arlo about the image quality.<br/>✓ Mislabeled captures. People are vehicles, vehicles are people.  Many packages not recognized. A lot of people were nearly out of frame and became motion label even wearing bright plain clothes. Videos containing multiple trigger labels either don't alert or just become a plain motion. Beware for packages not alerting.<br/>✓ Poor customer service when reached. Process only delayed the return process.<br/><br/>Update (Ring Doorbell 4) so you may compare and decide:<br/><br/>✓ Ring is a chunky machine. Just like Arlo. It's a similar install but Ring is more of a rectangle. You can get down to finer dimensions but you either like one shape or the other. Ring does have specific safety points to pay attention to. Unlike Arlo, there is no button release for people to just press and make your security camera pointless. Ring has a hex screw that secures the battery in.<br/>✓ Swapped faceplate! Not that it matters at all but mine is purple. I must disclose that without prompting at all Ring sent us a free one just as a welcome. It's a piece of basic plastic. Make of that what you wish.<br/>✓ Battery drops out with a press button. Much nicer and safer than Arlo which you can pop the whole camera screen cover and button plate with a paperclip.<br/>✓ Both have optional wire attachment/solar which can damage/overcharge the battery pack. I hope they introduce a feature to stop charging a fully charged battery to extend the life. Not only to help customers, be convenient and all that but lithium and battery materials are finite.<br/>✓ Neighborhood Community! All communities are a game changer. I didn't have to even have my doorbell. It was on back order but I joined and was able to participate. Videos are not auto shared, you decide what videos you share with your area. Neighborhood areas are defined by users but you're not allowed to define more than a given space. Local law enforcement also decides to participate too if they want.<br/>✓ Can I preach neighborhood community again? Mine has had warnings about window peepers, break ins, car theft, property damage, acts of kindness, missing/found dogs and more. All within minutes. Yes, Nextdoor is an app but this is also helpful. With outside apps like Nextdoor or social media you have to download your content and then upload which can reduce the quality.<br/>✓ Better quality at 1080p than Arlo's promised 4k. How is that? I'm confused still. Same items on my network! I blame the coffee maker that is abused and always making coffee for people (joke). Also Ring only required me to have 1Mbps upload. I love me a tech team that can code a program to compress video. Less packet loss between customer and company servers. Yay.<br/>✓ Preroll to know what triggered. It shows as a little window within the video.<br/>✓ I dictate how long the recordings go. The algorithm also highlights the section that it thinks was motion or important.<br/>✓ Certainly not great at labels but better.<br/>✓ The UI is vastly greater. The one long video strip I can hold down and fast forward. It's so handy if I want to watch a really fast roll of all the cars at night that triggered my camera or skip the cats that visit the bird bath in the morning.<br/>✓ Same capture zone, less fish eye AND I can rotate my phone to see a larger image. I can also still pinch/zoom or swish and move about the image.<br/>✓ Very simple customization for trigger zones. Sensitivity settings are easy to understand too.<br/>✓ Again, the dashboard and app itself for ring fires a nuke at Arlo. I am very willing to hand them money and hold them accountable for their product. Their customer service was helpful. I'm sure I'll run into issues but confident they'll have fewer hurdles.</span>

<span>So far the essential wire-free video doorbell has been really good. It does not pick up anything that is real far away which helps to minimize notifications that do not indicate something is up at the home. The installation was fairly easy although a bit confusing when switching from the wire-free installation to the wired installation. You cannot set it up wirelessly then go back and connect it wired like a plug n play device. If you want your existing mechanical or digital chime to work with the new essential video door bell then you need to remove the device from your account then re-add it and go back through the steps to indicate that you've wired it and choose the style of doorbell chime you have. We feared that we would have to purchase a chime separately when our existing chime did not work but thanks to my insistent searching skills I found on the Arlo site how to fix the issue. I think it's a bit pricey for one device especially when you do not have the option of live monitoring, and when you're trying to have security cam coverage for your whole home, but overall it's been a great product.</span>

<span>I'm giving it 4 stars only because there's a bit of a lag between when it senses motion and begins recording/"rings" the app on my phone that somebody's there. Once a two way conversation starts, it's relatively low lag, but the people at the door might be waiting a bit before my phone lets me know they're there. Got a "no drill" mount for it (uses adhesive) - completely painless to install. Nice wide field of view, high resolution images.</span>
