<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>So this happened to me in two different houses with two different sets of blink mini cameras. when i was setting up the camera, it would not connect to wifi. it would blink blue and green and then the light would go to a steady red and after a couple mins the app would tell me it couldn’t connect to wifi and that it’s usually poor signal or incorrect password. Sometimes the lights on the camera would just turn off and it would be unresponsive. I retried so many times with same outcome. I reset my wifi countless times and changed the password and reset the cameras and even got right next to my router for maximum connectivity, because according to the internet that’s what I’m supposed to do. Well it’s actually the complete opposite. After some research, these cameras connect to 2.4 GHz band. Some wifi routers give off both 2.4 and 5.0GHz, some have two separate routers for each band. I have spectrum wifi so my one router has both bands. Anyways the point is the 2.4 covers larger, further out areas but with lower signals. 5.0 covers less area with better signals. So in order for the camera to connect you have to go the furthest away from your router to be able to connect to the 2.4 GHz band. So if you have a similar sounding issue try connecting furthest from the router. Also i did contact blink support but no response and i went to Best Buy to ask and they didn’t know what to do. maybe blink should include this info in the instructions</span>

<span>UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn’t the best but once you change the video quality setting to “Enhanced” it’s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won’t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT &amp; XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don’t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage &amp; subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that’s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use ‘em where you don’t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.</span>

<span>I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.<br/><br/>Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.<br/><br/>I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!<br/><br/>Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.</span>

Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<span>I like these little cameras!  Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below).  Real time live video is important to me for various reasons.  For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.<br/><br/>These cameras are small and light.  The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting.  Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.<br/><br/>The app is so-so..  it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked.  For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings.  To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline..  it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead.  I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain.  You have to guess where to look for things.<br/><br/>For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events.  Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.<br/><br/>Speaking of recording events only to your SD card:  SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings.  If you choose "events only" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops.  This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information.  I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook.  The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.<br/><br/>The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events.  It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone.  When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good.  It is slightly better indoors.  I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera.  (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that.  The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).<br/><br/>For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio.  Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced.  As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.<br/><br/>Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons.  This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.<br/>I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all.  You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings.  I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet.  No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.<br/><br/>1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017.  They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years.  They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal).  The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed.  (My network is not the issue.)  It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise.  I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards.  No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.<br/><br/>3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc.  Priced around what wyze cameras cost.  As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house.  Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them.  That feature does work and is actually really nice.  Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.<br/><br/>4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit.  These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point.  The cameras seem really solid and well made.  I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked.  Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay.  For the price, they would have had to be perfect.<br/><br/>5. Eufy Solo  IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more.  I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster.  I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras.  Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion.  Audio quality was really good with these.  But the delay was a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>The End.  I applaud you if you got this far!</span>

<span>I had a dumb motion sensor flood light wired to the corner of my garage that never worked that great, and sometime in the last year the bulbs burned out, and while I was being lazy about replacing them, I started checking into a smarter replacement. There are a number of options that seemed pretty good, but this product from Wyze stood out as being more affordable than a lot of the other options, and I've had good experiences with Wyze products in the past as well. I'm glad I pulled the trigger. The installation was straightforward (fairly intuitive, but good instructions as well as a helpful hanger accessory included in the box to help during the wiring process). The only issue I had was that the unit came with the wire connecting the camera to the unit connected, but not fully plugged in. This was not obvious, and for a while it just looked like I had a DOA camera. It took a few minutes of messing around before I figured that out (the plug is pretty snug, given that it needs to be protected from the elements outside), and once I did it was all good. The coverage of both the motion sensor and camera are really good, video quality is excellent, and the versatility of the product (i.e. you don't have to use their cloud service for this to be a useful product, but they're also actively working on features for that service that make it worthwhile for people) makes me glad I went with this option.</span>

<span>Version 3 of this Wyze indoor/outdoor cam is a bargain.  The high resolution and low-light color sensitivity of the new Sony Starlight imaging chip, which it uses, is amazing.  It is significantly more sensitive than my own vision at dusk and dawn.  The camera nevertheless also has infrared imaging capability, which I do not need for my applications.  These features coupled with a multitude of other features, too many to list, and overall care to design details make this a superb choice at its current price.  There are, however, things to consider that might depend on intended application.  1. The short focal-length lens provides a 130-degree field of view.  This is great for surveillance applications, but it introduces significant barrel distortion.  Although the camera has digital zoom capability, this is at the expense of otherwise great resolution.  A version with a longer focal length lens (narrower field of view) would suit my needs better.  2. The camera is suitable for some outdoor applications but can also shoot through windows (IR imaging off).  The camera has a white body that makes the black window mount, sold separately as an accessory, a must.  It would be nice if Wyze introduces a black version to limit window reflections, as it did for the earlier Version 2 of the camera.  3. You must buy a subscription to the Wyze Cam Plus cloud service, currently as low as $15 per year per camera, to make full use of the many surveillance detection and recording features.  The annual cost is likely to go up and be significant with multiple camera installations.  4. Wyze is developing a web-based browser application, which is currently in beta.  For now it has limited functionality compared to the Android and Apple smartphone applications.  Sadly, you must subscribe to Cam Plus to access even the beta version.  Wyze should definitely make browser access free.  Time will tell how much of a long-term bargain this camera will be.</span>

<span> EDIT: I uploaded a video of the camera's sound quality in action, so if you view the video turn on your sound BUT KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN (initially). No need for bleeding ears.<br/><br/>During the Wyze portions of the video I was sitting roughly 20 feet away and six feet below the camera; There should be no feedback at that distance.<br/><br/>During the iPhone portion (where I filmed the same space as the one the V3 is normally set up to film) I was roughly six feet away and six feet below the camera. The point was to capture the same sounds in the same room.<br/><br/>All the videos were taken very early in the morning, with no traffic or human noise outside, and with what I'd call regular ambient interior noise (the humming of appliances, the running of a computer in the vicinity, etc). No other people were present to make noise inside.<br/><br/>The first portion of the video is the sound that the V3 produces when I am viewing the live feed. It was screen-captured with my iPhone.<br/><br/>The second portion is a comparison demonstrating the sound my iPhone picks up in the same general space, at the same general time, in the exact same conditions, and with the exact same ambient noise in the background as in the first portion; This is not to show how much better the iPhone's mic is than the Wyze (obviously it's better) but to give you an idea as to what noise and sounds were actually present in the room while I was viewing the V3's live feed of the same room, and capturing it with my phone camera.<br/><br/>The third portion is the same space with the same ambient noise, plus conversation from the television that is eight feet from the V3. I chose a scene that sounds a lot like regular conversation, set it to conversation volume, and it has some light score that comes in at the end.<br/><br/>The final portion is what my iPhone picked up in the same space during the same time and conditions, and while playing the exact same scene/conversation on the TV at the same volume as while capturing it on the V3. If you listen VERY carefully you MIGHT be able to pick up a word or two in the V3's video that you can compare to the iPhone's. Maybe. It took me three tries. Hint: listen for the word "Garrett".  Hope the video helps you make a more informed purchasing decision!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Picture is ok. Night vision/low light is very good. Motion detection is spot-on. The camera looks good, design-wise.<br/><br/>Why the one star?<br/><br/>Because that's where the good ends.<br/><br/>The problem is the mic/sound quality is appalling bad. That's such an old, tried-and-true tech I have no idea how they managed to bungle it so much, but managed they did.<br/><br/>Maybe they are using the very cheapest, most absolute garbage quality components on the face of the earth, which sucks, because better components don't cost that much, especially wholesale. They're just squeezing every penny out of profit and selling garbage wrapped up and promoted as quality.<br/><br/>Frustrating.<br/><br/>So, what sound does it pick up?<br/><br/>From what I've read online there are various audio manifestations/issues ranging from nearly no sound at all, all the way to my problem, which is the sound picked up becomes a garbled, distorted, feed-backed  jumble of sometimes jarring noises that maybe sort-of could be interpreted as words (in the case of people taking) but nearly nothing's decipherable by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Pet noises, like barks, meows, growls, etc. are literally non-existent. If it picks it up at all it's just converted to "noise".<br/><br/>All other sound is just as bad. Sometimes there's these random-seeming staticky "bangs" every once in a while. Who knows what that is.<br/><br/>I hate it.<br/><br/>You hear that developers?<br/><br/>I. Hate. This. Camera.<br/><br/>And I wish I didn't because otherwise I like so much about it.<br/><br/>But, alas,  I need sound so I am able to use the function where you talk to someone through the camera and hear them when they respond. I also need to be able to hear what's going on with my pets.<br/><br/>I need to be able to hear when the camera's motion-detection is tripped and the cause of the trip has moved out of the line of the camera but is still out there rustling and bumping around, or otherwise making noise out on my porch and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>If I had children I wouldn't be able to hear them, or speak to them through the camera. or hear when one is crying.<br/><br/>So, be forewarned, if any of the above is one of your needs/goals you probably won't be able to do that with this camera. Buy elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's incredibly stupid they didn't fix this problem before releasing the V3. A lot of people online report the V2 being awful as well, so the developers knew. That means you shouldn't put off buying one for when the next gen comes out (whenever that is). They probably won't fix it.<br/><br/>The worst part, I think, is it doesn't support the use of an external mic, which would be such an easy solve. There's no input port and the simple hardware and software to support that, and that really is stupid AF. If it did allow the connecting of an external mic all I'd have to do is plug one in and I would have the sound I need. At least then I wouldn't be writing this scathing review. It would be a win-win for everyone!<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>Finally, apparently contacting customer support is a total waste of time, and the people you talk to (bless their hearts, it isn't really their fault) have no tech experience or understanding whatsoever of how these things work. I don't know about you, but I find that exhausting. If one were to spend the time necessary to troubleshoot all the garbage products we wind up with one would never have time to do anything else, and even with that effort 95% of the time it results in no improvement, and no resolution. I'm tired of it. Just make a solid product, and when something goes wrong, replace it or refund the money, don't make anyone jump through hoops.<br/><br/>Finally, fix the issue, fast. And don't repeat it in the next iteration.<br/><br/>Long and the short of it is I need a camera with a functioning mic and/or that has an input for an external mic. The end. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even at the price-point these cameras are at.<br/><br/>I regret buying these, as now they're going to be tossed after I buy another brand (according to message boards even cheapo Chinese no-name brands have a better mic than these things!). What a waste of time, money, and resources.</span>

<span>I think that it should be known that you can no longer remove your background without using a green screen. I tried when I initially got the camera and was disappointed. Other than that, it is a really good camera. Definitely an upgrade from the cheap one I used to use to stream.</span>

<span>Reason for purchasing. I purchased this product for improving the picture quality of my Zoom conferencing and other things like that.<br/><br/>Did I achieve the result?  It does improve upon what I had previously, but I cannot see the 4K quality. Probably Zoom does not allow that (I tried it on a Super HD display!). Let's say that quality is fine, but not as good as I expected though.<br/><br/>Viewing angles: 3 different viewing angles (68 degrees, 75 and 90 i believe) provide a good amount of customization although for teleconferencing using a virtual background, I find the 68 the most suitable. If there were more people participating from the same location 90 is definitely the choice. Good option to have, not extremely relevant for a home office though.<br/><br/>Autofocus does its job and via the G-Hub it is easy to center myself inside the camera.  However, without the G-Hub, I would not know how to do it.  I am sure that there is a way. Autofocus can be replaced by manual settings, but when I tried I did not improve upon the autofocus.<br/><br/>Instruction manual is miserable, but I downloaded one from internet. Not too useful either. At least the schematics on how to install it are very clear and it is actually quite easy as written earlier.<br/><br/>Installation was super easy and it was working within 60 seconds from opening the box. I do have the Logitech G-Hub, as I have also a Yeti Nano microphone and thus the Brio camera appeared immediately on the Hub. To be fair, on a second computer, without G-Hub, I can start Zoom and Zoom gives me the option to select this webcam, but without it, I am not sure where to look for it as no software was installed. As you can see in the picture I attached, the webcam is discrete and it is easy to put and keep in place (I tried it on several laptops and display) I was even able to put it on top of my large speakers while testing with the camera from below my height.<br/><br/>Overall, I am fine with this webcam, everything seems to be in order and definitely it improved my situation, but I was expecting (maybe I had erroneous expectations) a tad higher quality of camera as I see many streamers reaching very nice qualities. Definitely better than mine. The quality is not professional grade, not at the top standards at least.</span>

<span>Omg!  I’ve been looking for a cam that does zoom in for YEARS! This cam has it!!<br/>Most cams are made for 17 year old girls who record vids on their laptop for social media.  Their laptop is 12 inches away from their face.  Most cams DO NOT take into account that you are using the cam in a business setting.  My camera (and monitor) are 24" away from my face, so until this point, having the camera zoom would have been quite helpful.  3 settings fit all biz needs.  Up to 3 persons in shot, 10 persons, 25 persons, which is 90%, 78%, and 65% respectively.  GENIUS settings!!<br/><br/>For this feature:  i give it 5+++ stars!  Well done!<br/><br/>Every time they launch a new iPhone, they always talk about what a great camera they came out with.  Again, there is NO ZOOM feature.  The phone is built for a 6' tall man's arm length (taking a selfie).  If you don't have that arm length, your shot is not ideal.<br/><br/>I upload a pic on Fb frequently.  Again, to replace profile pic, there is no Zoom in, only Zoom out.  If you Zoom out, your face will no longer be in the picture.  Stupid.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Skin tones weren’t good, but because of another photo app I use, I figured maybe there is an app that I can make further corrections.  My face was pink and my arms were orange.  This won't happen to you as the built-in color correction will likely work 95% of the time.  It didn't work for me as I am brown-skinned.<br/><br/>I called LogiTech to ask if they had an app.  Yes!  Success. Got that solved, too!  (It's called Contrast and Saturation).<br/><br/>All around great camera, I would give it more stars if I could.  Oh, and my friend told me to tell you, you DON'T have to wear makeup.  Full skin correction happens!</span>

<span>This WebCam has very good camera quality. You can adjust the video software that you are using to video chat to change how you appear on the camera as well, but I wish the camera was easier to manipulate in settings for low lights and a lot of light settings. The other issue I had with it is the material used to manufacture this product is cheap plastic. The privacy cover broke when I was trying to put it on/it is supposed to bend. They go up and down but it snapped right in half after adjusting it twice. That should not have happened because even the adjustable camera goes up and down and that did not break. However, the WebCam itself is hard to adjust to where you want it because of how tight the cheap plastic is that you have to move to adjust its position. Most monitors are flat nowadays, and I have a really flat monitor. This WebCam does not attach to the back of your monitor with the pad that is on the bottom of the adjustable arm like it is supposed to. That is because of my monitor being too flat, of should not be a problem either.</span>

<span>This camera sat wonderfully atop my vintage Apple Display thanks to a well-designed mount. It worked perfectly with Teams and Zoom. The privacy door comes with it but you must attach it yourself; it worked flawlessly. This is a real bargain, but I had to return mine, because I was so small in the image that it would not have been professional. (For reference, in order to fill the frame, my face needed to be 9" away.) As the lens is fixed focal length, it becomes the responsibility of software to choose a portion of the image to stream to others in the conversation, yet conferencing software lacks this feature (as of Aug 2022). So I reluctantly returned my eMeet C960 for a more expensive camera with built-in zoom. eMeet has a good product, and I hope others are able to take advantage of its great price and excellent features.</span>

I wanted a camera I can put on the tripod and place it in FRONT of the screen so they feel I am speaking to them, not looking in a strange direction.<br/><br/>I have tried a few cameras, including that built into my Mac, but I always got a bad view angle.<br/><br/>This camera allows me to place it on a small tripod and in front of the screen so I look at the people I am speaking to and straight into the camera lens.<br/>However, the camera, being 1.5 feet in front of my face, shows the whole room which for working from home makes little sense.<br/><br/>In addition, the camera, compared to others, shows the skin tones which less than flattering.</span>

<span>I own 5 Ring indoor cams, along with a Ring Elite doorbell and a stick up elite POE cam.  This is just my input regarding these cams as I have been testing them and using them for quite sometime.  First thing is not every indoor cam works the same, some arrive with older firmware and need updating.  Plug in close to your router and do the full set up and do your updates.  Once you add the cam to the app and it’s working well, unplug it and move it to the area you want to monitor.  Do your set up either by mounting it or setting it on a shelf.  Get the angle of view your looking for and then set up your motion zone and sensitivity.  Make sure you check the “health” box to see your signal sensitivity.  If you are using a mesh router network, you should reconnect to the closest link for it, if not you may have to reconfigure to the nearest of it isn’t automatic.  Make sure you turn on the snapshot option as well.  If you don’t want to have the indoor cams record or send alerts while your home, you can turn that ability on and off with the new quick access buttons in the app.  You will get 30 days of free recording for ALL your cams, with each cam you buy. So if you decide to buy one a month, till you cover all your angles in the home, you will literally get an additional 30 days for every cam on your network covering the 50 days of cloud storage for free.  Why not use this option while it’s still available.  After you cover your needs, opt for the yearly service.  I have 5 indoors cams, covering almost 4000 sf.  I love that I can drop in and watch over the home as well as hear and talk through the cams.  Night vision in a room is great too. Makes a great baby cam as well.  I have had 2 indoor cams give me problems in the past, either dropping off my network, or the snapshot option not working.  If you have read my ring reviews before, I am well versed in networking and I have found that some ring reps want to always point the finger at every else but their devices.  I can say I have found problems in a couple of their devices and once they were replaced, the problem was solved.  Don’t allow them to drive you insane, the community forums are good but they only can go so far for help as well.  Sometimes a quick swap of the unit with a new one solves the problem.  Amazon has always backed me and they are truly behind their customers.<br/><br/>4/2020:  I wanted to be able to watch the main entrance and hallway in my home, have an eye level view, no wires at all showing, and nothing that stood out of place.  So review the attached pics, maybe this install will gravitate people who are inclined to custom installs, know there is no limit to what you can do.  Just plan out your work and never rush.  I was able to recess an indoor cam into my wall, and still provide me with all the aforementioned needs.  I used a double electrical box as it provided me the necessary room without modifying the box.  I used an indoor/outdoor ring power supply and reused the indoor cam plug on the power supply as it fits perfect and locks in.  I obtained 120v power from a nearby electrical outlet, and brought my wire into the box from behind the wall.  I mounted the ring power supply on the back of the electrical box, and prepped the box to accept the camera.  I created a clear acrylic template and was able to use that to cut out the blank wall plate.  What’s really nice is I can still unscrew the wall plate and easily remove the cam if I need to do a reset or adjustment.  This solved many issues for me and still provided an eye level video shot of persons entering the front door.  Since the ceilings are 12’ high, mounting the cam at the ceiling with a downward angle wasn’t conducive in getting a good facial shot.  This is just one example of several I have designed myself to combat issues most of us have dealing with wires, angles, placement, etc.<br/><br/>11.21.20:  After almost a year of Ring use, I have to say I am disappointed in the Ring community forum, their tech support, and products.  Just recently, I had two of the ID cams drop offline.  No matter what I did, no luck getting them back to work.  I actually unplugged a back up ID can and went to move it, that one also dropped offline and never came back up.  Tech support was of no help, and the community forum mod just tells you to call in.<br/><br/>I would think using 10 ring cameras, I know a little about them.  Based on my research, they connect to WiFi, but can’t get to the internet.  It appears that there is a high probability that my ISP is blocking the camera for possible threats, even though I turned off my firewall, set up a DMZ zone, and just about created a WiFi bridge to push the Ring cameras too, they still won’t work.  They don’t play nice since the last firmware update.  So as they fail, I am replacing them with another company.  Honestly, I don’t care what brand I use, as long as it works.  Read the community forums, and see for yourself.  Setting up cameras is not really that difficult, troubleshooting isn’t either as long as you have full control of all devices.  Ring doesn’t allow for device control outside of normal settings.  Also, Ring devices CAN NOT, be wiped clear of stored memory setting for your home network.  It’s embedded in the device.  Even if you remove it from your home network, and sell it.  It still has your network mirrored in its memory.  Found this by pure chance.  At the very lease you should have the cams IP address to clear out stored info and reset it.  Wow</span>

<span>My husband and I relocated to Michigan this past spring and it didn’t take long to realize that my I Phone11 camera was woefully  inadequate when it came to capturing the beauty of the Upper Peninsula! I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!<br/>There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers! It was worth every penny!</span>

<span>This camera is a great starter camera. I used it as my starter and it is amazing. The focus, 4K shots, nightime view, quality, and zoom is amazing if you're starting out.

<span>This camera is my first camera ever (other then my phone). To say I’m absolutely in love with this camera is a under statement. Ever photo I’ve taken so far has came out crystal clear! The little things around my house including my kitten that with a phone doesn’t pop much absolutely come to life! I bawled when my camera came in. I have been scraping up every penny to be able to save up for this camera and I’m so happy I did. One thing I do wish it came with was a lense protecter. I have seen mentions of uv lense protecters that are supposed to be absolutely wonderful. If you do get this camera save a little extra to get one. Once I can save up I’m getting me one. It is a super easy camera to learn especially for beginners. It is not heavy at all, which comes in handy for if you are doing long photo shoots. Another thing I wish it came with was a camera cleaner. Or things that told you what was safe to clean the camera with. Obviously not water but are glasses cleaners safe? Or is there a specific camera cleaner? Not sure but other then that I’m beyond happy!</span>

<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.<br/>4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.<br/>Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.<br/>Cons:<br/>Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no "action" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.<br/>No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.<br/>Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode)<br/>My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only "A", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.</span>

<span>Bought this for our granddaughter as her first non-iphone camera.  She is thrilled with it so far.  It has a fully automatic program mode that allowed her to begin shooting good looking photos immediately.  She loves horses and has been using the camera to take photos and videos.  Yet the camera has many advanced features like a serious telephoto zoom, full manual, aperture preferred, shutter preferred modes, and much more.

The battery lasts pretty much all day, it's pretty easy to navigate without instructions, and it's nice and compact. Love this camera!</span>

<span>Since my iPhone can take better pictures than most professional cameras, I wanted one that would give me the Zoom that I cannot get with the iPhone<br/><br/>This camera is great for macro, wildlife, and other although you will need to learn its features and tricks to get the best out of it<br/><br/>The sensor is small although you get a nice smaller size than a professional one in exchange with a very nice price for the Zoom optics<br/><br/>This camera is a great compromise that offers good price, great zoom, OK quality and battery<br/><br/>If you want a professional camera with all bells and whistles and great flexibility, there are better options are a higher price</span>

<span>Was cautious about this camera because of the price, but I can tell you I was surprised as to the simple set up and the operation of this camera.  The directions are straight forward and the instalation and set up of the camera qas done in about 5 minutes.  I use it to check on my pets at home.  Experimented with the motion alert and was able to adjust the sensitivity enough that it detected my cat walking across the room.  Definitely would have no issues with detecting a child or adult moving around.  Using the on screen pan and tilt controls on my android phone works great.  Slight delay but works very well to pan across the room.  The night vision is very good.  In a completely dark room, the camera is able to show great details within the room.  Over all I am impressed with this camera and all its capabilities.  I plan on ordering two more for my house.</span>

<span>This a review about the outstanding customer service from Wansview. I did purchase this camera a couple of years ago and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. This is about an older model that I got from my daughter, the Q3S indoor camera. I couldn't get it to pair with the app so I contacted Wansview thru email at their site. Next day the communication started. The detailed but easy to understand steps to fix the situation was very impressive. I ended up sending them a photo of the label on the bottom of the camera, next day they sent me the fix. Older camera needed an older app. The app I was using was for this camera above which is newer and uses the cloud camera app. They sent me the link and I downloaded the older app and bingo! the camera was online like it was new. This kind of C.S. is what we should expect from any company. Two thumbs up  to Jessie and Monica at Wansview who help me solve this problem, thanks again .</span>

<span>This is great camera for those locations where you need active monitoring.  I carry a couple with me as I travel to use at a location doesn't need a full blown camera security system, but just a way to remotely monitor an area or employees.  For that these cameras are great.  Setup can be done in about 5 minutes, and the ability to remotely move the field of vision is a great feature on such an inexpensive web camera.  Picture quality is also great, and the night vision works well too.  I which the desktop software worked better and was easier to use, as I would rather store my video locally than in the cloud.  Overall though if you need a quick and cheap monitoring solution, this is it.</span>

<span>So I got this camera to monitor a stray with a severely fractured pelvis that I am fostering. It’s in a 30” kennel mounted in the top corner that’s covered by a sheet often. It’s always what we be considered “low light” so probably the least ideal conditions and I still love it. I have not one ounce of regret. Could it be better? Sure, but I have a feeling most of my cons are addressed in the higher tier items so I’m not complaining at all.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1 it just works! I didn’t have to fuss and fight with it, didn’t really even read the manual aside from what app to download. I had to try a few times to scan the QR code on my phone, it still only took 3 or 4 minutes.<br/>2 the clarity of the picture in normal &amp; IR mode. It’s gives a nice defined image from close like I have it or across my apartment like when setting it up. it will work great when he’s all healed to maybe catch some fun cat antics in my apartment.<br/>3 on that point the connectivity on the wifi and cellular is fantastic!!! I haven’t had a single issue with it not connecting or behaving improperly once connected. It even warns on cellular that it may use alot of data. Take notes Wyze I think I could go on vacation and actually connect to this camera, I have been converted!<br/>4 It is great in low light, especially if you use the IR light in pitch black situations! I don’t because although the internet says cats can’t see infrared light my kitten disagrees when he tries to hide from the camera when I turn the IR on.<br/>5 the included mounting stuff works great. I may have made a frankenstein out of it now, but once it’s not in the cage that hardware will work great.<br/>6 it does well at all the normal camera stuff it should like adjusting focus, adjusting lighting, moving without binding, taking pictures and videos from the app, reviewing footage… all the normal stuff.<br/><br/>Cons, they are slight and if I used it like a normal camera all but one wouldn’t be an issue.<br/>1 when you move the camera with the app the camera itself can make a very slight sound. Through the app, it’s a pretty loud sound. It wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t 16 inches or less from a hurt/scared kitty… it doesn’t surprise him after 2 days but he notices. Again it’s really barely noticeable.<br/>2 it sometimes makes a slight “clickity clack” when adjusting the focus when say I reach my hand in the cage. This might not be a thing if mounted more than 2 feet from something. It also may be switching to the non IR night vision (B&amp;W). Again not real loud unless you’re right there, still not a problem.<br/>3 this one is the app, but again it’s probably because of the small kennel it’s in. I wish the motion detection could be less sensitive than it can currently be. Again when 1/3 of the image moves there’s not much you can do.<br/>4 this one isn’t specific to my situation, but I just wish the degrees of rotation for every camera movement up or down/side to side wasn’t so drastic. Not a complaint as the slightly higher priced offerings from WansView probably have finer rotation, I’m just cheap 😁<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a great camera! I will recommend it to anyone that wants a camera to monitor something whether that’s property, pets, people, nature or the inside of a small kennel. It’s just great. Not just good for the price just good. 10/10 I would buy again</span>
