                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The only deficit to this camera is the focus.  Although it functions well, it is noticable slower than a professional, much more expensive camera.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, you can't beat this camera for everyday use.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The audio works great, and the camera is good quality. However it has a very wide angle that I haven’t been able to adjust. The auto focus is also difficult to adjust when there is a window behind.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This camera sat wonderfully atop my vintage Apple Display thanks to a well-designed mount. It worked perfectly with Teams and Zoom. The privacy door comes with it but you must attach it yourself; it worked flawlessly. This is a real bargain, but I had to return mine, because I was so small in the image that it would not have been professional. (For reference, in order to fill the frame, my face needed to be 9" away.) As the lens is fixed focal length, it becomes the responsibility of software to choose a portion of the image to stream to others in the conversation, yet conferencing software lacks this feature (as of Aug 2022). So I reluctantly returned my eMeet C960 for a more expensive camera with built-in zoom. eMeet has a good product, and I hope others are able to take advantage of its great price and excellent features.</span>

<span>With my eMeet webcam, I look really far away, entered in a very wide-angle shot (no, people don't need to see that much of my house or whatever background I choose!). Even if I move the camera 8 inches away from my face, I still don't take up much of the screen. No one else I communicate with looks this far away when we're talking. I don't get it -- especially since I see screenshots in the reviews from people who fill their screens like you'd expect to with a webcam, and because my husband has the same camera, bought a year earlier, and he looks normally sized on screen. Another reviewer said the camera fine if you want a wide view of a conference room or want to show several people at a table. But for one person, I just look goofy. The camera is plug-and-play and easy to use, but since you can't adjust how tiny you look on screen, it's just a no-go for me. I'm going to buy something different.</span>

<span>Gotta love something that "just works" in Linux. Didn't need to install any additional drivers, and the camera and microphone work great.<br/><br/>The microphone seems to be pretty good about noise cancellation; the people I have video calls with haven't reported hearing any echo from my speakers.<br/><br/>The only reason for four stars instead of five is that the profile is a bit large, at just over a centimeter (see the picture). Thankfully in GNOME 3 there's a top taskbar by default, so the camera doesn't cover anything important. But if your monitor has small bezels and you're using Windows or a desktop environment that has no top taskbar, you might need to put some sort of spacer under the webcam to lift it up away from your monitor a bit.</span>

<span>Functionality/Ease of Use: I can say that getting this webcam up and running was pretty seamless.  I happen to use a Macbook Pro and after plugging in the webcam it was immediately found and able to be used.  The quality of the video is pretty much on par with other top consumer brand webcams.  In comparison, the Logitech 920 is of equal quality in video.  The angle of the lens is large enough while only being about 2 ft from the camera itself.  Can't ask for anything better there.  The sound quality of the microphone is what I would consider expected.  Not the quality of a dedicated microphone with noise cancellation or filters but definitely good enough to get the job done.  The light indicator that shows the camera is active is REALLY a nice touch because it is obvious enough to get your attention and inform you that the camera is active.  I really can't complain in any way.  For the price, this is a great value buy with top of the line video quality.<br/><br/>Design/Hardware/Practicality: I really love the design.  Simple and sleek enough that the webcam doesn't overwhelm you when looking at your screen.  Some webcams on the market are just too bulky and can be a distraction.  The nice addon of the protection lid is a nice to have and having it be a part of the packaging and giving the user the option of installing with the provided sticker is a nice touch.  I've seen other consumer brand webcams have a giant price inflation just to have the lid.  That is absurd and I am glad Amcrest makes this feature/addon a simple part of the product with no price increase.  Privacy should be a top concern, not a money maker.  So kudos to Amcrest on that.  Installation from a hardware standpoint is pretty easy.  The design allows for either the install mount on top of a monitor or by use of the included tripod which was a pleasant surprise!  I happen to like the use of the tripod on my desk as it gives me a better angle that I like for the video that I am in.  The tripod works well although it would have been key to use a gorilla type of tripod mount instead of the wire bend type.  I can't complain honestly as it works well.  Just maybe a per user preference to use a more adjustable set tripod legs.  But for the price, you absolutely cannot be this tripod inclusion.<br/><br/>Overall: I love this webcam and honestly during this hard time during the pandemic when a majority of all webcams are out of stock, this particular webcam not only cam in handy but I am SO glad I was able to test this webcam out and put it to good use.  I have used this webcam with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, Slack, and more.<br/><br/>I have already begun promoting this webcam to my colleagues as well as friends and family members.  For the price, quality, ease of use, this is by far the best webcam I have used.<br/><br/>Note: One really nice touch that maybe could be added in a future revision would be the inclusion of adding RTSP as an option.  I could use this for when I am away and want to monitor the office by using this webcam. There is software to do this via the computer you are using but would be really nice to have this a part of the webcam natively.  This may be a hardware limitation and would require an upgrade and price increase but if there was a version that supported this feature, I would upgrade.</span>

<span>I've been using this camera off and on for several months now. To provide a little background, I work remotely and attend roughly 4 hours of virtual meetings per day via Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.  For points of comparison, I work off of a Dell Precision 3551 with a built-in webcam and, when docked, I generally use a Logitech 1080p Pro Stream.<br/><br/>Field-of-View: The Amcrest has a very wide viewing angle compared to all my other cameras.  I would say that is both it's best and it's worst feature depending on what you're looking for.  For my job, I need the camera to sit atop my monitor and look at my face\upper torso.  The Amcrest's wide angle is a little wide for this use-case, which ends up giving a very slight fish-eye effect at the outer edges that could be avoided with a narrower angle.  It also shows more of my home office's room than I'd like colleagues to see.  That being said, there are other use cases where the very wide angle lens has been extremely handy. During the lockdown we hosted a couple family events via Zoom and pointed the camera at the entire room of people, which was extremely nice compared to the narrower field-of-view of my Logitech which could not see the whole room.<br/><br/>Image Quality: Compared to other 1080p Amcrest products that I own, I feel the resolution is a bit softer.  It's also softer than the Logitech, but still quite a bit sharper than the laptop's built-in webcam.  The white balance is a bit cooler and the tint tends to lean enough towards green that I immediately noticed it, but only I think because I was specifically watching for it. The dynamic range is a bit lower than my Logitech and the detail in my dark hair tends to get crushed in shadow while my light skin softens and washes out.<br/><br/>Microphone: The microphone is usable.  I would say that it may actually be better than the Logitech's built-in mic (which is also usable).  That being said, I would only recommend it for general business\personal type use and certainly not for hosting a webinar, or recording any music.<br/><br/>Software: The Amcrest (as far as I can tell) does not offer any software for image adjustments while the Logitech does.  Some apps, like Zoom, have image adjustment features baked directly into the app that allow you to correct things like the tint, contrast and exposure, which is great since those were things I didn't love about this cam.  However, many other apps (at least at time of writing this review) do not offer these adjustments. In these cases, the Logitech has a companion software that allows you to tweak aspects of the image while the Amcrest does not.<br/><br/>I feel that my review has pointed out a lot of little details that aren't quite perfect, and while I stand by that, there are very few webcams that I would consider to have very high image\audio quality at the sub fifty dollar price point.  In fact, the Logitech I daily drive and my main point of comparison costs between double and triple what this one costs and is certainly not double or triple the quality.<br/><br/>I consider this a great value camera for the money and would still recommend it.  Especially if you use a software like Zoom that allows you to tweak a couple aspects of the image or if you like the very wide angle lens.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera a little over two weeks ago. I have not needed a webcam in years as we primarily use our phones and laptops for such things. With the quarantine situation we had to figure something out with Zoom and school activities. We needed something for the kids that was better than a laptop. We have four kids in Karate. The school they attend has moved to virtual sessions. This webcam was a perfect addition to the situation. I have this mounted on top the TV. The cord is more than long enough to reach the laptop we setup below. The laptop is just the vehicle to attend the sessions. The fact that I can have this camera w/microphone sit on top the TV (set up as a second display for the laptop) makes the kids feel like they are right in class again.<br/><br/>The wide-angle lens is perfect to capturing the entire room. With four kids they need to spread out a bit. This room is approximately 15’x14’ with the TV sitting in the corner (photo attached). This photo was a screen capture of a QuickTime video that was shot with the regular house lighting. We typically move the couch out and the camera can pick up the entire room. We also use the microphone on the camera. It works fine with no complaints from the instructor on the other end. Before using it for this purpose I called someone from my computer on Google Duos and tested both the image quality and the microphone. It worked great.<br/><br/>I have read two primary complaints about this camera in my research to ordering it.<br/><br/>The first one is the color can look washed out. This is a simple webcam. You should not be expecting to shoot super high-quality video on this. As the camera describes, it 1080p quality. You could achieve the optimal results with proper lighting behind the camera and other professional equipment and proper positioning. Not sure why anyone would expect professional grade quality from a webcam. You should care about a good quality image and dynamic functionality in how it handles light. This camera does great in low light situations. The two light bars on the side really help with assisting where light is a problem. I have no issues at all with the quality of the image it produces. It more than meets my needs.<br/><br/>The other issue I read about was the microphone. Again, this is a webcam; people should not be expecting to record high quality audio with it. The quality is fine for general use. The people on the end can hear you with no complaints. A bit of a tip; the cameras functionality is driven by the software that is using it. Sometimes the default for the mic is set too low. You need to test this and adjust this up. I had to do this for both Duos and Facetime. Once I adjusted the mic up to regular levels, there was no issue. I suspect people are overlooking this.<br/><br/>This camera is literally plug and play into everything. I used it on both a Mac and PC. It also worked great on my Hackintosh. I have used it with Facetime, Google Duos, Zoom, Quick-time and several others. Every device picked it right up and each application allowed me to jump right into selecting the video and mic. In all applications I could have just used the camera for video and selected a different source for the microphone. This is super easy to get right to work using it.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the camera has no swivel on its base. It makes it difficult to do micro adjustments to the right or left. This would be a little useful for the Karate class we use it for. It is not a deal breaker though.<br/>I have many Amcrest products and they never disappoint. Their products are simple enough for non-tech people to use. They are also flexible for people like me who like to explore and push the limits of devices.<br/><br/>This camera is one I would recommend to anyone who wants a quality well built webcam without having to spend a lot of money. It easy to use and you will be up and running in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>• Good video quality in low light<br/>• Wide angle lens for capturing more of a room if necessary<br/>• Awesomely long USB cord<br/>• Adjustable fitment to accommodate monitor and TV thicknesses (my TV is a bit thicker)<br/>• Good microphone (adjust your mic settings)<br/>• Comes with a nice little tripod<br/>• Dust cover for the lens<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>• No swivel movement on the base</span>

<span>This is a review of the 1080p Amcrest webcam. Lots of people are working from home due to the COVID pandemic, so I thought a webcam review would be review.<br/><br/>I currently use a 2017 MacBook Pro with TouchBar and the Amcrest camera will be compared against the MacBook Pro’s 720p FaceTime HD Camera.<br/><br/>Step Up:<br/><br/>Opening: This was deliver well packaged with not damage to the item, and unboxing it was easy. I appreciate that Amcrest includes a camera cover. The cover is attached with adhesive to the front face of the camera, and clicks open and close. Since I use a dock (CalDigit TS3 Plus, and it’s on a laptop, I found it easier just to unplug the webcam at night or when I’m not using for that extra peace of mind.<br/><br/>Mounting: Mounting it was very easy and if you’ve ever used a Logitech Webcam, it will be the same. If you havent, the quick set up instructions are informative and it takes 30 seconds total to finish attaching it to your monitor.<br/><br/>Plug and Play: I plugged in the Amcrest webcam to my dock’s USB A port. You should note, that this is a USB A product so if you have an Apple laptop after 2016 you will need a USB C to A adapter for this or to use a dock with your laptop. Nothing popped up on the screen after plugging in the webcam so I wasn’t sure if the driver installed correctly or not. Usually, Window’s computers have a notification pop up, letting you know the device was recognized.<br/><br/>I opened the Apple FaceTime app and was still puzzled why it used my laptop’s built in webcam instead of the Amcrest webcam. I finally figured out that you have to go to the menu bar up top, click “video” and then go down the list and select the Amcrest HD webcam.<br/><br/>Similarly, when using Google Meet or another online conferencing service, I had to click into the settings, and change the camera being used. Every time I joined a new conference, it would default to the built in webcam. I’m not sure if there’s a way on the OS X to change that, but it isn’t a big issue.<br/><br/>Quality: The 1080p image quality is a noticeable improvement from the now-outdated 720p camera that Apple supplies on all its iMacs and laptops. However, on the Amcrest, the colors seemed washed out. It appears that the camera does some sort of image softening. I would hazard a guess it’s to make wrinkles and other things less subtle on faces, but I was not a huge fan of it. Also, the image color scheme was odd… my skin color ended up being a few shades lighter and the room had a blue-ash tint to it. Parts of my face were literally glowing, which, may be nice for YouTube production videos, but I think I would find it a bit unusual on work conference calls.<br/><br/>Overall: I would say this is a good quality webcam. My receding hairline is much more obvious on this camera than on my laptop’s built in webcam, ha! When the image popped up my first reaction was “oh god.” I like that with a dedicated webcam, the image is higher up than a laptop’s built in webcam, so the video angle looks more natural as if you were talking to a colleague in person.<br/><br/>The quality of the camera itself is good — I can see the seams on my shirt or details on the wall more clearly than with the laptop’s built in 720p webcam. Unfortunately, I found the image softening and the washed out color a bit unusual. I do look “better” with fewer wrinkles, but I also would rather look natural on video conference calls. You may have a difference preference and enjoy this feature. It does not seem like there’s an option to turn it on or off.<br/><br/>All in all, it’s a very affordable webcam, but I had to remove 1 star because of the image softening and the odd color scheme which makes me a few shades lighter and isn’t realistic.</span>

<span>This camera was getting tons of great reviews on Youtube....I was Between this and the Cannon M50.  All the reviews I saw spoke highly of the mic...most certainly the onboard mic is not "shotgun mic" quality. Upon first use I knew I couldn't use the onboard mic, brings to mind a song lyric "oh..am I sitting in a tin can, far above the world"<br/> The mic was one of the appeals of this lightweight point and shoot vlogger friendly camera. Image stabilization is probably a 7 out of 10. Sony video quality goes without saying.  So all and all a good vlogging/point and shoot camera. Plan to get an external mic...but a small inexpensive shotgun mic will get the job done. I use Comica CVM Compact.<br/>Battery life is a real issue here..so I bought the optional bluetooth mini tripod and I used this for filming and vlogging, don't expect much over 25 mins out of a battery if you're filming...and the battery door/SD card door cannot be opened from the side...so you have to remove the tripod or quick mount every time you change to a new battery or remove/install full size SD card.  This is simply a hassle for the user.  I'm replacing my Sony AX33...for now I'd rather have the heavy video camera with longer battery life and better image stabilization.  All and all it's still a good point and shoot...just lacks in the engineering for easy removal of battery and SD card.  Nobody wants to plug in their camera to charge it....especially if it won't last 30 mins during video use. You need to buy additional batteries and a charger...but they're pretty inexpensive.  I'd buy it over a Cannon 80D any day of the week if that tells ya anything.<br/>Overall it's light, very easy to use, great picture and video quality, decent image stabilization once you learn the camera, battery life is lacking and the mic might be ok for an entry level vlogger....always remember..viewers will forgive bad video...but bad audio will not be tolerated and your watch time will show it.<br/>Hope this helps you in your purchase decision. I will buy again if this one gets damaged. It's as light as a feather!</span>

<span>Great point and shoot camera works very well and for the money.  I picked this because I didn't need a camera with interchangeable lenses and it's worked out great.  I think eventually once I up my photography skills your feet skills I will buy a better camera camera that has interchangeable lenses lenses but since the lenses cost as much or more than the camera oftentimes this is a great place to start for vlogging  And creating content which is the reason I bought it.  The really amazing thing is it is so small I can stick it in my front pocket and carry around with me at all times.</span>

<span>This is not the camera for you if you are vlogging. This raggy camera ALWAYS shuts off saying the camera is hot. You barely get 20 mins out of this camera.  Pain in the butt. Just get something better so you won't have to wait around!</span>

<span>This camera has a traditional USB cable, but apparently, you can't use it with USB 3.0 nor can you use it with a docking station. My Dell precision only has USB 3.0 and I use a Dell docking station with dual monitors when I'm home. The docking station only features either USB-C or USB 3.0 ports. This setup was fine when I first bought it. I go to use it a second time a few months later and all I get is a black screen. I plugged it into a 10 year old desktop with USB 2.0 and it fired right up. Sounds like Logitech is cutting corners with cheap hardware and falling behind the tech curve. They should be embarrassed.<br/><br/>Tried update drivers, uninstall and reinstall software... even restarted my computer. Nothing helped. Return window has closed with the Amazon order. Logitech support sucks. Tried to chat with them and "due to unusually high demand" they said they'd get back to me via email, so now I'm engaged in what I'm sure will be an endless back and forth that will likely go nowhere. My only hope is that they'll swap this out for a product that isn't obsolete.</span>

<span>Good camera, used for talking with our Deaf brother. Sharp image. We disabled auto-focus because when we Sign the focus constantly tries to focus on our  hands, which doesn't work. It blurs in and out repeatedly. We used manual focus and it worked well.<br/><br/>Took forever to ship, though. It's becoming a problem. We order a scanner, camera, hard drives, etc., and it takes a week or two to even ship, then several days to arrive.What's the use of spending $100/year on prime if everything takes two weeks to get to our house?!</span>

<span>The picture and mic quality are very good especially considering how inexpensive the webcam was. There is ample cable, and it's nice that it gets power from the USB so only 1 cord needed. It comes with a privacy flap with adhesive that you can attach, or you can leave it off if you don't need it. There is a tripod screwhole, and the counterweight folds in different ways so that you can use it standalone on your desk, too, if you don't want to hang it off your monitor. The only downside that I've seen so far is the picture starts to get grainy in low light, but it hasn't been an issue for me. This camera is perfect for what I needed.</span>

<span>I bought the Meeting Owl to replace a ceiling mounted PTZ camera that was 10 years old.  I had originally bought the Logitech Rally 4k.  The picture quality on this camera was amazing, but alas it did not rotate 360 degrees only 180 and the PTZ feature was super slow.  So, I opted for the Meeting Owl Pro at $1000...$300 cheaper than the Rally FYI.  Still a $1000.  First the pros, the tech in the Owl is amazing.  It splits three ways for those in the conference room and projects it through Zoom or other platforms.  If two people are conversing in the room, it will split those two for remote participants and makes for an amazing conference experience.  I can't say much about the sound, it seems fine, but we use the Clearone Chat 150s and they are hard to beat.  Some people said that the Owl Features will not work if you don't use the sound, but not true.  The Owl is always listening, and the VC platform will use whatever other mic/speaker combo that you have.  Now the bad...the video quality is very poor (potato poor) we worked with Owl Tech support, sent them a screen shot and they said, "What you are seeing is the quality of the Owl."  I just don't understand.  Owl should partner with GoPro for help improving picture quality.  All that said, I think I will keep the Owl although it pains me.  The quality is similar or a little worse than my 10-year-old PTZ, but you can't deny the features of Owl.  If they could improve quality to deliver crisp clear video this would be the perfect conference room camera.  I just don't see how they can advertise 1080p.</span>

<span>(Amazon asks me to rate this on sheerness and thickness, as if it's pantyhose. ;-) )<br/><br/>The Owl is still the category leader for it's niche, which is flexible group meetings of 3 or more persons spread out in an arc over 120 degrees. I acquired the original Owl when it was new, and looked forward to this improved Owl Pro. I use the Owl in several scenarios:<br/><br/>1. Large group informal meetings where there are as many as 50 people scattered all around, sometimes in a full 360 degrees in an open office;<br/><br/>2. Formal conference room setting where the default option would be a camera at the end of the conference room which creates a "tunnel" effect that does not balance the participants well (we have used Cisco and Polycom systems);<br/><br/>3. Very small conference rooms where regular cameras cannot fit the entire room without severe fish-eye lensing; and<br/><br/>4. Ad hoc situations such as a meeting around a dining table in a restaurant or a coffee table in a hotel room, recently for a socially-distanced virtual birthday which one family around a dinner table.<br/><br/>Its positional flexibility is unique.<br/><br/>So why not five stars?<br/><br/>Simply because they have not improved the device nearly as much as I would have expected especially given the $1000 price point. The flaws in the original Owl were well documented by users in many forums including here on Amazon, and given the premium price I would expect more improvements.<br/><br/>a) The user interface lacks customizability, for example to i) remove or change size and position of the panorama, ii) place blind spots in the panorama (e.g. to exclude a door) or window, iii) place deaf spots in the field so that a PC or TV doesn't fool the system into thinking there is a speaker, iv) change or limit the number of panels, v) pin a preferred orientation, vi) remove the permanent Owl ad/logo (SUPER annoying), vii) alter the sensitivity of the "smart" algorithm... I could go on. The defaults have a lot of issues.<br/><br/>b) The effective resolution dedicated to any one speaker has only improved slightly even though the price-performance of camera sensors, processors and memory have all improved far more significantly. Any similarly priced mobile phone, for example, would have a far higher aggregate resolution.<br/><br/>c) Functions are controlled by a mobile phone app interfacing with the Owl over WiFi and there is no computer control interface even though it plugs into the computer. This can be particularly troublesome in a corporate setting where not everybody has installed the app on their phone.<br/><br/>The louder speakers is by far the biggest improvement (the former system was very weak for larger spaces). The video and "smart" microphones do work better, but not very much so. As a result I was far more impressed with the original Owl which seemed "ahead of its time", vs. the Pro which seems almost like a lazy update.</span>

<span>I purchased 2 units for an offsite event I was holding at a large hotel in medium sized conference rooms (approx 30 people) after using one for a book club meeting which worked well.<br/><br/>Whats good:<br/>* Setup took 60 seconds.  Take out of the box, plug in, register on your phone, connect to your computer and start a Zoom call.  Done.<br/>* No micromanagement required, its voice detection and camera panning are excellent<br/>* Non-intrusive design, people thought it was neat but weren't distracted by it.<br/>* A good value for money, given the alternative of managing mics and mixers and a much more intrusive seutp.<br/><br/>Whats not so good:<br/>* The video quality was only 640x480 in zoom which made the images grainy.<br/>* The audio quality is very low, very often it was hard to understand the speaker, especially if they had an accent or didn't speak very loudly.  Also when there were multiple people talking at one time they generally got garbled.<br/>* In a ballroom with a dome overhead light it created a strange halo effect on the dome of the camera<br/><br/>I want to make a clear caveat that I wonder if I could have tuned it more for better quality.  My event didn't allow me time to do any testing or tuning before the event started, so maybe I could have done more, but if I could it wasn't obvious how to do it.</span>
