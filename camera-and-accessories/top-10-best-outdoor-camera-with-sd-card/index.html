<span>I have a few LaView cameras. They are perfect for my needs.<br/><br/>After several months of use, one of my N11 cameras stopped responding. I reached out to them about the issue. Ariel from Laview promptly sent a new camera! I'm very pleased with how they support their products.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This camera has captured videos of car prowlers twice. I have 2 of them to cover different angles.  I like the picture quality. Battery life depends on how frequently it is triggered but I recharge about every 2 weeks. Recently I had trouble with my network and could not get either one to re-pair. Contacted customer service and Ariel replied the next day with menu options that I was unaware of. Used the ez connect and both paired up right away and both work well again. Evidently certain iPhones need to use the optional pairing method. Thanks Ariel.</span>

<span>Nice camera with a low price . Very good quality pictures.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>They work good. Took me a while to figure them out. You need good streaming internet to be able to view real time video on your phone. I wish they would start recording on the motion sensor a little faster than it does. There's probably 5 or ten seconds lost at the beginning of an even before it starts recording. Other than that it's good quality and easy to install.</span>

<span>I have a Nest doorbell and driveway camera, but a Wyze Pan Cam for the backyard. I knew the Wyze wasn't meant for outdoors (although it worked fine mounted under an eave and with a silicone cover on it to protect it from the elements) and the nighttime vision wasn't very good.<br/><br/>I have a bunch of Kasa TP-Link smart plugs, so I thought I would try their camera. I knew I would have to pay the subscription if I wanted video saved to the cloud (same as other brands), but I also saw that you could install a memory card to keep recordings local and not have to pay for the subscription (similar to Wyze).<br/><br/>I installed and formatted a memory card in the Kasa Camara, and we hung it up in the afternoon and let it record 24/7 until the next day. I went into the app and found I would have to review the entire video from the memory card to see anything - I would have to pay to get snippets of motion detected. Because Wyze will give you 10-second snippets of motion/noise/person detection (then can click on the recording on the memory card to view more), I decided to get the Wyze Camera v3 (Indoor/Outdoor) and returned the Kasa Camara.<br/><br/>I will say that I think the Wyze v3 Camera has better nighttime vision than the Kasa; downside is that the Wyze app is the only way to view the camera's. I wanted to like Kasa, but the Wyze one out (and it's half the size). (Another note, I bought the light for the Wyze at night, but the night vision is so good that I don't need it).</span>

<span>This choice is hard to beat for the average consumer at the seemingly low price $30 USD, but you can expect to spend more money than just that.<br/><br/>First the good stuff. The camera is small and inconspicuous, and has a very clear image quality, even in the dark. It's easy to set up; just plug it into a standard power outlet and install the app on your phone. Whatever the camera currently sees, you can see through your phone. By default, it begins actually recording footage whenever it senses motion. The recordings are stored online in the cloud (not in the camera). These recordings are also viewed from your phone, and the camera sends your phone a notification whenever it has sensed motion and recorded something. It can sense motion from pretty far away. It can also capture audio, though the quality is hit and miss and usually very quiet.<br/><br/>Now the sketchy parts. The camera's night-vision is only "color" if your definition of "color" is restricted to white, black, and grey. If the camera is looking through a window at night, it's infrared will reflect off the glass and back into the lens, making night-time recording a bust. Better put the camera outside. It also will not function without a wifi signal. When placed outside your house, the camera's wifi reception can be wonky depending on a host of factors. The camera's power cord is a rectangular USB which is a pain in the ass to fit through a drill-hole unless you feel like drilling a hole into your wall that's an inch in diameter. The cord itself is also quite short; maybe 7 feet long at best. Now the biggest buggaboo: you pretty much need to buy their security plan, which is $20 per camera per year. Why? Without said plan, you cannot adjust the criteria for triggering the camera's motion-sensor (and thus recorded events and motion-triggered notifications). This means you will get a notification on your phone every single time so much as a fart blows past this thing, and even then it will only record for 30 seconds. After that it won't record anything for another 5 minutes. This helpful cooldown timer means you'll get the cool 30 seconds of the thief trying to break into your house, but not the the next 5 minutes of him actually doing so and walking away with all your gold-bricks.<br/><br/>The security plan lifts the (totally unnecessary) 5 minute cooldown timer, and allows you to set the camera's recording trigger to person, vehicles, package, pet, smoke alarm sounds, and a range of other criteria. It's actually quite good at differentiating between these things. That means you can have it notify you only when it sees people and vehicles, for example. There is also an SD card add-on that is highly suggested. Without the SD card, you'll have no physical copy of the footage. The SD card also allows the camera to record continuously even without a wifi signal. The card has enough capacity for about 4-5 days of continuous footage, and it automatically overwrites the oldest footage once it's reached capacity. The card plugs directly into the camera, which means it is vulnerable in the event that the camera itself is damaged or stolen.<br/><br/>Overall, you should expect to spend a total of $45 up front for the camera with the SD card upgrade, plus a recurring payment of $20 a year per camera for as long as you intend to use the thing. This is still favorable for the average joe to other security cameras, which often range into the hundreds of dollars and have much more complicated installation. It's a great choice for home security, or maybe even a small business. You just have to overcome some shady business tactics and pay extra to avoid planned obsolescence.</span>

<span>Customer service was hands down the most excellent, reliable and painless experience I have experienced since this whole pandemic started.<br/><br/>The equipment is solid and it's design aesthetic is simple, clean and modern. Installation was a breeze and I found myself connected to the control center of a very feature-packed and user friendly interface to navigate. This setup can be easily accomplished by both new to home security tech and the more advanced or savvy users. For the price that you pay for such a suite of control, it definitely feels a bit higher-end considering the affordability.<br/><br/>We use this specific camera for outdoor use and it meets all of needs and then some. The only negative thing I could say about it after a week of use is the two-way speaker is somewhat of a funny fopa. Like this camera delivers in all the real areas of importance and then the microphone quality is awful, and if you're attempting to communicate with someone on the other hand, good luck getting them to understand a single world you're saying Mr. Roboto.<br/><br/>The HD resolution is crisp as long as you dont try to zoom in. I wouldn't suggest ever enabling sound detection, especially for outdoor use. It's rather annoying to get notified everytime a bird craps on the porch or just of wind makes the leaves and branches in your yard sound like a nuclear war head had been detonated.<br/><br/>Connectivity is quite versatile. The camera is placed at quite a distance from the router and we have yet to see the connection quality call anywhere less than 80-88 on a high congested or speed throttled network. If you have a stable internet connection your FPS and video quality are rather impressive. I wouldn't suggest this camera setup for someone who's connection doesn't allow at least 5GB of highspeed internet UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD.<br/><br/>You have the option to expand the memory with an sd card or you can opt into some very reliable cloud storage provided through the app. They even offer a 30 trial that you can begin at any time. And whatever day you choose, you'll be able to view events from 14 days before you begin. This is almost u heard of and it's quite reliable.<br/><br/>It's really hard to find anything wrong with this security camera besides its lousy and almost irrelevant mono speaker. At this price and with all this bang for your buck, you'd be silly to pass up on such a reliable and well made product.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a little piece of mind and the ability to watch on the places that you care about most, this device is perfect for you and it's inexpensive enough to impress even some of the harder to please, fancy pants types.<br/><br/>The only things that I would make sure of before making this purchase is that your wifi connection is highspeed and supports 2.4GHZ. This device is not configureable on a 5GHZ network. Make sure that you're able to have safe and adequate power outlet access as well. I would always suggest that you use an appropriate surge protector, and wired in securely or hidden manner. Placed just out of reach of easy access so that anyone attempting to cut any cords or damage property would be caught in the act before they were ever able to breach your property.<br/><br/>I plan on adding more to our property and if there's ever an updated model, I won't even hesitate to do an immediate upgrade. As I already know, the shipments tend to arrive way faster than I could have ever expected.</span>

<span>Let's begin with the packaging which will be the first thing you see upon receiving the camera. The exterior packaging is attractive and includes a lot of details and specifications about the camera. Opening the box and you will find a very VERY impressive bubble wrap protecting the camera shell. This protection is probably overkill but that makes me happy. They put the effort into protecting the device. The rest of the small parts were packaged up nicely and the power supply was in a separate box. Also included is a masonry drill bit which will be helpful if the install is on brick or concrete.<br/>Packaging: 5 Stars<br/><br/>Now, let's get started on the camera itself. My first impression was, "wow, this thing is a tank". It feels very well built with a metal exterior and it definitely seems up to the task of withstanding outdoor use. The cord coming off the back of the camera is about 18". This cord includes the power cord, Wifi Button, and ethernet cord if you plan to use ethernet instead of wireless. Don't be confused, there is also the power adapter that has a very long (at least 12 foot).<br/><br/>2 screws need to be removed to insert an SD card. I had an 8 GB card laying around so that's what I used for the test. You can also use Netvue's cloud service in place of the SD Card if you would like the video to be recorded. I'll report in another section about how long an 8GB card will record.<br/><br/>Connecting the camera to my wifi was very easy even though at first I wouldn't have said that but I found out my wifi/internet started having issues before I tried to add the camera to my network. The Smart Link feature which is what it attempts to use to connect first didn't work for me but the backup QR method worked just fine.<br/><br/>Use of the app is very easy. It's simple for even the most tech-unsavvy users. Once the app and camera have been configured the camera will begin recording to the SD card. I found that it takes a couple hours to be able to review recordings. My 8 GB card is recording about 22 hours which I find to be acceptable. (I do plan to replace it with a 32 GB or larger card at some point as I would like about 4 days recorded). NOTE: the SD card must be formatted to FAT or FAT32 in order to work. Initially, my card was set up as exFAT and it wasn't recognized but when I contacted support I got a fast reply and determined that I needed to reformat my card.<br/><br/>I haven't installed the camera outside on my house yet because on the day I planned to install it snowed and has been too cold for me to be out on a ladder, however, i plan to install the camera this weekend when the temperatures should be warmer.  I don't foresee any issues with the install as it should be pretty straight-forward given that there are anchors and screws included. There is also a hole template to stick to the surface so your holes are in the right alignment.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very impressed with my Vigil camera. For the price, I don't think there is a better outdoor camera that has the same features and includes an easy app such as Netvue. It's worth your investment.<br/><br/>I will report back and update my review if I run into issues with install or with the camera later on down the road.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review.</span>

<span>Setup was easy enough. Small screwdriver to remove the cover and slide the SD Card in (Phone will format the card in order to use it). Powered the camera on inside the house. Didn't put antenna on yet. Download the Netvue App. Followed the app instructions. Uses 2.4ghz wifi only. Has the option to use a wired connection. It says to install the antenna prior to mounting the antenna outside. I would not do this step first, it will get in the way and you will end up taking it off anyway. Wait til the end. Comes with a nice template to drill the holes, along with the wall anchors and screws. Also comes with an allen wrench to adjust the aim of the camera. Plug into a power source and the camera will reconnect to the wifi and you can then adjust the aim of the camera to the area you want.<br/><br/>There is no windows app or a way to view the video online. The workaround for a Samsung Phone - Android is to install Samsung Flow and mirror your phone. Pretty sure there would be a way to do something similar with iOS. If viewing the security camera online is important, this camera is not a good choice.<br/><br/>Clear picture in both daylight and night modes. Didn't spend a small fortune for the camera, so good value here.<br/><br/>The app....not a major selling point.<br/><br/>Opening the camera, the audio is ALWAYS on. First time all that static/wind/road noise was way to intense. No way to default it being off. For me, 2way communication is not important at all especially where I mounted it. So i mute it every time i view the camera in the app. There is a setting for volume, but even with it off it still provides sound. Not even sure what that setting is for.<br/><br/>Initially, the notifications are on 24/7 and the "sensitivity" slider is half. Ended up sending notifications every 5-15 minutes because the wind was blowing. You can adjust the notification time; i set it for just at night time and putting my phone in Do Not Disturb; otherwise the thing was going off all night (storm passing through). Still adjusting the sensitivity, doesn't show any percentage so for now it's hit or miss. And it does miss. Have to study more on how fast it resets and how long it records.<br/><br/>You can adjust what areas are going to trip the camera. However, it's a 4x3 grid. So you can't fine tune it if part of what you want is half in that grid; or all nothing. I like being able to draw a rectangle in the exact area i want. Not a big negative, it is what it is.<br/><br/>You can review the video, but you have no way of knowing what time to look at because it doesn't store that info if it's outside your notification time. The video was stored, but you have to guess what time to look at. On my Yi Home, it still shows me when the camera tripped without giving me notifications all day. Think i will play with not allowing notifications from the app but telling the software to do so anyway. Hopefully then i can go look when i want.<br/><br/>They really want you to buy a cloud plan. For 2 weeks worth of 24/7 recording, it's $6.99/month or $69.99 per year. 2 weeks? Hmm. Motion detection storage is $1.99/month or $19.90 per year. But that wouldn't help if you need more than 10-20 seconds of video. And that price is per camera not account.<br/><br/>All the files are stored as *.nvt3. No clue as to what they are or how to view them. Can only play them on the Netvue App. On my Yi Home, all the videos are mp4's and it will store as much as the card can hold. No 2 week limit; granted, I have to have a large card but they are pretty cheap.<br/><br/>Bottom line:<br/><br/>Pros: Clear pictures in both daylight and night modes. Price can't be beat. Wired or Wireless. Easy to setup.<br/><br/>Cons: No windows app/viewer. Not mp4 format. Sensitivity will take some time to get "right". Cloud plans are expensive and short duration.</span>

<span>These are pretty good little cameras, wired (just for power, I mean) 2.5 GHz WiFi.. BUT, I'm giving them good credit because of customer support they have. Or at least 1 of them and that's at the time of writing this although, I don't see any reason it would change. (Just in the off chance that should change, we're not looking to hang that one guy who said on Amazon that these people had "good customer service") Mine wasn't a big issue but they were persistent in getting me taken care of. That's much better than the alternative. At any rate, it's just little light cameras in plastic cases but so far been reliable, nice app, and good picture and stuff so yea, I might get a couple more of them so they stay with one app. Much easier that way..

<span>Sorry to the seller.  The product is great.  Worked great for years.  My issues is with Amazon.  I thought my system had failed so I ordered another.  I fixed it and cancelled my order within minutes but Amazon didn't cancel the order and now it has shipped and I'll have to return it.  This cost the seller or Amazon not me, which is the only good thing I can say, but it's a waist of money for somebody and that isn't good in the grand scheme of free markets.<br/>It's not like me to grouse about a thing and not do something to make it better.  I can't do anything about the order process but I can share how I fixed my problem.  The symptom was that when I woke up and looked at the monitor it was black.  I checked the power and plugged it back in and the opening screen came on flashing but it wouldn't fully boot up so I couldn't get to the menu to try to trouble shoot.  I looked all over for a reset button and tried everything including pairing the cameras even I couldn't get to that setting through the menu.  Finally I sat down and ordered another Defender system because it has work flawlessly for over 5 years.  I got up to look at the thing one more time and noticed the memory card.  I pulled it out and BOOM!  It started booting up, I literally dropped everything and dashed to the computer to cancel my new order within minutes.  Bottom line is the Defender is a great dependable system.  I have a $800 fancy 8 camera system with a DVR and all the bells but the system I set before I go out is the  Defender.  I've never had to reset the cameras or re-pair them like my expensive system.  True the image isn't quite as crisp and the monitor is small but the cameras have a speaker that works well so you can hear what people are saying at the gate 300 feet away.  If I could only have one system I would get the 4 camera Defender.</span>
