<span>Before I begin, my previous camera was a Sanyo vpcT1496R 14MP camera.<br/><br/>The people that say their phones are better either have brand new phones, which some of them come with 13MP+ cameras....or got a defective camera.<br/><br/>This is a good camera. I can actually use the zoom and it isn't always a blurry blob. (It can still be a blurry blob depending on settings, but it doesn't have to be) I haven't really messed with any settings. I've put it to where the display shows standard and not the actual quality of the photo to save battery, and the pictures still look way better than my old camera. I can't wait to someday go to the zoo and take pictures with this thing.<br/><br/>The battery life is fine.<br/><br/>I bought this from Focus Camera on Amazon. I mention this due to the one problem. I got the European version and I live in America. It came with a European charger which isn't compatible with American plugs. It came with an adapter that isn't even listed in the parts that can come with the camera....which means this could've been a used camera (albiet one that was taken care of) since someone had to open it to add the adapter that doesn't come with it. The adapter could be a POS and cause problems. Amazon did fix it by letting me order a charger and refunding me the amount (Amazon, not the seller). Note: the authentic looking chargers (the ones that look like the one it was supposed to come with) are the ones where you take the battery out to charge it. Which I dislike because that means every charge....gotta put the date in and everything (warning for those who get the correct charger)<br/><br/>Minus the charger thing, it's a good camera. It's fairly cheap as well. Sony usually has good quality in their electronics, though you can always get a dud.<br/><br/>Edit: Since reviewing this, things have changed: This thing is flimsy. Out of NOWHERE the part that pushes out and pulls in the lens broke so now the camera refuses to do anything beyond tell me to turn it off and on again. So I can't suggest you buy this camera unless it's the only half decent one in your price range.</span>

<span>Totally pleased with purchase!! Comes with three chords that when all put together Can be used to charge in the wall outlet. Then one chord can be used to charge in the computer. And one cord for the car.Super easy to use. To set up the camera is very simple and easy to figure out which button is which.It comes with a battery but no memory card the memory card I had to buy separately but it was not expensive and for the price of the camera I was not expecting it.It takes just your regular general memory card nothing fancy.The only issue I had with it was the arm strap. Even in the instructions it did not say how to attach it and we have yet to figure that out. So if someone could help us that would be great.The feature that helps you to get a focused picture even when you’re shaking a little bit works great.The instructions are pretty much basic and simple and so you may need to find out more information about it online.It works best for outdoor pictures I think. And the zoom is A very nice feature.They have continued to improve it in the past few years.It is lightweight but it has enough body to it to hold it easily when taking a picture.If there is no charge to the battery it takes approximately an hour to an hour and a half to charge.I purchased this camera for the purpose of taking outdoor nature pictures for the cards that I sell. And I am very pleased with the camera and so far think it is going to work great for that purpose. I would recommend this camera to anyone who just want something simple but well worth it with great quality.</span>

<span>This is great camera if you need a cheap price daily carry snapshot camera or as gift for someone don't have one.  I order this camera for my parents as daily carry camera so they can capture some interesting photo of their daily life while I am not with them.  They love it because they are not tech person, they not even know all the features on their smartphone. I spend 5 mins to reading manual and setup the camera 10mins to explain to them how to use. After one hour they are good to go with this camera.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Easy to use, nothing complicate on/off, shutter, zoom and menu button.<br/>2. Super lightweight, maybe been use DSLR for while this camera just too lightweight for me, even lighter than my mobile phone.<br/>3. Better than mobile phone quality picture (If you are mobile phone photographer NVM)<br/>4. Good battery life. This will save some battery juice for my parents smartphone.<br/><br/>Nothing is prefect there still something need to watch out.<br/>Cons:<br/>1. Poor quality on the LCD screen. If you loading your photo to your computer it will look so much better than you check it on the LCD screen on the camera.<br/>2. So lightweight mean sometime you can't get a stable shot<br/>3. Menu language limitation there only few major languages are available not many choice as other model.<br/>4. Video quality is kind of noise but still acceptable.<br/><br/>Over all me and my parents both are happy with this camera.  They can always carry a camera to anywhere they going now. I mean for this price range and the quality we got I am happy with it. Of course if you are look for better image quality and rich features camera, look for other this just good enough for daily snapshot, you have to pay the right price to get the right quality tool.</span>

<span>This is a great camera for a beginner and someone who likes to take pics casually.

Can’t open the lense to clean it which sucks because now I’ll have to take it to a camera shop and pay to have it done. Which is dumb obviously anyone who buys this camera doesn’t have a lot of money to spend which is why I bought it it n the first place….

<span>The menu system is not user friendly. Either the unit is defective, or the design is garbage. Tried setting the time/date, didn't take, and the camera seems to make it's own choices and won't let me even delete an image. The unit arrived inside of a USPS Postal Service package, inside of an Amazon package. Seemed to be in great condition. Put good batteries in it. It connects with the USB cable just fine and once connected, the images can be downloaded, altered and deleted, but the camera menu system is not useable. Update, the manual is sadly lacking explanation of how the menu system works. I was able to change the date and options, but had to explore the buttons to figure out what and how they work. There is only a diagram of what functions the buttons represent, and it's not clear, at least on the camera menu what characters indicate those functions. Otherwise a good cheap  camera. It's plastic and it feels light, comes with a rubber protective cover, says it's water proof to 10 feet. I don't plan on testing it, but it should be ok, in a light rain, or on a canoe trip.</span>

<span>I've had a lot of cameras. Used to work in a camera retailer and used may different brands.  I had an FZ20 which died a long, LONG time a go. Loved that camera. Wonderful photos. Since then I've mostly used SLRs.  I bought this thinking that it would be great to take to a football game, since lens length is restricted by the stadium. Thought it would be best of both worlds.<br/>I assumed I would be able to use the controls much like on an SLR. I mean, it's "F-Stop, Shutter speed, and ISO".  The main difference being the zoom lens.<br/>I can't make this camera do what I want. Even on manual. It has a lot of built-in settings. Finally had to watch YouTube videos to get help. You have to make a series of complicated and bizarre steps to change those settings. (Focus points are a nightmare.) It runs like a computer program. Someone who is less familiar with a camera might be okay with it.  I wanted a camera.<br/>I've waited too long to return it, so I'll have to use it for whatever....<br/>I eagerly anticipated getting this camera. I'm very disappointed.</span>

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>This camera is amazing just getting back into learning photography I love you can manually change the f stop and other features. I bought a used on and can't even tell it looks perfect takes perfect pictures I could not be happier. This is an easy to use DSLR camera for a beginner or has some features even a pro would enjoy it does take AA batteries which I have seen bothers some but not me just buy some nice rechargeable AAA's  and it's just like having a battery pack you have to charge those too so wouldn't let ego keep you from a great camera.</span>

<span>Update June 20, 2019:<br/>My second set of NiMH batteries just went flat after taking photo number 1488. So I am getting on average 744 photos per charge on a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries. That is really good battery performance.<br/><br/>The Sony DSC-H300 is a very nice camera for the price. It is not equal to a Rebel SLR or my Fuji, but it costs a fraction of the price of either of those.  For a basic point and shoot camera it has a lot going for it.<br/><br/>The user interface is about the same as most digital cameras, so you should be able to figure it out. I had very little trouble with it.<br/><br/>The complete operator manual is available by going to sony dot com and digging down through support.<br/><br/>The photographs are sharp enough. The colors are a bit more saturated than they are in my other cameras, but that is what I have noticed in Sony cameras that I have owned previously.<br/><br/>The autofocus can be a bit tricky, but with practice I am mostly able to make it work. I take a lot of macro photos, and sometimes it does better using the area focus, and sometimes it does better using the spot focus. I try things until it works.<br/><br/>I was initially put off by the fact that there is no obvious Macro setting.  I take a lot of macro photographs.  However, the camera does have a macro mode; it sets it automatically, removing the need to remember to put it into macro mode before shooting. So the lack of a menu setting for macros is a benifit rather than a deficiency.<br/><br/>I also was initially put off by having to set the exposure correction through the menu system. You have to push the menu button, then click down a few spaces to get to the EV setting. It takes four or five menu clicks.  However, once I had set the EV to something other than zero, pushing the Menu button took me directy to the EV menu, so it became a one-click setting at that point. Clever. In fact the menu does that in general. The menu rembembers where it was and takes you back there when you push the Menu button. That memory is reset when you go in and out of replay mode or turn the camera on/off.<br/><br/>The camera uses AA batteries, which is a requirement for me. I have boxes of NiMH rechargeables that I use in all of my cameras, and the DSC-H300 works fine with them.  I shot 646 photographs on one set of fully charged Eneloop 1900 mAh NiMH batteries.  That is not an estimate; I actually took that many photos on one set of batteries. It reports the charge level accurately as well.<br/><br/>For connection to a computer, the camera uses a Mini USB 5-pin connector, not to be confused with the older USB mini 4-pin connector, which is larger. I have some older cameras that use a connector that is called a "Mini USB", but it is not the same connector as the one that works with this Sony.  The older connector is more accurately referred to as a "Mini USB 4-pin" connector.  Fortunately, the camera came with the proper cable, so this was not an immediate issue, but if you need to replace the cable, make sure that you get the "Mini USB 5-pin" version.<br/><br/>A nice feature is that the backup battery that maintains the settings, such as the clock when the main batteries are out is rechargeable. So if you leave the camera with no batteries in it long enough for the backup battery to go flat, you can simply leave fresh AA batteries in it for a while and the backup battery will recharge.  You don't have to buy a replacement cell to put into the camera.<br/><br/>One of my favorite features of this camera is that it allows me to decide whether to connect to a computer using Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) or USB Mass Storage. PTP is a camera-specific protocal that connects to the computer in a readonly fashion. That makes it very unlikely that I can do something stupid and damage the SD card. In PTP mode, unmounting the card just requires turning off the camera.  If you want to change anything on the card using the computer you have the option to connect to the computer as Mass Storage USB. That protocol gives you full access to the SD card. Just be careful to unmount the card before pulling the plug or turning off the camera or you risk damaging the file system on the card and losing your images. I use PTP because it is simpler and safer.<br/><br/>The camera connects properly to USB on Windows 7, Linux Mint 18.1 and Linux Mageia 7 Beta 1. It connects using both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports.<br/><br/>Caveat: It is necessary to take off the lens cover before turning on the camera.  When you turn on the camera, the lens moves out slightly, and the lens cap blocks that motion. If you leave the lens cap on, the camera throws an error telling you to turn off the camera and try again. So always take the lens cover off before turning on the camera. An exception to this rule is that you can leave the lens cover on when it is connected to a computer. It does not attempt to move the lens when it is connected to the USB.<br/><br/>Here is another tip.  The instruction manual says that to change a menu setting, find and set the new setting, then push the OK button to select it. However, pushing the OK button makes the menu disappear. If you are setting multiple items in the menu, it is annoying to go back into the menu for each item.  However, you can set multiple items easily. To set multiple items, select the desired item and setting, then push the Down button or the Up button to accept the new setting. The menu will remain displayed, and the new setting will be accepted.<br/><br/>So I give high marks to the Sony DSC-H300 as a beginner camera or a less expensive knock-around shop camera. If you are looking to take truly outstanding photographs to print in large format, you might want to look around and spend more. But for a general purpose camera, the DSC-H300 works.</span>

<span>This is a wonderful camera. I'm a doll artist, and I needed to take cleaner, detail photos of my work.  This camera did the job beautifully! I can't believe it. When I was taking pictures of the doll art I was working on, the pictures were so detailed, that I had to lotion my hands really well, because the camera, showed how dry my hands were. I love that this camera!!! The camera looks traditional and professional, but I know looks aren't everything.  What was included with the camera are batteries, a USB cord, which works really well with my MacBook Air.  It used my iPhoto as the way to down pictures.  It also included a strap and projective cap over the lense. You'll need to by a SDHC memory card. The camera has a nice heft to it, But even with that weight,  I can still take a picture with one hand, while trying to take photos of what I'm working on.  I am an amateur at cameras, but I know what I wanted my pictures to look like, and this camera did that for me!  Just fantastic.</span>

<span>Bought this for my wife for Christmas and wanted to wait until we had it for a while before writing a review.  I gave it three stars because it’s cumbersome and hard to use. There’s no built in battery to charge which is a pain. It takes four AA batteries, but when it gets cold out (I live in Colorado) the camera doesn’t work. The battery light flashes and then shuts off. This is with new batteries too. The focus is pretty straight forward but working the functions is tricky and hard to understand. The picture quality is alright, about the same as my iPhone X which isn’t saying much for this camera. It does take a memory card that’s if you can keep fresh batteries in it long enough to fill the card up. There’s no option to change out lenses should you want to, I know we didn’t plan on this option we just wanted an easy to use camera. In this day and age of smart phones, you might be better off just using your phone rather than buying this future paperweight.</span>

First, I was concerned with this camera since one review had mentioned that the camera eats batteries.  After taking between 10 to 20 pictures the battery life indicator went to half charge and then quickly to 1/4 and then empty.  However, the camera kept taking about 175 pictures until it finally shutdown and I had to switch to a new set of rechargeables.  About 75% of those pictures were taken with flash which really eats up battery life plus I spent a considerable amount of time with the camera on learning the new operating system.  I am now up to over 400 pictures and I am still on the second use of the rechargeable batteries.  It is disconcerting to see the empty battery icon on the LCD screen but as long as each set of rechargeable batteries takes at least 175 pictures I can live with it.<br/><br/>One note:  Be sure to set the camera up to operate with the NIMH if that's what you are using.  The camera can be adjusted to operate with either alkaline batteries or NIMH batteries.  Even though the camera bundle also came with four alkaline batteries I have never tried the camera using them.<br/><br/>I'm impressed with the Ultimaxx  4-battery charger and batteries.  I like that the charger will shutdown after the batteries are fully charged so that I don't have to worry about frying the batteries by overcharging.  I've purchased an additional Ultimaxx 8-battery charger and eight AA batteries to be assured that I will not run out of batteries during a long day of taking pictures.<br/><br/>My previous camera was a Nikon Coolpix L810 that I had for 10 years.  The AZ401 is at least equal in all areas and in many ways superior to the Nikon.  The image stabilization is excellent and the picture quality is better.  I've taken ten of thousands of pictures with the Nikon and if I get ten years out of the new Kodak camera I will be most pleased.  Only time will tell.</span>

<span>I love the camera but the lens cap that came with it doesn't fit it at all and there was no way to attach the faulty lens cap to the camera.</span>

<span>It’s a decent little entry level camera for kids imho.  The zoom is great but the photo quality is not that good at all &amp; even with the highest speed SD card, there is a major delay between being able to take photo after photo</span>

<span>Not sure why a lens cover was put on this camera because it won't stay on. Otherwise a very good camera.</span>
