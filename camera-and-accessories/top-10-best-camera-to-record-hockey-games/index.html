<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Used it five times and the buttons to advance the pictures stopped working.i really think it was just a fluke. Anything man made can have a problem once in a while but the summer was very quick to remedy the situation which was great.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have used several different Amazon chinese trail cameras and most have sucked. This one does not suck. Not saying its perfect - but it does get photos and enough to think that I am not missing anything. Pictures could be nicer, but they are good for sure. No audio on mine, and had one that took really short videos and couldnt change it in settings. (Only 2 seconds no matter what the settings were)<br/><br/>Other cameras have had corrupted files (files here are still in a weird format, but its okay) and most of the other cameras I had broke the season I had them. These cameras are still going strong.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Pretty solid image quality. Night vision works quite well... I like that I can dial up or down the sensitivity of the motion detection. Comes with a pretty good quality mount included that's a nice feature. Initially purchased this to try to catch a thief who was getting into my stuff at night... But wound up using it outdoors to capture the neighborhood wildlife in the backyard. Works well for both purposes.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Picture quality during day time and night time are of good quality. The several options for setting up picture and video parameters makes it easy to get the best picture style for your surroundings. The space for extra batteries is also another nice feature provided.</span>

<span>With my eMeet webcam, I look really far away, entered in a very wide-angle shot (no, people don't need to see that much of my house or whatever background I choose!). Even if I move the camera 8 inches away from my face, I still don't take up much of the screen. No one else I communicate with looks this far away when we're talking. I don't get it -- especially since I see screenshots in the reviews from people who fill their screens like you'd expect to with a webcam, and because my husband has the same camera, bought a year earlier, and he looks normally sized on screen. Another reviewer said the camera fine if you want a wide view of a conference room or want to show several people at a table. But for one person, I just look goofy. The camera is plug-and-play and easy to use, but since you can't adjust how tiny you look on screen, it's just a no-go for me. I'm going to buy something different.</span>

<span>Omg!  I’ve been looking for a cam that does zoom in for YEARS! This cam has it!!<br/>Most cams are made for 17 year old girls who record vids on their laptop for social media.  Their laptop is 12 inches away from their face.  Most cams DO NOT take into account that you are using the cam in a business setting.  My camera (and monitor) are 24" away from my face, so until this point, having the camera zoom would have been quite helpful.  3 settings fit all biz needs.  Up to 3 persons in shot, 10 persons, 25 persons, which is 90%, 78%, and 65% respectively.  GENIUS settings!!<br/><br/>For this feature:  i give it 5+++ stars!  Well done!<br/><br/>Every time they launch a new iPhone, they always talk about what a great camera they came out with.  Again, there is NO ZOOM feature.  The phone is built for a 6' tall man's arm length (taking a selfie).  If you don't have that arm length, your shot is not ideal.<br/><br/>I upload a pic on Fb frequently.  Again, to replace profile pic, there is no Zoom in, only Zoom out.  If you Zoom out, your face will no longer be in the picture.  Stupid.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Skin tones weren’t good, but because of another photo app I use, I figured maybe there is an app that I can make further corrections.  My face was pink and my arms were orange.  This won't happen to you as the built-in color correction will likely work 95% of the time.  It didn't work for me as I am brown-skinned.<br/><br/>I called LogiTech to ask if they had an app.  Yes!  Success. Got that solved, too!  (It's called Contrast and Saturation).<br/><br/>All around great camera, I would give it more stars if I could.  Oh, and my friend told me to tell you, you DON'T have to wear makeup.  Full skin correction happens!</span>

<span>I have had a lot of logitech products over the years; everything from their flagship gaming keyboards to travel mice and webcams. I really like the compact nature of this camera. Looking at the pictures of the camera I would have expected it to be a bit bigger on top of my monitor. One of the best features and the reason that I went with this camera is that the USB-C cable is detachable from the camera and can be replaces with a longer one if necessary. I was not too concerned with the length as I have it plugged into the USB hub on my monitor, but that hub sits behind a trim panel that needs to be removed everytime I need to unplug it when my computer has issues. These issues are not with the camera as my computer seems to have issues with every webcam that I have used, so being able to unplug it and plug it back in at the camera is a huge time savings for me!<br/><br/>The quality is great! I have everything on default settings as I typically just use my webcam a couple days a week for maybe an hour at a time. If I were doing something like streaming or creating content with it I would likely take the time to tune all of the settings that are available with the software mentioned within the instructions. I also do not have any studio lights so my lighting depends on the weather outside and a single lamp that I have off to the side, so auto settings work best for now.<br/><br/>The camera does come with a mount for the top of your monitor as well as a privacy cover for when you are not using it. I personally think it adds some unnecesary bulk to the camera so I have opted not to use it personally. You can also remove the montiro mount and use it with a tri-pod or ring light if you would like. I might look into this option down the road.<br/><br/>The camera also supports Windows Hello which allows you to log into your computer just by looking at the camera. When I am not having issues with my computer this works great! I typically have to log in and unplug the camera and plug it back in for my computer to recognize everything, but once that has happened it is flawless for the remainder of the time I am at the comptuer.<br/><br/>I recomended this camera to family who had previously purchased it and when I finally got fed up with taking the back panel off of my monitor I decided to pick one up for myself. Great camera that I have no problem recmoending 100% to anyone that is looking for a webcam with better quality than their laptop camera or the cheap webcams that are all over the maret these days. I have had logitec webcams for many years and have not been more happy with one of them than I am with the BRIO. If you are on the fence I would say just go ahead and spend the money to get one. You will not be disapointed.</span>

<span>If you have the money to invest in this webcam, I highly suggest making the purchase. Logitech has a great reputation when it comes to the webcam sector. I have several webcams and this is now my favorite. Hopefully, this review helps with any decision you are trying to make.<br/><br/>This is one of the few webcams that supports 4K Ultra HD 2160p/30fps. I just upgraded to a 4k monitor, so maybe most people are not looking for a 4K webcam.  At full HD 1080p/30 or 60 fps, this webcam also supports HD 720p/30, 60, or 90fps, it is still by far the best webcam I have right now. It is impressive! Even with makeup, you will probably notice a few flaws in your skin. It is that amazing!<br/>It does come with a privacy shutter that you can attach if you want a physical block of the camera. Not only that, but it snaps on easily. There is also a black drawstring travel bag to prevent scratches and dust when not in use or if you need to travel with it. It does not come with a tripod, but it does have a tripod thread mount.<br/><br/>There is a detachable mounting clip. I tested it on an older, bulky laptop. It is wide, and it worked great. I purchased a tripod because I will primarily use this for my desktop. I didn't like the idea of it hanging on my monitor, as it doesn't have a plastic outside edge. My monitor screen runs to the very edge. If you have a similar monitor, I would highly suggest purchasing a tripod. Another consideration that might make you want a tripod, this webcam can’t be tilted up or down or turned left or right, so it’s basically stuck in a fixed position. With the tripod I bought, the top half has a ball with the plate of the screw that attaches to the bottom of the webcam. This setup on the tripod allows me to adjust it to where I need it.<br/><br/>This webcam is compatible with video conferencing platforms like Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, Cisco, Cisco Webex, Cisco Jabber, Microsoft Cortana, Windows Hello, Skype, Google Hangouts, and other VC applications, XSplit, OBS, Twitch, BlueJeans, Zoom, Fuze, GoToMeetings, and Ring Central. I use several of these platforms and compared to my older 920 Logitech webcam, I can see a huge difference in quality. I share videos with colleagues, and they have also noticed a difference. As for the platforms, many have a maximum of 720p or 1080p. You probably won't notice a difference when joining a meeting.<br/><br/>Once you start using the webcam, you will see the autofocus and the auto light correction with high dynamic range (HRD). It tracks movements and quickly makes the right adjustments. There are also three fields of view, so you are not limited to a single default. The three views are 65-degree, 78-degree, and 90-degree. If you are not familiar with what each would offer, the 65-degree view is a close-up view of your face, the 78-degree is more balanced with your face and some of the background, and the 90-degree view shows more of the background with you in the center.<br/><br/>You also have omnidirectional microphones with noise-canceling to reduce background sounds to make the voice clear. It does not take away a cat meowing in the background, but I do notice less noise from my chair if I slightly spin.  I have not had any results where my voice is distorted, echoing, or that hollow sound. I think it helps to have two microphones built into this webcam. I want to mention, that the USB cable with this webcam is of high quality. It also is slightly over 7 feet in length.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Great sound quality, crystal-clear video, autofocus, auto light correction, 3 adjustable fields of view, high dynamic range (HDR), the image quality of the camera is impressive, and offers a good range of resolutions with still image and video capture.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The quality of the construction of accessories isn’t consistent with the camera. It feels like I got cheap accessories. Some might consider the price as a con, but I particularly do not. I feel the price matches the quality of this webcam and the features it does have.<br/><br/>Tech:<br/>Supported resolution: 4K/30fps; 1080p/30 or 60 fps; 720p/30, 60, or 90 fps<br/>Diagonal field of view: 65 degrees, 78 degrees, 90 degrees<br/>Focus type: Autofocus<br/>Lens type: Glass<br/>Built-in mic: Stereo-dual Omnidirectional, with 2 microphones<br/>Dimensions: 1.06 inches high x 4.02 inches wide x 1.06 inches deep<br/>Weight: 2.22 ounces<br/>Cable Length: 7.2 feet</span>

<span>Pros<br/>Good sensor, for what you can get on a computer (pc/laptop) I’ve tried it in light and dark rooms. It’t not better than what your getting with an iPhone or high end android device. But it’s a lot better than several I’ve used including other Logitech and some off brands and few Microsoft ones as well as several laptops.<br/><br/>Mics good too<br/><br/>No external branded weird software to get in the way. They kept this clean just as I like it. It’s just works. That’s what we want we are working no nonsense Logitech gets it.<br/><br/>(internal) Software/drivers and hardware is good: this is what I mean. Logitech generally an expensive company. You could say overpriced, but their stuff has worked well for me when competing products haven’t. The mice for example are fantastic. They have these little touches and never fails that’s not the review but I’m just saying their products are well together on the software end. Autofocus works no messing around with your operating system trying to get the camera to work. It works fine with Team and Zoom.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Cost: I mean 170 is a lot of money for  good but not high end camera. Think about a high end Iphone or a highend Samsung phone. You almost expect that for a 200 stand alone camera. This is sharp but it can’t touch those kinds of cameras on color or light handling. Does it matter for office calls. Ehh, but still your spending this you must care right? I did. I got tired of looking like a faded blurry mess which is why i upgraded to this. Your just not making memory here. They aren't artistic beautiful web cam pictures but you look pretty decent.<br/><br/>The biggest con for me is the stand. I get it everyone will complain about a stand I’m telling you take their 910/920 series and give me that stand anyway. It sticks better on the monitor, it pivots way better. This thing has a tripod attachment, but I don’t know many offices workers sticking a tripod on the desk. This is the place where I thought they could do a ton better. I mean I can live with it, but it needlessly sucks. Once you get it right it’s basically set and forget well unless if you are a call with a whiteboard and moving around or something (I do that).<br/><br/>It's a good camera. I ‘d probably do it again, because again the other ones just don’t create clear video or have other problems, I prefer to buy something good rather and keep it for like 10 years. I had a C910 for 10-11 years until it got a bit flakey. I bought a Microsoft one before that the cam studio where the autofocus never worked right and kept getting crappy ones form my it department that had weird issues or were impossible to see fine details. I finally expensed this, they pushed back and I just appealed to them … environmental care … buy suggesting continuing to buy me crap that breaks or doesn’t’ wrok will just fill landfills. Just get me a good camera and be done with it.  They are happy because I went away and shut up about the camera . And I am because I ‘ve got Gorilla tape holding a great camera to my monitor. It’s  win for everyone. I think you’ll be happy. You’ll be mildly annoyed with the stand. Don’t expect iphone. Expect good computer camera for calls.</span>

<span>I have had this camera since Feb and while I do like it, unlike my Kiyo Pro, there is NO auto focus. This amazed me as I just found this out recently. According to Elgato this is a streamer based camera so they removed unneeded functions for streamers. Removing the mic I understand, but it baffles me why they would remove auto focus. I only found this out when taking a proctored exam online and had to show my ID. The Facecam was my main camera I was using. The text was very blurry and made it challenging for them to confirm. So I later tested on my other webcam, and I could see it adjusting the focus. This, in my opinion, is a big miss from Elgato. I think I might just pick up another Razer Kiyo Pro for this reason.</span>

<span>Aside from the flaw (which I will get to), the camera is pretty awesome.  I think the most impressive part of it for me is the battery life. I wish there were a 4K option, but it's a small sacrifice given the price point.  Now, the flaw...<br/><br/>You cannot change the aspect ratio of the camera.  It is always 16:9 which means that streaming on popular platforms like TikTok and Instagram shouldn't be a thing since these apps work best using 9:16 ratio. Now, if you're ok with simply recording versus livestreaming, you can lay the camera over to achieve 9:16.  Then, during the editing process, rotate the image.  Aside from that issue, the Mevo Start is a flawless budget camera.</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>I've had this camera for a few weeks now.  I have shot with it and really like the performance as it relates to my job as a private investigator.<br/>I love the time and date stamp, the small discrete screen and the video quality for the size which is better demonstrated on the computer than on the device.  Nothing is smaller with a live screen that I've found.  I took it apart to see if I could move the camera to the top of the device so that I could lay it flat on a table and film more covertly.  Unfortunately the camera is fused to the mother board instead of on a ribbon connection. So no looking downward to the screen while on a table or while in the palm of my hand.  The good thing about the camera is that I believe (although I have not measured the diameter) it has a M7 lens which offers more options from wide to telephoto replacements than the M5 or M6 cameras.</span>

I used the waterproof case during the times that I knew it would be submerged under water (in the ocean, at the waterpark).  I did not use the case for times where it might just get splashed (parasailing, etc).  Overall, I had no issues.  Battery life isn't the best but that is the standard complaint among all of these type of cameras so I bought extra batteries.  The battery/memory card compartment is difficult to open but that is expected if you want a waterproof seal.  It is much simpler to use than my GoPro 4.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This action camera comes with an impressive hard carry case, big enough to carry the camera, all accessories and camera mounts. However, while it provides very good protection, it is a bit overkill. Action cameras are generally purchased to perform a particular purpose for a user and therefore would not normally require all accessories to be carried. No problem if it’s in the boot of a car but impractical in a backpack or such.<br/><br/>The camera itself is a study little thing, measuring 5 x 4 x 2.5 cm and weighs in at just 69g. It uses a microSD class 3 card but this doesn’t come supplied with the camera. The camera is pitched as having a resolution of 4K. While this is true, it is only 4K at 10 fps, 2.7K at 15fps but produces better footage at 1440p and 1080p which have much better frame rates. 30fps and 60fps respectively. More suitable for capturing the “action”.<br/><br/>It shoots stills photographs at a high resolution of 16mp but this can be reduced to 12mp or 8mp.<br/>A minor niggle for me is that the camera operation is not very intuitive. Strangely the power button doubles as video recording start with a dedicated stop button on the top of the camera. The instruction book is decent. Operation and settings are easy to understand.<br/><br/>The free downloadable smartphone app worked great for me and enables control of the camera via wifi. Useful for operating a mounted camera where the buttons aren’t easily accessible. All-in-all I’m happy with this camera. It functions well and comparative to the big-name alternatives. Unless you particularly need or want a GoPro this camera will do as good a job for a much reduced cost.</span>

<span>My initial impressions are quite good.<br/><br/>It's really, really tiny and solidly made. You'll need a micro SD card. Read the instructions because there are a couple of things that aren't totally obvious, like how you press the power switch to start the video and the red video button to stop it. But it's easy enough to master.<br/><br/>There are quite a few settings, but the touch screen makes changing them easy, even though it's very small. I like the various interval setting to capture stop motion movies, and you can do things like automatically take a still photo during video every two or five or more seconds. You can record just video and not sound (sound is poor), or both, or set it to start recording when it senses camera movement... a useful armoury of settings.<br/><br/>You can connect by wi-fi to your phone too and see what the camera sees and access its controls and settings – very useful if it's attached to a helmet or something. This works very well for me. You can also transfer videos and photos to your phone this way. You can also connect to a remote shutter release (like on a selfie stick) with Bluetooth.<br/><br/>For video, Veho recommends the 1080p60 (60 frames per second full HD), which gives good, sharp, smooth results. The f/2.5 lens means it not going to be too bad in low light or underwater. You can also record at 720p100 for super smooth  or slow motion, and then there's the 4K10 setting... Hmm. Ten frames per second? That's poor. So this is a 4K video device in name only, so don't be misled. Ten frames is unacceptably jerky and awful. There's electronic image stabilisation though, which works 'quite' well but is no replacement for a gimbal.<br/><br/>It records still photos at 12MP but stills look mediocre. Use your phone instead.<br/><br/>I like the big, chunky plastic carry case with foam inserts so you can take all your accessories safely with you. And it comes with quite a few. The best is a crystal waterproof case good for 40m depth. There's also a slightly flimsy 'quick release' 'case' that like the waterproof case clicks into one of the included mounts; these have adhesive pads so aren't re-usable – once you've stuck them on something, that's it. And there are some small soft pads and an orange rubber thing that doesn't have any obvious purpose.<br/><br/>What it lacks is a tripod mount, or any kind of temporary means of attaching the camera to things. You'll have to delve into the wonderful world of accessories for these!<br/><br/>The obvious comparison you'll make is with the GoPro Hero series. GoPro costs a lot more actually but does 'proper' 4K60 video with really good image stabilisation and is waterproof without an extra case, though not to 40m.<br/><br/>But this action cam takes fairly solid 1080p60 video and is cute and super tiny (even in its waterproof case) and easy to use. Wi-fi works well and the accessory case is a bonus. You pays your money and your takes your choice, as they say.</span>

<span>Camera is dependent on separate app to view and download the video's. The iPhone app is unusable making the camera unfit-for-purpose. In addition the battery life at 4k resolution appears to be about 10 minutes from a full-charge when running the WiFi connection attempting to download the content! A shame as this could of been a could little camera...</span>

<span>Unlike many action cameras which supply no extras and which have to be purchased separately, with this you get a good 'starter pack' with several bits and pieces (two sticky mounting bases plus a frame mount and waterproof case mount). It's good that you get a hard carry case with it, but the case is rather on the large side - nearly half of it is taken up by an unnecessarily large foam block to hold the camera, and there is quite a thick foam surround in the bottom half and thick padding in the lid, all of which could have been much smaller and thinner allowing the case to be more compact.<br/><br/>You need to supply your own micro SD card (it will take up to 64GB). Charging is via the supplied USB to USB Micro B cable. There is an access panel for inserting and removing the battery; I assume you can purchase extra batteries to replace when you are out in the field. (Don't make the mistake I nearly did of very nearly pulling the tape off the battery thinking it was a protective strip that needed to be removed before use - will teach me to RTFM first.)<br/><br/>Video and image quality seems quite good. Sound quality (if you choose to record this with your video) is not great but then that seems as far as I can tell to be a bit of an issue in general with these kind of compact action cameras.<br/><br/>The set of instructions is quite good and clear, and it's generally simple and easy to understand (though I do find it a bit odd that the on/off button on the front doubles as the start recording button and there is a separate stop recording button on the top). There is a very useful mobile app which connects to the camera via wi-fi so you can control it remotely and even use it to send images and video straight from the camera to social networks.</span>
