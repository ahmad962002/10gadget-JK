<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Excellent quality image and night vision.  However I dropped my rating to 4 stars for these reasons:  first of all the online description is inaccurate.  The camera comes mounted on a different style bracket than shown in the Amazon ad.  Secondly the field of vision spec is incorrect - actual field of vision is 150 degrees - not 105 degrees as listed in ad.  Neither of these issues were a problem for me but it might be for someone else.  And lastly there was no warranty information and no help line or contact information for support.  Hopefully I will never need it.</span>

<span>Update:<br/>This unit is so much better than the wireless units on long RVs. They sent me a FREE 2nd camera so now I can see the 5th wheel hitch and the pin box when hooking up.<br/><br/>I bought this wired system to replace the wireless system we have been using on our 44' 5th wheel.  The wireless system was always intermittent.  I t would work at &lt;5MPH, when passing close by hills or underpasses, when passing semi's but an intermittently and always with a delay the rest of the time.  On top of that, the camera itself failed twice over the last 4 years.<br/>So, I decided to go back the the old fashioned and very reliable wireless system that we used on our previous DRV 5th wheel.  Reliable, good picture and good night vision.<br/><br/>I cannot attest to the life of this product but the picture is good, plenty of settings options on the display and the vendor responds quickly to inquires.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>No fading in/out.<br/>A must for longer trailers.<br/>No delay in the image like wireless.<br/>Good display.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>Is harder to install if your trailer isn't wired for analog backup camera.<br/>Requires connecting/disconnecting cable at stops.<br/><br/>Will add to the review when I get some time on the unit regarding reliability.</span>

<span>I mounted this camera on the rear of our 24' toyhauler, just under the flood light at the very top of the ramp door. It sits about 9' off the ground. Installation was easy and I had no trouble running the wire where I wanted to. The wiring itself, though, is cheap and flaky. If you jiggle the connections, even with the locking rings securely fastened, the image on the screen will cut out. You have to get everything held in place just so, then tape the cable down or otherwise somehow fix it in place so it can't move. I got one replacement harness from the seller and that was a little better, but the image still jiggles from the 23' foot cable going from the camera to the harness. Not sure I'll bother trying to get that one replaced, too.<br/><br/>Once you get an image it's nowhere near as crisp as what's shown on the listing. It's OK, but doesn't by any means have the contrast, detail or color depth the listing shows, regardless of any adjustments that can be made to the monitor's display. I haven't tested it at night yet, so can't comment on any aspects of that. The screen also needs to be mounted so you can view it dead on, otherwise a slight angle can make the screen image dim quickly.<br/><br/>The backup lines are just that: strictly for backup. I've seen some cameras that allow you to turn them off or on whether you are in reverse or drive, but not this system. You would need to somehow connect the "reverse trigger" wire to be energized at all times. However, that would probably also continuously energize the night vision LEDs and burn them out well ahead of schedule.<br/><br/>Why would you want the backup lines on when you are driving forward? Because the biggest weak link of this system is the extraordinarily wide angle view of the camera, and the backup lines MIGHT give you some rough estimate of how close behind you other traffic is. Having used this system several times now, I can clearly state that its only real value (at least as an RV rear view camera) is in detecting whether there is someone directly behind the camper or not. For traffic in a lane to your left or right, the camera view is so sweeping that by the time a vehicle is close enough to you to be able to identify it on the monitor, it's already practically right on the camper's rear bumper. What appears as a dime-sized blob on the screen (Is that a car or a truck?) is actually so close it's already fully visible in, and fully filling, your side view mirror. You really cannot safely use it to determine if it's OK to change lanes or not unless you see absolutely nothing at all on the monitor (or in your mirrors). That may be OK on the open highway, but once you get in town and everyone is tailgating or cruising in someone's blind spot, this camera will definitely not give you peace of mind when changing lanes.<br/><br/>I thought perhaps changing the "zoom" setting to 4:3 instead of 16:9 might help, but all that does is prove that the 16:9 setting merely stretches the 4:3 image to fill the screen. There is absolutely no different in the image content itself. I was hoping I could actually zoom the image to make it more closely resemble real life, but the "zoom" feature is just a toggle between 4:3 and stretched 4:3.<br/><br/>The optics and usefulness of this camera MAY be different if I mounted it much lower on the camper, but I doubt it. It needs to be high enough that a car behind you doesn't take up the entire screen and you need to be able to see what's BEHIND that close car. If you just want to know if someone is behind you in your lane, this system is OK. If you want to rely on it to see if it's safe to CHANGE lanes, don't. The image is just way too wide-angle to be useful for that.<br/><br/>I rolled out a tape measure and had my wife stand at 25' behind the camper, then put small strips of white tape on the monitor to line up with where a car would be at that distance. I haven't tested that out yet, but that would be the minimum safe distance for changing lanes IF the traffic isn't fast approaching. If this system had a more natural angle of view, that "calibration" wouldn't be necessary. I shouldn't have to be so fixated on the camera image, trying to determine what I'm really looking at to figure out where the nearby traffic REALLY is, that using this setup makes driving less safe, not more.<br/><br/>You should consider this system to be an accessory to, and in no way a substitute for, your rear view mirrors.</span>

<span>works decently and as expected with no problems. I do wish it was capable of viewing both cameras in reverse while mounted on each rear corners of the vehicle. I have a bucket truck and mounted them so i can see both corners of my rear bumper when backing up so I do not run over anything or anyone. The only way to have split screen with both cameras is to have them constantly on, as the reverse trigger switches to one camera mode.

I contacted their support and was told unfortunately the wireless system uses the same frequency as my Ford's TPMS system.

<span> Works good not good for cars trucks suv has to be mounted high like top of an rv because of the camera view I put in in a honda accord camera is big and like I said needs to be mounted up high for a good view and same with the guide lines is not designed to be mounted low but since I already put thee holes in my trunk one for the wire which is pretty big and 2 holes for mounting hope this helps anyone wanting to install in a car truck or suv wish I would have known but for the price it's ok but I would of spent more if I would of know I disconnected the blue wire it's for the guide lines that are useless if not mounted high</span>

<span>Update: Seller contacted me and offered a half refund. Appreciated nice customer service. Wasn’t expecting that. Just be weary of what you need it for before purchasing to save you a hassle if one is REALLY needed. If it’s not daily use it’s suitable. But for daily use just save yourself the hassle and keep looking.<br/><br/>Installation was not easy. Once installed had to use gorilla double sided mounting tape to really get it to adhere securely. Night vision is in black and white and rather pointless but we won’t need it then anyhow for our use of it while camping to see the pop up camper behind us. The picture quality is stunning. It looks crystal clear during the day. That is the main pro to this. Tried to turn the directional lines off since we aren’t using it to actually reverse into a parking spot but after turning them off it still remains on. Weird. The screen also won’t power off when we don’t need to use it. Glad this isn’t for everyday use as a backup camera or I’d be irritated and returning. Decent enough for a visual though of the camper and will just unplug the screen when not being used.</span>

<span>The installation and kit are awesome. So many others include a huge cable. This beautiful design includes an extension cable that you can use if needed but if you just need a short run that is also possible. No need to hide 20ft of cable. The camera is firmly set in the mount so rotation and aiming are doable without worrying about it falling out of place. So why 3 star? The lens that is on the camera is curved, causing the image to be distorted. Also, the camera is good for an overall view, but if something is within 10-24 inches the image is not sharp. Very hard to make out details. I need a small camera like this but I need it to work up close and far away. Auto focus would be great. I would pay more.<br/><br/>9/2/2022 UPDATE - Seller contacted me and is sending me a different model that may be better suited. Raised from 3 to 4 stars for customer service. The camera is still working.</span>

<span>I got this camera for my 2004 town car. I didn’t expect much, I didn’t really expect it to look as good as my camera on my 2017 explorer or my hubby’s 2020 Mazda. BUT, it looks a thousand times better. This teeny thing shows everything behind you and then some. I have two pictures, one I took at my dentist office that shows the building on the other side of the street! And the other is at the end of my driveway, that shows the two house across the street, which are about 100 yards apart! It’s crazy how far this thing can see. Plus it’s teeny so as an after market camera it works great, because you can hardly see it on the car. Also, the green guidelines are perfect for someone like me who is terrible at backing and parking. I follow the lines and I’m good to go.</span>

<span>TL;DR: just buy this one, you won't get a better backup camera. An excellent piece of hardware that is very small, has tons of mounting options, and will therefore will look at home on just about on any car you install it on.<br/><br/>Been waiting for a small backup camera that won't look like a giant black wart on my car's butt. I installed this on my '99 4runner right in the license plate tailgate area and love it. The 210 degree FOV is HUGE, almost too wide for how I have it mounted.. but it does give me a very clear view of both ends of my car and what I'm backing up to. Also helpful when towing, so I'm glad I went with the wider one.<br/><br/>The camera itself is quite small and looks great on the car - is just about as good as OEM if you put the work into mounting it well. Feels super high-quality. There's plenty of wiring to get up to the head unit with length to spare, zip ties and a variety of mounting hardware is all included and of good quality. Picture quality is great and the image at night is solid w/ some decent backup lights installed (I have a couple AUXITO-branded LEDs in there - see photo of head unit. Note that those are not the camera's reverse lines - I disabled those and set mine up via a Sony head unit). Instructions are clear as day and the reverse trigger works great.<br/><br/>INSTALL TIP: if you install this in a tailgate and need to tap a reverse light in a different place, you can cut a slit in the cable at the appropriate place after routing it and cut+pull the trigger wire out wherever you can find 12v reverse-switched power. In my car I did this at the driver side rear light after routing out the top of the tailgate through the stock grommets. Just be careful when cutting open the cable so you don't sever the video/power cables in there too. Think about your cable routing, that's the hardest part since it's car-specific. Otherwise easy as pie to set up.</span>

<span>When traveling in my RV, I tow my Jeep Wrangler.  I am unable to see the Jeep while I am driving the RV and I like to know (often) it is still attached as I drive.  I have a Back-Up Camera on the RV, but it only displays the image when the RV is in Reverse and when the Emergency Lights are activated.  I want to be able to see the Jeep at ALL times.<br/><br/>This product is perfect for my needs.  Before I leave on a trip, I connect the camera to the back window inside the RV (to not worry about weather or the camera growing legs) and I mount the monitor next to my GPS on the front windshield.  My RV is 32 feet long and there has never been an issue with the wireless image being displayed on the monitor.<br/><br/>I did have an issue with the cord for the camera.  The wires became detached from a circuit board.  It was past the warrantee period (one year), so I contacted Auto-Vox via email for "Repair Advice".  The customer service rep, Gigi responded the same day offering two solutions:<br/><br/>1) Bypass the circuit board:  The circuit board in the box is a filter box for German-made vehicles<br/>if that did not work:<br/>2) She said: " I will send a new supply cable to you to solve the problem."<br/><br/>I was able to bypass the circuit board (solution #1) and the camera is working again.  It was really great to know that the Auto-Vox stood behind their product (even when I was out of the warrantee period).<br/><br/>The response/advise from Gigi was very timely, friendly, and definitely added to my brand loyalty for Auto-Vox.</span>

<span>I’ve had this for 14 months now (bought in August of ‘21). It has survived Hurricane Ida, plenty of rain and wind through the rest of the year, and nearly daily use. There has only been one issue that I’ve come across, and it just started recently. I believe my converter that allows the camera to be plugged into the car lighter has a short in it. For now, all I have to do is touch it and it’ll immediately work, but I’m not sure how long it’ll last. For what it’s priced at, this thing has been incredible and I’d recommend it to anybody needing a cheaper backup camera option. Don’t expect any high quality video feed, because it’s not the greatest. However, it gets the job done and has a great night time view. Setting it up is much more simple than most negative reviews make it out to be. I struggled with it for only a moment, and then was able to figure out my issue from YouTube. It really is a great device, and you can at least expect a year or more of zero issues.</span>

<span>Installed it in a 20 year old Accord. Watched plenty of videos and read the manual thoroughly before installing and so installation was without a hitch. The accord did not have any holes in the trunk lid through which I could pass the wire internally, so had to drill a small hole, no biggie.<br/><br/>A couple of things that can be improved<br/>- The tap supplied to hook into existing DC power cables are unconventional. Would've been better if they had given the T-taps.<br/>- The screen can only be powered using the  conventional 12-V power socket. It would've been better if they also given an option to power the screen by tapping into 12-V power cables directly, just like the camera.<br/>- Lastly, the screen holder can't be moved once installed. Would've loved the flexibility to move it.</span>

<span>A couple of issues; camera placement &amp; durability. I purchased for 2009 Ford E350 van for viewing boat trailer coupling to ball hitch.  The license plate holder of the van is recessed into the passenger rear cargo door. Camera would not fit using the license plate top screws. Camera is too large. It would fit on bottom screw but illegally obscure license plate. It is a box style camera.  I affixed the camera to the most lower left side of right cargo door using the "3m" adhedive backing that was on the camera mount.  This location was chosen to facilitate the best view of the trailer hitch; center of vehicle. Durability of adhesive backing is unknkown. I fished the camara wires under door weatherproofing strip into the vehicle then behind the  interior door panel  through body wiring plug into tail light back up light.  The camera has a single screw parallel to the back of the camera which attaches to the metal mount supplied &amp; designed to be used by mounting on license plate. It is unknown if the screw is stainless steel or not. The metal mount appears to be non-stainless steel, painted black. The metal is very thin. The durability of this matetial is unknown as it is exposed to outdoor weather. After completing installation i applied liquid tape over the exposed screws to help weatherproif it. I use liquid tape on my boat wiring.  Installation requires a simple 12v circuit probe to ID + &amp; - wires. My instalkation required removing interior door panel of cargo door, routing wires through soft plug harness to tail light which needs to be removed to wire to camera to back up + &amp; - wires.  I was not 100% satisfied with product, but it does the job.  KEY ISSUE: Is there enough room above the top license plate screws to facilitate attaching the camera? Every vehicle is different. I recommend Seller and/or manufacturer provide the minimum measurement from the top license plate screw hole to top of camera for mounting their product. This is very simple for them to provide. I will post follow- up on durability &amp; how it holds up in FL weather.</span>

<span>Great set up for 4X4 as its not routing cables into the cab. Had problems when wired to the lights (backing and main) as the system would shut down when the engine started. Obviously some level of interference such as power surge with my vehicle (Ford Ranger). Would not work with engine running. But after wiring a USB outlet to the more stable canopy interior light the problem was solved. The horizontal and vertical fields of view are great and include the tow bar and rear traffic with the camera mounted just above the number plate. Placed the wifi transmitter in the back corner in direct line of sight through cab and canopy windows and it is strong, consistent and fires up in about 10 seconds once I start the Casoda app, and remains powered up until I unplug the camera/wifi. So good I've ordered another one for my SUV.</span>

<span>I have ordered a few of these. I had one installed in my 98 4runner. Everything was fine and worked as it should. I rolled down the back and window BAM, broke the wires completely. I spliced it back together but I didn’t want to run the risk of something happening again so I ordered another one. The one that came in had HORRIBLE picture quality, I knew this wasn’t normal because I have others from this brand/company and they were fine. I purchased this a month or so, maybe more than that ago. But customer service was fantastic, gotta give them props. They didn’t have me hassle with having to pull everything out, they apologized for the issue and sent me out a new one right away. I installed the new one and looks just as good as the other ones. Obviously it was an issue with that one camera, maybe it was bad, whatever. But the seller/company took care of me and that is the only reason I am writing this review. With so much bad customer service out there these days it’s nice to find a company that will actually help you with little to no questions asked. Awesome experience.<br/><br/>Now on to the backup camera:<br/>My only issue with a lot of these backup cameras is they narrow the viewing angle in order to provide a better picture, I get that, but I’m not trying to read a newspaper behind me so I want the widest view  possible, 149° isn’t bad but it isn’t great. If you’re at the store backing up and somebody is JUST to the right or left if you bumper, you won’t see em, the viewing angle isn’t wide enough. So please be careful even using your backup camera. Otherwise, it’s been 4wheeling, through car washes, through mud, you name it, it’s been through it and it’s held up just fine. For the price you really can’t go wrong and the customer service is top notch. My ONLY complaint again, is the viewing angle. Otherwise I’d highly recommend this product for anyone looking to add a backup camera.</span>

<span>These cameras are so straighforward to install (in theory). You can and should test the camera prior to full installation (just sit in your front seat, wire it to the radio, and make sure it is working with your HU). I put this in a 2006 Toyota Sienna and my HU was a Boss Audio BE7ACP-FT. The most time consuming part was running the video cable all the way back, then into the lifting tailgate on my van and finding a good way out to the license plate frame.  The supplied cables were more than long enough (I installed along the headliner back to the tailgate from the passenger side)<br/><br/>My only legitimate complaint with this camera is the big thick plastic bracket that the camera is mounted in. It partially covers up my registration tags (both month and year), as well as obscures the state. Don't know if the local police will make a big deal of this or not. Slim down that bracket, reinforce with some metal if necessary, but no reason it has to be soooo thiccc.</span>

<span>The backup camera is easy to install. The only problem I had was my camera was powered all the time so that I could use it when towing just by turning on the monitor. Since this camera has lights, those white lights are on all the time. They are very bright. If your camera is powered all the time you may want to consider this.</span>

<span>I have a 2013 Elantra that i upgraded the stereo on and it had rear/ forward camera options i didn't need it i can back up just fine without it but i got it for the heck of it. at the time cost was $25. probably the best $25 i have ever spent on my Elantra!<br/><br/>first of installation i did it myself needed youtube of course but that and the instructions and a few tools ( soldering rod probably the only one i had to purchase but electrical tape will do) and i got it to work. it has the option to lay lines out on the image or you can use your stereo customizable lines if you unit allows , just one cut of a wire and the pre set lines are gone. also the light that it has to assist you at night are super bright.<br/><br/>i knocked out the ground one time while packing up the trunk and i bought a second one then realizing my mistake i re grounded worked just as always so i am installing second camera in front license plate , really has helped with those tight parallel parking spots<br/><br/>as for picture quality it is better than my stock 2018 Honda accords back up camera picture the only thing as for quality that i have ever noticed is if the sun directly hits lens it makes the sun look black like an eclipse kinda cool looking but short of that my purchase was a great one will definitely recommend if you have rear view camera options power supply is 12v required and the in put to unit is a traditional av yellow jacket plug</span>
