<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>I found this camera to have less zoom capability than the Canon PowerShot SX 70 HS, but much easier and more intuitive to set from the menus.  It has similar capabilities overall. It is somewhat better for macro photos but is not as good for landscape in my experience.  It has good innards and a Leica lens.<br/>It is a bridge, or hybrid camera and is very handy, but does not have the capabilities of a DSLR.<br/>There are better YouTube tutorials for this camera, than the Canon PowerShot SX 70.</span>

<span>This camera is my first camera ever (other then my phone). To say I’m absolutely in love with this camera is a under statement. Ever photo I’ve taken so far has came out crystal clear! The little things around my house including my kitten that with a phone doesn’t pop much absolutely come to life! I bawled when my camera came in. I have been scraping up every penny to be able to save up for this camera and I’m so happy I did. One thing I do wish it came with was a lense protecter. I have seen mentions of uv lense protecters that are supposed to be absolutely wonderful. If you do get this camera save a little extra to get one. Once I can save up I’m getting me one. It is a super easy camera to learn especially for beginners. It is not heavy at all, which comes in handy for if you are doing long photo shoots. Another thing I wish it came with was a camera cleaner. Or things that told you what was safe to clean the camera with. Obviously not water but are glasses cleaners safe? Or is there a specific camera cleaner? Not sure but other then that I’m beyond happy!</span>

<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

<span>I'm just a hobbyist photographer and wanted a better quality camera with interchangeable lenses. This fit what I was looking for and the price range I was in. My photos are decent, but can get better as I learn more about post processing and editing. But this camera has served me well for years and I've used it a lot while on trips with excellent results at least to me. I do wish it better stabilization. Some third party brand lenses that have stabilization in them won't work with this camera body. Only Panasonic branded lenses will work with the stabilization for this model. The newer cameras are more up-to-date with this stuff and interchangeable with the stabilization.<br/>I may upgrade in the future but this camera is still great quality and I will continue to use until then.</span>

Canon’s all-new 45 Megapixel full-frame sensor is at the heart of the EOS R5’s superb image quality, which also leads the way for impressive8K DCI cinematic movie capture with the ability to extract 35.4 Megapixel still images. Focus and speed are paramount in the EOS R5, providingimpressive continuous capture at speeds of up to 20 frames-per-second and with Dual Pixel CMOS AF II capability, to track split secondmovements of even the most elusive of subjects. With 1,053 Automatic AF zones, it is easier than ever to photograph people with the use ofEye, Face and Head Detection AF, or intuitively track the whole body, face or eye of cats, dogs, or birds with Animal Detection AF. The 5-axisin-body image stabilization can effectively compensate for camera shake with approximately 8 stops of stabilization with use of both non-stabilized,and optically image stabilized lenses. Connectivity like 5GHz and 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, is also included.

<span>The elephant in the room is the cost and video issues. I don't do video so I don't care about that aspect and Canon has fixed some of the issues with the latest firmware releases. As for the cost, there is no getting around it. For those able/willing to accept it, you will be getting a great camera. I was an old DSLR snob for the longest time but I haven't touched my DSLRs since I got this. I primarily shoot wildlife (birds) and landscape images. The shots I get with the R5 are incredible. I opted for the R5 over the R6 knowing that I would occasionally need to crop in for some bird images. I am able to maintain quality when cropping.<br/><br/>The eye detection is truly amazing. I am continually surprised at how well the camera detects the birds from great distances through brush and busy backgrounds. That being said, there are times where I will revert to spot focusing since the camera will sometimes miss eye focus. The autofocus is also great for locking onto birds in flight. As a long time hobbyist, I could never hope to focus quick enough. The R5 eye detection allows me to capture images I would normally not get.<br/><br/>I also use the camera to take pictures of my son's soccer games. I can track player movement, focus on specific players in a group, capture fast moving sequences. At 12 fps in mechanical mode, I am able to stop action with ease. I did use electronic shutter and it is smooth like butter. You are essentially taking a very fast stop action video. The problem is that you don't realize how many pictures you are capturing when you hold down the shutter button. You can fill a card pretty quickly in electronic mode. I only shoot to the SD card slot and have never filled the buffer during a game.<br/><br/>Again, this is an expensive camera but it is worth the price tag for my uses. Great image quality. Incredible eye detection autofocus. Good image quality at high ISO (not a lot of noise). Ability to use my old EF lenses with an adapter with no loss in image quality or autofocus speeds. I have used the R5 with RF lenses and they do add another level of quality and decrease weight. I am just not ready to sell all my old EF lenses to invest in a pure RF system.</span>

<span>It's was quite an investment but after being in the field with it. Well worth the cost for the images it produces. Coming from the Canon R... which is still a fine camera. I must say, having conditioned myself to use the finger slide to control various settings and the 4-way tap button, the "old school" joystick and rotating wheel is like having a MacBook Pro 2021 model and trading it in for a Mac SE — regarding the controls. The Canon R was fast with click of the Q button, tap the wheel to make your selection, click the center button. Canon R5, I click the Q button, the have to go up to the joystick to make select then back down to the OK button in the rotating wheel. Not as easy to do with your eye in the viewfinder. However the image quality trumps the little issues like those.<br/><br/>The Canon R5 C was a considerable choice however it reverts back to no built in stabilization like the R. And I believe it lost the gimbal control to see if your camera is level or pointed more upward and downward. Both I can't live without.</span>

<span>I've had several M-series cameras, this one has much faster auto focus and better light sensitivity then the predecessors. I have tried telephoto with the 50-200mm lens, but the pictures aren't sharp, perhaps it's the lens or it really requires a tripod even in bright light. It's decent for macro work, I'm using the 22mm for that.  I've taken some nice landscapes with a Rokinon 8mm and I've got a 12mm Rokinon on the way to do a little astro photog.<br/>I've decided I'm not a huge fan of not having a real view finder and the zoom in on the screen is limited so fine focus can be a bit of an issue at times. I got the silver-top model and was a bit disappointed that it's not metal.</span>

<span>This camera is awesome, it has everything one needs out of box with little need for anything else only extra batteries that can be found 3rd party via Amazon.<br/><br/>The amount of options for an optical camera like this is so amazing. I like how the digital display explains what every feature does for video or pictures for noobs like me. I love the CMOS sensor that allows one to zoom without losing quality by simply using sensor cropping.<br/><br/>The mic is pretty good but I'll probably upgrade that soon for better clarity. The EVF is awesome! No more having to squint at the screen on sunny days trying to see what the tracking is seeing. It's like having a hood for your screen.<br/><br/>I am happy I went with this little combo than just the DSLR combo with tons of things you don't need cause this beats it. Always go with mirrorless cameras, it's the latest in camera tech, trust me. Do your research on the differences.</span>

<span>It's not a full frame.  But I didn't buy it for that. It's much lighter, much smaller and much cheaper than my R5.<br/>Is ridiculously portable.  I can carry it and a whole bunch of EF-M lenses and it will weigh less than my old 5D3 with an 85 mm attached.<br/>One caveat: get the EVF.  I bought the kit ....<br/>With the 11-22 it's a very good camera.<br/><br/>With the 32mm f1.4, (attached photo) its superb!!<br/>Other really nice lenses that I have used are the 28 mm macro, the kit lens and the 55-200.  I bought a Viltorx adapter for $38 here and mounted EF lenses on this thing.  They work flawlessly!<br/><br/>Update:  I have had it for 11 months now.  My main reason for buying was portability.  I took it to Hawaii, Key West and London.  Was great for travel.</span>

<span>I bought the lumix as a lower cost replacement for my Sony zv-1 that met with an untimely demise. I love that it’s mirrorless and offers the option to change lenses. The onboard mics are good and it has audio tracking so the audio follows you around. Good face recognition autofocus. The only thing I miss with the zv-1 was the ability to blur the background at the touch of a button. This camera actually requires you to do that with aperture settings. The kit lense isn’t great but it’s good enough if you’re vlogging and using intelligent auto settings. If you want more performance you’ll need to pick up a better micro 4/3 lense which there are a ton of affordable options out there.</span>

<span>Unlike Panasonic's own YouTube tutorial, the advertised WebCam capability is not incorporated in this model.  With the Lumix WebCam software installed, when you connect the camera using the supplied cable the viewfinder does show the necessary PC (Tether) option.  It will only output the Lumix Home Screen, not the lens image.  Since there is zero coverage of the WebCam feature in the manual or Panasonic's site other than the YouTube video, you aren't getting that feature.<br/><br/>OK, so you don't want to use it for video streaming.  Is it OK?<br/><br/>It apparently has no onboard storage like some of the cameras in this price range.  Regardless of the word OPTIONAL associated with the SD card, you need one it appears.  Nothing in the instructions say it needs additional storage unless you go past 4GB, but it does.<br/><br/>OK, you didn't expect it to have onboard storage, is it OK?<br/><br/>The camera is quite dainty.  The ON/OFF switch is smallest I've seen on a camera.  If it cold out, or you are wearing thin gloves, you might have to operate the switches visually instead of by feel.  You have to operate some of the features, like charge port, the LCD viewfinder, the top view focus knob, the flash, with your fingernails.  If you have no fingernails?  You might have to bring something to work it.  I will guess the charge port door will be the first thing to break on it, since it's flimsy and not restrained well.<br/><br/>I haven't decided whether I'll field test it or not.  I was going to use it for automotive vlogs, but I doubt it will handle light field duty.  Am I expecting too much at this price point?  Perhaps.  That's why I gave it two stars.  I'll keep using my 7 year old camera until I make up my mind.<br/><br/>I wasted 3 hours trying to make the Webcam feature work.  I have many webcams, but I thought this would be a step up.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  While the camera was sold in mid-February 2021, it did not have the November 2020 camera body firmware update v1.2.  This is what enables WebCam capability.  Sort of.  It does not transmit audio like most webcams do, it is simply a device driver for the video output.  The updating process is not well documented, but here is an overview:<br/>1)  Formal SD card with Camera.<br/>2)  Put SD card in computer.<br/>3)  Locate v1.2 firmware on Panasonic's site and download.<br/>4)  Unzip the file into the root directory of the SD card.<br/>5)  Put SD card back in camera, turn on camera, switch to review images mode.<br/><br/>The documentation does not necessarily match the DC-G100 screens.<br/><br/>It doesn't change my opinion on two stars, since the docs are poor, and it becomes a Video-Only webcam even though it has a microphone.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>First, I am a proud owner &amp; professional Videographer who uses Panasonic gear as my primary tool for VIDEO imaging purposes (for pro photo, I have to use Canon alas - wish it was different.. though for everyday photo the GX85 is perfectly fine). I have owned pretty much all flavors of Lumix cameras from GH1, GH2, G6, G7, GH3, GH4 to the GX85. I was excited about the GX85 as a small camera tool to shoot videos on the go for my events without having to use extra gear (gorilla pod, etc) to film detail &amp; movement shots quickly using the new 5-axis IBIS on the GX85 that no other Panasonic camera has. I was very intrigued and positively influenced by reviewers online to purchase this item for my work.<br/><br/>After two events covered (full day weddings), I have to say that there is a lot to like about the GX85 and a few very annoying things to dislike as others have said. Panasonic tends to create many different variations of a camera these days with several big flaws in each so  you have to buy them all it seems...<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/>- The TINY electronic viewfinder is going to be the worse part of this camera. You can barely squeeze your eye into it and accurately use it when you shoot. I don't have big eyes either... After about 5-10mins of usage, my eyes hurt a lot because of the squinting I have to make when shooting with that EVF... And I've never had any issues with other Lumix cameras which I've used for hours non-stop, except the LX100 which I've borrowed in the past and is similarly flawed. I wished they had kept the GX7 type of eyepiece for the viewfinder for this supposedly GX7 mark II update that is the GX85. The resolution isn't bad, and I am not too worried about the ghosting / refresh rate if I can barely get my eyes to see through that EVF viewfinder which also lacks tilting compared to the GX7.<br/>- The battery life is not very good either... With the panasonic OEM battery, you can maybe squeeze 1h15min to 1h30 of recording because you have to rely heavily on the LCD display instead of the EVF... With non-Panasonic batteries, you get about the same depending on which one you buy, but you lose the knowledge of knowing exactly when the battery dies as these cheap batteries will display 2-bars and go suddenly to die after about 1h or 1h30 of usage.<br/>- LCD display lacks degree of movement... It can only tilt a little bit down or a little up to about 30 degrees... So it's useless for selfies or filming with LCD display flipped open like on a GX8, G7 or GH3/4<br/>- Lack of Microphone jack... The audio isn't bad but not nearly as good as a standalone shotgun mic... Plus you get the extra vibration sound from IBIS which can be annoying<br/>- SD card slot under the camera next to battery slot... Makes it hard to change cards when mounted on a tripod...<br/>- Lack of quick manual AF-S/AF-C/MF switching mechanism like on GX7 or GX8... You can program one of the FN button but it still prevents you from switching from AF to MF when you are recording... which is so crippling as often times you just want to switch on the fly between the AF-C and MF without having to stop recording video.<br/><br/>The Pros:<br/>- 5-axis Stabilizer IBIS... Used in conjunction with the Panasonic lenses which have IS on lens... this makes it a very good camera for shooting video &amp; stills without too much blur or shake... The videos are not smooth like when  you use a gimball... but it definitely helps big time. I'd say it's on par with the Olympus IBIS such as that on EM5-Mark II... There are definitely some artifacts though still like jerk in motion... The supplied tiny 12-32mm lens (equivalent of 24 - 64mm Full frame) seems to do a very good job though working with the GX85 on camera IBIS to remove as much shake as possible. It's not perfect though and you will always get better movement shots with a gimbal or stabilizer. But on the go, it does a very good job filming with little shake when you don't have a tripod with you. It's not perfect though and does create some minimal vibration sound/feel to the body.<br/>- 4K and different 1080p video flavors. That's Panasonic's strength... Though it lacks in terms of higher bit rate that you can find on GH4 or GH3. Still the videos are good on this tiny camera<br/>- Lightweight / Can be carried in many places without being obtrusive. It's not tiny but small enough to fit in a jacket pocket. The benefits of Micro 4/3...<br/>- Low light seems to be better than the GH4 or G7. The improved engine seems to give pretty good results even at ISO 3200 for video &amp; photos. I'm glad it improved... Now let's hope we can actually shoot photos at ISO 6400... It's still not there for ISO higher than 3200... An improvement nevertheless compared to past recent LUMIX iterations.<br/><br/>Overall... This is a very good addition to the LUMIX lineup mostly because of the 5-axis In-Body Image Stabilizer Panasonic has finally been able to implement... You only wish Panasonic would actually create a camera that has all of its best features instead of always crippling each new addition with flaws that didn't have to be there... But it's their game these days... Let's hope the GH5 includes the IBIS on the GX85 which is a given, with improved clean &amp; usable ISO6400 video &amp; photo in low light, and I can happily get rid of all my Canon gear for both Photo &amp; Video...</span>

<span> UPDATED 12/30/2021<br/><br/>PROS: Comes with a 2-lens kit at an affordable price; has more features than any competitor at that price; well-constructed and solid housing; many other better brands such as Canon and Nikon have relatively flimsy construction, the menu screen is great better than competitors, great video. If you register with Panasonic, they gave a three-year warranty which came in helpful because I dropped it quite a bit.  I attached a video of a band, and you can see the quality for yourself. This is in a nightclub with poor lighting and acoustics, but I think the camera did a pretty good job.  No camera has everything, but all-in-all this is a great all-around camera.  I can put it in my jacket or coat pocket if I am not using it.<br/><br/>CONS: No built-in mic but not usually needed unless you are using it for professional video but there are workarounds for that.  The sound is actually pretty decent for what I use it for. I attached a video. The viewfinder is small as noted but not as bad as people make it sound.<br/><br/>The negative comments about the battery life or not having a memory card are nonsense or may have been used equipment or defective. I have had no problem with battery BUT I would STRONGLY recommend getting the separate battery pack and extra battery as I would for any mirrorless camera - that is how all of them are.  ALL mirrorless cameras have a shorter battery life than an old SLR because mirrorless cameras are always in use when turned on. If you turn off when you are not using, it lasts quite a while, but unlike an SLR you can't just turn it on and let it sit there without using the battery.  People who complained about this don't know how mirrorless cameras work.<br/><br/>No camera comes with a memory card and not many come with a separate battery back. You could charge in-phone but that's annoying. I have no problem with the wi-fi either. Some people should stick with point and click if they don't want to bother learning how to use a slightly more capable camera.  You would spend at least $1000 to get a better camera as of 2020.  I paid $450 for the 2-lens kit somehow during a sale but even for the recent $600 price, it's a good deal. I got mine last year around Thanksgiving, but I did not see that re-offered at that price. Pictures attached are what I took, including some touching up. Video is out of the can, nothing else. For me the sound is good.<br/><br/>I think this is the best camera in this price range and I would not spend more because I am clumsy and drop it a lot and would be really upset with a more expensive camera. However, Panasonic honored it's 3-year warranty (if you register it) so that was good. I did not buy the extended warranty but in the future, I think I would.<br/><br/>The current price is $795; I paid $450. I still think it's a good camera, but I would wait for a sale. I believe the price increase is due to the supply chain issues.</span>

<span>I mostly use this for video and I'm very impressed with this camera. I want to shoot and then minimize editing as much as possible so that's why I like the G85 so much. The 4k video quality with standard un-graded settings is better than the GH4 I replaced this with.  The clarity and color is better with the standard settings and I don't really have time to get lost in post processing.  I also compared this to the Sony RX10iii and its 4k video quality was just a tiny bit less detailed but the overall look was better with the G85. Also the menu settings are so much easier with the g85 over the Sony.  Also the button placement is much more intuitive with the G85. Auto focus seems about the same but I mainly use manual for video to make sure it stays in focus.  Especially because I'm shooting in a controlled environment.  I'll miss the wide focus range but not by that much and I can always buy more lenses with the G85.  Another thing is the G85 seems like it has a touch less crop shooting in 4k so I can get a slightly larger angle.  That bothers me with all cameras when shooting 4k and I wish I could get the 35mm equivalent of 24mm out of it instead of more like 28mm in 4k. Also it seems that the  Pictures were much better with the G85.  It seems that whenever I put the RX10iii in auto focus to try to get some kid pics for fun 1 out of 5 pics came out correctly where almost every pic comes out correctly with the G85.  For me the f3.5 does a good job but it sure does look better with the f2.8 12-35 lens. I thought my untrained eye might not pick that up but it did. Everything looks better even when comparing f3.5 vs. f3.5.  It's pricey so it might not be for everyone.  I also tried the Sony a6300 and it was an amazing camera but it overheated very quickly weather I pulled the monitor away from the body or not.  So there was no way I could keep it and that's a major deal breaker.  The G85 can get warm but never get's so hot that it over heats and shuts down when shooting for extended periods in 4k.  I shot for about 4-5 hours in a row shootiing 5-8 minute vids at a quick turn around and it never shut down. It got a little warmer than the GH4 and Sony RX10iii but never malfunctioned so all is well.<br/><br/>The one issue I have with the G85 is I wish there was a 4k 30mbps instead of just 4k 100mbps.  I shot around 40 5-8 minute videos and it was something like 122Gb.  I had to use compression software to keep it which is a bit anoyying.  Love the water/dust resistance and that is what kept me from keeping the G7.  It also feels like a better made camera than the G7 with a more intuitive layout too.<br/><br/>If you are like me, an intermediate, who needs a good camera with 4k for work but doesn't want to go too deep into the post processing world it's hard to find a better camera.</span>

<span>I’m a beginner with little knowledge of advanced camera settings so I can only rate this camera from that perspective.<br/><br/>Why I like it -<br/>-30x Zoom (obviously)<br/>-Feels solid - no “cheap plastic” feel here<br/>-Touch screen makes it a lot easier to move around menus and choose options.<br/>-Great indoor photos - I’ve had compact cameras in the past that performed poorly in indoor settings, but I’m happy with the flash shots I’m getting at birthday parties, convention halls, etc).<br/>-Wirelessly transfer photos to my iMac (via iCloud). You have to install an app on your phone or iPad, but once it’s set up it works well).<br/><br/>What I’m not thrilled about -<br/>-It’s heavier and thicker than any compact camera I’ve ever owned. Definitely not a “shirt pocket” camera, it’s even a tight squeeze for most pants pockets.<br/>-While the screen tilts up and down, it doesn’t swivel left to right. Not a big deal, but there are times that would come in handy.<br/>-Too many complex settings and options for a beginner. I’m sure this is the case with all similar cameras, but once you have to leave auto mode and dive into the menus for anything other than changing the date, it's overwhelming. Good thing I’m happy with the auto-mode shots I’m getting.<br/><br/>I don’t do any video recording so I can’t comment on that.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m very happy with the camera and the shots I’m getting from it.

<span>Short review for the ZS70 here, my full review shortly will be published on my blog (google camera name and photographic-central). Quick rant/explanation: I'm giving it 5 stars for two reasons- One, I can't choose 4.5, and two, there were a couple one star reviews here when either the camera wasn't released yet or there was obvious user error. To me, those aren't valid reviews so the extra half point helps to mitigate them (since Amazon hasn't removed the reviews, and probably won't I'm doing my part to keep things fair). Moving on...<br/><br/>Review: There simply aren't any decent pocket-able super zoom cameras on the market that shoot raw. As a professional and enthusiast, I demand raw. I suggest readers who don't use raw learn how to so that they can get the most out of the TZ70. This camera has a very small sensor, but, it is a modern BSI CMOS, which means it's very efficient for the size of its pixels. As long as you have reasonable expectations from a sensor this size, it will probably exceed those expectations. Image quality from raw is much better than I anticipated. The lens is very sharp through the range (just don't go over f5.6 if you can avoid it, natural diffraction kicks in). Therefore the sensor and lens combo out perform a camera of this class. Even dynamic range is better than I could have possibly thought. Credit to technology moving on.<br/><br/>When you factor in all its features (a vast array from 4k video to wireless to time lapse video), it's top notch design aesthetics (minimalist, classy, utilitarian), excellent build and ergonomics, this camera is a powerhouse of a pocketable "all in one" compact. My only wish is that the lens were slightly brighter (max aperture through the range), but otherwise it's a camera in its class of sensor size that shadows all others. At first I dismissed the ZS70 because of its packed tiny sensor, but I was shocked and pleasantly surprised looking at the image quality in raw. 1" sized sensors are still going to outperform it mind you, but this sensor is much better than you might think. Once you get it set  up, it's a joy to shoot with. That lens is so versatile for all kinds of snapshot photography- from landscapes to macros, action shots to long range stills or portraits. Its fast focusing so even actions shots are within reach.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is everything  you need in a little point n shoot, and nothing you don't. The controls on the exterior are plenty and holding it is quite lovely for one handed shooting- it's slightly larger, thicker, and heavier than the ZS50/60 but that is a good thing for a camera with such a long zoom. It makes a more stable platform when you are shooting at full telephoto. It has just the right heft to it for a camera of its size and type, welcome if you ask me. The five axis stabilization helps tremendously to keep blur at bay. Most of the controls are customizeable. The LCD is helpful for waist level shots and acts as a sort of angle bi-pod when you place the camera down for more stable shots (if you don't have a tripod for example). The EVF is welcome and usable, and helps in bright light and for extra stability when you are looking through it with the camera pressed to your eye/face.<br/><br/>I cannot get over how lovely its designed- all sides are nice n flat, nothing protrudes to snag, there's no obnoxious advertising of features on the camera itself, and everything appears proportionate and cleanly organized. The front and rear grips are improved and excellent. The design looks very Leica-esque - minimalist and beautiful. Great choice in exterior materials, the blend of flat fleck paint and satin metal. The black and silver versions are both excellent and classy.<br/><br/>If you print, you can easily make lovely prints to 13x19", and if you have some talent or stack your raw images, you can raise that number substantially (30x40" perhaps!). To me this camera is the sleeper compact out there right now. And it's likely to get more reviews and fans as a result.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is the best of the newer ZS series (or TZ series if outside the USA) cameras. It's classy, versatile, discreet, minimalist, and utilitarian. I wish more cameras were designed like this. Keep it up Panasonic!<br/><br/>Edit: My full review is now up on photographic-central blogspot dot com :)</span>

<span>I was looking for a camera for an upcoming trip to South America. Although my iPhone 13 Pro takes great photos, it has limited telephoto capabilities, so I decided to buy a "real" camera instead, one that was both compact in size but had good optical zoom.<br/><br/>After considering both the Panasonic Lumix ZS80 and very similar Nikon Coolpix A1000, I decided to order the Lumix. After playing with it for a couple of days, I decided to return it, primarily for two reasons:<br/><br/>1. The fonts on the screen and camera controls are very small, and hard for me to read without reading glasses, which I don't plan to wear outside. That might have become less of an issue after I became more familiar with the camera, but I didn't want to have to struggle with it on my upcoming trip. Note that reading the fonts was not a problem when using the viewfinder rather than the touchscreen.<br/><br/>2. The feature that allows you to automatically transfer photos from the camera to your phone using the Panasonic app was pretty quirky. Even though the camera can connect to the phone via Bluetooth, you have to connect the phone to the camera's WiFi in order to transfer photos.<br/><br/>A couple of other observations: there are two manuals, basic and advanced. A printed copy of the basic manual is included, but you have to access the advanced online. Also, the cover over the charging and HDMI ports is very flimsy and seems like it might fall off.<br/><br/>I can't evaluate the camera's performance since I didn't use it enough. It appears well built (other than the port cover) and feels comfortable in your hand. It's pretty small, so it should be easy to pack. I also ordered a case, extra battery, battery charger, and memory cards (none come with the camera), but returned everything except the memory card that I opened.<br/><br/>Sorry it didn't work out for me, but if your eyes are better than mine, the camera is worth considering.</span>
