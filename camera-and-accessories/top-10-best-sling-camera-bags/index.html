<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This camera bag was fantastic. Enabling to hold my equipment either in front or behind me and allowing quick access vs a regular backpack. I brought all my equipment in a Morally Toxic Valkyrie bag, and then chose a few pieces for the day while walking around Athens and the Greek isles. I have a full size FX DSLR and lenses. It held the weight fine. When shoulder got tired I would flip the bag to my back and use the extra chest support strap. Reason for 4 stars not 5: Needs some extra padding to protect equipment more. Could be just a tad bigger to better fit 70-200 zoom. (Smaller lenses were no problem and could fit up to 3 without the 70/200) And a better exterior holding method for a water bottle. I wound up using a hip pack to carry my water. The external straps and pocket are really for a small tripod and that’s it.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased this bag for my new Canon T7 that came with two lenses.  The camera with the 18-55 mm lens fits fine.  However, the Canon 75-300 mm lens that came with my camera barely fits when the camera is in the bag.  I would also prefer to have my tripod legs totally within the bag, not just strapped on  with one leg hanging out.  All in all this seem to be a good quality bag.  I personally should have ordered a bag a bit larger, with more storage.  Once I add my filters, extra batteries, remote shutter release etc. the bag, it is pretty much jammed full. I would like to add a wide angle lens, but that area is taken up by my lens hoods. So I will try to rearrange things, or eventually purchase a larger bag.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>If you like carrying around a bunch of photography stuff and/or you have the more expensive FX lenses that tend to be bigger.  This is probably not going to function as nicely as you like.  I am one such photography and I love the design of the bag but it's... inches too small.  This would be a 10 star bag if just an extra inch was added in width and potentially length.<br/><br/>Fantastic design.  This thing works as a sling, swings around just like pictured and has buckles on the front to prevent camera items from falling out when you unzip it.  But if you want easier access you just unbuckle them, no fuss, nice and simple.<br/>The strap for the bag is also great.  The band is wide so even when I put heavy lenses in it the strap doesn't dig into my shoulder.  It also has a buckle for quick removal and an extra across your stomach for stability.<br/><br/>For me, it's slightly too small.  I love the fact they kept is small but for what I want to use it for I am stuffing it a little too much...<br/>FLASH<br/>This bag definitely can't fit my flash... I am simply not comfortable with taking it out of it's case to fold it oddly in the top like they show.  I'd almost rather put an extra lens up there in a case than do that.<br/>LENS AND CAMERA<br/>If you own a basic DSLR with DX lenses you will easily fit-  Camera Body, stock lens (24-120mm), a 35 mm(or 55mm) and a small telephoto(70-200mm, 70-300mm gets slightly too long for standing tall as shown in picture)<br/>If you own a camera that uses FX lenses... Be prepared to stuff... you can get the body with a lens attached (not telephoto) and a smaller 35mm or 55mm lens but if you want to add a telephoto you have to start changing the way the camera sits inside the bag and personally I am a little weary of how protected the camera is at that point.  I will say it fits but just not well.<br/>TRIPOD<br/>The side pocket would fit a small tripod as shown but I have yet to test how well the tripod really stays put and wears on your back like that.  I am guessing it's not going to be as nicely wearable as I hope.  As far as a gorilla tripod, this would definitely sit there and travel just fine.<br/>LITTLE STUFF<br/>There are several pockets for the little stuff.  Extra battery, memory cards (strongly encourage a large case not individual memory card cases bc they will fall out, cleaning cloth, lens caps and so on.  I do wish this had at least 1 zippered pocket but it doesn't :(<br/><br/>In short<br/>PROS-<br/>Design, style, wearablity and comfort I give 10 stars out of 5 :D Very very happy with this aspect of the bag.<br/>Easily fits smaller DX lenses and body<br/>Lots of small pockets<br/>Love the space for tripod<br/><br/>CONS<br/>Slightly small if you are using FX lenses (ONE to TWO inches in width and depth would make this a perfect back for FX lenses as well!)<br/>Personally don't feel it fits a flash<br/>Wish one or two of the pockets zipped instead of velcro<br/><br/>With all that said, I'd buy it again. It's functionality is so incredible that I just have to have it and will continue to work with it in hopes I find a better solution for the storage spacing of the lenses... good tetris practice.</span>

<span>I've owned a couple Lowepro bags since I've gotten into photography. Of those, the one I use the most is the Slingshot 102 AW. I removed all the dividers and I carry a jacket with me to store a limited amount of camera gear for casual day trips. It has served me well and I really like having the rain cover. The other bag I owned was the Fastpack 250 AW II, which I used once and never touched again, until I donated it to Goodwill. I found it to be too big and bulky; for more serious hikes I just take a Kelty Redwing 32. I found myself wanting something a little larger than the Slingshot, but not so large as to make commuting into the city or moving through crowds to be cumbersome. I think the Slingshot Edge 250 fulfills my criteria. It's larger, with more storage capacity, while actually being slightly slimmer than the Slingshot by maybe an inch.<br/>I didn't bother to read all 700 reviews, but here are a couple things I've noticed about it that maybe haven't been mentioned. It's pretty much a perfect bag for my wedding loadout (refer to pictures from here on out). I can fit an A7 III (L-bracket attached) with a Sigma 35 Art in the main compartment, along with a 24-105 and a little space for say, a 28mm f/2 or all my batteries. I rearranged the dividers so that when I unzip it after having slung it, the grip part of the body is facing me, and I can pull it out easily. In the top compartment I can fit an a6600 with a Sigma 85 Art. I could also fit a jacket or some other soft material in there. The outermost zippered pocket can fit my phone fine, and the pocket actually extends all the way to the bottom of the bag, which is kind of nice. This pocket is where I stored the straps/buckles for the tripod; they can be removed completely for a cleaner look on the outside. The outer stretch pocket will technically fit a 32 oz. Nalgene, but it's a very tight fit, so I'd recommend a 16 oz. Nalgene, or a slim bottle like in the stock photo, so as to not prematurely fatigue the fabric. The tablet sleeve in the top compartment doesn't look very big, but it stored my iPad (9.7 inch screen) without a hitch. Any larger and it'd be a pretty tight fit.<br/>Hopefully this is helpful to somebody who was wondering a bit more about the dimensions/storage ideas. I like the bag overall and I think it'll get used pretty frequently. As another reviewer mentioned, I wouldn't mind a bit more versatility in terms of how you can arrange the dividers; their structure and the limited velcro strips leave a bit to be desired in the customization department, so I'm knocking off a star for that. Otherwise, I like it.</span>

<span>I really like this bag.  I can carry my full size DSLR (Nikon D700), a 28-70 lens a 70-300 lens and remote trigger (see photo) with either lens attached to the camera.  It might be possible to substitute a flash for the remote trigger, but it would be tight.  This is a moot point for me as I use this bag when hiking / biking, and under those circumstances, I find the pop-up flash on my camera to be adequate in those instances where flash is required at all.  If I did need to carry a flash, I would put it in the top portion of the bag which in my case is generally empty.<br/><br/>I will withhold judgement on the tripod holder until I have a tripod that is appropriate for this type of travel.  My current 'small' tripod - an older Manfroto 3001 - is a little long at 25", a little heavy at 5.2lbs and way too top-heavy with its fixed head that accounts for about half it's weight.<br/><br/>To wear this sling, you orient so the bag will be behind you, feed your LEFT arm through the strap and maneuver the strap over your head so it rests on your RIGHT shoulder.  The ends are sewn to the corners of the bag, so this it cannot be switched.<br/><br/>With the camera portion of the bag loaded, the weight is distributed so I hardly notice it.  The bag can then be swung to your front exposing the opening for the camera compartment of the bag.  Very handy.  I use this bag when biking, and when riding I prefer the bag to be snug to my back.  This is easily achieved by fastening the smaller chest strap to the smaller chest with the attached buckle.<br/><br/>I have yet to take a spill while wearing this bag, but am confident that if that happens the bag will protect my gear.  About 25 years ago, while backpacking, I fell with a Lowe-Pro gadget bag attached to the back of my 40 lb backpack and landed, of course, on my back.  It was a fall of 6-8 feet, and my backpack and gadget bag absorbed the shock, so I was unhurt.  My gadget bag got the worst of it, so I was concerned that my gear would all be scrap.  None of it was damaged.  Since then I have trusted only Lowe-Pro to protect my gear.<br/><br/>BTW:  This review was unsolicited.</span>

<span>I'm new to the photography and filmography field and was getting a new camera and equipment. So, I needed a bag that I would want to feel safe that my equipment was in. And let me just say I feel very comfortable already. This bag looks absolutely professional, and not bulky at all. I love the cross-body strap, and there's even a clip to connect it on the other side for added stabilization on your back. The outside of the bag was surprisingly great quality, which a lot of camera bags that are much more expensive don't even have this nice of quality. Also, the padding is very thick, so there's no need to worry if the bag ever slips out of your hands or drops from a chair or bench. It will protect your camera. And honestly, the bag is slim and small enough that I don't even notice I'm carrying it at times.<br/><br/>The front pockets are really nice for extra items like cleaning kits, notebooks, filters, and really anything small. And it's just as nicely padded as the rest of it. Another thing I liked was having to access the camera from the back. It's an added security measure, so there's no chance of someone getting to it without you knowing. Another added feature, which I was happy about, was at the bottom of the bag they included a little rain coat for the bag, so if you're ever going to go in the rain or go on a wet ride, this'll protect it! Also, in the section at the back, those dividers can be adjusted to your equipment sizes.<br/><br/>The only downside I see to this is if you are going to carry around a lot of lenses or other equipment, this wouldn't be the bag for you, because of the size and limited capacity.</span>

<span>I find that the zippers are badly designed, and as a consequence, they bind as you try to open or close them.  To get them closed requires two hands, which is difficult if you have a camera in one hand.  If you leave them open, you'll run the risk of stuff spilling out of the bag.  Another thing is that the bag is designed and sold for a right shoulder carry only.  After 10 years of using a left shoulder sling bag, it takes a lot of getting used to.  I wish they sold a left shoulder carry option.</span>

<span>The bag works well for me. It is big enough to hold the gear I need and not big enough to tempt me to bring gear I don't need. I like the water bottle holder and can reach back to retrieve a 26-oz Camelback bottle without unstrapping anything. I have worn it on hikes of generally 5-8 miles in steep, rugged terrain. I can swap lenses while standing (or walking). I found the shoulder strap wide enough to be comfortable worn over the slightly padded shoulder of my safari vest. The waist strap was useless--it would not keep the bag from rotating toward my right side. I moved it partway up the shoulder strap and added a leather pad. This makes it more comfortable, keeps it from rotating, and pulls the shoulder strap off my neck. Yesterday, after at least two years of use, the bag fell off my back when the strap broke. No gear damaged. The stitching at the bottom of the diagonal strap gave out. Maybe my modification put more stress on it, but the stitching was not robust. I repaired it and expect to continue using this as my go-to bag.</span>

<span>It's a good, well made bag.  But it doesn't sit up ready for you to put things in/take things out.  It doesn't sit on a surface in a position that makes it easy to swap gear in and out of.  Over your shoulder, if you're on the go, it's pretty good.  But it has annoying loose strap ends that have to be dealt with.  Overall I think it's a good bag, but kind of clunky and a little annoying to use.  It does make very good use of space, though.  A good bag if you like to pack as much as you can into the smallest bag possible.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is a great sling bag- for light weight setups/shorter excursions. Its well built and well designed, with only 1 issue- the design of the shoulder and hip straps.<br/>The shoulder strap has no padding, and gets uncomfortable after 3-4 miles (Pentax KP, 28-105mm, Vanguard carbon tripod, batteries, tablet, water and a few other light weight items), and the hip belt is essentially useless as it doesn't effectively transfer weight to your hips. Even if it did, it wouldn't be comfortable since the straps are tiny with no padding. The shoulder strap is wide, but all of the weight goes on the adjusting strap, making the wide shoulder strap itself kind of useless. You could potentially remedy this by putting a seat belt pad on the strap?<br/>Eventually, I had to throw in the towel and shift back to a proper hiking bag. I think that this bag would be outstanding for lightweight platforms (the KP has a magnesium body- tough but like a brick) or for short walks.<br/><br/>I totally recommend this for short excursions or photographers that don't have a lot of gear, not so much for wilderness/nature photgraphers. Take my advice, don't buy overly expensive camera bags, and just use a proper hiking backpack with an insert. I personally use a Camelbak HAWG or Fourteener with a case logic insert, and I have been told that the Osprey Stratos and Tenba 9/10 work well. These setups are perfect for those of you carrying gear for 5+ mile hikes.</span>

<span>As a new photographer I am very self-conscious about how big a dweeb I must look lugging a bunch of gear around. I turned to this bag because of its relative stealthiness, price and favorable reviews. It bangs around offroad hanging from  the headrest of my jeep, gets drenched in sweat hiking in the mountains and still looks ready for a night on the town. Or something. Just returned from a trip having used it as the extra, lap-held second carry-on with nary a batted eyebrow. I have it crammed with a Canon 40D, 24mm 2.8, EFS 50-250mm, EFS 10-18mm, extra battery, battery charger, some extra filters, cabling and back-up memory cards. It's full, but you could still fit a cliff bar or two in there. Outer mesh pocket not quite big enough of any of the tripods I own but will accommodate a 20oz water bottle.

So I keep my bottle in the top pocket with it's top hanging out. I do not have extra lens so I can't comment on how this bag would work if you had to carry a lot of lens.

<span>I did a ton of research before landing on this bag, and I'm really pleased with it. I wanted a sling bag where I could keep my set of six Rokinon cine lenses with me while out on video shoots. I like that this one loads on the side of the bag, which means that when you sling it around in front of you, you're looking down into the top of the opening and all of the lenses are right there for you to grab and swap out safely. I like this bag so much that I'm not even going to ding it for having a zipper handle/grab fall off after just a week or two. I tied it back on and we're good to go.</span>

<span>I like the organization of this bag. The 70-200 f2.8 or RF100-500 stay on the camera and then there is room for at least the RF24-105 or RF 14-25 and possibly both if you put one under the other lens.<br/><br/>I wish the small pocket had more flaps or elasticized pockets to organize things like batteries and cards, but that is a personal preference thing, I guess.<br/><br/>I do have a hard time keeping the bag on my right shoulder if I try to carry it like a backback instead of cross body.  It just likes to slide down.<br/><br/>Cross body, it is dead stable and very comfortable.  Easy to spin around as I need it.<br/><br/>All and all, almost perfect for what I need to carry.</span>

<span>REALLY BAD STRAPS ; Too inadequate for the amount of weight they say you can carry .<br/>They say you can carry 1 camera , 2 lenses , a tripod , a laptop ?  , NO WAY . That main crossbody clasp is going to break , it is the type you find on a fanny pack , a pocket clasp ? . Not something that is supposed to hold 15 pounds of gear worth a couple of thou.<br/>ALSO the stabilizing strap doesnt make sense. It feeds throught a little elastic loop and the clasp in on the WRONG end. The clasp is on the bag all the way around under your left arm , you can try to do it one handed with your left hand or reach around with your right hand but its not easy .<br/>I am returning this .</span>

<span>Overall, I think this case would work well for a small camera and accessories. However, I didn’t get a chance to use it because a zipper pull came off when unzipped it. You can see it circled in yellow in the photo.<br/><br/>I did test the case to see if it would work for my purpose--Olympus Pen camera with a couple of lenses and accessories. It was a tight fit and I found the included foam dividers cumbersome. They didn’t seem to give a good configuration.<br/><br/>The front pocket was nice and worked well for smaller items. The strap allowed use as a waist pack or sling, which is nice. Overall, I think it would be a nice bag for a smaller camera or without an additional 300 mm zoom lens.<br/><br/>The larger sized bag would be too much. So, I’ll keep looking for something just a tad bigger than this one.</span>

<span>The small is quite small, like a Fanny pack from the 80s. A Leica rangefinder with a small lens fits but a fuji Xpro or Sony A series is going to be a really tight squeeze, if not impossible. That would be fine but the lens has to face down and there’s almost no padding on the bottom (or lid) of the bag to protect the lens if you take the bag off and aren’t careful when you set it down.<br/>I personally like the bag for a very inconspicuous bag for street shooting but have to be careful how I use it.</span>

<span>I think this bag had little to no real world testing. The concepts are all great in theory but fail in practice. My issues:<br/><br/>1. The buckle. Twice now I've bumped it the wrong way and my bag has flown off my and slammed to the ground.<br/><br/>2. Comfort. Pack any significant amount of gear and this thing is insanely uncomfortable. The strap digs in and the bag bulges into your side.<br/><br/>3. The dividers. It's insane this bag costs $100 and includes dividers like that. Absolutely useless cheap poorly designed garbage. Probably my biggest gripe.<br/><br/>I think the positives are the amount of pockets and space. But honestly keep shopping. There are bags with better design out there. I have buyers remorse.</span>

<span>The device section is not the best designed and could be much better.<br/>That being said they provide more dividers than can be used depending on your camera.<br/>I have a canon rp with a lens adapter, this makes the camera just fit if I have a 24mm or 50mm.<br/>I carry a 24, 50, and 70 to 300mm, the 70 to 300mm fits well but only if you have something to fill the small section that is left over.<br/>Carrying these lenses and the camera takes up the full area, of you have a drone it will have to go in the space up top.<br/>I am able to fit: mini 2, batteries, controller, 4 extra camera batteries, tablet, tablet adapter for mini 2, 65 watt Anker charger, and two filter packs, the charger for my one wheel xr fits in that the zipper barely closes.<br/>I probably need a bigger bag than this but the size is perfect for a hike or rolling around the city.<br/>The strap does dog into your shoulder a bit, however that is probably in part from me carrying to max the bag can hold.<br/>The extra strap on the side does not have the best connection with the velcro strap.<br/>For the price I think this bag is as perfect as it could get.

<span>I received a plain brown colored bag (not as pictured) and it has no smell what so ever-(its definitely leather though). This is probably why the seller discounted this color for 80 bucks.... over the other varieties offered by this seller. I feel it deserves a 5 star rating for what it is-a plain brown leather camera bag. It is very well made and seems extremely durable, excellent stiching, the separation insert is solid, the velcro of the insert is well stiched and the interior lining is soft, strong and a notch above similarly lined interiors in durability ( i can tell this by how the velcro attaches to the inner lining. It doesn't give as much when pulled on). I would definitely buy again but would have passed over this item first time around...being that I wasn't in the market for a camera bag and It was the vintage look of the picture that got my attention...and what I had hoped for. The quality of the item supercedes this and I really do like the brown color just the same. Its that good.</span>

It is very small, but still high quality build and soft leather.<br/><br/>I was going to purchase a nice leather ag for my Fijifilm X-T30 mirrorless camera. The bags I found cost between $350-$250, quite a bit for a small bag.<br/><br/>Then I searched Amazon and happens to find this one with great reviews.<br/><br/>I purchased it immediately, it arrived quickly and well packaged.<br/><br/>The bag is a lush brown that smells like a new leather coat or leather boots...wonderful.<br/><br/>It has a divider inside to keep my camera separate from other equipment, such as another lens, charger cord, battery and memory cards, sometime if I’m carrying a small lens I can carry my Manfrotto tabletop tripod.<br/><br/>It isn’t rain proof, but it is very rain and moisture resistant, and seems to repel water nicely.<br/><br/>The strap is long enough to use crossbody or shoulder, and I am 6.1.<br/><br/>The hardware seems to be sturdy, robust and well made without sharp edges.<br/><br/>This bag should last years and look even better with time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this if you like quality leather, and have a nice camera and good glass to carry on shoots or anywhere for that matter.</span>

I had no idea what I was getting myself into and immediately started to look for a backpack. I decided to try this bag out first because of the price and before I went totally overboard on accessories without getting any actual photography practice in. Currently, I only use the Sony a6000 series aps-c camera in it, so its not a huge camera by any means. However, I carry my camera and four lenses along with the cleaning kit. I also carry multiple batteries, the charger, SD card holder, and other misc. items with room to spare. If I had a complaint (which I really don't), it would be the accessibility into the case. You have to unclip two buckles, flip the first part up, and then unzip the case. I understand that this bag wouldn't be near as weatherproof if they had chosen an easier access design. Overall, I am super happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>Outstanding bags for the price. I have three of these - two orange and one gray. One bag holds a full-size D5 or DLSR+Attached battery, plus a 35mm film camera, a GoPro, and all the accessories, cleaning, filters, and charging equipment. Each of my bags are setup as a fully self-contained "kit" for specialized uses. A bag will easily fit a D5 or D200+Battery Pack; GoPro + Spare Case &amp; hot shoe mount; Nikon FM2 35MM Film Camera; Six rolls of film; Two hard memory storage cases; Full cleaning kit, chargers, filters, spare AA, AAA, and DSLR and GoPro batteries, etc... Attached pictures do not do them justice. One trick is I leave the lens attached to each camera. You can easily carry a camera and three full lenses if you wish. The best part of this bag is the "double top" the "outer hood" flips over and buckles shut. Under it a zipper lid stays closed over your gear, keeping it dust free. I use waterproof spray and either silicon or beeswax on the zippers because they will spend their fair share of time in the rain/mud/snow/whatever -- Expect to trash at least one of these a year if you are an active outdoor photographer. But that is more the abuse of the equipment than the equipment itself. The setup in the pictures works best for me - but there are a lot of other good examples shown by other reviewers. As for color - Orange is better than Gray in my opinion because gear is easier to see inside the bag with that contrast. I would buy more colors if Amazon sold them however, just because my kids are specialized for different use-cases. The way I have these bags setup is:<br/>1) 35mm Film Landscape and Macro<br/>2) DSLR+35mm Portrait and Street Photography<br/>3) DSLR+35mm Generalized Travel Photography<br/><br/>I will convert my Nikon full-size bag to an Amazon bag when it wears out. I can't say enough about these bags from a functional use perspective. They are not pretty, or leather, or designer - but for a functional hardcore photographer, these are ideal.<br/>Features I like:<br/>1) Size Zipper Pockets on each side: Big enough to put charger, wires, and USB cables in one side; and batteries &amp; lens/body caps in the other.<br/><br/>2) "False Pocket" inside the bag: You will notice a battery bank, hot shoe mount and hard memory case stuffed into the "false pocket" inside the case; Below that stuff are two filters in plastic cases -- it works absolutely brilliantly.<br/><br/>3) Front large external zipper pocket: I stuff the strap and a trash bag in here. It has what I consider to be a useless sewn-in pocket on the inside, but aside from that, I like the generous size of that front pocket for bulky cables and crap that just doesn't fit neatly in the case.<br/><br/>4) Netted pocket on inside of inner-lid: Perfect for wipes, DSLR sensor cleaners, thumb drives, extra eye-pieces/black-out eye pieces, etc..<br/><br/>5) Size above all. If they made this bag literally one inch wider and deeper it would be 1000% perfect, but that is also personal preference. Everything in this bag fits perfectly snug, and I can roll, twist, turn, and flip upside down and nothing moves. It is really a well-designed bag if you do your part and configure it appropriately.<br/><br/>Things I don't like:<br/><br/>1) The strap for the bag has a hideous "Maxi-Pad" looking shoulder pad that is essentially useless. The strap also has bulky plastic hooks. The strap is so useless it should go directly to the landfill from the manufacturing line. Because I am able to separate it from the bag and burn it, the rating of 5-stars is still appropriate for the bag itself.<br/><br/>2) "Tripod Retention Loop/Buckles" on the bottom - They are kind of useless. I used Velcro to stuck them in so they don't flop around like a ragbag. I tried attaching a tripod and a mono-pole to them at first, but it makes the bag awkward and other than the fact they can provide spare buckles if your primary ones break - they are nothing more than an example of what looks good on a whiteboard doesn't always translate into what works in real life.<br/><br/>3) Not enough rubber/feet/clearance on the bottom bag pads for what I do. My bags will be sitting in mud, wet surfaces and other unfriendly places. I don't think Amazon can really be at fault for this however - they did a great job with the bottom skids for 99.9% of consumers.<br/><br/>4) Plastic anchor loops for the crappy plastic and maxi-pad shoulder strap: These are sewn-in. No plastic should ever be used where a critical anchor point is needed. These should be metal, or just a heavy sewn-loop of canvas strap. Again - this will probably be okay for consumers, which this bag is made for - but plastic for an anchor point? Really? That said - they are pretty robust pieces of plastic crap.<br/><br/>Comments and Observations:<br/><br/>1) I would buy different exterior and Interior colors of this bag. They only come in black with choice of orange or gray interior. If Amazon made more color options, I think they would sell a lot more of these. I would buy them in different exterior colors without a doubt.<br/><br/>2) I think the way the straps come together with the Velcro handle could be improved. It isn't bad, but it isn't really great either. It is simply functional and unremarkable. This is being as hyper-critical as I can on the product - because it really is an amazing product overall, for the price, and the fact that it is designed for consumers and not professionals.<br/><br/>I hope this review helps you make your choice.</span>

<span>The Amazon Basics camera bag is really an excellent value. That's especially true for users of smaller, mirrorless systems, where you'll be able to fit in a good bit of kit (see end of this review). It would also function well for users of "full-frame" DSLRs as a light-weight "go bag" for those times only a minimal kit is required.<br/><br/>Pros: Although the bright orange interior color may be off-putting to some, I found it to be a plus: it means there's no need to rummage through it trying to find that piece of black camera gear inside an entirely black bag (especially in dim lighting). Construction is neat and overall good-looking. Stitching appears strong, and is neatly done without lots of dangling thread ends. Straps are actually longer than you're likely to ever need, but not so long as to often get in the way. There are two zippered end-pockets, a zippered mesh pocket inside of the top, inner cover, and a zippered side pocket having a couple of inner pockets and another zippered inside mesh area. The main section has four velcro-attached dividers, two of which are designed to fold about an inch from their tops. It also has a stitched in padded divider for a small Android tablet, kindle, or iPad. There is both a  padded carry grip and a padded shoulder strap. There is also a set of tripod straps on the front, bottom edge. Hardware is all heavy molded plastic, which I happen to prefer over clanky, noisy, metal hardware.<br/><br/>The velcro tabs that attach the inner cover to the outer weather cover were a nice touch. If the inner cover is zipped shut, then releasing the buckles and opening the outer weather cover will leave the inner one in place. But if you expect to be opening and closing the bag often, you can leave the inner cover unzipped when you close and buckle the bag, and when you next release the buckles to open the outer cover, the velcro tabs will lift the inner cover along with the outer.<br/><br/>Cons: One more of the smaller inner padded orange dividers would have made the bag just a little more useful, as I use small Olympus micro four-thirds bodies and lenses. The padded divider for the tablet should use velcro, instead of sewn in. It would be nice if Amazon made those available separately. The shoulder strap's pad is too tight on the strap to easily work past the hardware, if necessary. The shoulder strap pad's padding itself is far too rigid and stiff, and not stitched down within the fabric pad cover, which gives it a tendency to kink and makes it feel bulky and uncomfortable. The end pocket's gussets should extend the same depth all the way around the side and bottoms of the pockets, instead of tapering towards the bottom on each side. I'd also have liked some sort of built-in storage for memory cards, and a different arrangement of inner pockets inside the large side pocket.<br/><br/>None of the above cons, however, are serious, with the exception of the pad for the shoulder strap, which frankly appears to have been made without anyone ever trying it for suitability to purpose.<br/><br/>Finally, the bag is taller then in needs to be for this sort of micro four-thirds gear, by about an inch and a half, and could benefit from being about the same amount deeper (front to rear).<br/><br/>If that sounds like a bunch of nit-picking, you're right, it is. :-) As I said, there's no "perfect bag", and maybe someone will read this and make one that's closer to perfect. But overall, this is a very good bag, especially at this price. It compares very favorably with those costing 2-3 times more. And that's coming from someone who has used many bags, for many different camera systems, over some 50 years.<br/><br/>Easily stored in my bag:<br/><br/>Main area: Olympus E-PL8 with optional VF-4 viewfinder (either attached or stored in its own pouch), Olympus FL-LM1 flash in its own pouch or attached, Olympus lenses 15mm "bodycap" lens,14-42 mm, 40-150 mm with hood in either stored or use position, 70-300 mm with hood in stored position, a set of stacked extension tubes, a mini folding tripod, and a couple of instruction sheets.<br/><br/>End pockets: Charger for camera batteries, intervalometer/remote release transmitter and receiver, cell phone charger, spare body/rear lens caps.<br/><br/>Side pocket: Memory card holders, spare batteries. and room to spare.<br/><br/>Inside top pocket: Battery charger automobile 12v adapter cord, cell phone charger cord, Olympus camera-PC USB cord, intervalometer connection cord, and a bit of extra room.</span>

<span>I'll start by saying I'm very picky about gear, and also that I bought and returned three different camera bags before ordering (and loving and keeping !) this one.  The unfortunate reality photography enthusiasts have to live with right now is that it's impossible to walk into a big camera store and try out a bunch of bags to find something that's the right size for your particular need.  Ordering online is challenging, even when interior and exterior dimensions are listed.  This purchase was triggered by moving to a Fujifilm outfit, so in the bag I have an XT-4 body, 23mm prime, 50-230 zoom, 18-55 zoom, Metz 26AF-1 flash unit, the Fujifilm two-battery charger with cables, and some miscellaneous small items.  The bag swallows it all with enough room to spare that I don't have to worry if I change up my lens set at some point in the future.  It's just in that "not too big and not too small" sweet spot. Everything about this bag says "expensive," and honestly it's WAY underpriced at the sub-30 dollar point.  If someone put this in my hands and told me it was $125 or even $150 I wouldn't bat an eyelash. Slap a camera bag company name on it and I'll bet that would be the price point. All the materials, buckles, and straps are high quality.  Every feature must have been thought out by a camera person because the zippers and velcro parts are just perfectly placed and make the bag really secure and plenty weather resistant.  It's inconspicuous and doesn't scream "there's something expensive in here!" I don't think you'll find a better bag of this size at any price.</span>
