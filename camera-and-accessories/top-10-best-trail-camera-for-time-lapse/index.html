They write "Never run out of storage with 128gb micro sd card" and there is no other mention that you will be getting the 8gb card and that the unit is 128 gb card capable.<br/><br/>9/8/2019 - After purchasing a 128gb card I tested out the time lapse feature. I chose 1 minute interval and highest quality HDR with 1080 resolution. I also upgraded the firmware to the version 90. I left the camera mounted outside for a 1 day and half and it produced 2 avi files. I had it set to run from 7:30-5pm. It looks like it simply produces files on a daily basis which is fine as they are easy enough to stitch together. Anyway the file size for 8 hours was around 210mb so with these settings running M-F you could easily let this go for months at a time. The picture was surprisingly awesome. I thought it might be along the lines in quality as say my arlo pro 2 security cameras but the picture produced was quite rich in color and very clear. I've also checked out some comparison videos and this unit you can clearly see is the better picture among its competitors. So at this point even with the mis leading advertising imho on the card size it ships with I would highly recommend this. BTW, imho the 128 card I bougth was rather inexpensive. I bet this company could negotiate a deal and it wouldn't be that costly to them to enhance their package.</span>

<span>In many ways I really like this product - but it has its problems.<br/><br/>This is really a combo package of the ATH2000 housing and the TLC2000 camera.<br/><br/>Good/Pros of TLC2000 camera:<br/>- good camera quality – great HD picture quality.<br/>- excellent low power use when in standby / timer mode<br/><br/>Bad/Cons of TLC2000 camera:<br/>- my timer setting was to record daytime on weekdays, but found morning video at end of previous day – it’s all there but not in the right video file - crazy<br/>- wish it was 4k<br/>- wish it would auto-upload via Ethernet<br/>- when power is off camera forgets all its settings<br/><br/>Good/Pros of ATH2000 housing:<br/>- very good configurable interior space – quite flexible<br/>- provision for power cable through bottom of case<br/>- room for moisture absorbing packets<br/><br/>Bad/Cons ATH2000 housing:<br/>- housing lens window must be layered or something as it has water residue inside it now – camera pictures are still usable but they’re a bit compromised – can’t be cleaned – window glued in and not easily replaceable<br/><br/>- battery holder for 16 batteries is a piece of junk (although it has clever electronics) – started coming apart fairly quickly.  Replacing batteries is a time-consuming unpleasant chore.  However, I found on Amazon an “always-on” USB charge pack (Voltaic Systems V50) that fits inside the case with a right-angle cable and that doesn’t shut down when the camera is on stand-by between timer events; this has made life far, far easier and more pleasant.  I can charge the pack while still connected to the camera so the camera doesn’t forget its settings.<br/><br/>Soon I will be switching to a POE high res camera with auto-upload to my file server, but this camera was quickly and easily deployed to get started, takes good pictures, and the 3rd party battery pack gets me about 2 weeks of 5 day daytime video.</span>

<span>****bought this in 2020. I believe it’s critical to do the firmware update when you receive it or it may not work right. I recall that it took a few attempts to get the update to work so follow instructions carefully. Following that, I bought a 128gig mini SD and mounted the cam inside the enclosure up in a tree for two constriction projects. The first build lasted almost a year. Every two weeks or so I’d climb a ladder and pull out the SD card, get the footage, and replace the batteries. I think the batteries and SD would have gone quite a bit longer but I didn’t want to lose any days. Today I finished the footage on the second build. Both times the cam worked flawlessly. Crisp time lapse footage!</span>

<span>I ordered these products for a professional application - long term, exterior time lapse.  I read about them several on the company's website.  According to the site, it seemed like a perfectly suited item to my application.  I never really found out, because out of the box I hit one issue after another.<br/>I ordered 3 units.  I read all the instructions first.  I won't detail every issue I had - but the first unit I opened crashed while formatting a new card.  The card was the specs per their website.  Then, I couldn't get it to turn back on.  After a while it did turn on, but then crashed again. The 2nd seemed to format the card.  Again, having completely read about the product on their site, realized there was a firmware update.  So, I downloaded that, followed the directions and found that the 2nd camera seemed to format the card, but the file structure wasn't there for me to put the new firmware on. So, I created it but the camera wouldn't read the card.  Finally, after a lot of attempts, I got the firmware on the card and followed the directions to install it.  Short story - didn't work, even after several attempts.  I went to the site and called the "Hotline"...  went to a weird voicemail.  So, tried again to be sure, double checked the number, and got the same.  So, I left a message with my number.  No call back (this is days later, still no call back).  Finally, and this should tell you about their QC and overall attention to detail:  The weatherproof housing has a battery holder so that you can power the camera over an extended period of time.  It has the wrong connector!  It doesn't interface with the camera! Useless!!  This company did a very good job with their site and marketing.  When you get the box, it's like getting something from Apple - cool packaging, sleek, looks like good stuff... just like their website.  But, it's a bunch of smoke and mirrors.  I'd say this - if you're looking for something to play around with at home - more of an inexpensive toy camera to do time lapse with, then this might be okay for that.  But, in no way is it ready for anything more than that.  I found that there is no inexpensive option for doing high quality, extended, exterior time lapse.</span>

<span>This absolutely does not have a 16MP sensor and uses interpolation fakery to generate 15.5MP files.  640x480 seems more probable.<br/><br/>I found the kit version locally on sale with 8 AA batteries, 16GB SD card and strap for $39.  At that price point I don't feel too ripped off and just wanted something basic to catch some things in an area without electricity.<br/><br/>One issue for me so far is very poor low light capability.  It does switch to night mode even when it's still light out, and this is a pretty obvious attempt to cover for the limitation of the sensor.  But even then, unless you have a lot of light, the photos have tons of motion blur and noise.<br/><br/>But the BIGGEST issue as others have mentioned is that the IR LEDs put out quite a bit of visible light!  So there is not much "stealth" to this camera especially at night!  False advertising?  Well, they will claim that the name of the company is "Stealth Cam" but the camera itself isn't "stealth".

(Rep helped me  find one)  I ended the chat and realized that I was also missing the flat part also.  See pix.  I bought a pack off Amazon that included both ends.

<span>Took a chance on this camera to capture our house build, and played with it for a while before we started construction. I had alot of trouble figuring out how to get it to actually record because the instructions leave a fair amount to be desired and everytime I tried it recorded nothing, but thought I had finally figured it out after finally getting several successful short term recordings.<br/><br/>Placed it on our lot to capture dirt work and a few days later came to get the footage only to find there were no recordings. Took it home, checked settings, tested it, worked fine. Put it back on our lot to capture the placement of slab forms only to find no recordings a few days later. Took it home and tested again, got it working, thought I had figured it out. Placed it again the day before slab pouring. Tried to have faith in it (my mistake) and left it all the way through the majority of the framing, and just discovered after pulling the SD card (always formatted IN THE CAMERA ITSELF prior to attempting a recording) that it recorded just thon slab pouring day until randomly quitting at 8:36 pm and never recording anything else. So I bought this for one purpose and it completely failed me, and I missed my chance to capture a time lapse of our house being built because of this piece of garbage. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to whether it works or not. I'm extremely upset and wish I could at least get my money back but it's past the return window. Oh, after leaving it for 3 weeks (remember it didn't record anything past 8:36 pm the first day... less than 16 hours of recordings on a 512GB SD card which should hold about 30 days' worth based on my test videos), the camera is reporting a low battery. Don't they advertise the battery life is supposed to be good for 6 months of recordings?! I'm using the effing batteries they provided!!<br/><br/>I'd end this review by saying "buy at your own risk" but instead I'll just say it'd be easier to simply set fire to your money, because the only thing you'll get from purchasing this camera (besides a lighter wallet) is an errand when you have to drop it at an electronics recycling center. Assuming you're conscientious enough to do that, and you don't just smash it with a hammer to relieve your anger.</span>

<span>Using this to do daily photos of a build in process for a project we're doing. It's a nice and simple camera that does the trick. Being able to use regular batteries, rather than some goofy power pack, is a plus, because any staff person can easily swap out batteries.<br/><br/>Picture quality and such seems competent. No complaints.</span>

<span>I received this earlier that expected and I'm super happy about that! The package and it's contents came neatly packed and in good condition. It came with all the advertised gadgets. Once you read the instruction manual it is easy to navigate the camera. It doesn't have an overwhelming amount of options and the color display is a nice feature.  I think this is a perfect tool if you need to document anything to do with construction. I think this could be the perfect tool to capture, daily, weekly and monthly construction projects. I would definitely love a smart phone app that could show you the progress of the capture but for the price it truly is a budget friendly device that has the power to create timelapses in an easy and user friendly way.</span>

New for 2018, the Cuddeback 20 Megapixel IR features industry leading 1/4 second trigger speed that captures the deer that so many other cameras would miss. With super-fast recovery speed The camera is ready for the next picture within 1 second of taking the first. The result is that Cuddeback can capture two photos before many cameras can capture one. And the pictures are incredible - 20MP color images when shot in daylight and black-and-white Images when shot at night. High power 850nm LED illumination for a range to over 100 feet. Ire takes crisp black and white night images, and full color day Images. On top of the performance, we added a ton of cool and innovative features, separate day or night delays, fully customizable time lapse and many more. We even reinvented the mounting system to make camera deployment easy and versatile. A conventional camera can get Banged around while strapping it to a tree. With Cuddeback Genius mount you simply strap (or screw) the mount to the tree and gently slide the camera on and off as needed. Optional Genius mounts allow panning, tilting and locking. Camera runs off of 8 x AA batteries and can take up to a 32GB SD card (batteries and SD card not included)..

<span>No game camera is perfect. They all have something i would change. I have used several brands. Even the $600 ones have issues and eventually die. They are out in a harsh environment with bugs, dust and extreme temps 24 x 7. I am currently running 6 cameras. 5 are now Cuddeback. 2-3 are this model. I buy the cheapest camera that works reasonably well and toss them when they fail. If you want a lot of good pictures run a bunch of cameras for 2-3 months before the season.</span>

<span>I'll start with one plus; the mounting system is wonderful!  Way better than all them straps and crap.  All the negatives - When I place the mode on FAP (Fast As Possible),  it'll take maybe 10 photos, then that's it for the night (it's in my yard, I check it every day).  I have a steady deer population coming to the feeder day and night, AND THE CAMERA MISSES ALMOST ALL OF THEM!  The sensor is obviously not very sensitive.  I guess a hundred bucks still only buys garbage for a camera.</span>

<span>We’ve had some fun playing with it and gotten some great photos. I have to get used to using it for water and always wipe the lens. Not very intuitive to use, so you have to be committed to learning the system to get the full value. I’ve bought many accessories to make it all work, maybe more than I needed but some at least seem needed.

<span>My wife and I got into YouTube content creation a few months back. We initially started with knockoff GoPros and while they were great for getting us started, we want a more professional look now that we're building up a subscriber base. We already have a Panasonic Lumix G7 for recording "selfie" style shots so this camera was going to be for second angles and tight shots where the G7 won't fit. With that in mind, we opted to save some money buying this Hero 8 rather than the latest and greatest Hero 11 seeing as we didn't need all the bells and whistles (including the front facing screen). We have been more than happy with our purchase. Keep in mind, though, we record at 30 fps in either 1080p or 4k depending on the needs of the particular shot so we're not pushing the camera to its limits. With that said, we use a USB battery bank and leave the camera plugged in and, in combination with a 256GB SD card, we've left the camera recording in the Texas heat and sun for several hours and never run into overheating issues. That's even with the media mod attached, btw.</span>

<span>I took a shot on trying this model out because the 9 was a lot more expensive. I found the price of the 8 to be a good deal and I have no regrets. The display is crisp and easy to use and the camera quality is excellent. I like the different modes you can shoot in and take stills. The app makes it pretty user friendly too. My only complaint is the battery life. I hear that's a pretty common thing (Wanting longer battery life) but for the quality you get it's pretty worth and can record long enough for most situations. Otherwise spare batteries help. I'd highly recommend this if you are still shooting on the hero 3 or 4.</span>
