<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I received this Z7II yesterday and immediately put it through its paces.<br/>There seems to be nothing left out in this camera.  So why only three stars?<br/>Nikon has made the documentation only available to download off their<br/>website.  I cannot print a page out of the PDF file for some sort of strange<br/>reasoning on the part of Nikon's engineers.  Once I got the camera I would not<br/>send it back I like it so much.  Had I know how difficult it would be to use the documentation<br/>though I likely would not have purchased another Nikon.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The Z7II features a bit snappier auto focus and some changes to the menu.  I am keeping my Z7 as a backup body and retiring my Z50.  I am happy with this purchase.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Great camera with the interesting feature of seeing exactly what your exposure will be through the viewfinder as you compose the image. Bit of a lag from turn on to ready to shoot but not a deal breaker for a landscape photographer. Had to get used to not seeing anything through the viewfinder until I turned on the camera, but again not a deal breaker. I like the smaller size and lighter weight over my old D850. I bought the 24-200 Z lens with it and find it to be a great lens combo and also light weight.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This camera is amazing.  I love it!  I can sum up this purchase by telling a quick story about what a famous professional photographer told a serious amateur friend about camera purchases in a seminar he was holding.  He said, “If you are a serious photography student, do not go out and purchase a camera you think you may not be able to afford.  If you are serious, go out and buy a camera you KNOW you can’t afford!”  If you have Nikkor lenses you can use them with this camera if you also get a converter.</span>

<span>I have had this camera (and the Fuji 100-200mm lens) for less than a month, so I am still in learning stages. As a medium format camera, this is bulkier and heavier than "regular" cameras (and the same for the lens), so it somewhat limits your handheld shooting. It has a large viewing screen and well-placed easily used buttons for main functions. One feature I really like is the Fuji app that enables you to download photos to your iPhone very easily and also to run your shutter remotely with a button on your iPhone so you can eliminate any shake that might arise by pushing the shutter button when the camera is on tripod. I have a to to learn yet about the use of this camera and lens, but in the first few weeks I am quite pleased with it. Oh, I should mention that the 50r does not have image stabilization, so that is a bit of a downer. You have to rely on the OIS in the lens itself. Given the weight of the camera/lens combination, I have had some trouble with sharp handheld shots. As a result I find myself frequently relying on a tripod, and this leads me to think of medium format shooting as a slower process than with other cameras. Having decided this, I am comfortable with it and have shaped my expectations for a medium format outing differently from sessions with other smaller cameras. Mostly I think now this is a function of the lens rather than of the camera. A smaller, lighter prime lens would probably make this a very functional handheld "street shot" camera. But for me, that will have to be for later. These lenses are very expensive. But that's another story. update: One revision I must offer is that the Fuji app does not really live up to one's expectations. When it works, it is wonderful, but it often won't open at all or if it does it may suddenly shut down in the middle of a job and not restart. Fuji really needs to do some work here.</span>

<span>I recently took my GFX100 to Yellowstone for a 6-day shooting workshop, took my 250+1.4TC and the 45mm 2.8 and 23mm f4. I also used a Sony A7R4 with the 600 FE f4. The 600 F4 is also extraordinary and really works great with the 1.4 TC but the GFX100 lets you crop and the resolution and micro-contrast of the lenses coupled with the IBIS and the big sensor turned it into a monster. The best pictures I have taken in my life. The camera struggled to acquire focus a couple of times and I had to turn it off and onto fix the problem. Maybe it was the temperature of 5 F and the wind. The Sony worked flawlessly but the Fuji is in another league when color detail contrast makes the pictures seem to be so real that you cannot but smile. Using the camera is very easy if you come from other Fuji systems as I do. I have my Nikon D850 with great glass as well as Sony and both are superb. Especially for wildlife and Landscape but unless you are shooting birds, or very far away subjects the Fuji GFX100 is the better choice. I shot most of the time handheld at ISO 100-1200</span>

The Fujifilm gfx 50S medium format mirrorless digital camera adopts a 43.8Ｘ32.9mm medium format g format) sensor with 51.4 MP. Featuring premium design and excellent operability stemming from the highly reputable digital camera x series system and the accumulation of image design technology from over 80 years of experience, the gfx 50S achieves the highest ever image quality from released with the APS-C sensor in 2011, the x series has earned high praise from professional photographers and photography enthusiasts alike, due to its excellent image quality and mobility across a wide range of genres including landscapes, snaps, portraits, and sports photos. On the other hand, there were also many photographers craving for the release of a camera equipped with a large-size sensor with an even higher number of effective Pixels, which could be used mainly in the fields of commercial and studio portrait photography, while at the same time keeping the excellent color reproduction of the x series intact. In response to those voices, developed the gfx 50S and the fujinon gf lenses series as a system for photographers that require even higher image quality than can be covered by the current x series lineup.

<span>The performance of this camera is off the chart. It has the best image quality of any camera I have ever owned. To name of few of my favorites: Sony RX1RM2, Sony A7RM2, X-Pro 2 and Leica Q. The GFX has recently gotten me to sell my Sony A7RM2. Don't get me wrong, the camera's I just mentioned all are remarkable but the FujiFilm GFX 50S produces the kind of images that wows me on a regular basis. I am pretty much a pixel peeper when it comes to image quality so it's tough to really impress me.<br/><br/>I realize that I have bought into a larger camera system, but it is well worth the size and weight for (in my opinion) the major bump in image quality. In terms of handling I actually find that the GFX is much more comfortable to shoot than the Sony A7RM2. Truthfully, I hate the location of the viewfinder on the Sony - it's too deeply set into the camera. I always seemed to be torquing my neck and really jamming my nose into the LCD to get my eye into the EVF. The GFX is much more natural shooting experience. That in itself, for me, makes up for the larger size and weight. By no means is the GFX huge, I'd say it is smaller than most standard DSLRs. It roughly the same size as the Panasonic GH5.<br/><br/>So far, I have only tested the 63mm F/2.8 and the Pentax SMCP-FA 645 400mm. The 120mm macro and the 32-64mm should be arriving soon. Hopefully, I'll have more to add after I test those lenses.</span>

<span>The camera had terrible color accuracy and exposure metering. I’m sure you’re saying right now just use the built in calibration functions. Well that would be great if just doing that would make the problem go away. I tried that and it was not a solution and here’s why.<br/><br/>The color balance or light metering was not consistently biased. It would yield results with various imbalanced ratios of RGB. The matrix metering would not average the scene so that one could have a base-line for bracketing (which is essential for my work).<br/><br/>Regardless of whether I used SRGB or Adobe color spaces when shooting or using camera/Adobe color profiles for the image processing in Lightroom I could not get images to look natural(what I saw during the shoot).<br/><br/>This is coming from the Nikon D7000,D800 and D810.<br/><br/>Either Nikon is using some weird color science or I got a bad copy.<br/><br/>Thus, I sent the camera back. And at this point I’m not sure if the D850 is a worthwhile path. I may need to move to mirror-less and leapfrog mirrors all together.<br/><br/>As a professional photographer one needs the equipment to function reliably and consistently.  Yes we shoot RAW file format and have the ability to make corrections but one needs a reliable baseline from which to begin a workflow. In this competitive field one does not have the luxury of time to invasively correct each and every image.</span>

<span>The D850 is a big improvement over my D7000.  Using the same lens and exposure, the D850 does a noticeable better job.  Can't tell if it is the increased pixel density, lack of anti aliasing filter, or what, but a definite improvement.<br/><br/>Haven't used all the available options, but life is easier with the D850.  Focus stacking is so much easier.  The D7000 would do it, but only after being tethered to my tablet/phone or connected with wifi using the TP-Link.  Still not clear on how the length of a focus step is calculated, but just following the instructions have worked well so far, even when doing macro with tubes.  Focus Peaking makes using manual lenses, including the Celestron C5, so much easier.  Nice to have HDR as a menu option.  I do like the HDR option on qDSLRDashboard better with up to 19 exposure available instead of only 3, but then I am back to having to carry my tablet again.  With the improved dynamic range, also a noticeable improvement over the D7000, HDR may be almost a thing of the the past.<br/><br/>The D850 is supposed to get more photos per battery than the D7000.  I think it will but you have to leave the live view/touch screen alone and that is hard to do.  It works very well.  Easy to see in bright sunlight, focus and shoot by touching the screen, using focus peaking, or setting up many of the on camera options require its use.  The electronic shutter, with no noise or vibration, only works in live view.  I can go through a battery on the D850 way faster than with the D7000.<br/><br/>Do miss not have a IR shutter release.  It was so simple and quick to use on the D7000.  Had to do a search on the internet to verify it wasn't on the D850.  Still haven't figured out a fast way to do a wireless shutter release.  Snapbridge is always there, but that is not fast.  You could change your mind by the time that gets set up.  It requires the WIFI connection to work.<br/><br/>The WIFI connection was a big disappointment at first, still not my favorite thing, but I have found a procedure that gets it up and going every time.  Ignore the instructions when you try to connect with wifi.  The bluetooth hasn't been a problem.  Use the camera menu to turn it on and, if the phone/tablet is paired, it will quickly connect.  The only thing bluetooth can do is use the phone/tablet GPS data to geotag your photos, update the time/date on your camera, and turn the camera wifi on.  To turn the camera wifi on select "Download pictures" or "Remote photography" on the Snapbridge app on your phone/tablet.  Every time I do this I get the message that the connection has failed.  Ignore that and go to settings on the phone/tablet where you can now select the camera wifi on the list of available wifis because Snapbridge did turn it on,  and select connect.  Then go back to Snapbridge, select "Remote photography" and it will connect.  Haven't found Snapbridge to be all that useful to control the camera so I usually go to qDSLRDashboard and connect with it.  Works great and works every time, but why can't I just have a menu option, ON THE CAMERA, to turn the wifi on and off.<br/><br/>The other annoyance with the D850 was the cover for the hot shoe not being provided.  I thought at first it must have been left out when the camera was packaged.  Nope.  You just don't get one.  Over $3000 dollars for a camera and you have to get your own cover for the hot shoe.  This is not my first new Nikon camera but it is the most expensive.  I am almost positive this is the first time I had to go find my own hot shoe cover.  It is a nice cover.<br/><br/>Hopefully Nikon continues updating Snapbridge and the D850.  I do like the camera, but I will still find uses for the D7000, like long range backpacking, since it is lighter and easier on batteries.  But then again, the D850 is only about 1 lbs heavier and I think I could learn to leave the live view alone....maybe.<br/><br/>Update<br/>The latest firmware update, part C 1.10, added the option to turn WIFI on/off to the WIFI menu on the camera.  Snapbridge is no longer needed to control the camera WIFI.</span>

<span>I am not a professional photographer, but I do consider myself a serious-enough amateur to spend the amount this camera costs. I had been using a D810 previously and I kept the same trio of F2.8 zooms that I had been using with the D810.<br/><br/>In the month, my main focus was two weeks of shooting during a family trip to Greece and then videoing a house concert that my wife and I sponsored.<br/><br/>Plusses:<br/><br/>1.  Even contrasted with the D810, the bigger sensor is worthwhile. In particular, if you are going to blow up a portion of an image, bring on the pixels!  Using a Nikkor 70-200mm zoom with a 1.7 extender (the largest extender I've tried that does not visibly degrade the image quality, you can do more to bring out far objects in your shots. I know this will matter to me when I am shooting wildlife on a planned trip this summer.<br/>2.  The focusing system is more flexible than the D810 and more accurate. I especially love picking focus points on the rear touch screen -- so much easier than doing so using the buttons on the camera<br/>3.  Speaking of which... That rear screen. It is so clear and bright it pushes me to make more use of Live View, And about time Nikon offered a tilt screen. A great help when I was shooting the concert with the camera on a tripod. Last fall, I photographed the solar eclipse (from a park south of St. Louis. Camera on tripod, sun high in sky and I was lying in the dirt so I could keep an eye on the screen. With this camera, tilt the screen and that makes a difference for people my age. (I am old enough to have used a Nikon F when it was new.)<br/>4. The ergonomics -- a lot of people have commented on the deeper hand grip. A real positive for handheld. And the move of the ISO button makes a lot of sense.<br/>5.  Expeed 5 processing. Almost every time, I adjusted the exposure to override the processor in Greece (lots of bright backlighting in Greek ruins) I found the camera's exposure was superior to my correction. Heck, its tough to teach an old dog like me new tricks, but I respect that processor.<br/>6.  Overall speed. I avoided the D800 because I thought it was too slow for my needs. The D810 was acceptable. This is great -- I do like shooting wildlife<br/>6.  ISO 64.  Yes!!!! In that Greek sunshine I keep the ISO at 64 and the colors and resolution are just beautiful.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1.  This camera is heavy. Its the first Nikon I have owned where it has felt heavy in my hands. Not a problem walking around with the camera on a BlackRapid strap, but a whole day of hand held shooting... not sure.  In Greece, we kept running into "no photography allowed" museums which is fine. But twice I elected to save weight by bringing a D610 body in the expectation that a museum would bar photos anyway. Both times, photos were allowed but shooting in a museum one does not need high pixel counts or speed.<br/>2.  The absence of the U1/U2 settings on the D610 -- easy to define personal settings. The Shooting Banks in the menu are not stable and not nearly as appealing.</span>

<span>I've had this camera for a couple of months now and am really pleased with my decision to upgrade from the Nikon D810.<br/><br/>Image quality is really not that different from my D810 but this camera does nail the white balance far more frequently than the D810 did. This saves me a lot of time in post processing.<br/><br/>Where this camera really blows away the D810 is with the focus engine. Whether it's up to D5 levels or not, it is light years ahead of the D810. I set the D850 to AF-C with dynamic-area (25) focus and simply spray-shot as my two dogs ran around the yard near dusk. The results were shockingly good as the D850 continued to nail shot after shot. With my D810, a play session with the dogs might yield 5-10 usable shots out of several hundred taken. With the D850, I had well over 100 perfectly-focused shots of the frenetic dogs; this was without the benefit of direct sunlight. I shot those with my 85mm F1.4G at F1.4, ISO 1250, and 1/2000 shutter speed. Noise was really low (though visible when you zoom in to 100% view). Fortunately, the noise is fairly easy to clean up in post processing.<br/><br/>The touchscreen is nice and I use it more than I thought I would. Scrolling/zooming an image is not as fast as a smartphone, but it's very good and not painfully laggy. The tilt screen (which tilts both upwards and downwards) is a great addition that lets you set the camera on the floor to capture a crawling baby without having to lay on your stomach.<br/><br/>45MP is a lot of data. I shoot RAW and I learned this weekend that I can fill a 32GB card in a matter of minutes when doing action photography. For that reason, I moved to a 128GB card. I went with the Sony G UHS-II SD card and performance is magnificent. I considered a 128GB XQD, but I already had a good SD reader and at the time I needed them, XQD cards and readers were in short supply. Due to the extremely good performance of the Sony G UHS-II SD cards, I'm content to stick with SD even though I know XQD can be faster. Either way, 32GB (~300 shots) is not enough storage for this camera if you shoot RAW so plan on a large card.<br/><br/>As a former owner of a D700 and then the D810, I can tell you that as an owner of either of those, you'll be thrilled with this camera. If you're still using the magnificent D700, be prepared for image handling to be drastically slower unless you've recently upgraded your computer. If you've already jumped to 36MP, then going to 45MP is not really a noticeable difference.</span>

<span>We purchased this camera for work purposes and have to say, it does do the job. I was able to zoom a pretty good distance (more than what is actually needed). The flash is not the best BUT after walking the property and taking random photos - the camera did pick-up lowlight areas and did brighten the scene, so the photo did come out clear and brighter. I wouldn't recommend this camera for a person who is experienced and is used to a more sophisticated DSLR camera as it would be a disappointment to you. This is great for someone wanting to learn how to take photos and doesn't want to carry multiple lenses around at the same time. Although these cameras were purchased for work, I did catch some pretty nice shots. The main caveat I will say is the LINK123, APP. Unfortunately, the app does not always function when you want it to. Also, it would be nice to be able to open the app without syncing your camera to view older saved photos in your camera gallery.<br/><br/>Overall, if you would like an introductory camera with pretty neat options - I would recommend this camera.</span>

<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>I've only had this camera for 2 or 3 weeks so my experience is limited, but so far I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.<br/><br/>This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.<br/><br/>It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is "open" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)<br/><br/>It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.<br/><br/>Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The "mixed" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)<br/><br/>The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of "creative" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.<br/><br/>The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable "quick menu", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.<br/><br/>Drawbacks I've noticed:<br/><br/>You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.<br/><br/>It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.<br/><br/>I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera after purchasing a Lumix FZ1000Mk2, to compare the two. The FZ300 was US$300 cheaper, and I wondered if I could get by with it instead of the FZ1000Mk2. I found the form factor to be a bit small for my larger hands, and didn't really care for the zoom control on the lens barrel. There have been some instances "in the wild" of the zoom lever surrounding the shutter release failing, so having a secondary zoom control is good, but this one seemed somewhat vague.<br/><br/>My background is a series of digital point and shoot cameras going back to the Agfa 1250. I've had perhaps 10-12 digital cameras since that time, culminating in the Sony Alpha 900, with a complete, and I mean complete, kit of Minolta lenses for that body. That said, I got to the point where dragging along a backpack of lenses and filters to be more than I wanted. My Lumix LX5 and LX7 languished in a drawer, the iPhone 10Xr had taken on more and more photography duties, but it in itself let me down on many occasions, especially in low light.<br/><br/>I ended up getting the Canon G5X Mk2 as a new pocket camera with a better zoom range than the LX7. What I needed along with that was a super-zoom bridge camera to take the place of the lenses I was giving up with the Sony A900, and the furthest reach I had with that kit was an f8 500mm reflector...<br/><br/>In the end, I found that neither the FZ300 or the FZ1000Mk2 really met my needs and settled on the FZ2500, which while still a very good camera for stills, has a more impressive video capability, even though that is secondary to my needs. The FZ2500 has a weight and size that feels better to me, the ergonomic feel more like a traditional interchangable lens camera, and it will record video only limited by battery and memory capacity.<br/><br/>The FZ300 is a VERY capable camera, and it is a favorite among people who shot birds. The 1/2.3" sensor gives it better optical zoom reach. In the end, I wanted the larger camera and a 1" sensor to match the Canon. so the FZ300 was returned along with the FZ1000Mk2.<br/><br/>That said, I did recommend the FZ300 to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I believe she will be happy with it. Indeed, I think for anyone wanting something that is a huge step up from a smart phone, in a fairly light package (600+ grams) with weather sealing will appreciate this camera. It simply wasn't right for me.</span>

<span>I found this camera to have less zoom capability than the Canon PowerShot SX 70 HS, but much easier and more intuitive to set from the menus.  It has similar capabilities overall. It is somewhat better for macro photos but is not as good for landscape in my experience.  It has good innards and a Leica lens.<br/>It is a bridge, or hybrid camera and is very handy, but does not have the capabilities of a DSLR.<br/>There are better YouTube tutorials for this camera, than the Canon PowerShot SX 70.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> ULTIMATE RESOLUTION, DEPENDABLE PROCESSING: Powered by Fujifilm’s high-performance X-Processor 4 quad-core CPU, GFX100S utilizes its 102MP, back-illuminated large format CMOS sensor to create truly stunning results. Create remarkably detailed still images that possess amazing color fidelity, and rich shadow detail, with enough dynamic range to allow for astonishing push and pull adjustments in post-production. Or, use Pixel Shift Multi-Shot to create ultra-high resolution 400MP stills with remarkable detail. In video mode, record 4K/30p footage in 10-bit F-log or 12-bit ProRes RAW, with an incredibly beautiful depth of field, for a look that is made for the silver-screen.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> SMALL, BUT STEADY: Sitting at the heart of GFX100S is a newly developed shutter and In-Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) system that helps ensure you always make the most of the extreme resolution of the camera’s 102MP imaging sensor. While reduced in size, compared to their counterparts in GFX100, both elements offer incredible performance, with the new shutter capable of 5fps continuous shooting and the unique, five-axis IBIS now working in conjunction with GF Lens Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) to provide up to 6 stops of correction. With such outstanding performance, GFX100S frees you from a tripod and lets you keep creating even when the light is low.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> THE SHARP END OF AF TECHNOLOGY: With an advanced phase detection autofocus (AF) system, GFX100S spearheads a whole new era of large format digital camera systems. An updated autofocus algorithm brings subjects into focus in as quickly as 0.18 sec, even in light levels as low as -5.5EV. This extraordinary performance is strengthened by the presence of phase detect autofocus pixels across nearly 100% of the frame, resulting in complete precision regardless of where the subject is. Combined with responsive tracking and reliable Face/Eye Detection, GFX100S lets large format photographers enjoy reliably accurate AF, even in low-contrast situations.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> LARGE FORMAT HAS NEVER FELT LIKE THIS: The GFX system already has a strong reputation for taking high-resolution photography out of the studio and into the world, but GFX100S takes it even further. Not only does it have a super-tough magnesium-alloy casing, but it is also made to operate in temperatures as low as 14°F (-10°C) and to be dust- and weather-resistant for those off-road moments. At less than 2 pounds (900g), its compact body is comparable in size to many full-frame cameras, but it contains an incredible, 102MP sensor that’s almost twice the physical size of the typical full-frame sensor! Simply put, whether you are creating handheld portraits on location, or framing landscapes in the remote wilderness, GFX100S will truly let you harness the extreme power of large format.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> ICONIC COLOR MADE FOR YOU: Fujifilm’s expertise in color science is legendary among image makers. For more than 86 years, Fujifilm has been responsible for some of the world’s most iconic photographs and movies. GFX100S gives you access to this wealth of experience at the touch of a button, powered by one of the world’s most widely acclaimed digital color processing engines. With a choice of 19 exclusive FUJIFILM Film Simulation modes, it is easy to achieve fantastic color straight out of camera. With a new FIlm Simulation mode to explore - Nostalgic Neg. - it may just be worth it to spend a little more time here than you originally thought.  </span></li>

GFX100S is a new generation of large format digital camera, designed to suit a new generation of creators. The 102MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor combines with the X-Processor 4 quad-core CPU to deliver images of astonishing quality and professional 4K/30p video. The camera’s five-axis In-Body Image Stabilization provides up to 6 stops of vibration reduction, while phase detection autofocus pixels, covering nearly 100% of the frame, work at speeds of up to 0.18 sec in light as low as -5.5EV. Have the freedom to create, even when the light begins to fade, and do it knowing that Fujifilm’s legendary color science will deliver the beautiful tones it is renowned for time and time again. Considering that all this is housed in a camera body comparable in size to many full-frame cameras, it’s clear that FUJIFILM GFX100S is blazing a new trail in the worlds of photography and filmmaking.

<span>Have received my second body after my first one stoped working and one and a half months later it s still working but it has been freezing up almost every photoshoot. Removing and reinstalling the battery helps but again you would expect semi flawless performance for $6K. If it wasn’t for picture quality I would have sold all my Fujifilm gear by now.<br/>I am 100% convinced that GFX100s have issues that need to be fixed.</span>

<span>How about that 33 days, 4 weddings and few events shot with it and it is dead now 😖. 6000$ for a camera that did not even lasted a that long. Even having a back up camera I still missed a critical moment during ceremony. Fujifilm is it normal?</span>

<span>Finally a medium format that’s quick enough for sports photos. At 5 fps burst, it’s not quite the performance you find in the smaller format high-end DSLRs, but it’s sufficient for occasional sports photographer - like my kids’ soccer games. My priority is high res medium format, but I don’t want to have a separate camera for the occasional sports photos. I currently own the 50r, but rented this body for the week from LensRental - highly recommend btw. It appears impossible to purchase this body at this time as everyone is out of stock, but I plan to replace my 50r with it as soon as more stock is available. This is a dramatic improvement over the 50r.</span>

<span>Honestly, for the price I was expecting something more DSLR-y. But what I got was a point-and-shoot that was buffed up to make it look like more than it is. Honestly when I picked it up out of the box I thought someone had scammed me. It feels like a kid's toy, a big hollow plastic camera. If not for the screen on the back, I think anyone could mistake it for that. It feels cheap and hollow inside.  But okay never mind the feel, it's all about the pictures right. And the pictures are on the same level of a point and shoot too. I was prepared to give it a chance, despite my initial disappointment, until I saw the grainy low light pictures and the extremely poor dynamic range on the video. I was very impressed with the autofocus though for pictures, it was very speedy. Less impressed with the videos where it couldn't keep focus when I zoomed in.<br/><br/>There are so many easy to access settings that provide those point and shoot features you'd expect, but it also allows you the more precise controls you'd expect from a better camera. The screen on the back is nice too. it's easy to hold when taking selfies, as long as you want to hold it with your left hand. For $200 less it would be a wonderful choice for a high quality point and shoot. And you might find it on sale for that price, And if you do I can recommend it. Maybe this camera is trying to fill that middle range between the two types of cameras.</span>

<span>I am not a professional. I wanted a camera that was better than the garbage that comes on a cell phone, but didn't want something as bulking as most DSLR camera. I wanted to be able to take it with me most places I went. This is what I arrived at. Very good camera, take incredible quality pictures! They don't look super great on the screen, but once I brought them over to my laptop they looked INCREDIBLE!<br/><br/>Only 2 things I was a little disappointed with. I really wish you could snap pictures faster. it's still MUCH faster than an average cell phone, so I was still okay. Just not as fast as DSLR's.<br/><br/>I was also a little disappointed by the app designed to import pictures to your phone wirelessly. I didn't really know it was going to require wifi, so it's difficult to do while you're out an about for the purpose of social media. Just have to stop at a coffee shop or something. This wasn't the whole reason I bought the camera, so not a huge issue.<br/><br/>All and all, I would still really recommend this camera for someone who wants good quality photos without lugging around a huge bag with camera parts. I didn't expect to spend this much, but a quality camera, even one designed to be smaller, lighter and more maneuverable, is going to cost you.</span>

<span>just wanted to communicate a quick message. not that i want to focus on negatives but these things jumped immediately as not so great at me when using the camera for the first time.<br/>for all of this i subtracted 1 star.<br/>From all i was reading i do expect that all other function perform as described.<br/><br/>1. It said charging can be done through USB cable, so i was hoping that for long-term exposure (like astro photography etc)  one can add an external battery to keep it going bit NO:<br/>"Even if charging is in progress, it stops when the<br/>camera is turned on."<br/>that is what the manual says and i checked it is true<br/>2. the EVF is activated by eye contact. basically the moment the EFV is darkened. the weird thing is when reviewing images on the LCD and then you look through the EFV to see more details etc the camera switched to the regular recording mode. to see the image in the EVF you have to put your eye on it and THEN switch to viewing mode.<br/>on all other Pen cameras i use the EVF-1/2 and it is switched by a button on the EVF which i like better.<br/>3. the battery door has no automatic lock when it is closed, you have to manually move a little slide. also different from previous Pen's. i though it was broken.<br/>4. autofocus seems ok but have not directly compared to my EP5 and EPL9. once thing that bothered me on that older cameras was that they did not focus well on the moon at all which disappointed me a lot (that was with the 14-150mm zuiko).<br/>5. EVF: clearly the external EVF-1/2 have the advantage that they are articulate. meaning you can orient them 90 degrees up which is very convenient for many situations. now that would be great to do here too. or they could have added the port to use the EVF in addition when needed.<br/><br/>update1:<br/>(2) i found out that the automatic switching of the EVF can be turned off with a button next to it - very good!<br/><br/>Update 2, Jan 2 2021<br/>Did my first shooting outdoors. AF works very good compared to my epl9 and ep5. It even focussed very easily to the moon.<br/>The 2 dials on the top are very convenient to quickly change key parameters.<br/>I explored the HDR function a little but have not seen too dramatic impact. On my phone I use Snapseed for HDR and feel it has more impact on the image. But so far so good.<br/>I also played with the Art14,splash color, function and it is working well.<br/>More later<br/><br/>2021 january update 2:<br/>tried the nightscape mode for the stars. everyone who has interest in that one probably knows the Pleiadies (see picture). this was taken handheld with Zuiko lens 40-150mm, not bad overall. the camera takes 8 frames with 1/10 sec each and combines then. outcome is not bad at all. to get the focus to work i had to point first to another brighter star and kept eh release button pressed half down when pointing then to the barely visible Pleiadies (this was in the city so no really dark sky).  this scene mode does not allow for manual focus which would be nice.</span>

<span>Camera is great at almost everything it dose, what it lacks is connective ability that previous models have, you can't currently use it as a webcam or use a laptop or tv as a giant view finder and control device.  The only connectivity you have is using your cellphone through an Olympus app with limited functionality. I wanted something more modern to compliment today's age of seamless cross platform usage &amp; the camera  is just lacking in that aspect, you have wifi &amp; bluetooth  connectivity but its limited. It's difficult to take full advantage of the 180 flip down screen without a sufficient tripod that won't block the screen, it requires some serious creativity. If I could return the camera and buy the OMD E5 Mark iii I would go for it because this camera is limited to just snapping photos and video</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>
