For today's interchangeable lens camera enthusiasts or anyone looking for a lighter, newer more intelligent alternative to bulky DSLRs, the Panasonic Lumix 4K Digital Camera DMC G85MK with 12 60mm Power O.I.S. lens delivers impressive, no compromise performance. This 4K Mirrorless Micro Four Thirds camera is nearly half the size of most DSLRs yet delivers impressive 16 megapixel large sensor performance in the most compact camera system ever designed by Panasonic Lumix. Thanks to the elimination of the low pass filter, its fine detail resolving power is boosted nearly 10 percent over previous 16 megapixel sensors. Image stabilization is top of its class with the complementary Lumix 2 axis lens O.I.S. and a new 5 axis in body I.S., available in either photo or video recording modes. Camera purists will enjoy the familiar quick access thumbwheel controls and integrated 2360K dot eye level electronic live viewfinder, plus an articulating flip LCD display for greater flexibility in difficult shooting angles. Modern enthusiasts will love the Wi Fi mobile control and next generation flexibility that 4K Video, 4K photo and 4K Post Focus modes bring to the creative experience.

<span>Currently using automatic mode because I am new to cameras. My novice eyes are blown away by picture quality. I feel like a professional but by no means am I. I plan on taking family portrait photos for a business adventure but will be using this on the side for streaming and adventures as well. I would 100% recommend this camera even for a noob like myself.</span>

<span>I mostly use this for video and I'm very impressed with this camera. I want to shoot and then minimize editing as much as possible so that's why I like the G85 so much. The 4k video quality with standard un-graded settings is better than the GH4 I replaced this with.  The clarity and color is better with the standard settings and I don't really have time to get lost in post processing.  I also compared this to the Sony RX10iii and its 4k video quality was just a tiny bit less detailed but the overall look was better with the G85. Also the menu settings are so much easier with the g85 over the Sony.  Also the button placement is much more intuitive with the G85. Auto focus seems about the same but I mainly use manual for video to make sure it stays in focus.  Especially because I'm shooting in a controlled environment.  I'll miss the wide focus range but not by that much and I can always buy more lenses with the G85.  Another thing is the G85 seems like it has a touch less crop shooting in 4k so I can get a slightly larger angle.  That bothers me with all cameras when shooting 4k and I wish I could get the 35mm equivalent of 24mm out of it instead of more like 28mm in 4k. Also it seems that the  Pictures were much better with the G85.  It seems that whenever I put the RX10iii in auto focus to try to get some kid pics for fun 1 out of 5 pics came out correctly where almost every pic comes out correctly with the G85.  For me the f3.5 does a good job but it sure does look better with the f2.8 12-35 lens. I thought my untrained eye might not pick that up but it did. Everything looks better even when comparing f3.5 vs. f3.5.  It's pricey so it might not be for everyone.  I also tried the Sony a6300 and it was an amazing camera but it overheated very quickly weather I pulled the monitor away from the body or not.  So there was no way I could keep it and that's a major deal breaker.  The G85 can get warm but never get's so hot that it over heats and shuts down when shooting for extended periods in 4k.  I shot for about 4-5 hours in a row shootiing 5-8 minute vids at a quick turn around and it never shut down. It got a little warmer than the GH4 and Sony RX10iii but never malfunctioned so all is well.<br/><br/>The one issue I have with the G85 is I wish there was a 4k 30mbps instead of just 4k 100mbps.  I shot around 40 5-8 minute videos and it was something like 122Gb.  I had to use compression software to keep it which is a bit anoyying.  Love the water/dust resistance and that is what kept me from keeping the G7.  It also feels like a better made camera than the G7 with a more intuitive layout too.<br/><br/>If you are like me, an intermediate, who needs a good camera with 4k for work but doesn't want to go too deep into the post processing world it's hard to find a better camera.</span>

<span>In this day of camera smart-phones, is there still a place for DSLRs?<br/><br/>I say yes, if you actually want to take pictures rather than snapshots and if you are willing spend some money and are ready to haul some stuff around to take those pictures. I settled on the Micro 4/3 format because it is the most easily portable DSLR camera, and therefore the most likely to be used by me.  I don't see myself printing larger than 8x10 photos so 16mp is more than enough and overkill for social media. The regular-speed 4K video is more than adequate for and videography I will be doing (invest in a good mike to up your game).<br/><br/>A HUGE plus is the fact that this camera and kit lens that cam with it are weather-sealed so I have peace of mind taking it on a hike.<br/><br/>I look forward for using 4K pre-burst mode, it is literally a time machine, letting you capture an event up to one second before you push the shutter button! It allows you to follow your child on the field and to get the shots you really want with having to take thousands of pictures.<br/><br/>There are trade-offs for not going full-frame sensor (e.g. low-light performance, less depth of field) but the price differential, $697 on sale with a 12-60mm weather proof lens, rather than thousands for the bigger camera? It was a no brainer for me.<br/><br/>Great ergonomics, custom setting modes that can be saved to allow up to 4 different set-ups, a very good and versatile kit lens (24-120mm 35mm equivalent focal length) all in a camera that I will take on day hikes.<br/><br/>Go on Youtube and watch some videos about what this camera can do. You will see that it is still more than adequate for a hobby-enthusiast.  It has rekindled my love of photography.  Happy snapping!</span>

<span>Exactly what I wanted, what I needed and what I saw in so many reviews. I love this camera! Is 16MP enough...if you're going to spend less then $10K for a complete photography setup then the answer is yes! If you're spending that kind of money on your gear then the kind of work you're doing probably would benefit from more MPs, probably 50MP and above! Don't forget the body is just the start. You need vibration reduction on the body or on the lenses (unless the camera is a permanent fixture in a studio on a tripod) and lenses with the quality to match those extra MPs. The G85 with the water resistant body that is identical to this camera is also great with the added physical robustness of the body. I use this camera for both professional and personal projects and I love it. Even equipped with my "magician's bag of tricks" of adapters, tripod, etc I can still carry it all for a full day without complaining a bit. Not so with a DSLR. A camera is a personal thing to a semi-professional or professional. How you like the placement of buttons, knobs, accessibility of features etc. is all part of why pros spend all that money. For a user who wants to spend &lt; $2k and be able to take photographs in most conditions at professional quality levels these higher end micro 4/3rd camera are simply a Godsend. This one definitely lives up to its hype.<br/><br/>Also in case you're wondering if you're better off with a $1k cellphone to take pictures. If you're shooting objects close to you (say within 20ft) and your lighting is going to be good, you just want to point and shoot and you're going to shoot the occasional picture then maybe you can stick with your phone. However with this camera and the right lenses, adapters, etc. you can shoot pretty much anything in any condition with vast flexibility and still be mobile. A spare battery cost $10 and you can be ready to shoot video or stills after a dead battery within 30 seconds if you have a spare charged battery on hand. No speed charging on a cell phone will allow that (not to mention your $1k cellphone battery will get chewed up charging and discharging for many cycles). High quality optical zoom lenses that mate with mm precision to a sensor with as little bit of glass (lenses) between them are vital to getting the highest quality shots. This is why modern high end zoom lenses (which require multiple pieces of glass) are so expensive because every piece of glass you put in between the sensor and the subject has to be of higher and higher quality to make up for the loss of image quality/brightness of the light passing through the glass itself. So those add on lenses for cell phones give you less and make you pay more. If you are buying a cellphone for the camera...I'd advise you check out this camera and buy a cheaper cell phone. With the power and quality of all cameras on reputable cellphones these days saying you're buying a phone for the "amazing camera" doesn't make sense if you're looking into photography as a serious hobby unless your budget forces you to chose between a phone and a camera and the phone is a necessity for most people.</span>

<span> UPDATED 12/30/2021<br/><br/>PROS: Comes with a 2-lens kit at an affordable price; has more features than any competitor at that price; well-constructed and solid housing; many other better brands such as Canon and Nikon have relatively flimsy construction, the menu screen is great better than competitors, great video. If you register with Panasonic, they gave a three-year warranty which came in helpful because I dropped it quite a bit.  I attached a video of a band, and you can see the quality for yourself. This is in a nightclub with poor lighting and acoustics, but I think the camera did a pretty good job.  No camera has everything, but all-in-all this is a great all-around camera.  I can put it in my jacket or coat pocket if I am not using it.<br/><br/>CONS: No built-in mic but not usually needed unless you are using it for professional video but there are workarounds for that.  The sound is actually pretty decent for what I use it for. I attached a video. The viewfinder is small as noted but not as bad as people make it sound.<br/><br/>The negative comments about the battery life or not having a memory card are nonsense or may have been used equipment or defective. I have had no problem with battery BUT I would STRONGLY recommend getting the separate battery pack and extra battery as I would for any mirrorless camera - that is how all of them are.  ALL mirrorless cameras have a shorter battery life than an old SLR because mirrorless cameras are always in use when turned on. If you turn off when you are not using, it lasts quite a while, but unlike an SLR you can't just turn it on and let it sit there without using the battery.  People who complained about this don't know how mirrorless cameras work.<br/><br/>No camera comes with a memory card and not many come with a separate battery back. You could charge in-phone but that's annoying. I have no problem with the wi-fi either. Some people should stick with point and click if they don't want to bother learning how to use a slightly more capable camera.  You would spend at least $1000 to get a better camera as of 2020.  I paid $450 for the 2-lens kit somehow during a sale but even for the recent $600 price, it's a good deal. I got mine last year around Thanksgiving, but I did not see that re-offered at that price. Pictures attached are what I took, including some touching up. Video is out of the can, nothing else. For me the sound is good.<br/><br/>I think this is the best camera in this price range and I would not spend more because I am clumsy and drop it a lot and would be really upset with a more expensive camera. However, Panasonic honored it's 3-year warranty (if you register it) so that was good. I did not buy the extended warranty but in the future, I think I would.<br/><br/>The current price is $795; I paid $450. I still think it's a good camera, but I would wait for a sale. I believe the price increase is due to the supply chain issues.</span>

<span>First, I am a proud owner &amp; professional Videographer who uses Panasonic gear as my primary tool for VIDEO imaging purposes (for pro photo, I have to use Canon alas - wish it was different.. though for everyday photo the GX85 is perfectly fine). I have owned pretty much all flavors of Lumix cameras from GH1, GH2, G6, G7, GH3, GH4 to the GX85. I was excited about the GX85 as a small camera tool to shoot videos on the go for my events without having to use extra gear (gorilla pod, etc) to film detail &amp; movement shots quickly using the new 5-axis IBIS on the GX85 that no other Panasonic camera has. I was very intrigued and positively influenced by reviewers online to purchase this item for my work.<br/><br/>After two events covered (full day weddings), I have to say that there is a lot to like about the GX85 and a few very annoying things to dislike as others have said. Panasonic tends to create many different variations of a camera these days with several big flaws in each so  you have to buy them all it seems...<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/>- The TINY electronic viewfinder is going to be the worse part of this camera. You can barely squeeze your eye into it and accurately use it when you shoot. I don't have big eyes either... After about 5-10mins of usage, my eyes hurt a lot because of the squinting I have to make when shooting with that EVF... And I've never had any issues with other Lumix cameras which I've used for hours non-stop, except the LX100 which I've borrowed in the past and is similarly flawed. I wished they had kept the GX7 type of eyepiece for the viewfinder for this supposedly GX7 mark II update that is the GX85. The resolution isn't bad, and I am not too worried about the ghosting / refresh rate if I can barely get my eyes to see through that EVF viewfinder which also lacks tilting compared to the GX7.<br/>- The battery life is not very good either... With the panasonic OEM battery, you can maybe squeeze 1h15min to 1h30 of recording because you have to rely heavily on the LCD display instead of the EVF... With non-Panasonic batteries, you get about the same depending on which one you buy, but you lose the knowledge of knowing exactly when the battery dies as these cheap batteries will display 2-bars and go suddenly to die after about 1h or 1h30 of usage.<br/>- LCD display lacks degree of movement... It can only tilt a little bit down or a little up to about 30 degrees... So it's useless for selfies or filming with LCD display flipped open like on a GX8, G7 or GH3/4<br/>- Lack of Microphone jack... The audio isn't bad but not nearly as good as a standalone shotgun mic... Plus you get the extra vibration sound from IBIS which can be annoying<br/>- SD card slot under the camera next to battery slot... Makes it hard to change cards when mounted on a tripod...<br/>- Lack of quick manual AF-S/AF-C/MF switching mechanism like on GX7 or GX8... You can program one of the FN button but it still prevents you from switching from AF to MF when you are recording... which is so crippling as often times you just want to switch on the fly between the AF-C and MF without having to stop recording video.<br/><br/>The Pros:<br/>- 5-axis Stabilizer IBIS... Used in conjunction with the Panasonic lenses which have IS on lens... this makes it a very good camera for shooting video &amp; stills without too much blur or shake... The videos are not smooth like when  you use a gimball... but it definitely helps big time. I'd say it's on par with the Olympus IBIS such as that on EM5-Mark II... There are definitely some artifacts though still like jerk in motion... The supplied tiny 12-32mm lens (equivalent of 24 - 64mm Full frame) seems to do a very good job though working with the GX85 on camera IBIS to remove as much shake as possible. It's not perfect though and you will always get better movement shots with a gimbal or stabilizer. But on the go, it does a very good job filming with little shake when you don't have a tripod with you. It's not perfect though and does create some minimal vibration sound/feel to the body.<br/>- 4K and different 1080p video flavors. That's Panasonic's strength... Though it lacks in terms of higher bit rate that you can find on GH4 or GH3. Still the videos are good on this tiny camera<br/>- Lightweight / Can be carried in many places without being obtrusive. It's not tiny but small enough to fit in a jacket pocket. The benefits of Micro 4/3...<br/>- Low light seems to be better than the GH4 or G7. The improved engine seems to give pretty good results even at ISO 3200 for video &amp; photos. I'm glad it improved... Now let's hope we can actually shoot photos at ISO 6400... It's still not there for ISO higher than 3200... An improvement nevertheless compared to past recent LUMIX iterations.<br/><br/>Overall... This is a very good addition to the LUMIX lineup mostly because of the 5-axis In-Body Image Stabilizer Panasonic has finally been able to implement... You only wish Panasonic would actually create a camera that has all of its best features instead of always crippling each new addition with flaws that didn't have to be there... But it's their game these days... Let's hope the GH5 includes the IBIS on the GX85 which is a given, with improved clean &amp; usable ISO6400 video &amp; photo in low light, and I can happily get rid of all my Canon gear for both Photo &amp; Video...</span>

This is a wonderful camera and if you know how to use a camera all the extra features in here are amazing. (I came from a rebel t2i) It took me 2-3 shoots to adjust all the settings but having updated gear has helped me grow exponentially.

<span>I own both the original 6D as well as the RP. Ive only had the RP for a short time, but here are some of my impressions. All in all, it seems to be a very good camera. Other than the resolution, I still prefer the images from my 6D but as I said, its early yet.<br/>I think the body is a little cheapy feeling. The ergonomics are good and you really dont need the extra bottom plate unless you have gigantic hands. It has a good grip and as everyone has mentioned, its very light. Of course until you add some big EF lenses. Other than the nice grip it tends to remind me of a Sony in that everything is minimal, controls are flush to the body, all black. I would have prefered a little better leatherette cover, and some more slr like controls. However, im being picky here and this would all affect the size and weight of the camera.<br/>The EVF is a top notch feature.  For landscapes in particular, there really has been no other way but Live View through the LCD, but that has changed. You can almost forget about the rear LCD except for certain purposes, the EVF is that good. It allows you to control everything and see everything including exposure. You can see in the EVF whether the sky is blown out etc. And thanks to drag and focus, you can easily move the focus point , get the exposure you like and lock it in with exposure lock. It is very much like having a peephole LCD. Big points for this.<br/>The autofocus is excellent and you can have a combination of them in place at the same time. The eye detect focus from my limited use is very fast and does a great job. If you want to to change the focus, just touch your LCD while looking through the EVF and you can move it, almost anywhere in the frame.<br/>There are a number of other great features such as focus bracketing that ive yet to try, but that one has the potential to be great. So all that being said, lets get to the image quality.<br/>Anyone moving from an aps-c to full frame Im sure will be very impressed with the RP. With a good lens you cant beat that combination of razor sharp and creamy soft that full frame offers. The colors of course are very good as expected, and here is a surprize. I was expecting the DR to be a real downer but its not. I convert to dng and edit in other programs other than DPP and i was surprised at how much range there is. Its certainly not class leading, but it is very respectable. If you need more than this, you really took a bad exposure. The low light performance is very good, and you can get very respectable images even beyond 12800 ISO with a little work. Now i have to say this, for whatever reason, i still prefer the images of the original 6D. I cant say exactly why, a combination of the tone, color and what i like to call the creaminess is still better for me on the 6D. But again I am splitting hairs. For the most part, the RP is capable of producing images rivaling the best of Canons full frame cameras. And it has a lot of practical convenience features that make this one hell of a camera for the price.</span>

<span>I worried about the smaller size before purchasing, so I got the additional grip. Although the camera is larger than I expected, I still need the grip to hold the body comfortably. I haven't tried any large lenses yet, but the jpegs and raw files really were incredible. No need to use the histogram or spot metering to nail exposure even in backlight situations. I shoot stills and manual focus. Using the EVF provided a pleasant experience manual focusing in bright sunlight. So the negative reviews are unfortunate and even wrong given my experience.</span>

<span>I recently set out to find a good camera capable of DSLR quality images but in a compact, lightweight, and easy to carry around design. After carefully reviewing this camera as well as several others in its class, I settled on the a6000. I am pleased to say I love this camera. The quality of images is outstanding with the large sensor and high mega pixel count. The camera packs a lot of features to it. I love how fast the focus is and the amazing fps.<br/><br/>My only major criticism of the camera:<br/>The lack of being able to use the auto bracket and timer mode simultaneously.  This is a serious flaw that Sony needs to address and hopefully will with a firmware upgrade. It is possible to get the results you need but in a harder work-around. So if you do a lot of HDR photography for example, this is something you will want to consider.<br/><br/>I have a few non-serious nitpicks:<br/>-Some have criticized the battery life of the camera. While it could definitely be better, for the type of shooting I do (mostly travel photography and occasional high speed continuous shooting for action shots), I have been able to deal with it. But I also ordered two non-Sony brand batteries to use as back up which helps a lot. I recommend obtaining extra batteries to have on hand. The camera does feature a battery life meter on the display (indicated in %) to help you know when the battery is getting low.<br/>- The camera doesn't come with a body cap. While these are inexpensive and easy to obtain, it is nice to have a cap on hand, especially being a mirrorless camera where the sensor has nothing in front of it when a lens or cap is not attached.<br/>- A wall battery charger would have been nice. Instead, you must charge the battery via the camera and plug that in to the wall. Lame. Do yourself a favor and order separately, a wall charger and extra batteries for this camera. There are some non-Sony brand chargers/batteries on amazon you can get inexpensively. I ordered two non-Sony brand extra batteries and a wall charger bundled for about $25 and they work well and the charger also charges the real Sony battery.<br/>- Hopefully there will be more choices of Sony E mount lenses in the future. The ones I have used so far are good though.<br/><br/>If rating this camera a 4.5 were an option, I would choose it. Only because of the issue of not being able to use the bracketing and using the timer simultaneously. But it wasn't enough to dock it a full point as it is something I am hopeful Sony can fix with firmware changes and is something I can live with if they don't.<br/><br/>All in all, this camera has exceeded my expectations and is a joy to shoot with. You will especially love this camera if you don't want to carry a big heavy SLR around but still want excellent quality pictures. For my needs, this the best camera I have ever owned and I imagine it will last for a long time!</span>

<span>A solid camera but you're paying for what you get 100%. This is an old(ish) camera and you could spend a bit more to get something nicer. That being said, I'm a big fan. I feel that you just have to work a little harder to get great photos whereas life felt a bit easier with a 'nicer' more expensive camera. Still a happy camper shooting good quality stuff.</span>

<span>I purchased the a6000 to begin building a new photo system.  I’ve had 3 great Canon DSLRs and never put much money in to the lenses, so I didn’t feel trapped in Canon land.  I’ve used many different systems besides what I’ve owned, don’t call myself a “pro” although photography has been a source of income in my life.  Basically, I know what I’m doing...ok? Lol.  I had a budget of about $2,000 which could get me any of the latest Canons or Nikons, and I chose this little inexpensive machine.<br/><br/>With the a6000 I get good manual control of just one setting or every setting, depending on what I’m doing and how much time I have to do it myself.  I haven’t used a fully automatic setting since I was a kid, advanced users like me enjoy this “cooking” if you will.<br/><br/>The camera will strike you as a high quality unit.  One of the biggest reasons DSLR cameras are so extensively used is the instant shutter.  No perceptible delay when you push the button, and this little mirrorless shoots stills faster than any Canon, with no perceptible delay.  It is amazing.  A pro could cheat with it and save weight, except customers expect a huge battery grip Canon or Nikon and a huge lens, not this tiny wonder.  I love this camera.<br/><br/>The only possible negatives I see are minor:<br/><br/>the proximity sensor for switching between the viewfinder and screen.  It gets confused and once in a while if I’m framing with the screen, my finger will trigger the finder.  I may wind up turning the screen off; the finder is much better.<br/><br/>Battery life sucks (the way it is in the mirrorless age).  I’m going to get another battery and a charger for it.  Wonder why the tiny oled finder uses more power than the 3” lcd.  Weird.<br/><br/>Also in a mirrorless camera there should be a truly silent mode with only an electronic shutter.  a6000 lets you set the first shutter to electronic which is what I use for single shots, otherwise it sounds like your taking 2 photos.  The flagship a7 can shoot without making a sound - wish the press would go Sony so we don’t hear machine gun DSLRs clapping away at a news conference.<br/><br/>Great camera, maybe a new standard in value.<br/><br/>The small zoom lens in the kit has power zoom.  I don’t want zoom at all, especially not with noisy motors although the action isn’t as loud as a point n shoot with permanent lenses.  Some day I will get a prime lens from Zeiss with simple AF and nothing more.  Screw zoom.  You will make better photos by learning to take a scene with a fixed lens.</span>

<span>Very unhappy right now - one of the key functions of the camera is dead.<br/><br/>I upgraded from Nex 5T to this model instead of Nex 6 because Nex 6 does not have NFC. With Nex 5, i was using NFC all the time to transfer pictures form camera to my phone via Sony PlayMemories app, it worked great and was very convenient when travelling.<br/>A6000 does have NFC, but the camera I've received was not able to connect to my phone - Sony Xperia Z2, which is newest flagship Sony smartphone - how funny is that! I was also not able to connect to my wife's HTC One, whereas my Nex 5T is connecting to both phones with no issues.<br/>So I went online and read reviews in Google Play store - a lot of users of Sony PlayMemories app is complaining about the same thing - they can't connect camera to the phone using NFC. The problem is not limited to particular phone model, but rather this is camera related issue - I've seen people with Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Sony Xperia Z, Z1, Z2, Motorola, etc, being unable to connect after purchasing Sony Alpha A6000.<br/><br/>I called Sony service, they kept me on the phone for an hour insinuating that I'm not able to connect to the camera because my NFC or Wi-Fi on the phone is disabled, but after multiple tests they made me do and when I demonstrated that I'm able to connect to the same phone with Sony Nex 5T, I was told that it is hardware problem that is quite common on this model.<br/><br/>I'll return this camera to Amazon.<br/><br/>Revised on 6/26/2014<br/>I've purchased another A6000 from different seller on Amazon - NFC on this one works just fine.<br/>My overall impression of this camera - I like it a lot. I'm enthusiast amateur photographer for 20 years, you can find 1D series full frame Canon cameras and L lenses in my closet, and I know how to use it. For many years I have not used any other camera but DSLR because there was huge quality difference between DSLR and regular compact camera, and I was used to the results DSLR and high end lenses were giving me. But those cameras are big and heavy, L lenses even more so, so as much as I love to use it when I go out with sole intention of taking pictures, those are not really handy to carry around for anything else. For example,  when I go with my family for weekend trips, to the beach, etc - places you go to have fun, but not necessarily for photo session.<br/>This is especially true when you have small kids to take care about, their stuff to carry, etc.<br/><br/>A6000 (and Nex 5 for the matter, I only upgraded to A6000 because of viewfinder) with kit lens (SEL1650 PZ) is giving me enough quality that I can be very happy with pictures taken with it. And it's so small I can carry it around all the time.<br/>Please mind that I'm talking here about casual family shots, landscapes, etc, not shallow DOF portraits taken with 85mm f1.8 lens or sports shots that require 70-200 f2.8 lens. I know A6000 limitations and never tired to use it for this kind of photography. Also, SEL1650 is not super sharp lens (which is normal, because it is small zoom lens and you can't beat the laws of physic), if you are pixel peeper you will see it right away, but this is not the point here.<br/><br/>What is important is the fact that A6000 with kit lens gives you picture quality of regular APS-C DSLR with kit lens, but is almost as small as regular compact camera.<br/><br/>As long as you understand this, you will be very happy with it. Plus, it gives you RAW format, so if you know Photoshop or Lightroom like I do, you can really do magic - APS-C sensor in A6000 is doing very good job, so you have enough pixels for cropping, sharpening, etc.<br/><br/>To sum it up:<br/><br/>- if you are upgrading to A6000 from regular compact camera, you will be amazed by picture quality and the very smart intelligent automatic picture taking mode<br/>- if you are buying A6000 in addition to DSLR, you will not be disappointed with the quality and you will be very happy with A6000 size.<br/><br/>Either way, it is win-win, I can really recommend this camera.<br/>4 star rating is based on the fact that there is not many cameras I rate at 5 - like Canon 1DX or 5D MKIII.</span>

<span>The only thing I dislike about it is the codecs are really hard to work with even on a decked out pc. You aren’t able to preview the files thumbnails like you can with the A7iii . Hope they add a function other than adding proxies directly to each video clip you make in camera .</span>

<span>There is a likely reason why they are heavily bragging about the A7siii, and that is all of the other things that come with this impressive camera. I imagine that the first thing most of us will notice is the ergonomics and build quality. Both of which are outstanding. Sony users will feel right at home and with some improvements to quickly adjust your ISO, Aperture, and shutter speed.<br/><br/>The menu system is improved and nicely customizable to put whatever you need to adjust the most, right onto the first page. Let’s not fool ourselves; none of the cameras out there have really figured out how to do menus that make us happy. The A7siii has not figured out the magic formula, but it is getting close. I am yet to find a complaint, but I am holding back praise.<br/><br/>Once you start shooting, only the most curmudgeon photographer could not express satisfaction at the industry-leading autofocus. Whether using human eye focus, traditional focuses, or the even further improved animal eye focus, the latest Sony technology is an impressive bit of technological magic. The lock on subject settings allows me to track the bride coming down the aisle as she passes the guest and others who jump into the frame. The A7siii sticks with her and does not jump to the new and closer object. Sure this is rather easy during staged shoots on manual, but for the unpredictable one take video situations… highly advantageous.<br/><br/>Some other standout advantageous aspects are in the memory cards, batteries, heat management, and 10 bit 4:2:2. Memory cards are getting expensive! Many new cameras only allow expensive memory options. You do need a certified v90 SD card ($100 or so for 128GB) for the 120fps at the highest settings, but 60fps with excellent 4k and 10-bit quality has been working flawlessly with a bargain-basement v60 SD card. That means for most applications, the A7siii is the best option for keeping storage cost manageable and reasonable.<br/><br/>Battery Life has been unremarkable, but this is an improvement because more technology and demand are being placed on the camera. Therefore the battery life is lasting as long as typical but getting more out of each drop and with no heat issues. Yes, no heat issues on the A7siii. Personally, most of my video shooting is highspeed and in the desert of Phoenix. August weddings are in brutal heat. The A7siii has no care or concern. One heat warning has been observed, but that was it, just a warning, and this is in the hottest of conditions faced but 99.99% of videographers.<br/><br/>The only area where the A7siii does not shine is in the same area all of these mirrorless cameras fall short (in comparison to DSLRs), photos. Maybe it is me, but DSLRs take better quality pictures. Though the DSLR pictures are much harder to obtain because of focus and shooting speeds when you nail a DSLR photo is better than a mirrorless. Still, the A7siii is nearly guaranteed to capture multiple in-focus action shots.<br/><br/>The A7siii will be my primary camera for the foreseeable future which is likely to be for many years into the future.</span>

<span>So been shooting with over 20 Sony cameras in my lifetime.  I do multicam shooting with up to 8 cameras at a time, and I shoot background plates for entertainment productions along with some doc work too.  I was very excited to start using the camera with all the new and improved features.<br/>So why did this camera suck for me, the image stabilization is mediocre at best, in a side by side test I did with this and the Panasonic S5, the S5 was clearly better.  The whole I frame thing meant having to buy little capacity storage cards for way more money instead of being able to use any of the dozens of SDXC cards I already own, again I'm using 8 cameras at a time so way more cost.  Looking at the imagery the Panny S5's 10 bit L-Gop frames even in high motion looked as good if not better to me than this camera.<br/>In comparing this to other Sony's I have used, I found this to be an somewhat better A7III.  If your using 8 bit 420, both cameras looked close.  The stabilization to me is poor in both.  The high ISO noise at the higher end to me also seemed similar.  It's like this camera has really high ISO, but when moving it becomes not as good as the S5 for seeing detail at faster motion in my side by side test, in what I see.<br/>One plus that I found over the S5, but for my needs is not as important since I pretty much shoot manual focus at infinity is the AF and viewfinder.  Very good VF and AF.  Best VF I have used in DSLR.  But since I use the LCD screen, the S5 is equal to me.<br/>So leaving Sony was a PITA for me, I sold all my glass and bodies, 16 camera bodies/glass.  The other cameras I used was the Sony AX53, again one of my top need is stabilization, and until now the AX53 with it's built in gimbal lens was pretty smooth, and for daylight infinity it's image is pretty good.  Way smoother then the A7III's I also owned.  But again the Panny S5 even beat this camera in stabilization.<br/>So unless autofocus and spending more money are your needs, to me the Panasonic S5 excels.  Why, stabilization, ability to shoot 10bit 4K on SDXC cards, cheaper with nice lens, standard remote jack for controlling multiple cameras, and happier with the imagery.</span>

<span>I bought the aS7 III this week mainly for the 4K 60fps capability, which is great. But the overall image quality improvement over my A7 III is unbelievable! I work in ambient light and even here in sunny Florida, house interiors can be dark in the middle of the day, even with lights on. I shot a test video in my own home at midday and the improvement in color, brightness and detail was amazing. Really no need to use noise reduction on darker clips, and no noise even at higher ISOs. But what blew me away most was I shot in 4K-60 but exported it in 1080p and didn't realize it. I thought I was looking at 4K. Just stunning results. Best photographic equipment buy EVER!</span>

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>I received this camera just over a week ago and have shot about 1000 pictures in various conditions with the kit lens and an RF f/4 24 to 105 mm L series lens I got with the Canon R camera I also own. I mostly shoot JPG and use RAW for those difficult pictures that in camera processing may not produce the best results. The R6 was purchased to replace the R.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>1. The camera is a delight to handle and is easy to like.<br/>2. Autofocus is superb with either lens. While taking pictures of our 4 month old standard poodle puppies, who would never keep still, I nailed focus around 85% of the time, compared to 65% for the Sony A7RIV and 50% for the Nikon Z7/Z6 using their equivalent lenses.<br/>3. I compared the JPG output to my Sony A7RIV which is a 60 MP camera and preferred the out of camera JPGs from the R6 in both color and sharpness. The 66% less pixels were not readily apparent on an x2 image on my 2020 27" iMac which was surprising.<br/>4. Quiet shutter with amazing shutter operational speed in electronic and mechanical mode.<br/>5. The supplied kit lens is remarkably good and the JPG output is indistinguishable from the f/4 constant aperture L series RF lens I have (in camera correction is a wonderful thing). It is slow at maximum focal length (105mm, f7.1) but this only affects low light conditions and the R6 has the dynamic range and low enough noise sensor to not mind using high ISOs. The only reason not to use this lens on a regular basis is its lack of weather sealing and variable aperture over the focal length range.<br/>6. Sensor stablisation is superb. I was taking shots at a 1 second shutter speed and getting a great hit rate.<br/><br/>The not so good:<br/>1. The camera feels cheap and plasticky when compared to the Sony A7RIV, Nikon Z7/Z6 and my beautiful Fujifilm X-T3. It is solid enough but does not give that carved from a solid billet of steel that the other 3 manage to do. It does not feel like a nearly $3K camera.<br/>2. The thumb joy stick is too far to the left and I often missed it until I got used to it.<br/>3. The multifunction wheel on the back cannot be used to move the focus point, it is rotational only. I miss the ability to press one side of the wheel to get to a function or move the focus starting point.<br/>4. The 20 MP resolution is fine if you do not crop in to get close ups. You soon run out of decent resolution, though not as soon as you would expect. I often use the ability to crop in on my higher resolution cameras in place of a good zoom.<br/>5. Lack of a decent constant aperture f/4 70 to 200 in the RF range of lenses. I use my old faithful f/2.8 EF 70 to 200 with an adapter, That is one heavy lens!! One equivalent to the RF f/2.8 70 to 200 lens would be wonderful and means I may always take this camera (I do not want to spend the money on the f/2.8 and I want something more compact).<br/>6. Kit lens is without a lens hood or case which, in a $2800 camera kit, seems a little cheap to me. The f/4-7.1 kit lens is not weather sealed.<br/>7. No camera charging cables etc. which are usually included with cameras in this price range.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>1. I love this camera and have an R5 on order which may address some of the build and resolution issues. I do not use these cameras for video on a regular basis (my iPhone 11 Pro Max is very good and can 'film' for more than 30 minutes without either stopping (EU laws) or over heating). I never hit the overheating problem.<br/>2. The kits lens is much better than it has any right to be at this price point.<br/>3. The camera will make good use of more expensive glass.<br/>4. Resolution is on the low side (for cropping in) but not a killer. Look at the output not the numbers and you will be amazed at just how good this sensor is.<br/>5. This is a great camera and beats the Sony A7III and Nikon Z6 in just about every metric that matters. It is also a competitor to the Sony A7RIV and Nikon Z7 despite its lower resolution.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Buy it. I marked it down 1 star because it is an expensive camera with some obvious cost cutting which takes the edge off the experience.</span>

<span>I wanted to share my experiences coming directly from a Canon EOS R to the Canon EOS R6.  First off, the R is a capable full-frame camera that takes fantastic shots.  The EOS R6 not only takes fantastic shots it does so more consistently than the EOS R did for me.  This is likely due largely to the improved Digic X processor in the R6 versus the Digic 8 in the R.<br/><br/>This camera just nails focus.  Focusing specifically on a person’s eye is remarkably impressive.  Just as an example of how absurdly accurate the eye autofocus is: When I first got the camera I was testing it in my bedroom.  I have a collage that has photo of me and my daughters in the center of it on one side of my bedroom as I sat against the opposite wall.  The picture of me and my daughters within the collage is likely only 4x3 inches large.  Zoomed to 105mm focal length and panning across the wall with that collage coming into frame, it automatically tracked focus on the eye of my daughter who was in the foreground.  This camera had caught focus on eye in a small picture within a collage across the room.  Racking focus between subjects or different objects is also really fast, too.<br/>Additionally impressive is the viewfinder.  The smoother refresh rate option is something that I appreciate immensely.  It just makes tracking the framing that much easier, especially with quick movements.  And I was slightly concerned about going from a 3.2 inch LCD screen on the R to the 3 inch LCD on the back of the R6, but after making the switch and even briefly comparing the two together this worry became a non-issue.<br/><br/>The body is a nice improvement.  The build quality seems relatively the same; however the button placement on the R6 seems largely more intuitive than on the R.  Don’t get me started on the Touch Bar on the EOS R.  I REALLY wanted to like it, trying time after time after time to make it useful in my workflow, but it just wasn’t useful and occasionally a hindrance because of accidental touches.  Having that replaced with the standard joystick and the different positions of the buttons is a welcome change.  Also, having the scroll wheel instead of the direction pad on the back is a lot more intuitive, especially for those who are accustom to that of the 5D mk IV and other cameras with the scroll wheel.<br/><br/>Having uncropped (nearly) 4K video on the R6 versus the 1.7x crop for 4K on the R is a welcome change, although this doesn’t affect me as much since I do mostly still photography.  However, when using the camera a little bit for video, this has been an appreciated difference.<br/><br/>Another appreciated difference is the faster shutter speed of the R6.  Being able to take 12 shots per second (with the mechanical shutter) AND while nailing focus saved me a lot of headache when I shot at an event in the evening last weekend.  I just couldn’t do that with the R prior.  Being able to do 20fps in electronic mode is a nice feature, however for my personal use, I am not sure this will be used all that much.<br/><br/>Speaking of the evening event, the low light capability of this camera is exceptional.  Truly.  At said night event, I was shooting at ISO 8000-12800 at certain times and the images just came out fantastic.  I had previously tried shooting with the R in a low light situation at ISO 6000 and it just didn’t do nearly as well.  Images sometimes came out blurry or excessively grainy OR blurry AND excessively grainy to the point of nearly being unusable images.  That was not something that I worried about with the R6.  I set ISO, set aperture, set shutter speed and shot.  Nailed focus, and just only had to pay attention to getting the composition right.<br/><br/>Also, having IBIS (in body image stabilization) is really wonderful and just adds extra security knowing I will get sharp images taken.  It also opens up the ability to have non-stabilized lenses without worry of out-of-focus images taken.  Using this body with the new "Nifty 50" (RF 50mm f1.8 STM) which doesn't have IS has helped retain sharp images much more.<br/><br/>So it likely sounds like I am gushing over this camera.  If it does, it is because I am.  The R6 is an amazing camera.  The price premium over the R is well worth it.  I was originally concerned about going from 30MP to 20MP, but after using it for a little while, that worry has quickly dissipated.</span>

<span>Overall, this camera is fantastic. Sony auto-focus is second to none. The customization of buttons and overall ergonomics are wonderful. My two main gripes are:  the surprising over-heating shooting standard 4K video (even with max temp set to High); and the screen size definitely needs improvement.<br/>I can film all day in the sun on the A7S iii with no overheating warnings. I do get that the image on the A7IV is being down-sampled from 7K and the sensor is 33 megapixels compared to 12, but I’m just still surprised that it overheats so easily…again.<br/>You could argue the fact it’s a hybrid camera justifies the performance to not be as stout in video. But to me, hybrid shouldn’t mean unreliable.<br/><br/>I’m debating if I’m returning it or just solely rely on the A7S iii for video. But then that begs the question of whether the A7IV is worth $2500 just for photo. I’m leaning toward “no”. The A7Siii photos are also fantastic, and for now, I’m mostly using them for real estate work and some product promotions.</span>

<span>The Sony A7iv is suberb camera. I have done night photography, portraits, and harsh sunlight photography. Even when I have an under exposed shot i am able to bring back the details in the shadows. The size of the grip is perfect. Also when using iso below 100 it still produces a crisp image.</span>

<span>The overheating while recording in 4k 60 is pretty obnoxious. But for it's hybrid abilities it's pretty incredible. The new menu is worth the jump from the A7iii if you're deciding over the A7iii and A7iv.</span>

<span>The ergonomics compared to the Sony a7iii is a huge upgrade. The grip has more depth and feels so much nicer and with the vertical grip attached, it feels like my old Nikon dslr’s. The autofocus and tracking is awesome as well but so far the battery is a little worse than the a7iii. The images and low light performance are better than the a7iii but not by huge amounts but when posting images to social media I have noticed more detail compared to the a7iii so maybe those extra megapixels does make a difference for that. I haven’t compared the difference with print images but I’m sure the a7IV will look better.</span>
