Perfect for travelers, the Panasonic Lumix Digital Camera DC FZ80K brings the legendary optical performance of a super long 60X (20 1200mm) DC Vario lens with amazingly stable O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) to a highly portable point and shoot travel camera. With a powerful 18.1 megapixel MOS sensor, the Lumix DC VARIO camera lens features a super bright F2.8 5.9 aperture range that is optically stabilized with Panasonic’s Power O.I.S. technology to add striking depth of field dimension to your photographs even in low light conditions. The high resolution power of 4K video technology captures up to 4X the resolution (3840 x 2160) of standard Full HD, enabling you to create printable photos with 4K photo's blistering 30 frames per second burst feature. Post Focus and Focus Stacking provide for additional creative freedom by allowing you to change depth of field or focus points after you take the picture. The Lumix FZ80 perfectly fits in your hand with an ergonomic grip while its rear touch enabled 3 inch LCD display and high resolution 1,170K dot viewfinder remain clear even in bright sunlight. Convenient travel ready technologies like USB charging and Wi Fi connectivity to your mobile device make the Lumix DC FZ80K a digital camera that everyone can enjoy.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>For the price a great camera!  I like to take pictures of the kids playing sports and whether zoomed in or not I’m not disappointed.  Keep in mind this is not a $2000 camera and you won’t be disappointed.  Love the video option. You can then go back frame by frame and select the best picture from the video.  Wireless transfer to my iPhone easy for someone like me who is not tech savvy.  Still learning about everything it can do but only takes about 5 minutes of reading to get the basic stuff working.  Helpful cheat sheet quick start card included.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Since my iPhone can take better pictures than most professional cameras, I wanted one that would give me the Zoom that I cannot get with the iPhone<br/><br/>This camera is great for macro, wildlife, and other although you will need to learn its features and tricks to get the best out of it<br/><br/>The sensor is small although you get a nice smaller size than a professional one in exchange with a very nice price for the Zoom optics<br/><br/>This camera is a great compromise that offers good price, great zoom, OK quality and battery<br/><br/>If you want a professional camera with all bells and whistles and great flexibility, there are better options are a higher price</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

<span>I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's obviously solid and precise build quality. Every bit as nice as the Sony RX100 cameras. The viewfinder is very usable. I had heard it was almost too small to use but I felt comfortable using it all the time and I wear spectacles.<br/><br/>The lens is not as sharp as I expected. I understand that in putting such a huge zoom lens in this camera that there would be some compromises. Unfortunately, a loss of sharpness is not one that I can abide. If you don't intend to enlarge your photos you should be fine. However if you crop your photos there just isn't much sharpness to work with. I'm sure things would be much sharper with a tripod support, however, for a walk around travel camera who really wants to burden themselves with extra gear? I know this makes me a lazy photographer. However, I have lugged full-frame cameras with huge telephotos and a bag of lenses and flashes all over the place and back and let me tell you, a small camera like this with all its features is a joy. Still, I want a sharp lens.<br/><br/>The lens is too slow for me. While perfectly adequate for static subjects like landscapes or achitecture, you will tear out your hair trying to stop even the most gentle motion. Either you crank up the ISO and suffer increased noise or you can slow the shutter and tempt camera shake.<br/><br/>The viewfinder is very low contrast and seems hazy. Physically, it is clean. However, it just looks hazy and washed out. It is certainly usable, but the poor image quality is annoying. If you have ever used an old-style rangefinder camera with a fingerprint smeared up front glass, it looks just like that.<br/><br/>The battery life is good, a bit better than I expected. Also the camera gives several options for working with reduced power so your mileage might go up by 20% or so from usual. Also, you can charge the battery in the camera. Very nice for travel as you can use the same charger for phone (in most cases) as the camera and have less gear to pack.<br/><br/>The menus are very complete and not too disorganized.<br/><br/>The 4K modes are astonishingly useful and the focus stacking can help you get a usable photo in a difficult situation. This camera lets you exercise your creativity with so many modes and options. Or, if you want simple, just put it in iA mode and let the camera do the work.<br/><br/>The camera is made in China. (Just like the RX100VI)<br/><br/>The wireless features work as expected with my Android phone. Bluetooth location tagging is top notch for travel. On the down side, there is NO airplane mode. You have to wade through the menus and turn all the radios off if you need to go dark.<br/><br/>No "Delete First" option when viewing photos. You always have to press a button to confirm you want to delete. The extra step annoys me especially because I am so used to having this available with Nikon and Sony cameras.<br/><br/>The touch screen is what everybody seems to clamor for these days. I'll say it works as it is supposed to. Unfortunately I grew so tired of touching the screen inadvertently and having annoying things pop up that required attention that I just turned the darn thing off.<br/><br/>Be prepared to read the manual. Even if you consider yourself a photography whiz this camera can baffle you right out of the gate. For example, if the monitor does not work you may have inadvertently pushed the LVF button. Press it a few times to cycle through the options and bring things back to life. Also, what does LVF mean anyway? I finally figured out it means "Live View Finder". It's buried in the big manual online. Just like other things such as "Starlight Mode" and others. The camera has vast capabilites but they are not all laid out in a linear easy to grasp fashion. You have to practically stumble onto each one and then grope for understanding in the manual. Various bizarre icons drove me nuts trying to look them up when they pop up. Stay strong, persevere and you will catch on to it all. (Or, just go to iA mode and wrack your brain some other day.)<br/><br/>I don't like where the movie button is. I keep pressing it to turn on the camera. Perhaps I should say instead that I hate how long it takes me to break old habits but still, that's where the power button should be in my opinion. Generally speaking, all the buttons should be larger and a little bit easier to press. After an all day session with the camera my button pushing finger was pretty sore. On the contrary, the large lens ring is way too easy to turn. This makes it pretty much useless as it takes nothing to bump it and change a setting.<br/><br/>I've made some negative comments but I do find this an acceptable camera for the right user, namely, casual photographers who will not be overly critical of the picture quality and who want the many travel-oriented features.</span>

<span>I was a Nikon shooter and have owned several DSLR bodies and lenses. But ever since the iPhones came out, I just wasn't using all of my "good" photography equipment as often as I should. The iPhone cameras had become "good-enough" for what I photograph (school events, concerts, vacations, family, etc...). Currently, I carry an iPhone 6 and feel that its picture quality has exceeded most 2/3" sensor point-and-shoot cameras. Still -  I often miss the detail of the DSLR sensor, clarity of true optical zoom, and the DSLR's superior low-light capability.<br/><br/>That's where this Panasonic fits in. I've been looking for a pocketable travel camera that can bridge the gap between an iPhone 6 and my Nikon DSLRs.  My requirements were as follows: small camera body, attached lens (so it can be used at concerts), 1" sensor, and a generous zoom range.<br/><br/>What's so important about the sensor size?  A camera with a larger 1" sensor is able to capture more photo detail with less noise than the usual 2/3" size.  This is most noticeable when taking photos in low light.  The Sony RX 100 III and Canon G7x are the benchmarks for the 1" sensor cameras, but I needed a longer zoom in order to shoot concerts, and sports.  As far as I can tell, the Panasonic is unique in this price range for the combination of the 1" sensor and longer-than-the-competition zoom.<br/><br/>Likes:<br/>* Solid Feel<br/>* standard micro-USB cable<br/>* Larger 1" sensor (larger than the majority of point-and-shoot models)<br/>* Longest zoom in this price range amongst its peers<br/>* RAW+JPG option<br/>* 4K Video<br/>* Touchscreen<br/>* Electronic Viewfinder<br/>* physical lens-ring control<br/>* thumb-wheel control<br/>* Smartphone integration (I can only test the iPhone app) - Live real-time camera controls, transfer photos and videos, GPS tagging<br/>* Fast menus<br/>* Fast focus<br/>* Custom White Balance<br/>* Full manual controls<br/>* Customizable Dials<br/>* Create features such as Post Focus and 4K Photo<br/><br/>Dislikes:  (these are really first-world problems)<br/>* no flash hot shoe (but its competitors may not have one either)<br/>* no external microphone option (but its competitors may not have one either)<br/>* It barely fits in my front-jeans pocket.  I have to be careful not to scratch it with the metal rivet on the jeans<br/><br/>Panasonic has this very interesting feature called Post Focus. The camera will rapid fire a series of shots using different focal points and let the user choose what to focus on AFTER the picture has been taken. Another unique feature is 4K Photo, the camera will basically take 4K video and let you extract high-quality 4K stills from the stream. I can see this being extremely useful with fast moving kids and pets.<br/><br/>I plan to add more to this review in the future...but for now, I've attached some photos samples.  I've also included a size comparison between the iPhone 6 and Panasonic.  As well as low-light comparison shots between the iPhone 6 and Panasonic in a poorly lit room. All shots including the low-light shots were hand-held without a tripod.<br/><br/>So far, every camera feature appears to work as advertised. There were comments on another website about wifi problems, I had none.  The wireless bridge between the camera and iPhone worked every time.  Note: I do have a dual-band router and although the 2.4Ghz channel was found, the 5Ghz was not. That may be why it didn't matter in my place.</span>

<span>The two uploaded photos are of the same section of landscape, one zoomed out (24mm) and the other fully zoomed in (360mm).<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Got this to avoid carrying my dlsr and lenses on hikes, and to do time lapse of sunrises and sunsets.<br/><br/>Step 1: Throw away the (junk/out of date) user guide in the box right after you open it once to scan the qr code to download the excellent user manual.<br/><br/>Step2:  Install (under the same cover as the battery) a 128gb or less SD card<br/><br/>Step 3: Charge the battery (charging port under the same small cover as the hdmi port)<br/><br/>Step 4: Set the wheel to iA+ (fully automatic shutter speed/exposure f stop) and if desired set the drive mode to burst with burst speed set to slow (2 shots per second if/while you hold down the shuttter release).<br/><br/>Step 5: Turn it on, point and shoot.<br/><br/>What actually prompted me to make this purchase is that I went on a great hike with views where I took a good number of pictures with my (decent) Samsung A71 5G UW smartphone Camera, but afterward found that the pictures didn't have anywhere close to sufficient resolution to want to print - or even share, *especially the zoomed in ones* - which was painfully dissapointing.<br/><br/>In comparison, the ZS200 displays markedly superior picture quality - staggeringly better when zoomed.<br/><br/>(Among other things, a good lesson/reminder on the merits of optical vs. digital zoom).<br/><br/>So far (10 days/1050 pictures later) I am overall quite pleased with this camera. The size, weight, picture quality and particularly the zoomed picture quality make the purchase price more than worth it for me. I remove the top portion of the camera case (not included, see below) when I go hiking, throw the cover strap over my shoulder and I'm finding it fairly quick to grab, turn on and shoot without having to remove the shoulder strap. After some practice, I find I am also able to do that one handed which is a plus, as I often have both my trekking poles in my other hand.<br/><br/>All that is to say I think I'll have a fair chance to get some opportunistic/fleeting shots of wildlife using this setup if and when they present themselves.<br/><br/>The camera does have a multitude of features and settings that I really haven't played with in the week or so since I got it, but it is quite a sophisticated piece of compact engineering.<br/>It's fairly deep into "real camera" territory for those who want to manage their own depth of field/shutter speed etc, so don't mistake it for the severely limited point and shoots of yesteryear.<br/><br/>One note about time lapse that I couldn't find in the user manual:<br/><br/>If you use a shot interval &gt; 30 seconds for time lapse photography, the camera will retract the lens barrel every shot, darken the display, then extend the lens barrel and turn on the display for the next shot.<br/>I had to try different shot intervals to determine where the barrel stays put for the duration (&lt;= 30 seconds) but when I originally set it to 150 shots at 1 minute intervals I observed the barrel extending and retracting each shot (150 times per time lapse series).<br/>I for one don't want to put that much wear and tear on the lens barrel stepper motor and parts, so I'll only use 30 seconds or less for a time lapse interval, but it seemed like something Panasonic should have spelled out in their manual (searched and couldn't find anything about that operation).<br/>Of note is I did have the lens set partially zoomed (~110mm) when I observed this, but I really don't believe that was a factor.<br/><br/>Also bought and reccommend<br/><br/>Mini Tripod for Camera,Zomei Travel Table Tripod with 3-Way Pan/Tilt Head 1/4 inches Quick Release Plate and Bag for DSLR Camera<br/>(THIS TRIPOD IS ONLY 20.5" FULLY EXTENDED)<br/><br/>SanDisk 128GB Extreme PRO SDXC UHS-I Card - C10, U3, V30, 4K UHD, SD Card<br/><br/>MegaGear Ever Ready Genuine Leather Camera Case Compatible with Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100, DC-ZS200<br/>(IF YOU LIKE LEATHER, RETRO STYLE COVERS)<br/><br/>For me, the only downside (more aptly the cheap side) I will mention that the battery cover latch and the charging/hdmi port cover feel a bit flimsy to me, but I couldn't possibly justify dropping my review score by a star due to to those two largely aesthetic details.</span>

<span>I never write reviews, but I feel compelled to throw my opinion in the ring. I was looking for a slim, simple cover for my a6000 when I'm carrying it in a courier bag. Something as small as possible, just to protect it a bit from scratches and dust and minor bumps. Normally it lives in a real camera bag when I'm out shooting and bringing other lenses, etc. Previously I tossed it into an old goggle pouch but it wasn't nearly protective enough, and the rubber eyepiece got caught on the material.<br/><br/>Many reviews made this MegaGear neoprene case seem like it was going to be disappointment: too small, too annoying, poorly made, not enough protection. So much so that initially I went with another option (which I hated and returned, but that's another story). I have to say for me, this case is nearly perfect.<br/><br/>Is it snug? Yup. When I first pulled it out of the box I thought "Oh, I see what they mean." But it actually stretches easier and further than expected. The velcro matches up well and holds more securely than expected.<br/><br/>Is it a little tough to get on and off? More so on than off. Off is actually pretty quick. So far, getting it on is a bit of work. I assume I'll get better at it but for now it's a brief wrestling match. If you hope this will be your camera bag while you wander around somewhere, occasionally taking pictures every few minutes, this is not for you. You will be annoyed if you expect to be constantly removing and recovering your camera. But for me, it's perfect for protecting my camera when I toss it into a larger bag. It adds nearly zero additional bulk to the camera. It goes on when I'm not using it, and if I go out shooting, it stays in the courier bag, or home, until I'm done shooting.<br/><br/>Is it poorly made? A little early to tell, but it seems good so far. As previously mentioned, the fit is better than expected, and the velcro seems more solid and effective than I had feared. I agree the carabiner loop should not be relied on, but that is mostly because by using it you are asking the neoprene material to be the weight bearing element, and it's not designed to do that job. It will rip. But even so, the loop is stronger that I thought it would be. But I still wouldn't hang the camera from it. I will probably remove the carabiner entirely.<br/><br/>Is it thin on protection? Not for me. It's perfect for what I want: a small amount of bump and bruise protection with minimal bulk. If I drop the camera in this from 4 feet will it protect it? Probably not. That's asking a lot from neoprene. Will it protect it when I plunk my courier bag down on a table? Absolutely. And that is what I was looking for.<br/><br/>In short, if there was 4.5 stars, I would give it that. The only knock I have against it is that if they modified the shape a tiny bit, it would better cover the eyepiece and movie record button.</span>

<span>Based on reviews that these cases fit snugly, I bought this case for my Olympus E-PL7 micro-four-thirds camera. With the 14-45mm EZ lens, this case is absolutely perfect! I even have space inside for a spare battery.<br/><br/>I used it for a trip to Universal Studios, leaving the cover tucked into my bag most of the time. A couple rides don't have free lockers, and for those, I slipped on this cover for some minimal impact protection (Flight of the Hippogryff, Jurassic). Had there been any dew at night, this would have been just the right amount of protection.<br/><br/> I absolutely love the light weight, the "wad-ability", and the bump protection. Note that this cover will not protect a camera in an actual fall, but it's great for bumping into door frames and shop display racks, or wedging yourself into close-together tables.<br/><br/>One feature I plan to add is a tether so it can dangle from the camera while the camera is in use. You can't actually use the camera with the cover attached, and it doesn't have any extra loops or Velcro.<br/><br/>Colors are great too - less likely to leave your camera on the table after a meal!</span>

<span>Sony A6000 guy here looking to ditch my camera bag and just toss the camera into a backpack without it getting scratched up.  For $15 I'm very impressed with this case.  It fits very well and the red color is nice, it will really help it stand out so I can find it easily in my bag.  The construction is excellent, and I was surprised to see that it opens up all the way so you can just put the camera right in -- there isn't a flap you have to try and squeeze the camera around to get it in the case (like some other neoprene cases I saw on here).  The A6000 with the SEL20F28 pancake lens fits perfectly, but when the camera has the larger SEL35F18 lens on it the fit is REALLY tight.  You can get the camera in, but it stays closed at only at the mercy of the velcro closure tab.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and will definitely enjoy using this knowing my camera will be safer to carry.</span>

<span>HIKING: I'm on a quest to find a lightweight case or bag that I can use for my Sony A6000 while hiking. I'd like to be able to take the camera in out of the case quickly. The lens will typically be on the camera at all times.<br/><br/>The lens right now is the Sony SEL-20F28 E-Mount 20mm F2.8 Prime Lens, with lens hood on. This is a pancake lens, but even so, the lens eats up a fair amount of space. The hood adds a bit more. To get an idea of the size of this setup: the lens with the hood on sticks out about as far from the handhold on the right side of the camera as the handhold does from the main body. Another way to understand the size is to go to camerasize.com, click "GET STARTED", then click on the tiny "cameras with lenses" link. After selecting the A6000, click on the rightmost view to allow selecting a lens, and select the lens you're interested in. That will show the lens without the hood, I believe, so with the hood things will be bigger. I have no affiliation with camerasizes.com.<br/><br/>This camera case isn't what I'm looking for.<br/><br/>What I like: the caseis is lightweight, and opens and closes with a convenient and snug velcro connection. It has a small carabiner that could probably be attached to the hip belt of a backpack. I sort of like the color, too.<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/><br/>Because the camera is so snug in the case, it takes quite a bit of fiddling to get the camera in and out of the case. This pretty much makes the case unusable for me, because when I'm hiking, I want something quick so I can get shots quickly without excessively slowing down a group of hikers, or myself. It takes too long to get the camera in and out of the case, for that. It's hard enough to get the camera in and out of the case that I'm not sure why anyone would tolerate it, but maybe some people are fine with this amount of fiddling around, or can do it faster than I can. Maybe the case I got is slightly smaller than most. I don't know.<br/><br/>The fit is so snug that the camera sometimes goes from off to on when I put it in the case. This also happens when I'm carrying the camera around in my pants pocket without any case at all, so some of this might be attributable to the camera, or the user.<br/><br/>There is a gap when closing the case, where a small part of the camera is exposed to the elements. I wouldn't expect this case to protect completely against water or dirt, but I'd at least like the case to completely cover the camera. I also wonder how much the case protects the camera where it does cover the camera (which is probably 95-99% of the camera). The case is pretty thin. People will have different ideas about how thick a case should be; I'd like to see it maybe 1.5 times thicker than it is. With my order, I received the neoprene case, as well as a cloth pouch with a drawstring that's currently not shown in the Amazon detail page. It's almost as though the setup is designed so that one puts the camera in the case and then puts the case and camera in the pouch, Russian doll style. Ugh. A question to be asked is: if the case alone is not enough to protect the camera, and one needs the pouch, then why sell the case? Maybe this should be thought of as a case plus pouch system, not a case. I suppose the pouch adds some flexibility in trading how much protection one gets vs. how much weight and bulk is involved, but what I want is a single lightweight case that protects the camera somewhat and can be opened and closed quickly.<br/><br/>This isn't what I was looking for. 3 stars for being basically as advertised - some of what I didn't like is more about the way I want to use the case than the case itself.</span>

<span>I've had a SeaLife DC series for years.  It's been a great device, but I thought it was time to upgrade. So, I bought this package.  I haven't gotten it in the water yet, but I've got a few issues with SeaLife on this model already:<br/><br/>1.  They don't include a lens cap. It's a big miss.  This is entry-level product management. If you scratch your lens, you basically ruin a $1300 setup because the OEM didn't want to include a $3 lens cap. Oh, I asked, and they will sell you one separately. [Update: I contacted the seller (not SeaLife, but a store) and they sent me a lens cap that fits, which is pictured nearby. I had to rig up a way to attach it to the camera<br/> with 550 cord].<br/><br/>2. There's no native way to dummy cord your camera or the light carriage to your gear. No hooks, loops, nothing. Again, entry-level product management miss. I've fashioned one of my own out of 550 cord and a combination of bowline and (half) figure 8 knot (pictured).<br/><br/>3. The arms for the lights don't move. You have to buy an additional (and separate) flexi arm for ~$60. I bought one and offset the camera to one side. Why is this important? Because you need the lights behind or to the side to avoid backscatter. This is a packaging miss on SeaLife's part.<br/><br/>4. There's no digital Zoom on this model.  Maybe that's a function of the "mini" but the camera isn't all that much smaller than my 10-year old DCS model.<br/><br/>5.  The camera itself is waterproof. This has benefits and drawbacks.  One big one is you can't add a removable memory card, or swap a card out on a trip.<br/><br/>6. The directions for the lighting have gold connections. The directions say you must wipe these with alcohol EVERY SINGLE TIME you charge the batteries.  a) it's hard to reach without something like a q-tip and b) this is a huge pain on a trip. I don't mind maintaining my gear, but this is *high* maintenance.<br/><br/>Generally, I don't think SeaLife has met up to the standards of their own reputation. I'm absolutely fuming about the lens cap thing.<br/><br/>Update: I have tested the camera in the water over 8 dives recently and am pleased with the photos.<br/><br/>- It's simple to use in the water - good for a non-pro-photographer.<br/>- I like the extra settings on the white balance which gives you some flexibility to experiment with.<br/>- I set my white balance to the "quick button" which is a nice feature underwater.<br/>- On their website, SeaLife has a pro photographer (Brent Durand) do a ~20 minute summary on how to use the camera which I thought was very helpfu.  You can also find that video on his YouTube channel. Basically, you watch that video and you know everything you need to use the camera.<br/><br/> There's a photo above with a remora attached to a parrot fish that I took with this camera (the other two were taken with a phone).</span>

They are awesome and they were very well maintained but they did not last.  I have installed new batteries to see if that would help the issues.  One light was giving me issues on my last dive trip. I got home cleaned all the contacts installed new batteries and they seemed to be working.  Went in my 1st dive this trip and half way through the dive the light stopped working.  Figured i would dive rest of the trip with one light.  Diving my 3rd day and now neither light works. Can someone from customer service please reach out and let me know if there is anything that can be done?  Otherwise these are great lights and they would get 5 stars.</span>

</ul>

The Benro Slim series has been expanded and now includes two new models that are the perfect travel tripod. Each has 5 sections and the reverse folding design reduces the folded size to only 12.9" (33cm). but don’t let its small size fool you, these tripods open to an impressive 57.1" (145cm) making them a practical solution for photographers who need to travel light but still need to travel with a tripod. There are two models of the Slim travel offering either aluminum or Carbon Fiber construction. Aluminum gives strength but Carbon Fiber remains the ultimate material for lightness and stability. The Slim travel tripod legs are fitted with anodized aluminum twist locks that only require a quick half turn to lock and unlock. A grooved center column prevents twisting when in use and can be reversed for low to the ground shots. Benro Slim travel features a lightweight shoulder, which has 3 leg positions and each leg can be positioned individually for uneven terrain. A weight hook is located underneath the center column for windy conditions and the rubber feet on the tripod are fixed. Staying level is made easy with a bubble level on the quick release clamp. Both versions of the Slim travel series use the compact N00 head. This removable aluminum ball head has an oversized ratchet style single locking control knob for easy operation and a panoramic scale. The ball head includes a blue anodized aluminum Arca-Swiss style quick release plate with a d-ring 1/4"-20 thread. A compact carry case is included.

<span>My first tripod with twist locks but is far from a deficiency for me ... they work well, I trust it with my camera, and I'll get use to them just fine. Nice weight hook, nice functioning ball head, and I like the color scheme. The balance ball is easily seen and used with the mount slightly forward with the camera I use. Even if I couldn't see the bubble at all it wouldn't affect the photos I seek. This perfectly fits into my underseat carryon luggage that also carries my other photo gear with room to spare. It also fits well in any of my backpacks or the saddlebags &amp; trunk of my touring bike. This tripod is more stout and sturdy than more expensive travel tripods that I've used and is a welcome addition to my light mirrorless camera gear.

<span>I guess you get what you pay for.<br/>Pro:This is a light compact travel tripod and will work in many situations just fine.<br/><br/>Feels sturdy. I like the bag clasp.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The biggest concern for me was the drifting of the ball head. I would think I had my shot lined up let go and it would drift. If you have a lighter camera with a short/pancake lens this may not be an issue.  You could buy a separate ball head but the added expense might make you consider an alternative tripod especially considering.<br/><br/>The height. This just was not as tall as I needed.<br/><br/>The screw legs took much longer to adjust than I expected.<br/><br/>The leg locks are… quirky. Wasn’t sure I ever got a good lock.<br/><br/>I’ll keep it but I’ll be looking for an alternative.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> 📸 📸 📸 [Built for Travel] The SLIK Sprint Series tripods are compact and lightweight, delivering rock solid performance in a travel ready package.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 📸 📸 📸 [Multi-Function Center Column] The center column can be removed and reversed to position the the head between the legs instead of on top. This offers ground-level and top-down perspectives not possible in the traditional set-up. It can also be separated into 2 pieces so the tripod can achieve minimum height. Simply unscrew the two sections from one another in this tool-less design. An integrated, retractable hook sits at the bottom of the center column to hang your camera bag for increased stability on uneven terrain or windy conditions.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 📸 📸 📸 [Fast Operation] The patented “Rapid Flip Mechanism” allows for single handed operation of the leg angle adjustments. Easily set the legs to 1 of 3 locking position with a simple “Flip” to increase stability on uneven surfaces or lower the height of the tripod for creative low-angle perspectives. Each leg section can be extended and retracted using easy to operate flip locks for swift setup and takedown.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 📸 📸 📸 [Core Specs] Maximum Height 42.4” | Folded Length 13.2” | Load Capacity 4.4 lbs | Weight 1.9 lbs |  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 📸 📸 📸 [Additional Features] The CF Series tripods include twist locks that make operation, setup and takedown easy, rubber feet for extra grip, and an Anti-Rotational system that prevents leg sections from turning inside of each other.  </span></li>

The New Sprint Mini III tripod is super compact with a folded length of only 13. 2 inches, which will fit in a lot of camera bags. When you need a solid tripod that functions like a full-size travel tripod but takes up a lot less space in your bag, the Sprint Mini III is the one. The new Rapid Flip Mechanism (RFM) provides an easy and simple way to adjust the leg angles to go from as low as 6 inches off the ground to as tall as 42. 4 inches with the column extended (measured at the top of the ball head). The Mini III BK model weighs 30. 4 ounces but can support 4. 4 lbs. of camera equipment. To put that in perspective; a Sony a7rIII full frame camera with 16-35mm f2. 8 lens attached weighs 3 lbs. The head is small but mighty and can support all that weight at any angle without drift or slacking. Each leg is made up of 4 sections and the height is adjusted using the simple to use flip-lock design for solid slip-free operation. All 3 legs are outfitted with streamlined rubber grips for easy handling. The center column can be separated for low-angle work and inverted so that you can shoot straight down over your subject. Great for macro work. The Sprint Mini III BK sports a matte black finish, includes an all-metal SBH-100DQ ball head with quick release plate, and a convenient single lever operation for releasing the camera for quick repositioning and lockdown. The Sprint Mini III tripod series is ready to go anywhere and look good doing it.

<span>I bought this to replace a slik 300dx I got in 14 years ago (the leg latches are cracking but still work I bet that’s why they discontinued it).  I liked that one because it wouldn’t jam in sand. That 300dx tripod got used a lot for travel so it doesn’t owe me anything and wanted to same brand based on how much I liked the old one (I will keep the head which is perfectly good still).  This new one feels silly light and folds very small.  It extends to a good height fairly sturdy tripod without too much trouble.  I Was a little worried because with a dx size slr it’s pushing the weight limit but even with a moderate length zoom lens it’s totally fine.  For long exposures with a bigger lens I need to delay 2 seconds to let it settle or use a release cable.  I was 150% of the tripods weight limit doing this so I’ll take that compromise for the portability.  I would bet windy and long exposures with long lenses will be a no go on this tripod, and I would hesitate to put a full size slr on it or a really long telephoto on it.  My lenses do have image stabilization which is the reason a 300mm lens can take a perfect 20 second exposure on this tripod I am sure.  But for my traveling needs with the equipment I have this thing is a really nice blend of size, weight and usability.  I really can’t think of anything I would change for the intended use.</span>

<span>This is a great tripod for plein air painters. It's lightweight, compact, sturdy for holding a pochade box and its legs can be outstretched for different topography. I wish I'd known about it sooner. I have half a dozen tripods, this one is the best for painting.</span>

<span>This thing is super nice for the money. I got to compare a few rando colorful affordable brand tripods and was impressed with those, but this seems even nicer in all this little places where it counts. The fastners, the plastic molding, the fit and feel of it is very nice. If I have to get more tripod stuff ill likely go with this brand! Will report back if it fails prematurely, so far so good.</span>

<span>After a lot of research, I chose this as my travel tripod for general travel, but also for backcountry landscape photography. It may not be as light as the carbon fiber options out there, but it also costs a lot less than those. It packs up small enough for me to secure it to a daypack. I like the lever locks on the leg segments rather than twist locks. From my initial use, it seems quite sturdy and the ball head locks up tightly. It supports my full-frame DSLR easily. I haven’t used the stability hook since conditions have not yet required it.<br/><br/>The one thing I dislike is that I couldn’t get Manfrotto’s Arca Swiss compatible mount at the time of purchase. I had to get it as a separate purchase. So, now I have a Manfrotto quick-release mount that I will never use because my PeakDesign capture clips are not compatible with it. I would have preferred saving $50 by having the option for the Arca Swiss mount when I bought the tripod.<br/><br/>My report on durability will obviously have to wait until I’ve used it a bit more.</span>

<span>Great compact travel tripod (with bonus monopod function)!  I already own a heavy duty tripod for my big telephoto lenses, but I found I would avoid using it for things like macro or landscape photography because it weighs so much and is awkward to attach to my backpacks because of its length.  This tripod is so light weight and compact, it fits great on my backpack and I barely notice its there.<br/><br/>While it technically has a weight capacity rating that can hold my big telephoto lens, I dont recommend it for those.  Since the legs are thinner, it gets pretty top heavy and wobbly with that much weight on it, but it handles my smaller lenses no problem (which is what I got it for anyway).<br/><br/>The included ball head is nice and sturdy and allows for quick readjustment.  It has a adjustable friction setting you can change depending on your camera's/len's weight.<br/><br/>This ball head is designed with cutouts for the tripod's legs as the tripod collapses by folding the legs up/inverted with the head in between them to save space.  Just be aware if you swap the ball head for a different one, the legs might not close as compact as before depending on the shape.  You could still collapse the legs downward in that situation if needed, but that will add a few inches to the height of the collapsed tripod as the head would not be inside the legs anymore. Probably not a problem for most people considering this tripod's small footprint, but wanted to point that out just in case.<br/><br/>Overall, great compact  tripod if you need a travel friendly one.</span>

<span>This is a solid little tripod. It has a has a monopod which is also great. I have this paired with an A7iii with the heaviest lens being a Tamron 70-180. Camera is on there sturdy with no movement. I also switched out the plate with a Peak Design dual plate since I use their products. Works very well with the ball head provided with this tripod.</span>
