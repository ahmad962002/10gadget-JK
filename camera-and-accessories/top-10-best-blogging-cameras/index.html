<span>If you’ve watched every review on YouTube and you’re still trying to decide, just do it. It’s a great camera.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love this camera for what it is,  they say its made for content creators,  the main reason i got it was it has Clean HDMI out so it works as a webcam,  it can recorded as long as you need it to without shutting off like most camera and a few other things that make it a great webcam,  some people say the camera does not zoom out wide enough.  when i use it its about a arms length away and i have no problem with the field of view as long as you get the image stabilization settings right..  use the heavier image stabilization and it crops in and you don't get that nice wide field of view so so use the middle setting for image stabilization and you dont loose that nice wide angel..<br/><br/>its surprisingly good in lower light situations and even at high iso you do not get much grain in the video,  the image quality is not quite as good as something like the Sony A6400 with a 16mm sigma lens but its just a small step down if you ask me.  get the camera settings right and change the picture profile settings to your liking and this thing looks great,  i have been using it for a few weeks now and its perfect for me, ,<br/><br/>i have a video on YouTube on how to set this up as a webcam for YouTube or twitch or what ever you may use a webcam for, if you want to find that just search for "Danny Lightning Sony ZV-1 Webcam Setup"  search for that on youtube and the video probably pops up,  I go through all the in camera settings for webcam use.  just get your self a nice capture card and the proper usb cable and change a few setting and you got a amazing looking webcame<br/><br/>ZV-1 vs regular webcam ( even the 250 dollar webcams) .  this thing blows regular webcams out of the water,  this is so much better its not even funny</span>

<span>Sony came so close to making a great camera for vloggers and people on the move.  It combines a 1" sensor, Zeiss lens, and a truly fantastic focus system.  Unfortunately, without some sort of active gimbal, it is nearly impossible to hold steady enough to get acceptable footage. I originally tried the handheld stick which came with the accessory pack... it was useless... even with the SteadyShot on I was unable to hold the camera still enough to eliminate shake.<br/><br/>Notes- (please note... I am only reviewing this for its video capability)<br/><br/>- I am going to start off with the positive.  The focus system is remarkable. I absolutely love that the camera will put itself in macro mode and focus on objects in the foreground. It is also remarkably fast in focusing in making the adjustment.  This is a very useful tool for doing vlog style product features... you can record your face and then have the camera immediately (and almost magically) focus on a product that you throw in front of it. The challenge is next point)<br/><br/>- If you are doing this while holding the camera on some sort of non-active gimbal  - your footage will likey have some serious shake.  Personally, I find this to be a cardinal sin. YT and other services usually de-rank videos with shaky footage.<br/><br/>-  Of course, you can overcome the shake by 1) using a tripod 2) getting an active gimbal.  Option 1 is ok... but it kinda defeats the purpose of the super-fast focus.  So I went with #2... and I was able to find a pretty decent active gimbal that worked well. Honestly, it dropped the shake to a point that I would have expected from the camera alone.<br/><br/>- The microphone is good... but not great. It is a solid choice for vlogging since it is omnidirectional.<br/><br/>- The picture quality is pretty good, but it's not going to blow you away.  Like most cameras, it does well in well-lit conditions (i.e sunlight) but it starts to fall short in indoor environments.  I was recently comparing footage (outdoors) between the ZV-1 and my iPhone 11 pro... the picture quality was comparable (although the iPhone has less shake).  I am not saying an iPhone is better for videoing (its not.. the ZV-1 has much, much better focusing, microphone, options, and etc).<br/><br/>- In a somewhat unfair comparison.. I recently filmed a trip to the zoo with both the ZV-1 and my Canon HFG60 (which also has a 1" sensor).  The Canon camcorder had a much better picture and I was able to film without the need of an active gimbal. Granted the Canon isn't designed to be used for one-handed vlogging..... but it did highlight some of the limits with the ZV-1<br/><br/>- Form - Another thing that Sony got right. The ZV-1 is super light, can easily be held one-handed, and has a nice articulating screen. I found the buttons to be a bit awkward and a bit too recessed which caused me to accidentally *not push* record when I was trying to record something.<br/><br/>- The Sony menu system is ok... I am not used to it... so it is bit cumbersome for me<br/><br/>- Pro features...  This camera isn't designed for pros. I see no option for manual focus (Not that big of a deal)  but you really can't even operate it in manual mode. It has a manual mode, but you're not going to be able to change the settings on the fly.<br/><br/>- The lens is a F1.8/2.8 so it is reasonably fast. It also allows for some decent bokeh despite a smallish sensor.<br/><br/>Final Verdict... It kinda feels like I a being hard on the ZV-1 by giving it 3 stars.  However.... on one of my trips, I forgot to bring the connecting plate for my gimbal, and the ZV-1 became nearly worthless.  While it has some very strong features... it could have been so much more!</span>

<span>This is a phenomenal all round camera for nearly any use you can think of. The update allows the auto focus to suck less. The picture quality is great when you use the right settings. And it works well as a webcam if you get the canon software to allow it. The only problem I have with this camera is it's extremely low capacity battery only allowing about an hour of power when just on. When recording at qualities below 4k it also lasts about an hour. On 4k you will be lucky to have it last much more than a half an hour. I bought extra batteries for it and hope those help the longevity! Otherwise this camera is great.</span>

<span>CONS:<br/>1) All the zoom modes are digital. i.e. THERE IS NO ZOOM.  You can get the same effect by cropping into any 4k video. This is just letting you execute a post-production FAKE zoom, but doing so in pre... while you're shooting. - It looks like you can go twice as far into the 4k video as one would usually do in post... (instead of zooming in to 2x in 1080P, it allows you to digitally "zoom" to EXPAND the size of your already captured image to 4x) but with this tiny sensor it's GRAINY AS HELL at 4X. and Forget about the advertised 8X zoom that they plastered all over the internet without mentioning that 'that's just for photos.' --&gt; THAT'S JUST FOR PHOTOS. - FAR less than 1% of users bought this stabilized video gimbal to attach to their phone, and take photos that their phone could take. The 8X zoom was not even close to a real claim.<br/><br/>You cannot use this device in the 3rd world or poor nations. As usual DJI is for elites and the Western Wealthy with an IMMEDIATE demand that you have internet access and a smart phone. ... And a willingness to confide in strangers, access to both. - You must be willing to use their app and have an account with them in order to "activate" an object that you bought which is no more complex than any Sony camera or disc player that does not require such obedience. - You must have an internet connection the day you "activate" your device. - You must have their app and a smartphone to address errors they make regularly in the firmware of their devices (I say this as an owner of 4 gimbals and 2 drones from these people... their updates are CONSTANTLY needed... and they never reach perfection, they just sort of stop supporting the last hardware each christmas.)<br/>You must further understand that the manual to your device is in your smart phone, not in your packaging.<br/>Again... could have been humane and powerful... ended up being corporate, systemically oppressive, and creepy.<br/><br/>The "do-it-all" handle does not do it all. It has no headphone output. There is still... despite now having 2 new &amp; functional mic inputs... no way to MONITOR your audio. Which no journalist, even of the lowest caliber would risk. You cannot interview someone on the spot, even for evidence, and just magically trust that you'll have good audio later. It doesn't work that way. We need to hear what we're getting for exactly the same reasons that we need to see the framing of our shot. There was no reason for failure here. The manual says nothing about the connection of bluetooth monitoring. And so far as I can see, 100% of DJIs claims of the ability to connect "external ear phones" are false. - You can connect external earphones to the handle or to YOUR CELL PHONE... to listen to PLAYBACK ONLY...  which was ALWAYS an option you had so that improves this device not at all.<br/><br/>The wireless mic that comes with the creator pack is a bluetooth mic and it sounds like it. Just like any bluetooth mic that you talk to your mom on the phone with. This sounds like that compression, because it IS that compression. Not a primetime / pro-ready mic. - It could have been 2.4ghz. It didn't have to be this. But it is.<br/><br/>The manual says it will automatically connect to the wifi network created by the do everything handle. - It will not. This was another open falsehood. - The wifi password is in the SWIPE DOWN, GEAR ICON, Accessories menu of the Pocket Gimbal itself, not on the box, not online, not in the manual, not in the app, not on a sticker. In the gimbal. Just thought I'd write that little tidbit here so you don't go on the same quest everyone else on that user thread went on.<br/><br/>Total failure on the addition of a useful zoom.<br/>Total failure on the audio addition.<br/>Total failure on the mandate to start writing informative manuals.<br/>Total failure on the mandate to treat their customers better.<br/>Better luck next year.<br/><br/>UPDATE 11-23-20: You get EITHER "___ digital zoom"... OR Slow Motion. You do not get both. Under no circumstances will you zoom into a slow motion shot or be be zoomed in when you slow mo.<br/>2: You get EITHER your cell phone as a remote screen, OR digital zoom control. Not both. To be clear, I took the pocket camera to an event wherein it would need to be boomed UP on a monopod to see over a crowd barrier. I placed it atop the monopod, and clamped my cell phone to the foot of the monopod and boomed it UP so as to see over the barrier while monitoring image on the cell phone below. - I then decided to try the digital zoom via tapping the cell phone screen... turns out, there is no zoom control on the cell phone screen. The app lacks this. So I lowered the device plugged in the joystick, 'zoomed in' to an arbitrary shot, then raised it up again... when it was time to zoom back out again, I lowered the boom, used the joystick, then raised the camera up in the air again. - So... that was good.</span>

<span>I had the first Osmo Pocket for two years and I really enjoyed it, it had a few downsides though like when a room was even a little dim, you could see visual noise in the footage and photos. Also whether you were outside or inside, the contrast and exposure were sometimes all over the place. The only way to TRY to fix it was to adjust the settings manually for each shot...but even then...there were limitations.<br/><br/>This Osmo Pocket 2 is much better in the sense that when I filmed the same dim rooms or low light settings, the camera performed much better with little to no visual noise. The contrast and exposures are much more even. If you're filming a landscape that is in shadow, but there's a bright sky, this Osmo Pocket will adjust the light so you can see the ground and landscape -which is an improvement because the last pocket would adjust for the sky and make the landscape look even darker.<br/><br/>The Pocket 2 also has better sound, its clearer and sound tracking allows it so the microphones pick up wherever the camera is pointed. I generally use an external mic, so I'll admit I haven't used the built-in mic features much. The Pocket 2 also starts up faster, but the power button is now a separate button on the side of the camera, be careful not to accidentally press the button when you're taking the camera out of the case or pushing it into the case.<br/><br/>Speaking of case, the last Osmo was held into the case with a silicone strap, this one doesn't use a strap, it uses friction...which I think is a bad idea because over time It will wear away at the sides of the camera, making it look bad. I can already tell that's whats going to happen.<br/><br/>The camera advertises 4k and HDR.. BUT what they don't tell you is that the HDR is not available on the 4k setting, it is only available on the 1080p setting. That being said, the 4k setting by itself is a vast improvement over the first Pocket, and by doing a bit of color grading in post-production, it could pass for HDR footage.<br/><br/>I was a bit confused when I bought it because DJI kept saying this has zoom, but they went back and forth as if it not only possessed digital zoom but also optical zoom. Let me clear that up. THERE IS NO OPTICAL zoom not even 2x optical zoom. It uses digital zoom only, which I personally don't like, so I don't use it.<br/><br/>The camera still gets warm when shooting in 4k mode, however it doesn't get nearly as hot as the first Pocket. My first pocket would get so hot the camera would shut down. This one doesn't. At least it hasn't yet. I like the little joy stick that comes with the camera. It allows you to move the gimball without neading to physically move your arm. This is useful for steadycam walking footage where you need to suddenly look up or down without switching to FPV mode. Just use the joystick. It moves the gimball at only 1 speed, but its a slow steady speed which is still good for getting steady footage. It would be cool if DJI incorporated software that allowed it to speed up or slow down from that speed when you push the joystick...but otherwise its a nice feature.<br/><br/>If you're new to Osmo Pocket, it is NOT an action cam, and it is NOT a lowlight cam. It's best use is for daytime/sunset vlogging, walking tour, steadycam, or getting high-quality footage in a convenient pocket size. So don't get it wet, and don't try to shoot in near darkness or extreme sports.<br/><br/>Everything in your shot is always in-focus, so don't expect the kind of background blurring you get with DSLR's focus. But if you want that kind of blurring, you can do that with Adobe Premiere Pro or Photoshop, so don't worry. I have shot near-DSLR quality footage with this camera and after doing some adjustments in post-production it looks amazing. I highly recommend this camera for vloggers, or for professionals when you need some extra camera work done with convenience.<br/><br/>As for the camera, the old pocket advertized a 12 MP camera, this one advertises a 64 MP camera. Normally that would mean the 64 MP would have a resolution almost 5 times the size...but in this case, the resolution is only a little bit bigger, the difference is in the camera's ability to capture detail.<br/><br/>I really like this camera, I think its a huge improvement over the original Osmo, for me it is the perfect camera. I personally don't need any other cameras because this one does everything I need it to do. But I know a guy who uses this camera ALONG WITH his DSLR and he gets great footage that he pieces together into a cool video.<br/><br/>So try it out. I think you'll like it.</span>

<span>As I get up there in age, lately I've been thinking, I don't have much to remember my family. Mostly some old low quality pictures. No ones fault, technology was just not there years ago. Not like it is now. So I've been on a mission to start preserving family and memories for my kids, grand kids and maybe even great grands, ect.<br/><br/>Month or so ago I bought the DJI Mini 2 drone and was just blown away by it's quality and features. I noticed DJI had this camera and I knew I could count on it being very good. And it is. So good.<br/><br/>I am no photography expert, so not going to say it's the best or anything. But for me, for preserving family memories it's just incredible. I love how small and light weight this camera is. Fits in your hand, you could even put it in your pocket. Power it on, push the record button and you are in business. So easy to use! So far it's had great stabilization. Perfect point and record camera.<br/><br/>The video this takes is fantastic. We've been playing the videos on our 65" 4K bravia tv and it's an awesome. Looks so good with great colors and clarity. Could not be happier. I have not learned all it can do, so really excited to discover all the features.<br/><br/>I only have one very small negative, though not totally a negative. I find the do all handle very difficult to take off. But for me it's a good permanent attachment and rarely have any reasons to take it off. I also wish the battery life was better, but it is recording 4K. And there are power bank attachments.<br/><br/>One tip... if you do buy this camera, be sure to get the thumb wheel attachment, it is SO much better than the default toggle and it adds more functions right at your finger tips.<br/><br/>If you are on the fence with one, get it, you won't be sorry. Highly recommend.</span>

<span>I won't lie I was tremendously skeptic about something this small and lightweight being able to produce any kind of good quality photo. Sometimes you'll get something that advertises one thing but then when you get it there's pixelation and distortion. I was tremendously proven wrong! This thing gives amazing photos and videos! I do videography on the side and one of my obstacles has been packing so much equipment and getting it through airport, to unload it on the other side, to get it into the car and then on to my event. For smaller events that don't require a lot this thing is absolutely amazing. And the best thing is it can fit in your back pocket.<br/>The one thing that I did not know in advance is what was needed for live streaming. I assume that once I connected my phone to the camera which provides a bigger screen for you to see what you're filming, I thought that I could stream through my phone. You cannot. You have to have the transmitter that fits into the bottom of this device in order to stream. The device calls $99 here on Amazon. The gimbal itself is very functional and it's tracking. What I mean by that is if you are walking it doesn't necessarily do a quick tracking that sometimes causes the camera to move too quickly. It's more of a slow gentle glide which is great depending on what you're filming. The downside to that is if you're filming something where you are moving rather quickly the gimbal will lose the subject and you'll have to recalibrate it again. All in all I would highly suggest this for anyone looking to do great photos or video while traveling.<br/>As far as it being water resistant I do not dare to try that out yet. But I'm currently just enjoying how this works. Battery life could be a little better. After 45 minutes of continuous filming I was down to 27% battery. And that was from it being charged 100%. So if you need to film longer this is a challenge as to the charging port may make it difficult for you to charge and film at the same time. You definitely would not be able to plug in your phone and the charger at the same time on the gimbal. All in all is a great product I highly recommend it</span>

<span>This camera is awesome, it has everything one needs out of box with little need for anything else only extra batteries that can be found 3rd party via Amazon.<br/><br/>The amount of options for an optical camera like this is so amazing. I like how the digital display explains what every feature does for video or pictures for noobs like me. I love the CMOS sensor that allows one to zoom without losing quality by simply using sensor cropping.<br/><br/>The mic is pretty good but I'll probably upgrade that soon for better clarity. The EVF is awesome! No more having to squint at the screen on sunny days trying to see what the tracking is seeing. It's like having a hood for your screen.<br/><br/>I am happy I went with this little combo than just the DSLR combo with tons of things you don't need cause this beats it. Always go with mirrorless cameras, it's the latest in camera tech, trust me. Do your research on the differences.</span>

<span>Very powerful camera for its price point, but buyer beware. Canon is no longer making new Ef-m lenses for the camera, so this is an end of line product. You can buy an ef adapter and have access to a lot of good ef and ef-s lenses, but then you adding weight and length to every lens you buy.<br/><br/>Also don't buy this camera for the 4k video. It works, but tends to be soft.  Due to how the camera works, it records at a lower resolution, then uprezes the video, creating a soft video that's not truly 4k.</span>

<span>I did a lot of research before this purchase. I already had a Nikon DSLR (D7100). There are excellent alternatives, each with its own set of tradeoffs, but I would absolutely the Canon EOS 6 Mark II again. A great start to videography, particularly because of Canon color science, logical menu system &amp; fully functional touch screen. Speaking of the touch screen, I don't like flip-up, but I solved that by using a cage (which I probably would have wanted anyway. I got and like the detachable view finder, which isn't expensive if you get it with the camera body.</span>

<span>Love it for all types of photography.  Touchscreen, menus, and physical controls are all fantastic.  It is very light and compact.  Maybe not the best camera for very large hands.  The autofocus &amp; crazy fast fps rate are great.  To me, the ISO becomes pretty noisy beyond 1600.  It is a 32MP crop sensor (1.6x).  Understand that before you purchase.  Also understand there is no weather sealing or built in image stabilization.  Haven't done much video, but it shoots every HD spec &amp; 4k beautifully, albeit with a 30 min time limit per clip.  The EVF is a definite must for photographers.  It is clear and customizable. There is not a great lens selection for the EF-M mount, but if you are looking to get into photography or vlogging, there is enough.  There is an adapter for Canon EF &amp; EF-S mount lenses if you currently own them.  This camera inspires me to go out and shoot because it is versatile, compact, and user friendly.  Love it.</span>

<span>I’ve used this camera for a couple months now, making daily videos using a dummy battery that plugs into the wall for longer recording sessions, and I haven’t had the camera overheat. With a regular battery, it’ll overheat within half an hour, but with the dummy battery, I record for 2-3 hours no problem, and I even left the camera connected to OBS for 5+ hours as a test, and it was still streaming no problem.<br/><br/>It DOES have clean HDMI output. There’s a fair bit of grain/noise, but let’s be realistic. It’s a $550 camera, not an $800+ camera. The black levels are very nice. Autofocus is pretty good. Takes 2 seconds at most to autofocus if you quickly put your hand up to it. It has eye focus (disabled by default, but no downside to turning it on in the settings). The onboard mic is decent, if you plan on using it outside (I don’t).<br/><br/>Overall, I’d say this is better than my iPhone 12 Pro in many respects, and it’s what I’d say is the minimum in the more professional-like range for common use cases like YouTube and streaming. My biggest problem with it is the level of noise (even with a pretty bright ring light in my face), but again, it’s a $550 camera, not an $800-1000+ camera, so that’s understandable.<br/><br/>If you plan on using this for YouTube or streaming, I would recommend buying a dummy battery so you can stream the clean HDMI output, which will reduce heat generation and prevent overheating.<br/><br/>Oh, the final gripe I have with it is that the flip screen doesn’t have an always-on mode. The longest you can have it on for is half an hour. I actually prefer mine to turn off after 3 minutes, but if you WANT to see yourself for longer than half an hour, you can’t.</span>

<span>I purchased this because it was the third generation revision camera marketed to 'Vloggers, Creators and Streamers," promising "Effortless streaming and conference calls."<br/>First - if you want to stream with this camera without it shutting off by the time the battery dies, you MUST have USB-C on your computer.  You will also need a USB C PD rated cable, which it does not come with.  The cable it comes with is a USB C to A that is about 1.5 feet long.<br/>The other thing about this camera is that the viewfinder flips out to the left, which is where all the cable jacks are, meaning if it's plugged in, you can't see a good chunk of the viewfinder screen due to wire obstruction (and you also can't tilt it).<br/>So, after ordering a USB C hub for my computer and appropriate cable, I started my first stream only to have the device overheat and stop streaming 1.5 hours into the stream.  After multiple tests, it overheats after between 45 mins and 2 hours.  Every time.<br/>If you're a streamer and considering purchasing this, steer clear.  No streamer ever touched this in the design phase.</span>

The Z30 is an entry-level camera designed primarily for vloggers, although it borrows all of its major components from the Z50 and Z fc, both very good cameras that can produce excellent photos.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between this camera and all other Z cameras is that the Z30 does not have an electronic viewfinder, or any viewfinder, so photos or videos must be taken from the rear screen. The flippy screen on the Z30 also opens to the side and can be rotated 180 degrees, a big positive for vloggers and video content creators.<br/><br/>The Z30, like the Z50, can record 4k video up to 30p, but the Z50 and Z fc has a 30-minute video or clip limitation, while the Z30 is capable of recording up to 125 minutes of full HD 24p/25p video, depending on battery life, memory card limits, and the body’s internal temperature.<br/><br/>The Z30, like most Nikon cameras, has very good ergonomics, with a deep grip. All of the buttons on the back of the camera are reachable with one hand, and the camera as two Function buttons, a nice touch for an entry level camera. It feels well-built and substantial.<br/><br/>Additionally, like all Nikon DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, many of the buttons can be customized. The red “Recording” button is larger than it is on other Nikon cameras, since this camera is aimed primarily at video creators.<br/><br/>The Z30 can also be charged while in use with a compatible USB-C to USB-C cable (not included). Nikon does include a USB cable for charging the battery from a standard USB charger or laptop. The Z30 also includes a Tally light (recording light) on the front, useful for vloggers, but the Z30 does not have a headphone jack, so you cannot monitor audio (you can visually check audio levels on the screen for clipping).  As an entry-level camera aimed primarily vloggers on the go, the lack of a headphone jack may not be a big deal. The Z30 also offers twin mics, so vloggers and video creators should get good audio results without an external mic.<br/><br/>The Nikon Z 30 comes with one or two “kit” lenses, the 16mm-50mm and a 50mm-250mm. Both are very light and are made of plastic (except for the glass), but both produce very good photos, and the 16mm-50mm in particular, is very small. You can easily fit the Z30 and the small 16mm-50mm lens in a jacket pocket.<br/><br/>Nikon also makes a 18mm-140mm DX lens, and all of its full frame lenses, which for the most part are heavier and more expensive, can be used on the Z30. Additionally, Nikon has a 12mm-28mm DX lens on its lens “roadmap,” a lens that will be likely be popular with vloggers and video creators.<br/><br/>Taking photos with the Z30 is a bit more challenging for people who are used to or grew up using cameras with a viewfinder. The kit lenses are light, which helps, but in situations where careful composition is required, a camera with a traditional viewfinder would be more preferable. The rear screen, with 1,040,000 dots, does a pretty good job, even in full sunlight, but it is easier to see the details of a scene with a viewfinder.<br/><br/>The Z30 has Nikon’s latest autofocus features, found in Nikon’s latest full frame mirrorless cameras, and the human and dog (or cat) eye detection feature works well. Additionally, the AF-F autofocus choice, for video, works quickly and holds focus.<br/><br/>The Nikon Z30 is aimed at smartphone users looking to move up to a camera that can provide higher quality video and photos, and vloggers and videographers looking for an entry-level option. Additionally, the camera, with its small 16mm-50mm lens, or with the Z 28mm prime lens, is unobtrusive, and is a great option for street photography. Finally, combined with its two kit lenses, the Z30 makes for a very small, light, and affordable travel kit.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!</span>

<span>So to be honest, my first-ever digital camera was the Fujifilm X-T3 which I bought at the beginning of this year (2022). Since then, I have been avidly going out to outdoor locations, downtown, and parks to gain experience in photography and videography. My focus is video, so when I saw this Nikon Z 30, I naturally wanted to get it.<br/><br/>Coming from a Fuji user that mainly produces "trendy" videos on Instagram, I'm impressed at how well this camera performs due to its compact &amp; small size. The low light performance is overall much better than my Fuji X-T3, and given that the Fuji is from 2018, it makes sense. APS-C sensor cameras are often perceived as lower-quality, however this, along with a few new cameras (Sony FX30), are being released and it seems like there's some upsides to using these type of cameras compared to full-frame variants. The Nikon Z30 definitely falls under that category, and as I said, I'm impressed at how little grain shows up even when the ISO is in the thousands.<br/><br/>This camera is extremely lucrative for content creators because of its overall performance given the lightweight &amp; compact body. Even with the heaver 50-250mm lens, the camera remains under 2.5lbs in weight. Of course, if you're a new Nikon user, there will be a learning curve, but YouTube can definitely help you in that regards.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that this kit is very much worth it. Considering the cost of lenses in general, getting the bundle with both lenses is more worth it than just getting the 16-50mm combo. The Nikon Z mount ecosystem doesn't have a ton of lens options to be honest, but there's a few third party options that definitely take advantage of this camera's sensor. I'm yet to purchase one of these third party lenses, but I know that given the performance this camera has been outputting with the included kit lenses, I can only imagine how great the image quality will be with prime lenses.<br/><br/>5/5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>• Impressive image quality<br/>• Great Low-light performance<br/>• Compact, lightweight body<br/>• Relatively quick autofocus and eye tracking<br/>• Intuitive quick menu, settings can be changed on the fly<br/>• Flip screen, vlogging made easier compared to using a tilt screen.<br/>• Pretty decent kit lens included<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>• Gets hot pretty quick and overheats when shooting video in 4K<br/>• Awkward SD card slot located next to battery inside battery tray</span>

<span>I’m still putting this camera through its paces but I wanted to give a first impression. I’m teetering between 4 1/2 and five stars. That there are some concerns that can only be examined after using it for a while. I am here looking to go into a Nikon mirrorless and you are primarily a still photographer you’re still better off going with the larger Z 50. This is a cut down version made specifically for videographers though it will take excellent still pictures. The processor and image sensor and the two cameras are exactly the same.<br/><br/>I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to carry around this thing  after shooting with 2 kg DSLR‘s for decades. It feels like I am holding a feather and yet my image quality is stunning.<br/><br/>I will continue to add to this review as I use it but here is a impressions list of my pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Mirrorless<br/>Fully articulated screen<br/>Hi resolution screen<br/>Stereo Microphones<br/>Design for videographers<br/>Improved user customizable menus<br/>Programmable function keys<br/>Stunning image quality<br/>Powerful image stabilization (in lens)<br/>Interchangeable lenses<br/>Full range of DSLR features<br/>4K and slow motion modes<br/>Light and compact<br/>Real time HDR<br/>Good value/price for entry level<br/>125 minute scene capacity<br/>Accepts power via USB-C<br/>It’s a Nikon<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Limited lenses available - smaller ecosystem<br/>Not primarily designed for still photography (Z50 is the better choice)<br/>No viewfinder<br/>Only supports UHS-I not II<br/>Mainly plastic construction<br/>Not Log Mode for video<br/>Only one memory card slot<br/>No headphone jack for real-time audio monitoring<br/>Some reports of overheating</span>

<span>If you’re a woman or a beta male this camera is perfect for you.  Tall people with larger hands will find this camera is just too petite.<br/><br/>The large touch screen is nice.  It allows you to quickly adjust you settings,  review images you’ve taken and make you wish Canon would have made a battery grip to go with this.  Unfortunately they didn’t and have no plans to.<br/><br/>The digital viewfinder is unable to keep up when you hold the hammer down and photographing fast moving subjects.  The auto focus at times completely loses focus and your subject completely disappears.<br/><br/>My rate of out of focus pictures was unacceptably high this camera.<br/><br/>If you are hoping this camera will be a replacement for your 7D Mk II it isn’t.  Do yourself a favor and wait till Canon builds a cropped sensor camera that will is a little bigger and has a battery grip available.</span>

<span>So far I am very happy with the performance of the R7. I was between r7 and the 90d. I think I made the correct choice. Not a full frame camera but works very well for wildlife/birds. In combination with my 400mm 5.6 L and my 70-200 is3 L with or without extensions. Was also able to convert my old efs lenses with good results.</span>

<span>If you are coming to the R7 from an 80D or other similar DSLR, you may ask the same question I did, which is whether or not to get the kits lens (18-150RF).  I decided to buy the kit as it was the only thing available at the time of order (body-only had been delayed).  I compared the 18-150 RF kit lens shot-for-shot with my 18-135 EF-S (nano USM, as sold in the 80D kit) using the official canon ef/rf adapter.  In my opinion, the 18-135EF gave better image quality results.  The 18-135EF rendered better, with better color and clarity.  Just overall more pleasing photos.  It’s not that the 18-150RF wasn’t sharp.  It was.  But there seemed to be an artificial “smoothness” to the photos.  I don’t know how else to describe it.  Also, my 18-135EF was slightly wider at 18mm than was the 18-150 RF, which is nice.  In terms of performance (focusing, etc), they were similar. The main advantage of the 18-150 kit lens is the smaller size and weight and convenience of not having to use an adapter.<br/><br/>Conversely, when I compared the 18-150RF kit lens to my two favorite EF-S lenses (the 15-85 EF USM and the 55-250 EF STM) at similar focal lengths, the 18-150RF kit lens performed better.  Photos with these older EF lenses seemed less sharp, even though the focus had seemed to lock on. This result was unexpected, because these lenses are quite sharp on my 80D, sharper than the 18-135EF for sure.  Perhaps the older focusing systems in those lens aren’t gelling perfectly with the R7 or perhaps it is a problem with IS compatibility. For my comparisons, I was initially shooting still objects at low to moderate shutter speeds using first curtain electronic shutter.  I then decided to try mechanical vs electronic shutters to see if shutter shock could be an issue, and indeed there was noticeable blurring with the mechanical shutter, quite awful on the 15-85EF, but also problematic on the 55-250EF, 18-135EF, and even the 18-150RF kit lens compared to the electronic shutter.  This did not always seem fully resolved by using higher shutter speeds, which was also surprising, and it makes me think there is more than one issue at play.<br/><br/>Using my 100-400mm Sigma lens and the 18-150RF lens for flying herons, there were similar issues, with best results being shot with electronic shutter, but the rolling shutter is INTENSE for panning moving subjects. My results with the mechanical shutter weren't great, but admittedly I was having issues tracking the birds due to the blackout in the viewfinder.  Thus, it’s a quandary in using this camera for action, for which it seems intended.<br/><br/>I’m scratching my head.  I’ve seen a ton of reviews saying the EF lenses work “flawlessly” via the adapter.  So I’m wondering if I just got a bad unit or if this is a general short-coming of the R7 that people just aren’t talking about.  (If it is the latter, I wish more people would speak to this issue as to temper expectations in this regard.)  While I'm sure I can improve my results via learning curve and workarounds, the thought of not being able to reliably use my EF and EF-S lenses with the R7 as I make the transition to mirrorless is discouraging.  As this camera is a brand new release, perhaps some of these problems can be addressed in future firmware.  Don’t know.  Not sure how motivated Canon would be to fix a problem that would result in them selling less RF lenses, or if it is even possible to fix given the mechanics of the camera and various lenses.<br/><br/>Based on my experience, I’d suggest that if you are going to buy the R7, get the kit lens and other RF lenses for best results, as whatever the shortcomings are of the R7, they seem worse using EF/EF-S lenses. Of course, if you are going to do that, you could really just go to any brand instead of sticking with Canon as an upgrader.  As for me, I returned the R7 and will consider other options.  I may come back to the R7, but the first experience with it was concerning enough that I have taken a pause.</span>

<span>Buyers beware: I was long past due for a camera upgrade and didn't want to shell out for the R6 or other full-frame given that I have an APS-C camera and several lenses. This camera announcement was delayed for a long time and I stayed up until after midnight to put in a pre-order on 6/23 [sic]. The shipment date was at first unknown, then changed several times. Note that you can now get the R7 right away but ONLY with a $400 starter lens. Body-only is available right now, but only "used" via re-sellers at $400-$500 above list price, generally meaning that the warranty is voided.<br/><br/>My camera was supposed to be delivered after 9/22,  then mid-August, then it "shipped" and was due last Tuesday, but still hasn't arrived [it's 8/15].<br/><br/>I am still looking forward to getting this camera but would recommend that people hold off until the supply is more stable.<br/><br/>Sorry Canon, love your lenses and cameras, but the rollout has been rough and could have been handled better.</span>
