For today's interchangeable lens camera enthusiasts or anyone looking for a lighter, newer more intelligent alternative to bulky DSLRs, the Panasonic Lumix 4K Digital Camera DMC G85MK with 12 60mm Power O.I.S. lens delivers impressive, no compromise performance. This 4K Mirrorless Micro Four Thirds camera is nearly half the size of most DSLRs yet delivers impressive 16 megapixel large sensor performance in the most compact camera system ever designed by Panasonic Lumix. Thanks to the elimination of the low pass filter, its fine detail resolving power is boosted nearly 10 percent over previous 16 megapixel sensors. Image stabilization is top of its class with the complementary Lumix 2 axis lens O.I.S. and a new 5 axis in body I.S., available in either photo or video recording modes. Camera purists will enjoy the familiar quick access thumbwheel controls and integrated 2360K dot eye level electronic live viewfinder, plus an articulating flip LCD display for greater flexibility in difficult shooting angles. Modern enthusiasts will love the Wi Fi mobile control and next generation flexibility that 4K Video, 4K photo and 4K Post Focus modes bring to the creative experience.

<span>I had the chance to use this model of camera before I bought it and so before I sank the money I already knew that this was a good product. It's really not too expensive and is able to shoot stunning video and take incredible pictures. My girlfriend and I have been using this often and it's been so easy to use even with her having minimal videography and photography experience.</span>

<span>One of the best value camera out there. Hands down.<br/>For current users, I highly suggest to do the following: Go to menu --&gt; Setup --&gt; beep (page 2) --&gt; Turn off the beep volume and E shutter volume<br/>This was a huge annoyance for me at first, and I was relieved to find it in the settings.<br/>Battery saving options are also within the page 2 of setup such as Live View Mode (30fps), Monitor Luminance, and Economy.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Stills quality is very nice and sharp, even from the 12-60mm kit lens. Image quality and bokeh are stunning when paired with the 25mm f1.7. The dual IS is really good for stills and even more amazing in video. Two custom settings within the dial are really helpful for saving your own shooting modes. I personally save Shutter-priority video moves to these in different recording formats (i.e. 4k30fps, FHD60fps). There are also plenty of fn buttons to customize. There are also color profiles to shoot in that may be customized. I find that the "Natural" profile to be the most pleasing in video. There is also Cine-D for those wanting a flatter look or for grading.<br/>Weather sealed - Not much to say here other than, great!<br/>Coming from a Nikon APSC camera, I am amazed at how light and robust the mirrorless form factor is. There is little fatigue in carrying it in your hands all day. The LCD screen that allows a full swivel is really neat for selfies/vlogging.<br/>Finally... the video. Most buyers are probably here b/c of this and yes... it does not disappoint. The detail is amazing! BUT, the real shocker is the image stabilization. When paired w/ dual IS and E-stabilization turned on, the video is practically gliding (especially @ wider angles - 12mm). I am not joking. Walking with the camera is buttery smooth, no jittery videos.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>It's only up to 16MP stills, though I still find the image quality to be very good even when an image has been cropped in edits.<br/>I found that the image is a bit noisy at higher iso (6400 and above), though this is not really a bother to me. I find that it gives it a natural feel to lowlight shots. You can always dial it down with a bit of NR in Lightroom and other software.<br/>A slight crop to the 4k video recording.<br/>This was not a con for me, but others may think it. There's a lot to learn w/in the settings of this camera. Take the time to read the advanced handbook. Experiment!<br/><br/>In summary, I highly recommend this. If you are on the fence, JUMP OVER!</span>

<span>I have been thinking of buying the OMD EM1 Mark 2.  I am an enthusiast and take pictures of my family and for travel. Many years ago, I sold my Canon bodies/lenses to get into Micro 4/3’s. Like many, my investment in film lenses led me to Canon bodies in the electronic world. However, it became clear to me that the electronic world offered new opportunities as the technology improved.  It looked like Micro 4/3 sensors would be the sweet spot for most photography in this new world. My first 4/3’s camera was a Panasonic.  I loved it.<br/><br/>Later I upgraded to the OMD EM5 Mark 2 for the better-quality sensor, better in-body stabilization system, and small size.  The technology was advancing.<br/><br/>Update: I have used the camera for some time now.  There have been two firmware updates to improve stabilization and stabilization "hum" and I am using the Panasonic 100-400 with dual IS.  I cannot say enough about how good this camera is, and at the price, it is a great value. I have added some pictures using the zoom lens and 12-60 lens for illustration.<br/><br/>Time passed, looking for my next upgrade.  It is not picture quality driving me, but 4K video and, frankly handling.  Don’t like the size of the existing OMD camera for handling.  Just a bit too small physically.<br/><br/>Out comes the OMD EM1 Mark 2 for body only almost $2,000, but looks like better handling.  Very professional features, especially fast focus and rapid fire.  Also, higher pixel stills is interesting technology. But What. $2,000.<br/><br/>I found the G85.  I bought it despite the stability issue.  I do not have a noise issue in video. Price is right.  I am using it and it meets my needs. (I expect a firmware update, but camera is entirely usable for photography, which is my focus, pun intended.  I have also made some video’s and they are passable.  There is a little “jump” at the start of the pan, but for me, I could survive. I expect that Panasonic will fix this, as the GX85 does not exhibit this behavior.)<br/><br/>Handling is much better with a larger size handle for holding and taking pictures.  Still light and better than dslr’s for everyday picture taking.  This is the next generation of Micro 4/3’s.  Frankly, I like the on-off switches on the right side, and this does it. (You can set up the dual switch on EM2 2 to be the on-off switch but too expensive to buy just for this.)<br/><br/>Picture quality is superb. Not the reason to upgrade or switch brands.<br/><br/>I had forgotten, but I much prefer the Panasonic UI to the Olympus.  I much prefer the Panasonic smartphone apps, in addition.<br/><br/>Micro 4/3’s is really where the action is, as there is strong and vibrant competition.  I wish all markets were like this. I expect features to improve and prices to fall.</span>

<span>I’ve been using a cellphone camera as my primary camera for a few years now and decided it was time to move up to a “real” camera. After successive purchases of two other models that both had defects out of the box and simply weren’t compelling enough to get a replacement of the model, I ended up with this camera. After having it for a few months I can definitely say I’m glad I got the Panasonic LUMIX GX85.<br/><br/>The first thing I really liked was the size of the camera. I have rather small hands for a male and the size of the camera is just right for me, being just large enough to have a solid grip on the camera while being small enough to carry around easily. The size of the camera and layout of the controls means it’s easy for me to access all the controls.<br/><br/>What impressed me after just a few days of use is the interface and menu system of the camera. I’m already very used to touchscreen camera controls from using smartphones and Panasonic did a really good job with the interface on the touchscreen display. It can be as simple or as busy as you wish it to be and works intuitively. I use the touchscreen display as my primary viewfinder, just like on a smartphone, and I simply find myself really enjoying using it.<br/><br/>As for image quality, I currently have a iPhone 7 Plus and the GX85 is leagues better, at least in RAW. The iPhone is a great snapshot camera to always have with you but trying to use it more “seriously” (if vacation photos count as serious) leads to disappointment. The GX85 can take photos with far superior detail and vastly superior dynamic range compared to the iPhone. That means being able to capture things a bit more like you see them and having more headroom to play around with in your photos in applications like Adobe Lightroom. I’ve been very happy with the photos I’ve been able to get from this camera.<br/><br/>I tend to mostly capture photos of still scenes and the focusing system in AF-S mode works very well for that. I have attempted a few times to get shots of birds using AF-C mode and have actually gotten a few good shots despite my inexperience with this (or any) camera’s focusing system. The mechanical shutter has a surprisingly soft sound, being loud enough to where you can be sure the shutter really did fire but not so loud, or sharp, that it gets annoying. The image stabilization is excellent and even my shaky hands can reliably get shots at 1/8 of a second and with a bit more effort in steadying myself, 1/4 of a second.<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty good on this camera and I can generally get a few hundred shots from it before needing to charge it. It charges through micro USB which is extremely handy, though it cannot charge the battery while the camera is powered on nor can it be powered by micro USB alone. Still, being able to use a portable battery pack to recharge camera is very useful. The included lense is very compact and has good image quality which helps make this a good travel camera. The build quality of this all-plastic camera is excellent and it has a hefty, reassuring weight.<br/><br/>The JPEG engine on it is good enough but doesn’t quite match up to smartphones like the iPhone 7 Plus. The biggest issue is that it has a tendency to randomly pepper solid-yellow surfaces with noticeable green dots, a rather bizarre effect. Again, it’s not a bad JPEG engine and most people will be quite happy JPEGs straight out of the camera, but I’ve been spoiled by how well smartphones with their extra processing power can do and I also intended to use RAW and process them in Lightroom later anyway.<br/><br/>There are some other downsides I’ve noticed. The electronic viewfinder is not very great to me, with it being rather blurry in parts no matter how I adjust the diopter, the image being a little small, and the field sequential image simply being a little unpleasant to look at. I should emphasize that this is quite personal and you may be absolutely fine with it, and also that I almost never use the viewfinder anyway so having it at all is more of a bonus feature to me. The included lense has a rather limited zoom range of 12-32mm and there is noticable barrel distortion at the widest end (12mm) that disappears at 14mm. The relatively narrow maximum aperture of the lense means low-light image quality may not be as dramatic of an upgrade from a recent high-end smartphone as might be hoped. The smartphone app’s location tracking is unreliable and I’d recommend using something like the GPS Tracks app (on iOS) to log your location and then use Lightroom to add the locations to your photos later.<br/><br/>I’m not much on taking video and I can’t comment much on that part of the GX85.<br/><br/>There’s really lots more I can say about this camera but this review is probably too long already. This has been an excellent upgrade from my smartphone camera that carries over the intuitiveness of smartphone camera apps and combines that with something with far better image quality and control. It’s just the right size and is so enjoyable to use that I actually do take it with me when I can. Simply put, I’m very glad I got the Panasonic LUMIX GX85 and enthusiastically recommend it.</span>

<span>I started my photography journey with Nikon cameras. I was looking to pick up a mirrorless for video projects and didn't want to break the bank. This Panasonic Lumix GX85 bundle fit the bill. While MP count may be a touch low, image quality is outstanding. 4K video is buttery smooth and quite impressive for such a small, budget camera. It did take a couple of days to get used to the menu system and all the options available, but was well worth the time spent learning. Auto Focus is a touch slow with the kit lenses, but honestly, that's to be expected. Looking forward to trying out some new lenses in the near future. Love it.</span>

<span>Bought this in the recent sale as our family camera and something to take on our trip overseas. I wanted something that was compact enough to carry in my jacket pocket but also gave me the option of putting on longer zooms to start capturing our daughter who is a bit camera shy. I was just tired of looking at blurry family pictures and wanted to start learning how to take better photos before our daughter got too old. It was loads of fun and really glad I picked it up.<br/><br/>(updated - shutter issue)<br/><br/>I wanted to highlight something odd I've experienced and recommend you check your camera when you first get it. I had only seen this mentioned here in one of the reviews so either no one else is reporting this or the the two of us are the only 'lucky' ones.<br/>I like to stay in burst mode since at any time I may switch from a landscape shot to a portrait one where i like to take a few pics just in case. occasionally the camera will take 2 shots at the single shutter press.<br/>It doesn't happen all the time and when it does happen, it stays that way for a few minutes then goes back to normal operation. This is not related to bracketing/etc. - i've taken about 3 weeks worth of photos so i feel that i'm somewhat comfortable handling the shutter button yet every once in a while it decides to double dip. i have not found a pattern yet.<br/>In single shot mode everything is great. it also happens in electronic shutter mode so i suspect it could be the shutter button. it's a little annoying but not enough yet to send it back to Panasonic and risk having it come back worse. For now I've simply added removing the few duplicates to my workflow.<br/><br/>anyone else seeing this?<br/><br/>(end of update)<br/><br/>Some things to note:<br/><br/>- the grip on the camera is rather small and the camera is a bit heavy. I like the weight but holding the camera with my large hands does end up stressing my fingers after a while. I feel like I have to dig into the camera body with my fingers for a firm grip. Try to grab it in person to make sure you're comfortable with it.<br/><br/>- while you can recharge the battery in the camera via USB - came in really handy in our trip - you can not transfer data via USB and power the camera at the same time. Since it only uses USB 2, getting those large RAW files and 4k videos means more often than not your battery will run out before the transfer is done. this forces you to get the data directly out of the card.<br/><br/>- it has a great touchscreen interface - you can take pictures by simply tapping the location on the screen - much like our smartphones. this means you can track your kids across the screen by moving your fingers and taking burst shots as they run around.<br/><br/>- you can take a photo and then decide which parts of the photo you'd like to focus on. this is great when you're just starting to learn depth of field and the different focusing methods. it saved us a number of precious moments. will probably use this less as i get more proficient - but for now it's a great safety net.<br/><br/>- as has been discussed, you can't really put this into auto focus on video and pay attention to your kids. you need to watch the camera and either help it focus once in a while or simply take over the focusing. we did lose a few video moments because i was watching the kids vs. the camera and it lost focus and never regained it.<br/><br/>- the screen doesn't tilt up for group selfie pictures. not unusual for these and sony cameras but still a bit limiting when on the road and trying to do selfies. we ended up using our phones paired with the camera but still not as nice as having everyone looking at themselves on the camera.<br/><br/>- the video audio is a bit weak. I knew this going in and frankly was expecting worse but it's still not as good as i'd like particularly when you see the great video quality that it produces.<br/><br/>- those 4k videos are big. if you've only shot 1080p, make sure your PC, display and storage can handle it. I had problems playing the 4k footage on my surface pro during the trip - requiring me to downscale it to 1080p before being able to show it to folks. this was the i5 surface pro. the camera itself does an excellent job of playing 4k directly to a 1080p TV but that means you'll need to keep your videos on the camera and show unedited footage.<br/><br/>So finally if you're looking for a fun family camera and something that you can learn photography on but still feel comfortable handing it to your significant other for those shots that a phone won't do, consider this. my only regret is not getting it sooner and losing out on our daughter's earlier adventures.<br/><br/>-enjoy</span>

This camera does everything the Gh5 did so well and so much more. Although I have many cameras for various situations, if you can only afford one camera, this would be a great choice for video and photo.<br/>PROS:<br/>-Full Frame + APS-C modes<br/>-96MP still images<br/>-24MP video images give you great image resolving<br/>-easy to use menu just like the Gh5<br/>-in-camera time-lapse video creation is so great and builds on the Gh5<br/>-the sigma EF adapter is perfect for all of my EF lenses<br/>-auto focus is greatly improved over other Panasonic cameras<br/>-Log film mode built-in<br/>-resolves clean blacks even at ISO 20,000 (can be cleaned up in post if ISO exceeds 20,000<br/>-the lens it comes with is perfect for gimbal use although it's aperture-situation isn't ideal<br/>-6K recording coming soon<br/>-dual SD card slots<br/>-great battery life<br/>-uses XLR-1<br/>-great dials<br/>-heavy duty construction<br/>-no moire filter, so it resolves the every last MP of imaging power while still adequately reducing moire<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-auto focus still lags behind Sony (but I almost never use it, so not a concern for me)<br/>- as many will be upgrading from Gh5 its a bummer it uses a different battery<br/>-viewfinder should have been upgraded, it's quality is now outdated<br/>-slow motion is in APS-C mode<br/>-10 bit mode is hard for editing software to process<br/>-no all intra</span>

<span>So I got the camera because I currently have a Panasonic G7 and I really wanted to upgrade.<br/><br/>What I like about this camera is the feel of it it feels sturdy professional heavy but not too heavy the materials feel very well made. The image was great you could definitely see the nice depth and HD to the videos the image stabilization work really great I've tested this camera with and without a gimbal you could easily do handheld stuff and you got perfectly smooth videos and the kit lens was amazing that I have nothing negative to say about that. And if Cameron had a good range of profile soyuz from which may color grading so much easier and very professional-looking. You have 4K 60 FPS and also this, does do well in low-light situations.<br/><br/>Oh boy here comes the negative Parts it's not much but here are my reasons reason why I took this camera back. For some reason Panasonic does not work on there auto focus to make it better. The camera is great for video but in some aspects the pictures are suffering. In my opinion out of 100% I feel the developers worked 60% went designing this camera for video for this camera while 40% is for photos. Like everything you need to buy more batteries I filled this, could do a little better and you would definitely like three or four batteries for a full day or two of work especially if you're working with 4K resolution and also like anything else extra memory cards.<br/><br/>In conclusion not a bad a camera but I think I want to move away from panic Sonic not because it's a bad camera it's great for videos but I want a camera that is close to Perfect all around which I am moving towards Sony and the A7 3 Series or a7r series just because me personally I like their colors videos and picture quality so much more.</span>

<span>Unlike Panasonic's own YouTube tutorial, the advertised WebCam capability is not incorporated in this model.  With the Lumix WebCam software installed, when you connect the camera using the supplied cable the viewfinder does show the necessary PC (Tether) option.  It will only output the Lumix Home Screen, not the lens image.  Since there is zero coverage of the WebCam feature in the manual or Panasonic's site other than the YouTube video, you aren't getting that feature.<br/><br/>OK, so you don't want to use it for video streaming.  Is it OK?<br/><br/>It apparently has no onboard storage like some of the cameras in this price range.  Regardless of the word OPTIONAL associated with the SD card, you need one it appears.  Nothing in the instructions say it needs additional storage unless you go past 4GB, but it does.<br/><br/>OK, you didn't expect it to have onboard storage, is it OK?<br/><br/>The camera is quite dainty.  The ON/OFF switch is smallest I've seen on a camera.  If it cold out, or you are wearing thin gloves, you might have to operate the switches visually instead of by feel.  You have to operate some of the features, like charge port, the LCD viewfinder, the top view focus knob, the flash, with your fingernails.  If you have no fingernails?  You might have to bring something to work it.  I will guess the charge port door will be the first thing to break on it, since it's flimsy and not restrained well.<br/><br/>I haven't decided whether I'll field test it or not.  I was going to use it for automotive vlogs, but I doubt it will handle light field duty.  Am I expecting too much at this price point?  Perhaps.  That's why I gave it two stars.  I'll keep using my 7 year old camera until I make up my mind.<br/><br/>I wasted 3 hours trying to make the Webcam feature work.  I have many webcams, but I thought this would be a step up.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  While the camera was sold in mid-February 2021, it did not have the November 2020 camera body firmware update v1.2.  This is what enables WebCam capability.  Sort of.  It does not transmit audio like most webcams do, it is simply a device driver for the video output.  The updating process is not well documented, but here is an overview:<br/>1)  Formal SD card with Camera.<br/>2)  Put SD card in computer.<br/>3)  Locate v1.2 firmware on Panasonic's site and download.<br/>4)  Unzip the file into the root directory of the SD card.<br/>5)  Put SD card back in camera, turn on camera, switch to review images mode.<br/><br/>The documentation does not necessarily match the DC-G100 screens.<br/><br/>It doesn't change my opinion on two stars, since the docs are poor, and it becomes a Video-Only webcam even though it has a microphone.</span>

<span>I use this camera for the DJ streams I do on Twitch. I was initially turned off by the amount of reviews referring to overheating, but based off how many of my streamer friends use and love this camera I picked one up with a Sigma 16mm f1.4 lens (370-400 USD)<br/>For the people complaining of overheating, they are using Canon’s webcam utility software which encodes the video on the memory card and transmits it through the usb output. This puts an insane load on the cameras processor which… yes, will make it prone to extreme overheat and shutoff. If you buy this camera to use in OBS etc. you MUST use an external capture card device like an Elgato CamLink. This prevents in camera encoding to ensure of less heat and potential damage. (The camera still gets warm while on for a while, but any device with a battery as such will and it’s not worrisome)<br/>Image quality is superb, especially with the addition of the Sigma lens. I get a nice bokeh and fine detail in all of my videos, even when output at a mere 720p.<br/>Highly recommend! Definitely upped my game for sure.</span>

<span>Runs through battery power really quickly. I use this through a video capture card &amp; OBS streaming software to record videos. You could not use this to stream for more than 30min at a time without having to change the battery.<br/><br/>AC power adapters exist but they run through the bottom-mounted battery slot which precludes putting the camera on a tripod or level surface.<br/><br/>Shoots in good quality &amp; the autofocus is better than many.

<span>I’ve used this camera for a couple months now, making daily videos using a dummy battery that plugs into the wall for longer recording sessions, and I haven’t had the camera overheat. With a regular battery, it’ll overheat within half an hour, but with the dummy battery, I record for 2-3 hours no problem, and I even left the camera connected to OBS for 5+ hours as a test, and it was still streaming no problem.<br/><br/>It DOES have clean HDMI output. There’s a fair bit of grain/noise, but let’s be realistic. It’s a $550 camera, not an $800+ camera. The black levels are very nice. Autofocus is pretty good. Takes 2 seconds at most to autofocus if you quickly put your hand up to it. It has eye focus (disabled by default, but no downside to turning it on in the settings). The onboard mic is decent, if you plan on using it outside (I don’t).<br/><br/>Overall, I’d say this is better than my iPhone 12 Pro in many respects, and it’s what I’d say is the minimum in the more professional-like range for common use cases like YouTube and streaming. My biggest problem with it is the level of noise (even with a pretty bright ring light in my face), but again, it’s a $550 camera, not an $800-1000+ camera, so that’s understandable.<br/><br/>If you plan on using this for YouTube or streaming, I would recommend buying a dummy battery so you can stream the clean HDMI output, which will reduce heat generation and prevent overheating.<br/><br/>Oh, the final gripe I have with it is that the flip screen doesn’t have an always-on mode. The longest you can have it on for is half an hour. I actually prefer mine to turn off after 3 minutes, but if you WANT to see yourself for longer than half an hour, you can’t.</span>

<span>I'm a serious amateur photographer who switched from Canon DSLR to the EOS R6 and am using a Canon EF-RF Adapter with all my EF glass.  I shoot a lot of low light indoor events such as plays, musicals and dances.  I was concerned about the size of the sensor "only" being 20MP compared to the EOS R5 of 45MP but was swayed by the price difference as well as the better low light capability of the R6.  After shooting numerous productions, I no longer have any qualms in purchasing this camera.<br/><br/>With the "L" series glass I have, I am getting very sharp, detailed, photos even when the subject was on stage and I was at the back of the auditorium.  I don't enlarge my photos to wall or billboard sized prints but for what my photos are used for - advertisements, brochures, social media and poster sized prints, the camera performs flawlessly.<br/><br/>If I planned wall sized, highly detailed photos I would consider the EOS R5 but for what I need, the EOS R6 was a good choice and I have absolutely no regrets in buying it.</span>

<span>Professionally, all my cameras before the R6 were just tools I used to create images for my clients. I thought the R6 would be just another tool, but as it turns out it's so much more. The camera is a joy to use. Starting off with the auto focus since that is a major improvement over previous Canon models. I've used the auto eye tracking on the 90D the R and RP and it was mediocre, working only when you were close to your subject. The R6 is, for lack of a better term, game changing. It can find and track the eyes of people and animals at far distances and is always spot on. It really takes time to learn and just let the camera do it's job, because I could never trust a camera to just find my subject and nail the focus. The images are sharp and RAW colors straight out of the camera are beautiful. The R6 uses the same 20mp sensor as the 1DX MarkIII which costs four thousand dollars more. In case anyone is wondering, yes 20mp is more than enough and the images out of the R6 are crisp and detailed. You basically have the guts of a 6500.00 camera in the body of a 2400 camera. The smaller file size also doesn't slow down my workflow. The low light high ISO performance is like no other camera I have used. I can shoot at up to ISO 25,600 and get perfectly usable images. I rarely shoot at these settings, but it's nice to know I can. The IBIS is something I didn't would think that mattered much to me until I bought the RF800 f/11. I would usually shoot at 1/800 minimum shutter speed, but the one's above were both shot at 1/400 handheld with no camera shake. The battery life is ok and I get around 500 shots per charge. Before I bought the R6, I owned three other Canon full frame cameras plus the 80D, and 90D. I shortly sold them all keeping only an R and 6D for backup because they were no longer being used. This camera has brought back the fun I used to have taking photos in my younger days.</span>

<span>I wanted to share my experiences coming directly from a Canon EOS R to the Canon EOS R6.  First off, the R is a capable full-frame camera that takes fantastic shots.  The EOS R6 not only takes fantastic shots it does so more consistently than the EOS R did for me.  This is likely due largely to the improved Digic X processor in the R6 versus the Digic 8 in the R.<br/><br/>This camera just nails focus.  Focusing specifically on a person’s eye is remarkably impressive.  Just as an example of how absurdly accurate the eye autofocus is: When I first got the camera I was testing it in my bedroom.  I have a collage that has photo of me and my daughters in the center of it on one side of my bedroom as I sat against the opposite wall.  The picture of me and my daughters within the collage is likely only 4x3 inches large.  Zoomed to 105mm focal length and panning across the wall with that collage coming into frame, it automatically tracked focus on the eye of my daughter who was in the foreground.  This camera had caught focus on eye in a small picture within a collage across the room.  Racking focus between subjects or different objects is also really fast, too.<br/>Additionally impressive is the viewfinder.  The smoother refresh rate option is something that I appreciate immensely.  It just makes tracking the framing that much easier, especially with quick movements.  And I was slightly concerned about going from a 3.2 inch LCD screen on the R to the 3 inch LCD on the back of the R6, but after making the switch and even briefly comparing the two together this worry became a non-issue.<br/><br/>The body is a nice improvement.  The build quality seems relatively the same; however the button placement on the R6 seems largely more intuitive than on the R.  Don’t get me started on the Touch Bar on the EOS R.  I REALLY wanted to like it, trying time after time after time to make it useful in my workflow, but it just wasn’t useful and occasionally a hindrance because of accidental touches.  Having that replaced with the standard joystick and the different positions of the buttons is a welcome change.  Also, having the scroll wheel instead of the direction pad on the back is a lot more intuitive, especially for those who are accustom to that of the 5D mk IV and other cameras with the scroll wheel.<br/><br/>Having uncropped (nearly) 4K video on the R6 versus the 1.7x crop for 4K on the R is a welcome change, although this doesn’t affect me as much since I do mostly still photography.  However, when using the camera a little bit for video, this has been an appreciated difference.<br/><br/>Another appreciated difference is the faster shutter speed of the R6.  Being able to take 12 shots per second (with the mechanical shutter) AND while nailing focus saved me a lot of headache when I shot at an event in the evening last weekend.  I just couldn’t do that with the R prior.  Being able to do 20fps in electronic mode is a nice feature, however for my personal use, I am not sure this will be used all that much.<br/><br/>Speaking of the evening event, the low light capability of this camera is exceptional.  Truly.  At said night event, I was shooting at ISO 8000-12800 at certain times and the images just came out fantastic.  I had previously tried shooting with the R in a low light situation at ISO 6000 and it just didn’t do nearly as well.  Images sometimes came out blurry or excessively grainy OR blurry AND excessively grainy to the point of nearly being unusable images.  That was not something that I worried about with the R6.  I set ISO, set aperture, set shutter speed and shot.  Nailed focus, and just only had to pay attention to getting the composition right.<br/><br/>Also, having IBIS (in body image stabilization) is really wonderful and just adds extra security knowing I will get sharp images taken.  It also opens up the ability to have non-stabilized lenses without worry of out-of-focus images taken.  Using this body with the new "Nifty 50" (RF 50mm f1.8 STM) which doesn't have IS has helped retain sharp images much more.<br/><br/>So it likely sounds like I am gushing over this camera.  If it does, it is because I am.  The R6 is an amazing camera.  The price premium over the R is well worth it.  I was originally concerned about going from 30MP to 20MP, but after using it for a little while, that worry has quickly dissipated.</span>

<span>Trust me, I would have stayed with Canon FOREVER but I was tired of the subpar 4k video on equally-priced Sony cameras so I had to switch. This Sony camera is AMAZING and I feel silly for not switching sooner!<br/><br/>I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER OR VIDEOGRAPHER, just a female who likes high-quality gear. I will compare it to the Canon Cameras I have returned/sold, rebought and still own (which are all the Canon Rebel Series, Canon 70/80d, Canon EOS 6D Mark II, and Canon M50). These are JUST the highlights of comparison to the Canon Cameras I own with my 9-month experience using this Sony camera.<br/><br/>4k VIDEO DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)<br/>* Actual 4k pixeled file, smooth and crisp.<br/>* Doesn't have image stabilizer, but can fix in FCPX. Need a tripod or gimbal for moving videos.<br/>* Smaller 4k files than any Canon camera I own, faster upload/download and editing time<br/>* No record time limit<br/>* 6k sampling<br/>* Processes video files MUCH faster<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)<br/>* Similar to 80d/Mark II<br/>* Option to plug the battery directly into the wall for continuous power. Need to buy this plug separately.<br/>* Can charge camera as you use it too<br/><br/>AUTO-FOCUS DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)<br/>* Faster autofocus but not perfect for video (still quicker than Canon)<br/>* Super fast autofocus for images<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY DIFFERENCES over Canon (all Rebels, 70D, 80d, 6D Mark II, M50)<br/>* Useable audio, much better than Canon PERIOD. (still would use external mic but a great back-up audio option)<br/><br/>Obviously, there is A LOT more great features than this but these were the most important ones for me (coming from Canon). The camera does not have any heating issues, haven't had it shut off on me yet in 9 months of using it. I didn't have an issue with the shoe being on top, as I hardly used a gimbal (some didn't like that). Also, the colors are nice, perfect for my skin tone (not too blue) and I prefer it over the Canon. I know I probably may change my mind as Canon releases its newer models but for now, I'm very pleased with this Sony. GO SONY!!!!!!! I hope this somewhat helps you :)</span>

<span>I don’t like the lack of weather sealing and built-in viewfinder, otherwise it is a great camera.<br/><br/>Edit after 8 months of use: I still like the camera a lot. I think it was the right choice for me.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Speed: It is a fast camera. I don't think this is an obvious choice for action and bird photography, but it is definitely a capable crop-sensor camera compared to alternatives (as of 2020).<br/><br/>Auto-focus: Reasonably fast and very accurate.<br/><br/>Image resolution: 32.5mp is more than enough, especially given the sensor size.<br/><br/>Ergonomics: It is comfortable and small. It has three dials, you can use one for shutter-speed, one of aperture and one for exposure compensation (or ISO). It is fun and convenient to use in the manual mode. I also like the custom modes. I don't use back-button focusing much, but it is easy to set-up if you need.<br/><br/>EF lenses: You can easily adapt older and cheaper EF and EF-S lenses with an adapter. There are many options for adapters starting from around $50. I got the official Canon adapter at a discount for less than $100. I tried Canon EF 50mm STM,  EF-S 55-250mm STM and couple of Sigma DG lenses. They are all excellent, no problems in focusing and no reduction in the image quality. Especially the cheap and lightweight EF-S 55-250 STM works great (but, I cannot recommend the IS II version).<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The viewfinder: The lack of built-in viewfinder is really inconvenient because the add-on viewfinder sticks out from the camera and makes it impossible to put it in a case. Taking the viewfinder out each time and storing it separately is a big hassle. I also tend to hit it to tree branches accidentally as I hike, and worried that it will be broken at some point. However, since it sticks out, you can use your left eye at the same time while tracking, which is a big advantage for action photography.<br/><br/>No weather-sealing: I wish it was weather-sealed, but this given the price point I don't expect this advanced feature.<br/><br/>No in-body-image-stabilization: Again, something I wish it had, but no Canon camera has this feature except the most recent R5 and R6 models (as of August 2020).<br/><br/>No RF lens compatibility: The M lenses still don't have a good selection. It is impossible to adapt the most recent RF lenses due to physical limitations. There will never be a proper RF to M adapter. So if you switch to a full-frame Canon in the future, you will not be able to use your old lenses, unless you buy only EF lenses.</span>

<span>Very powerful camera for its price point, but buyer beware. Canon is no longer making new Ef-m lenses for the camera, so this is an end of line product. You can buy an ef adapter and have access to a lot of good ef and ef-s lenses, but then you adding weight and length to every lens you buy.<br/><br/>Also don't buy this camera for the 4k video. It works, but tends to be soft.  Due to how the camera works, it records at a lower resolution, then uprezes the video, creating a soft video that's not truly 4k.</span>

<span>Love it for all types of photography.  Touchscreen, menus, and physical controls are all fantastic.  It is very light and compact.  Maybe not the best camera for very large hands.  The autofocus &amp; crazy fast fps rate are great.  To me, the ISO becomes pretty noisy beyond 1600.  It is a 32MP crop sensor (1.6x).  Understand that before you purchase.  Also understand there is no weather sealing or built in image stabilization.  Haven't done much video, but it shoots every HD spec &amp; 4k beautifully, albeit with a 30 min time limit per clip.  The EVF is a definite must for photographers.  It is clear and customizable. There is not a great lens selection for the EF-M mount, but if you are looking to get into photography or vlogging, there is enough.  There is an adapter for Canon EF &amp; EF-S mount lenses if you currently own them.  This camera inspires me to go out and shoot because it is versatile, compact, and user friendly.  Love it.</span>

<span>I've had several M-series cameras, this one has much faster auto focus and better light sensitivity then the predecessors. I have tried telephoto with the 50-200mm lens, but the pictures aren't sharp, perhaps it's the lens or it really requires a tripod even in bright light. It's decent for macro work, I'm using the 22mm for that.  I've taken some nice landscapes with a Rokinon 8mm and I've got a 12mm Rokinon on the way to do a little astro photog.<br/>I've decided I'm not a huge fan of not having a real view finder and the zoom in on the screen is limited so fine focus can be a bit of an issue at times. I got the silver-top model and was a bit disappointed that it's not metal.</span>

<span>I'm no professional by any means, and also never used any previous Panasonic cameras.  This caught my attention as it seems to be the smallest and cheapest thing to do amazing 4k 60 video.  The fact that it also doubles as an excellent still photo camera really helped justify the price as I can effectively sell my Canon camcorder and old DSLR.  Been playing with the GH5 for about two weeks now and it seems to do everything I'd like out of a camcorder and DSLR, in fact it easily outperforms them both.  No longer do I have to decide if I want to record video, or take still photos, can do either or both with amazing results.<br/><br/>This camera has a lot of features, and has well more auto focus features than I am use to.  I like the flexibility of the auto focus settings, seems very precise when you want it to be.<br/><br/>Pairing this with the new Leica 12-60mm lens I seem to have spoiled myself.  Panasonic has made a great camera here.</span>

<span>I will update this review as time goes on. At this point I have only experimented with the camera for several hours, but I already have enough information to form a solid foundation for a review (I have also used the GH4 for a few years).<br/><br/>  I run a small video production company, and for years I have used the GH4 for capturing high quality video. The problem is that every video shoot also requires several high quality/professional photographs. While the GH4 excelled in capturing video as a true camera it always came up short. As a result, I was always forced to lug my Nikon D750 around with me. I would travel with two cameras, and two sets of lenses. Occasionally,  I would substitute the Nikon for my Fujix100T or I would substitute the GH4 for my Osmo Pro (recently it has been more of the later).<br/><br/>  What I need... want... would love .... is camera to do all of it.  I guess I could invest in the FF Sony, but the idea of investing in a 3rd set of lenses doesn't exactly excite me.  At some point.... either the video on the Olympus will come up... or the photo stills on the Panasonic will improve...right?  Based on my tests - I think the GH5 will become my Holy Grail of cameras. I have 0% doubt that it will perform for video (and my the couple of tests I have run look very favorable), but my worry was IQ.  The new 20.3MP resolution has me hopeful that the GH5 will become my one camera for all purposes.<br/><br/>  Photos - Again - I will update this as time goes on<br/><br/>  - The upgraded sensor seems to make a large difference.In the photos I attached the 1st picture was taken at ISO 400 while the rest were at ISO 1600. Frankly, I always got nervous taking my GH4 above ISO 800 the noise and grain really started to become noticeable. The GH5 looks very usable at ISO 1600 ( I need to check ISO 3200 a little closer).  For full disclosure the ISO 1600 shots were taken with the Panasonic Leica f1.2 42.5mm gem of a lens.<br/><br/>  This is a good point for a tangent,. The reason why i like the MFT format (in addition to the cameras being physically smaller) there are some very excellent lenses out there.  I would stack the Olymous Zuiko lenses up against the branded Nikon lenses any day of the week. In addition, ignoring the difference in focal length my Panasonic/Leica f1.2 42.5 rivals my Otus f1.4 55mm for my Nikon (plus it has vibration reduction AND autofocus - eat your heart out Sigma). These high quality lenses are smaller and cost less than their full frame rivals to boot. Now there are some poor lenses too, but if you are willing to pay a little more I have found all of the Panny/Leica and Olympus Zuiko lenses to be very, very good.<br/><br/>Other notes -<br/><br/>  - If you shoot in RAW and use Lightroom you will have to update to 6.9.<br/><br/> -  The autofocus really is improved. It is very fast on the point.<br/><br/>- Has the ability to do focus stacking - I haven't tried this yet - but it is a very interesting function.<br/><br/> - Shooting manual is a breeze - I am not sure why Nikon can't copy Panasonic's focus peaking, but if they could... they should.  I mentioned I owned the Otus f1.4 55mm.... that lenses would be soooooo much more useful if Nikon offered a similar type of focus peaking.<br/><br/>- Low light performance - others may disagree, but I do think that it is better than the GH4. I have very good stills at ISO 1600. However, this might be a counter-intuitive since Panasonic is using the same sized sensor but increasing the resolution.  In order for the camera to have better low light performance and higher resolution would require either significantly better algorithms and/or improvements on the actual sensor gathers the light.<br/><br/> - Button placement and layout are still very solid. it is easy to navigate WB and ISO settings without moving your eyes (much more difficult on my Nikon D750).<br/><br/>- No built in flash. Honestly, I can not remember the last time I used a built in flash.<br/><br/>- The camera is not too much larger than the GH4, but it is noticeably heavier.  This camera is dense, and while it still has an advantage over my full frame it's losing ground here.<br/><br/>Video-<br/><br/>  - My early footage is excellent. The continuous autofocus is improved (although I do need to run a lot more tests on this one). I loved shooting footage with my GH4, but I usually filmed in manual focus. I never fully trusted the GH4 autofocus - it seemed to spend too much time searching.<br/><br/>- The ability to shoot at 180 FPS (you have first select a variable frame rate to get into this menu).<br/><br/>-  Out of the box it will allow you to record 10 bit straight to SD card (I recommend the new high transfer rate cards).<br/><br/>- Image stability - I am very excited for the improvements - but I definitely need to do a lot of testing to see how it really performs.<br/><br/>- In short...  for video the GH5 will do everything that GH4 will do, but it adds the ability to capture 10 bit footage directly to a SD card, offers weather protection, and in-body stabilization<br/><br/>- The screen and viewfinder are excellent.<br/><br/>Final Verdict - Again, I will have to update this review - there is MUCH still to be covered (especially for video). However, the early results are very promising and I do believe that Panasonic has made a significant improvement in IQ over the GH4. I may be naive, but I just ASSUMED it would be great for video (minor improvements in the GH4 would have helped maintain its status). The GH5 is roughly double the price of the GH4 so you will need to understand if the photo improvements and the upgrades in video are really worth it to you. For me... it is a no-brainer.... and I am optimistic that for now on I will be carrying just one camera with me!<br/><br/>5 Stars</span>

<span>This camera is a powerhouse for the price. Full disclosure, my first camera was a Panasonic SD camcorder back in 2005, then switched to a Canon Pro camcorder in 2009, then jumped on the Panasonic train again with the GH3 and was using them until I picked up the GH5.<br/><br/>The image is amazing, but that's not news. What is news - and hopefully will not be overlooked - is how much this camera is amazing to use. Custom buttons. Focus peaking (so amazing when shooting at f1.4 to f0.95 when you're changing focus during a shot). Image stabilization (I shot my last wedding 90% handheld with non IS lenses and the footage is gorgeous.) This camera fixes all the frustrations I had with the GH3 (which really were lack of stabilization and lack of focus peaking) and upgrades the image amazingly.<br/><br/>With weddings I typically don't even mess with 400mbps, I usually go 150mbps 60p or 24p depending on if I want to slow it down or not, and it's phenomenal.<br/><br/>Coming from the GH3 and Camcorders - the GH5's low light makes me so happy. It isn't legendary compared to other cameras - so I've heard. But I briefly owned an A6500 and used it in low light situations and it fell apart worse than the GH5 does in similar circumstances. (wedding receptions I'm lookin' at you).<br/><br/>For commercial work I'll crank up the bit rate and color depth and it's awesome. This is such a fun camera to use. I love the freedom I had with camcorders to hand-hold and not be tethered to a tripod or monopod for long periods. I still use those tools as I need to, but not always needing them allows me to be much faster and much less conspicuous at weddings (people think I'm a photographer and don't worry about what they're doing as much). The stabilization is better than the A6500's as well. I took that to comic-con last year and didn't love the IBIS.<br/><br/>All to say, as a professional in the wedding and web commercial industries, this is a powerhouse of a camera. Pair it with either a speedbooster and fast glass, or voigtlander 0.95 primes and you're set to create beautiful imagery without the camera getting in the way. (No overheating or other issues that competitors deal with).</span>
