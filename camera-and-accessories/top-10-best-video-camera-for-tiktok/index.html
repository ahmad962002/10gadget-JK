                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I do not know where should I start. First, I have never ever seen a security or surveillance camera which does not have date/time on the recorded/live video. This camera has neither. This is why is not not referred to as a security camera by Blink. They just call it an outdoor camera. This is why it is also so low priced.<br/><br/>Local storage: Since the Blink Sync module is included with this camera, I only needed a good quality USB flash drive for local storage. The recorded video at highest quality is max 4-12MB in size, so even a 8GB flash drive would record for months. The caveat with local storage is that the camera will record ONLY when armed AND movement is detected. That's it. It will not record anything else. This is mentioned clearly in the Blink cloud storage plans. With cloud storage, it can do live recording but only on demand.<br/><br/>Movement sensing: Horrible. Absolutely horrible. The camera setup describes that the camera should NOT be pointed to any moving objects like streets, trees, plants and shrubs, areas with lot of movement etc. Where does that leave us? I mounted it to watch over the car parked on the driveway. Then I masked off the street and trees and everything else. But, the driveway gets lots of sunlight. So, shadows cast by moving cars cause false notification so any times. I tried to reduce sensitivity to 3 but then, randomly, the camera would ignore movement when my wife's car pulls on the driveway. It is a Honda Accord, so not small in size. Now I have to live with so many false notifications. Even in the night, if a car's light shine on my parked car, the camera causes false notification. If any slightest movement is detected, for example, by a shrub swaying in wind, the camera will detect motion and send notification. If running the camera on battery, these false alerts will cause battery to deplete quickly.<br/><br/>A word about zones: The motion detection zones are only rectangular. With Advanced setting, the rectangle size only gets smaller but they are still rectangular, so either I have to mask off everything in the entire rectangle or leave it unmasked. So, if a rectangle covers some part of my car and some part of the street, I have to mask off the car because otherwise the movement on the street triggers a false alarm. Compared to Ring camera, where I can define non-rectangular zones, this is a huge negative. Now, most of my car's rear is masked off to prevent false alerts from the cars on the street. Even if the rectangle covers 99% of car but only 1% of street, it will trigger false alert even on sensitivity set to 3. Major problem.<br/><br/>Recording: The recording starts after camera senses a movement, so there is no pre-movement recording. I have cameras which record 5-10 seconds of pre-movement video so when watching the recording, I can clearly see what triggered the camera. With Blink camera, since recording starts after it detects movement, only first one second of video has the event which triggered the camera. If it is a quickly passing object, almost impossible to figure out what happened. You have to have really sharp eyes to catch that.<br/><br/>Recorded Files: Since there is no date/time stamp on the videos, the only way to see the date/time of recording is by downloading the recorded files. The file name contains the date/time. However, if the USB flash drive is removed and connected to a computer, these files do not have date/time and their creation date is in UTC time. Unless someone carries a UTC to local time converter in their heads, impossible to know the date/time of recording. Absolutely horrible design. The recorded files can be deleted one at a time from the Blink app. This is extremely slow and frustrating process. I tried to remove the USB flash drive and delete the recorded files by connecting it to a laptop, but ran into the issue of UTC timestamp instead of local time.<br/><br/>Speed: This camera is slow, slow, slow. I am guessing that the live video viewing and accessing recorded files passes via Blink cloud, it takes long time to see the live video or access the recordings. After viewing maybe 30 seconds of live video, the app asks me to press the continue button to keep watching. This is a major annoyance.<br/><br/>Live video: The camera does not automatically show live video when the app is launched. It shows a static picture of the monitored area which I took when setting up the camera. So, if the camera is later moved (say it moves during battery change, it will definitely move during battery change and there is no way to position it exactly the same), it would be a good idea to take a new picture and readjust the motion zones. Another major annoyance. So, I purchased a power adapter. Now the camera is powered from the USB and does not require battery change.<br/><br/>Battery operation: There are some settings which Blink recommends for optimal battery life. If left on those settings, the videos recoded with IR on would be so poor quality that you won't be able identify any person. They are grainy and pixelated. Good idea to power it by USB power if possible.<br/><br/>Mounting: Again, plain horrible. It takes a ton of strength to push the camera into the mount but it gets knocked out very easily. When doing setting, if I moved the camera beyond the mount's limit, it would just pop-out and fall off. Then I would have to push it again into the mount and restart the process. Same thing will happen  when the camera needs a battery change. Entire setup and motion zones would need to be setup again.<br/><br/>I only got this camera because it is inconspicuous when mounted on the front. Other cameras are bulky and have a snout protruding out. We do not have much crime in the area, only sporadic, petty car break-ins have been reported in the recent months, so I am keeping this camera. Otherwise, I would have gone in for a more robust, real security camera.</span>

<span>REVIEW UPDATE<br/><br/>We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make.  What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial.  None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity.  My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal.  Nope.  That is wrong.  The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work.  Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.<br/><br/>We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router.  We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras.  As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down.  I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.<br/><br/>Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature.  I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?<br/><br/>It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.<br/><br/>This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product.  Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network.  For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.<br/><br/>As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice.  Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection.  I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site.  I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.<br/><br/>Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.<br/><br/>I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras.  Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal.  I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras.  If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed.  The price of this education is high!<br/><br/>---------<br/>Original review<br/><br/>Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system.  I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.<br/><br/>The base:<br/><br/>The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place.  I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it.  Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying).  Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.<br/><br/>The Sync 2 Module<br/><br/>This is the brains of the system.  Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection.  Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a "what's in the box" on Blinks Amazon page.  So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included.  The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device.  Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady.  Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.<br/><br/>The app (Android)<br/><br/>At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered.  The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network.  I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module.  So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum.  It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender.  Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router.  Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup.  Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again).  This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically).  Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera.  Not entirely what you should have to do.<br/><br/>Batteries:  These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs.  The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries.  In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW).  I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries?  I would err on the side of caution and remove them.<br/><br/>Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions<br/><br/>This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members.  Nope.  You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system).  Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?<br/><br/>So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module.  What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally.  You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage.  Really?  Why?  What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive?  To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.<br/><br/>Yes you do get a "free" trial which unlocks all features.  If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked.  So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud.  Talk about ripping folks off.  Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally.  You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription.  Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions.  Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?<br/><br/>Loading issues with clips and thumbnails.  So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time.  Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud.  Nope.  Thumbnails are hit or miss.  These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app.  I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail.  Full wifi bars too and it still fails.<br/><br/>Alexa:<br/><br/>It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa.  I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them).  In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show).  You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.<br/><br/>Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud.  Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi.  The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.<br/><br/>Conclusion.  The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable.  There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with.  These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.</span>

<span> FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data..  I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨<br/><br/>UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.<br/><br/>The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.<br/>👇😕<br/><br/>This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍<br/><br/>The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.<br/><br/>So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.<br/><br/>Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.<br/><br/>After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐<br/><br/>This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍<br/><br/>UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.<br/><br/>Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.<br/><br/>I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.<br/><br/>Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.<br/><br/>The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍<br/><br/>Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.<br/><br/>Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.</span>

<span>I picked up a two pack of these cameras a while back while they were on sale. I already have Ring cameras around the perimeter of the house but they were quite a bit more expensive and there were a few areas I wanted camera coverage on without paying the high prices for Ring.<br/><br/>Let me tell you these cameras are great quality, coming from the Ring I have noticed that these camera's appear to have a clearer picture on them but not quite the viewing angle of the Ring camera which is fine. They have a battery indicator in the app to show you the battery health and also show you the temperature outside or wherever the cameras are located. They seem to pick up motion rather well and the night vision is about as expected compared to the Ring.<br/><br/>The app that Blink uses is a little more buggy compared to the Ring app but I still found it to work well overall and it can be linked to Amazon to show you the various cameras on your Firestick/Echo device which is a nice feature. Ring adapts a few more features if you have multiple cameras linking them together to capture certain events but if you want a great quality camera for a fraction of the price I recommend going the route of Blink.<br/><br/>They have a sync module which you can add a small thumb drive on for onboard storage from motion or live clips if you don't want to pay for a monthly subscription. Otherwise the monthly subscription packages cover single or multiple cameras (Depending on which one you choose) and you can have cloud storage of video events for a certain period of time.<br/><br/>I have even opted to get the Blink doorbell over the Ring doorbell mainly because of the price and others have said the quality is just as good if not better. Blink is a great product at a fraction of the price of other competitors.</span>

<span>This is my second GoPro - my first having been something I owned several years ago. This is a SIGNIFICANT upgrade from that in almost every way, except one. But before I go into that, let me explain what I LOVE about the HERO 11...<br/><br/>1. The video quality is AMAZING. So good! GoPro has been doing action cameras for a long time and frankly speaking, they STILL do it better than anyone else does...period. The HERO 11 has crystal clear image quality and colors are vibrant, sharp and life-like. It's downright impressive.<br/><br/>2. The stabilization is superb. This is another area where the HERO has received a significant upgrade. This little camera CAN AND WILL take anything you throw at it, and it will give you a beautiful, stable image from it.<br/><br/>3. It's lightweight. Coming in at just under 5.5 ounces, it's not going to get in the way of anything you want to do.<br/><br/>4. Despite being a lightweight, the quality and craftsmanship is something you can feel. This is a high end camera - and it shows, and you can feel it, too.<br/><br/>5. It has multiple shooting modes so you have great options on getting perfect shots.<br/><br/>6. The audio quality is also significantly better on the HERO 11 than on previous models.<br/><br/>And now, the one and only problem with this that I have found. It gets HOT - to the point it overheats. THAT'S a problem, especially if you are using it for a while. And then of course, when this happens, it shuts off, as most high tech devices do these days. Not sure why this wouldn't have been caught on beta testing (which I assume GoPro would do) but this is a significant issue. I only took one star off because the camera is so, SO good otherwise...but hopefully this issue is addressed because I hate for it to take away from what is otherwise a SUPERB action camera.</span>

<span>This is my first time I have ever owned a GoPro. I have rented them and owned a couple knockoffs. The knockoffs have nowhere near what this GoPro has. The GoPro 11 I received was not part of a bundle and only includes the camera, case, adhesive mount and mounting buckle.<br/><br/>Out of the box, it is pretty basic. The camera itself weighs 5.4 ounces. It feels heavier, but it feels premium. Opening up the battery hatch is a little bit of a pain. You will grab it at the notch and pull it out and it is pretty tight, so if you have nails you care about, please take caution. You will find the battery, SD card slot and USB-C connection in there.<br/><br/>Now, to where this GoPro shines. Where it shines brightest in is the video quality. There is not another action camera that I have found that produce the high quality images that this camera can. Color and image quality are paramount. The image stabilization is phenomenal. A bumpy road feels like the flatlands when filming live. My hands are not the steadiest and I have never seen a camera truly compensate for that like this one. The built-in audio is good and better than older versions and way better than any knockoff.<br/><br/>I wish there was a bit easier way to upload videos without having the GoPro subscription service, but it is not terrible to do this manually.<br/><br/>Also, you have seen others talk about it overheating at 4K/60fps and they are spot on with that assessment. This does overheat and is something GoPro should have worked on more before the release. This had to be a known issue. It gets very hot and while mine has not shut off, I can see how easily the unit would shut off when feeling like it is on fire.<br/><br/>One complaint I have from GoPro is can you include a SD Card with your purchase. This is not an inexpensive item and a SD card is a very low cost item that could be easily included because you cannot use the camera at all without an SD Card.<br/><br/>Do you need this latest and greatest GoPro if you have an older model? More than likely you do not. There are not a gargantuan amount of improvements to make you hit the order button immediately. Plus, your batteries and other accessories would work with the 11.</span>

<span>By now there are a number of review sites on social media showing off all the fancy new features the GoPro HERO11 has.  I think overall these assessments are accurate.  The GoPro 11 certainly has a number of great shooting modes. The 8:7 aspect ratio is very nice. The horizon lock feature works as advertised. Very happy with the functionality and overall customization options available.<br/><br/>The GoPro Quik works, but there are ads to upgrade to cloud storage/backup. After setting up your GoPro, the app will detect and recognize your unit every time you start the app afterwards, but it takes about 10-15 seconds to actually connect and see what the GoPro sees in the app.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the GoPro 11 overheats quickly.  At room temperature (~77DegF), the GoPro 11 shuts down in a little over 20 min when shooting in 4K 60 fps. It doesn't seem to matter if you step down to 1080 HD. Removing the battery/door and then powering the unit solely by USB power, improved the record time to about 25.5 minutes. Recognizing that tradeoffs have to be made in order for the GoPro to be waterproof and environmentally sealed, it still would have been nice if the GoPro Devs could make the camera last to the 30-minute mark with a battery installed.</span>

<span>I got this to check on my cats when I'm not home. It has great night vision and is simple to arm or disarm the motion sensor. I have two kittens (an orange girl and a black tortie girl) and a senior cat (maine coon mix) and I worry about them getting along or getting into things they shouldn't. To my surprise, I caught my older boy grooming the orange girl which he never does when I'm in the room! You can also use a mic on the camera and it's pretty loud (I can hear it very clearly from the next room). On the night vision, the contrast can be affected if a lighter object is really close, such as an orange cat putting their face right in front of the camera - everything else will appear very dark. My black tortie can be hard to spot with night vision so I really love the glowing eye effect on the cats and I can usually find her after speaking into the mic and she looks up, plus the glow makes them look like they have big googly eyes.<br/><br/>If I need to spy on my cats in more spots, I will definitely order another set!</span>

<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<span>My review is for the customer service. Yes- the cameras are a great deal and quality for the price. I have indoor cameras, but I have them facing out towards the outdoors. A few weeks ago, there was a murder. Trying to help the police, I knew my cameras caught it all so I went to review and could not log onto my account. I realized that my old phone was connected, not my new phone number. Long story short, it was a mess to get my number updated. Having said that, the Blink team members Dane and Dominic came through for me and are heros. They got me logged in, I was then able to locate the sickening event, all of it. I sent the evidence to the police this evening and will have to play the waiting game to see if there’s anything else I can do. What happens was truly tragic, but the images were clear, the night vision was crisp and the cameras detected every move. Please extend my gratitude to these two team members.</span>

<span>Bought these to replace my canary cameras due to them moving everything under a subscription. So im using these with the sync 2. Quality is pretty good but grainy when zoomed in and they don't seem to connect to the 5 network. only the 2.4. App is pretty basic and the login gets stuck sometimes making it so I have to close the pap out and reopen. This is for android. What really stinks is the app doesnt have a gps feature to auto arm and disarm when you leave/com home but you can work something out using IFTTT but it really should be built in. YEs you can schedule times to arm and disarm but that isnt too convenient when you don't have set times that you leave and if they are armed when you are home the notifications just pile in.</span>

<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>Update: the video quality is so much better than the original Mevo.  Some helpful hints if you have a large auditorium and you want to zoom in this is not the camera for you.  We stream to FB and YouTube live.  We only have 22 YouTube subscribers for our channel.  So in order to go live on multiple platforms you need another software to do that.  We use Vimeo.  To go live on YouTube you must use the RTMP button on Mevo.  Set up your stream on YouTube Studio and get your URL and streaming key to paste into Mevo.  Great thing is the Mevo will save it and YouTube doesn’t change it for a new stream when you reuse your settings.  Once everything is programmed into the Mevo it gets much easier to go live.  Again the video quality with the Mevo Start is so much better than the Mevo Plus.  We spent about $800 for the original and this was only $399.  You get your monies worth if you can leverage all its features.  Also if you are being asked for constant firmware updates which Mevo are you using and is your app updated.<br/><br/>Our church has been using the first generation Mevo for over three years.  We didn’t realize how outdated our Mevo camera was.  The video streaming began to get worse and we kept losing signal and the audio was terrible.  I went looking for another camera but Mevo still came up in the top.  I looked at the specs of the Mevo Start and realized how outdated our original Mevo was.  Today we streamed our service for the first time using Mevo Start and people complemented our video on how clear it was.  We had no audio issues or dropped internet.  We also didn’t have to plug it in since we stream for about 2 hours.  We always liked Mevo and they have made streaming affordable for our church.  This Mevo Start addressed most of our issues with the first Mevo we had.  Also the price has gone down from what we paid for the original Mevo.  It is worth the price.  It does so much more than just record video.  I love the app also.</span>

<span>The Mevo Start is a great camera for live streaming or for recording.  It is good for those getting started in streaming.  It is reasonably priced and has a lot of great features.  You can live stream to most any service.  The camera can be connected via Wi-Fi or with Ethernet (requires a separate adapter).  Wi-Fi works well if you have good access points and signals.  Streaming quality will depend on your upload speeds.  Recording are saved directly to the camera but you will need get a micro-SD card as it does not come with one, but those are so affordable.  You will need an Android or iOS tablet or phone to work with the camera.  There is an app that controls and configures the camera.<br/>There is a built in microphone that works well.  You can also alternatively connect an external sound source to the Aux 3.5 mm jack.  It is configurable for Mic level input or Line level input (like sound board).  There are level controls for audio within the app.  It fits on most any tripod (standard 1/4 screw).  I found battery life to be 4-5 hours which should be good in most cases.  There is a USB-C connector on the camera that can be used for external power or ethernet adapter.  Indicator LED on the front of the camera tells you the connection status and I believe can also act as a Tally light.<br/>One of the nice features is digital zoom.  You can view what the camera sees from within the app.  The app also lets you zoom the camera view in and out.  You can also move a zoomed box around with the full field of the camera, so it almost like having PTZ.  The video feed is quite good and there are settings for things like low lighting and outdoor.<br/>Camera looks and feels well built.  There is no lens cover so you might want to get a case for it.<br/>The camera can also be configured as an NDI source and it works great with OBS, zoom and all.<br/>Good starter and can still be used in more advanced setups (like OBS).  Keep in mind that the app can only be used with one camera at a time (you can move back and forth between cameras).  A multi-cam app is being developed and is currently in Beta at this time.</span>

<span>My husband and I relocated to Michigan this past spring and it didn’t take long to realize that my I Phone11 camera was woefully  inadequate when it came to capturing the beauty of the Upper Peninsula! I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!<br/>There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers! It was worth every penny!</span>

<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>I bought this to use when I don't want to use my laptop camera for meetings.  It's got nice quality for both picture and microphone.  It didn't want to work consistently when I hooked it up to the docking station.  I have to plug it directly into the laptop to get it to work best.  A few times it wouldn't turn on. I simply unplug it, wait 10 seconds and plug in again.  That's been a little annoying but only happened a few times.  For the amount I use it, it's not super horrible. Just be aware.</span>

<span>With my eMeet webcam, I look really far away, entered in a very wide-angle shot (no, people don't need to see that much of my house or whatever background I choose!). Even if I move the camera 8 inches away from my face, I still don't take up much of the screen. No one else I communicate with looks this far away when we're talking. I don't get it -- especially since I see screenshots in the reviews from people who fill their screens like you'd expect to with a webcam, and because my husband has the same camera, bought a year earlier, and he looks normally sized on screen. Another reviewer said the camera fine if you want a wide view of a conference room or want to show several people at a table. But for one person, I just look goofy. The camera is plug-and-play and easy to use, but since you can't adjust how tiny you look on screen, it's just a no-go for me. I'm going to buy something different.</span>

<span>I had a dumb motion sensor flood light wired to the corner of my garage that never worked that great, and sometime in the last year the bulbs burned out, and while I was being lazy about replacing them, I started checking into a smarter replacement. There are a number of options that seemed pretty good, but this product from Wyze stood out as being more affordable than a lot of the other options, and I've had good experiences with Wyze products in the past as well. I'm glad I pulled the trigger. The installation was straightforward (fairly intuitive, but good instructions as well as a helpful hanger accessory included in the box to help during the wiring process). The only issue I had was that the unit came with the wire connecting the camera to the unit connected, but not fully plugged in. This was not obvious, and for a while it just looked like I had a DOA camera. It took a few minutes of messing around before I figured that out (the plug is pretty snug, given that it needs to be protected from the elements outside), and once I did it was all good. The coverage of both the motion sensor and camera are really good, video quality is excellent, and the versatility of the product (i.e. you don't have to use their cloud service for this to be a useful product, but they're also actively working on features for that service that make it worthwhile for people) makes me glad I went with this option.</span>

<span> EDIT: I uploaded a video of the camera's sound quality in action, so if you view the video turn on your sound BUT KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN (initially). No need for bleeding ears.<br/><br/>During the Wyze portions of the video I was sitting roughly 20 feet away and six feet below the camera; There should be no feedback at that distance.<br/><br/>During the iPhone portion (where I filmed the same space as the one the V3 is normally set up to film) I was roughly six feet away and six feet below the camera. The point was to capture the same sounds in the same room.<br/><br/>All the videos were taken very early in the morning, with no traffic or human noise outside, and with what I'd call regular ambient interior noise (the humming of appliances, the running of a computer in the vicinity, etc). No other people were present to make noise inside.<br/><br/>The first portion of the video is the sound that the V3 produces when I am viewing the live feed. It was screen-captured with my iPhone.<br/><br/>The second portion is a comparison demonstrating the sound my iPhone picks up in the same general space, at the same general time, in the exact same conditions, and with the exact same ambient noise in the background as in the first portion; This is not to show how much better the iPhone's mic is than the Wyze (obviously it's better) but to give you an idea as to what noise and sounds were actually present in the room while I was viewing the V3's live feed of the same room, and capturing it with my phone camera.<br/><br/>The third portion is the same space with the same ambient noise, plus conversation from the television that is eight feet from the V3. I chose a scene that sounds a lot like regular conversation, set it to conversation volume, and it has some light score that comes in at the end.<br/><br/>The final portion is what my iPhone picked up in the same space during the same time and conditions, and while playing the exact same scene/conversation on the TV at the same volume as while capturing it on the V3. If you listen VERY carefully you MIGHT be able to pick up a word or two in the V3's video that you can compare to the iPhone's. Maybe. It took me three tries. Hint: listen for the word "Garrett".  Hope the video helps you make a more informed purchasing decision!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Picture is ok. Night vision/low light is very good. Motion detection is spot-on. The camera looks good, design-wise.<br/><br/>Why the one star?<br/><br/>Because that's where the good ends.<br/><br/>The problem is the mic/sound quality is appalling bad. That's such an old, tried-and-true tech I have no idea how they managed to bungle it so much, but managed they did.<br/><br/>Maybe they are using the very cheapest, most absolute garbage quality components on the face of the earth, which sucks, because better components don't cost that much, especially wholesale. They're just squeezing every penny out of profit and selling garbage wrapped up and promoted as quality.<br/><br/>Frustrating.<br/><br/>So, what sound does it pick up?<br/><br/>From what I've read online there are various audio manifestations/issues ranging from nearly no sound at all, all the way to my problem, which is the sound picked up becomes a garbled, distorted, feed-backed  jumble of sometimes jarring noises that maybe sort-of could be interpreted as words (in the case of people taking) but nearly nothing's decipherable by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Pet noises, like barks, meows, growls, etc. are literally non-existent. If it picks it up at all it's just converted to "noise".<br/><br/>All other sound is just as bad. Sometimes there's these random-seeming staticky "bangs" every once in a while. Who knows what that is.<br/><br/>I hate it.<br/><br/>You hear that developers?<br/><br/>I. Hate. This. Camera.<br/><br/>And I wish I didn't because otherwise I like so much about it.<br/><br/>But, alas,  I need sound so I am able to use the function where you talk to someone through the camera and hear them when they respond. I also need to be able to hear what's going on with my pets.<br/><br/>I need to be able to hear when the camera's motion-detection is tripped and the cause of the trip has moved out of the line of the camera but is still out there rustling and bumping around, or otherwise making noise out on my porch and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>If I had children I wouldn't be able to hear them, or speak to them through the camera. or hear when one is crying.<br/><br/>So, be forewarned, if any of the above is one of your needs/goals you probably won't be able to do that with this camera. Buy elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's incredibly stupid they didn't fix this problem before releasing the V3. A lot of people online report the V2 being awful as well, so the developers knew. That means you shouldn't put off buying one for when the next gen comes out (whenever that is). They probably won't fix it.<br/><br/>The worst part, I think, is it doesn't support the use of an external mic, which would be such an easy solve. There's no input port and the simple hardware and software to support that, and that really is stupid AF. If it did allow the connecting of an external mic all I'd have to do is plug one in and I would have the sound I need. At least then I wouldn't be writing this scathing review. It would be a win-win for everyone!<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>Finally, apparently contacting customer support is a total waste of time, and the people you talk to (bless their hearts, it isn't really their fault) have no tech experience or understanding whatsoever of how these things work. I don't know about you, but I find that exhausting. If one were to spend the time necessary to troubleshoot all the garbage products we wind up with one would never have time to do anything else, and even with that effort 95% of the time it results in no improvement, and no resolution. I'm tired of it. Just make a solid product, and when something goes wrong, replace it or refund the money, don't make anyone jump through hoops.<br/><br/>Finally, fix the issue, fast. And don't repeat it in the next iteration.<br/><br/>Long and the short of it is I need a camera with a functioning mic and/or that has an input for an external mic. The end. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even at the price-point these cameras are at.<br/><br/>I regret buying these, as now they're going to be tossed after I buy another brand (according to message boards even cheapo Chinese no-name brands have a better mic than these things!). What a waste of time, money, and resources.</span>

<span>The Wyze team are killing it with this one.  Their low cost products have always been a good draw.  My prior Wyze camera was the pan camera - good price for one that I could make spin around and look up and down.  I bought two v3 to get my side yards.<br/><br/>My primary cameras are nest...traditionally seemed to be the top of the line for this new generation of cloud based IP cameras - highest quality but highest cost.  But at least with the nest app I felt I was getting what i paid for.  Now those guys at Google made their new cameras not work with their own nest app, only the Google Home, which is crazy to me.  The Google Home currently doesn't let you see the *entire* 24 hour history within your subscription time frame, which was always a key distinguisher from Ring and other IP cameras - only highlights!  I had ordered a 2 pack of their new cameras  on Prime Day but then did some more reading and found out about the lack of nest app support, and found my existing nest cams could not access more than highlights/alerts in Google Home app, and decided that was just not going to be good enough.  I want to be able to look through the entire feed in case an alert didn't catch everything.<br/><br/>Then I decided to look at Wyze - I'd read their emails and was interested in their skylight night color and decided I would 'try' their $35 camera instead of the nest $120 camera.  After all, the new v3 is outdoor rated, has great night vision and has a lower cost, can install SD cards for onboard extended feed coverage (not just alerts) and I'm already using the Wyze app for my two pan cameras so I'm already in the ecosystem in my Google Home.  So I ordered 2 Wyze v3 cameras.<br/><br/>Installation - First, even the box is small...reminded me of the Blink camera size.  I ordered SD cards for the v3 cams to give me that very long look-back ability (very cheap for the sizes needed).  When I went to install I realized the USB cable/power line was thin - and I was able to run it inside my window track so as to NOT DRILL into my siding (because lets face it, eventually i may change to something different and who wants to put holes in their siding).  Unfortunately I did have to poke the cable through the screen b/c my screen didn't slide up/down.  Like I said, the camera is very small and light, so when I mounted I only needed one small screw (provided with kit) to hold it in place.  There was a magnet ring around screw area, and that could have helped with the mount, but I didn't use it.  The camera has left right and up down hinges so I was able to point it in the place I wanted to.<br/><br/>Performance - I am happy with the camera's performance.  Its 1080p.  One camera is on side with street light, and that area stays color lit with the starlight feature and yes can see pretty well.  The other camera is in more shaded part and uses the gray IR feed, and yes I can see what's going on there pretty well.  Unfortunately I don't think any of these cameras can "zoom" in and really see someone's face or a license plate, but that's just a limit they all have if you don't have a mechanical zoom presumably like the traditional fully wired camera security systems.  But I'd say the picture quality is on par with my $350 nest outdoor v2 IQ camera.  I haven't tried the higher level wyze plans with their version of person recognition, so can't comment on the facial recognition aspect, but I'm totally fine with losing that one feature when everything else has the $35 camera totally pacing the $350 camera.  What a value difference and its crazy the quality you get for this price point.  Wyze is really a super top level choice in the budget to mid-level home camera market.  Extremely happy.</span>

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<span>When I purchased this HC-V180K  camcorder, it was to be used mainly for a dash or window mounted camera, occasionally for travel use.<br/><br/>I considered buying a GoPro type action cam or a cheap  dash cam as well.  But, I decided on a  HC-V180K as a versatile all in one photo/video/dash camera that stayed within my $200 budget.<br/><br/>As a car cam, it works well with a wide field of vision at 1 zoom.  There are settings that let you choose between file types and resolution if you want to keep files smaller and allow more recording time.<br/><br/>Functions are controlled by a combination of touch screen and buttons, and I found them to be pretty intuitive.<br/>The one con if you will is that if you are intending to use this to record sports or anything where there are fast moving objects you are trying to track, you should spend the extra money for model with a viewfinder.  The zoom lens does allow you to pull in distant objects, but it's nearly impossible to track anything with a small LCD screen.  That is not really a fault of this model, just something to be aware of.</span>

<span>The zoom on this thing is pretty incredible. You can fill the frame with a full moon and see all the craters, etc quite clearly. It's a cheap camera, so the image quality isn't the greatest, but if you're not shooting for a paying client or important project, it'll do. Mine crapped out after a month. It developed a vertical black band left side of frame. No idea what caused it (software?) but return/refunded no problem.</span>

<span>I use this camera to record two to three high school football games a week and do highlights for the team. I love the zoom and the picture quality is fantastic (day or night). The still photos are great when you are in photo mode, but I was disappointed nothing or low quality, small size, out of focus and fuzzy if you take any photos on video mode. I was hoping to be able to get action shots while filming. But I think the photos will be great when I zoom in on far off mountains etc when I get back up to the hills.<br/>I love the fact that you can film in 1080p 60fps MP4 format. This way I don't have to convert MTS files before posting online. But these files are 28Mbps, so they are rather large compared to my old camera. You can record in 720p or 360p I prefer better quality. You can also record in near 4K with MTS files.<br/>10 or 15 years ago you could get a camcorder with a viewfinder and maybe a my hookup and flash in this price range. But not anymore.</span>

<span>The video quality on this camera is great in the day and it's decent in low light. The camera (picture) quality is not good but its it's not the worst by far. Still have to remember it's a camcorder so it's not expected to be the best in picture mode. It's pretty small, at least for my hands, which is good for carrying in pockets but it sometimes would feel strange trying to hold with the strap around my hand. Took me a few hours to realize how to switch from seeing pictures and videos, which I'm sure they explained in the manual that I did not read. The zoom is awesome though and for the most part it's very steady, of course, until you reach past 60x and enter digital zoom. The touch screen could be a lot better and is kind of tricky if you have medium to large hands but it is still manageable. Overall I will give this 4 stars because I got it for my wedding and I know the church has low light and the videos were very nice but not professional so dont think it's going to be crystal clear. But I enjoyed it and watch it often. There is no mount in case anyone is wondering. There is no flash either. I'm only mentioning that for the ones wondering about it. I like this Panasonic camcorder though and is deciding if I want a camera from them, Nikon, or Sony around $500 so if anyone reading this have a suggestion, including Panasonic, which would tell me why I should choose them, let me know what you think. HAVE A NICE DAY</span>

<span>First off, the camera produces beautiful image quality in both 4K and FHD. The compact size and features makes it perfect for on-the-go setups where you need to grab a camera and shoot with little setup time. I think with the increase in online streaming for especially house of worship this camera will fit into many single camera setups. I bought it for the compact size, the SDI output and the hope that the low light capability will work in the environment I shoot most of the time (inside a building with not so great lighting).<br/><br/>I give the camera 4 stars because it is compact and packed with features. It fit the bill for two of my setup needs but the part that did not work so well is the low light capability part... the low light capability is really bad. If you will use in a place where you cannot control lighting and lighting is not ideal then you may end up with dark images or grainy if you increase gain to compensate.<br/><br/>Otherwise if you are shooting in really bright settings like outdoors or a controlled environment where you can control lighting then this will fit in perfectly. Consider what is important to you and your setup and where you need to compromise before buying. Unfortunately I returned and went with Sony PXW-Z90V. For a few dollars more you get amazing low light capability with all the same features.</span>

<span>As other reviews said, the low light performance is not the best... But I did not get this camera to film night-time cave-diving.  I mostly got this camera for the impressive zoom and the unmatched stabilization.  I plan to use it for making travel videos and other scenarios that will tend to have plenty of light.  In that regards, the built in ND filter is absolutely essential and has already helped me adjust for shots that would normally be overexposed.  Battery life is also the best I've ever seen on a camcorder.<br/><br/>Other reviews have mentioned bad coloring or unbearable noise when using mic input.  My unit has no such issues with colors not displaying correctly.  It does have very minor mic noise on input, though it does not seem to be at the same unusable level others have stated.  Any audio I capture will most likely have noise removal done during editing, so I do not see this as an issue.  The built in mic has absolutely no noise whatsoever and is actually very good.<br/><br/>Full auto mode is pretty decent at getting shots, but this camera really shines in manual mode.  Limiting the Auto-Gain-Control to 3DB or 0DB also works wonders with reducing/eliminating noise.<br/><br/>I've only scratched the surface of what this camera can do.  I have no doubt that I will be impressed with every feature I learn in the future.</span>
