<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I've only had this camera for 2 or 3 weeks so my experience is limited, but so far I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.<br/><br/>This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.<br/><br/>It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is "open" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)<br/><br/>It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.<br/><br/>Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The "mixed" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)<br/><br/>The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of "creative" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.<br/><br/>The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable "quick menu", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.<br/><br/>Drawbacks I've noticed:<br/><br/>You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.<br/><br/>It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.<br/><br/>I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far.</span>

<span>This camera is my first camera ever (other then my phone). To say I’m absolutely in love with this camera is a under statement. Ever photo I’ve taken so far has came out crystal clear! The little things around my house including my kitten that with a phone doesn’t pop much absolutely come to life! I bawled when my camera came in. I have been scraping up every penny to be able to save up for this camera and I’m so happy I did. One thing I do wish it came with was a lense protecter. I have seen mentions of uv lense protecters that are supposed to be absolutely wonderful. If you do get this camera save a little extra to get one. Once I can save up I’m getting me one. It is a super easy camera to learn especially for beginners. It is not heavy at all, which comes in handy for if you are doing long photo shoots. Another thing I wish it came with was a camera cleaner. Or things that told you what was safe to clean the camera with. Obviously not water but are glasses cleaners safe? Or is there a specific camera cleaner? Not sure but other then that I’m beyond happy!</span>

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>My husband and I relocated to Michigan this past spring and it didn’t take long to realize that my I Phone11 camera was woefully  inadequate when it came to capturing the beauty of the Upper Peninsula! I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!<br/>There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers! It was worth every penny!</span>

<span>I'm brand new to photography; I've always been curious, but never gotten into it very much. After LOTS of research I decided on the Lumix G7.<br/>PHENOMENAL camera, as far as this novice can tell. Mirrorless, so it's lightweight. The picture quality is superb, the autofocus is intuitive, the entire package is solid. And the 4k features available in such a cost-efficient bundle can't be beat (I'm seeing retailers offering it $100 less than what I paid for it a month ago now). If you're just starting out like me, you really can't go wrong with this one. I'm also a YouTube content creator (shameless plug: check out "Chris and the XD in The C4 Movement") so having this available to shoot up to 30 mins of 4k video is huge. I'm loving almost everything about this camera.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing that stops it from getting a full 5 stars from me: it has a mount for tripods, but the manual states anything over .22 inches is not recommended and may damage the camera. That rules out a LOT of the tripods I've been seeing. As a photography novice, to really learn the shots and get best possible images without camera shake, I really need a tripod. Perhaps options exist, I'll keep searching, but just keep that in mind as you consider options. If you're going to need to mount on a tripod this may not be the perfect choice. But if you're like me and just want to make some cool shots here and there, I heartily recommend giving this camera consideration.</span>

<span>I'm just a hobbyist photographer and wanted a better quality camera with interchangeable lenses. This fit what I was looking for and the price range I was in. My photos are decent, but can get better as I learn more about post processing and editing. But this camera has served me well for years and I've used it a lot while on trips with excellent results at least to me. I do wish it better stabilization. Some third party brand lenses that have stabilization in them won't work with this camera body. Only Panasonic branded lenses will work with the stabilization for this model. The newer cameras are more up-to-date with this stuff and interchangeable with the stabilization.<br/>I may upgrade in the future but this camera is still great quality and I will continue to use until then.</span>

LUMIX S5 is a hybrid full-frame mirrorless camera that achieves both excellent performance in photo/video in a compact body designed for aspirational content creators. At the heart of the camera, the LUMIX S5 contains a 24.2-megapixel 35mm full-frame CMOS sensor that boasts a wide dynamic range and high sensitivity performance made possible by sufficient light condensation. The LUMIX S5 further realizes recording maximum ISO51200 crystal-clear high sensitivity video with the adoption of the Dual Native ISO technology. As a pioneer of photo/video hybrid mirrorless cameras, the LUMIX has the largest lineup of cameras that record 4K 10-bit video 2. As the latest member of the family, the LUMIX S5 is capable of 4K 60p/50p 4:2:0 10-bit, and 4K 30p/25p 4:2:2 10-bit internal recording. It is also capable of 4K 60p/50p 4:2:2 10-bit HDMI output. For 4K 30p/25p 4:2:0 8-bit internal recording, there is no time limit. Panasonic’s exceptional heat dispersion technology realizes stable, long time video recording. The LUMIX S5 provides 14+ stops of dynamic range, which is as wide as those of cinema cameras, and V-Log / V-Gamut compatibility with popular colorimetry called “VariCam Look”. A variety of recording formats and modes including 4:3 Anamorphic mode, Slow & Quick Motion, 4K/60p interval shooting and 4K HDR are also provided. The LUMIX S5 boasts high-speed, high-precision AF in both photo shooting and video recording that are made possible with advanced deep-learning technology featuring real-time detection of the subject’s type and parts such as human eye, face, head and body. Combining the Body I.S. (5-axis) in the camera and the O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) in the LUMIX S Series lens, the 5-axis Dual I.S.2 compensates for blurring even powerfully, allowing the use of a 6.5-stop 3 slower shutter speed. The splash/dust-resistant rugged design provides professional photographers with high reliability. To enhance the photographic experience, the 96-megapixel High Resolution Mode (JPEG/RAW), Live View Composite function and HLG Photo mode are available.

<span>So I got the camera because I currently have a Panasonic G7 and I really wanted to upgrade.<br/><br/>What I like about this camera is the feel of it it feels sturdy professional heavy but not too heavy the materials feel very well made. The image was great you could definitely see the nice depth and HD to the videos the image stabilization work really great I've tested this camera with and without a gimbal you could easily do handheld stuff and you got perfectly smooth videos and the kit lens was amazing that I have nothing negative to say about that. And if Cameron had a good range of profile soyuz from which may color grading so much easier and very professional-looking. You have 4K 60 FPS and also this, does do well in low-light situations.<br/><br/>Oh boy here comes the negative Parts it's not much but here are my reasons reason why I took this camera back. For some reason Panasonic does not work on there auto focus to make it better. The camera is great for video but in some aspects the pictures are suffering. In my opinion out of 100% I feel the developers worked 60% went designing this camera for video for this camera while 40% is for photos. Like everything you need to buy more batteries I filled this, could do a little better and you would definitely like three or four batteries for a full day or two of work especially if you're working with 4K resolution and also like anything else extra memory cards.<br/><br/>In conclusion not a bad a camera but I think I want to move away from panic Sonic not because it's a bad camera it's great for videos but I want a camera that is close to Perfect all around which I am moving towards Sony and the A7 3 Series or a7r series just because me personally I like their colors videos and picture quality so much more.</span>

<span>This camera is marvelous given the price and capability it provides. If you are a pro or semi pro and use manual focus most of the time, this is your dream come true under 2k. It got all the bells and whistles a pro shooter wants, 4k 10 bit 4:2:2, external 5.9k recording, Vlog, CineD, every dime of settings, beautiful fully articulated screen, pretty much everything the bigger brother S1H have. IBIS is ok (not as good as S1H), and you got vlog built in. BUT BUT BUT, contrast based defocus calculations for autofocus is pretty bad. If you depends heavily on Auto Focus and buying this Camera for v-logging, walking in and around, Selfie style video and will have different subjects in your video shots, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. This will disappoint you. I would rather use iPhone for that than this camera. This is near idea for me but since I wanted something that can be used for v-logging, I am disappointed. I am going to return this and looking at Sony A7C for that purpose.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 02/25/2021: I was testing S5 in a studio setup with Key light, fill light and a RGB light background. Forget about all other auto focus modes, this camera still manages to loose focus when the setting was even on face tracking or Area+ tracking with human detection.  However, it slightly improves with frame rate set to 60 on 4k. But that crops to APS-C mode. Don't know if this autofocus is something Panasonic can fix via software update. They completely redesigned the contrast based auto focus for S5 and update S1 series with this new autofocus system. Panasonic, If you are listening, would you be able to tell your customers when these autofocus nightmares  will be over? Panasonic, if this is fixable through firmware update, please do, because you are going to loose lot of customers in this segment of camera because this segment relies heavily on AUTO FOCUS.<br/><br/>Update: 03/01/2021: I got Sony A7C to test it against this. I must say that Panasonic beats all Sony camera's including higher end A7SIII if you can live with Panasonic S5 Autofocus system or Manual focus system. I found that Sony A7C, which in fact Sony's highly acclaimed A7III in a compact body, has pretty bad banding problems due to Electronic First Curtain Shutter (EFCS) mechanism (it has no full mechanical shutters and that is why you cannot turn that option off). Especially if you shoot in LED lights environment with increase shutter speed &gt; 1/60. Long Story short, Panasonic S5 is near perfect and even better as compared to all Sony camera's upto A7SIII if you can live without perfect autofocus.<br/><br/>Update: 03/09/2021: Since Panasonic is not giving us any update on its autofocus vision or future of autofocus in Pana cameras, I am going to return this camera. I can live with it if I am sure of its future or if price goes down so I can invest in good manual focus assistive setup and rig.</span>

<span>I have been thinking of buying the OMD EM1 Mark 2.  I am an enthusiast and take pictures of my family and for travel. Many years ago, I sold my Canon bodies/lenses to get into Micro 4/3’s. Like many, my investment in film lenses led me to Canon bodies in the electronic world. However, it became clear to me that the electronic world offered new opportunities as the technology improved.  It looked like Micro 4/3 sensors would be the sweet spot for most photography in this new world. My first 4/3’s camera was a Panasonic.  I loved it.<br/><br/>Later I upgraded to the OMD EM5 Mark 2 for the better-quality sensor, better in-body stabilization system, and small size.  The technology was advancing.<br/><br/>Update: I have used the camera for some time now.  There have been two firmware updates to improve stabilization and stabilization "hum" and I am using the Panasonic 100-400 with dual IS.  I cannot say enough about how good this camera is, and at the price, it is a great value. I have added some pictures using the zoom lens and 12-60 lens for illustration.<br/><br/>Time passed, looking for my next upgrade.  It is not picture quality driving me, but 4K video and, frankly handling.  Don’t like the size of the existing OMD camera for handling.  Just a bit too small physically.<br/><br/>Out comes the OMD EM1 Mark 2 for body only almost $2,000, but looks like better handling.  Very professional features, especially fast focus and rapid fire.  Also, higher pixel stills is interesting technology. But What. $2,000.<br/><br/>I found the G85.  I bought it despite the stability issue.  I do not have a noise issue in video. Price is right.  I am using it and it meets my needs. (I expect a firmware update, but camera is entirely usable for photography, which is my focus, pun intended.  I have also made some video’s and they are passable.  There is a little “jump” at the start of the pan, but for me, I could survive. I expect that Panasonic will fix this, as the GX85 does not exhibit this behavior.)<br/><br/>Handling is much better with a larger size handle for holding and taking pictures.  Still light and better than dslr’s for everyday picture taking.  This is the next generation of Micro 4/3’s.  Frankly, I like the on-off switches on the right side, and this does it. (You can set up the dual switch on EM2 2 to be the on-off switch but too expensive to buy just for this.)<br/><br/>Picture quality is superb. Not the reason to upgrade or switch brands.<br/><br/>I had forgotten, but I much prefer the Panasonic UI to the Olympus.  I much prefer the Panasonic smartphone apps, in addition.<br/><br/>Micro 4/3’s is really where the action is, as there is strong and vibrant competition.  I wish all markets were like this. I expect features to improve and prices to fall.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is a fantastic camera on many levels and really excellent overall. But I deducted stars for several reasons and ultimately am returning it. I am not a "Nikon guy" but I do currently use a D750 which is really a phenomenal camera. Unfortunately, it is also heavy. With a 24-70 lens attached, it is quite a whopper to sling around your shoulder. The whole point of getting the Sony A7II was to get the photo quality of the Nikon in a nice small and light package. I also have a Sony a99 with Zeiss 24-70 and I am absolutely in love with it. But, it too is a giant unwieldy beast. So I figured the A7II would be the best of all worlds.....wrong:<br/><br/>What I love about the A7II<br/>I could rehash all the details and statistics about this camera which can be found online, but I think these reviews are more useful when you put it into perspective of a real person. So to put it in perspective, I take a lot of indoor shots and lots of pictures of fast-moving kids and pets. I am VERY picky about good focus, fast camera operation and ease of use. So here is what the A7II did right for me:<br/>+ Beautiful - I think it is a gorgeous camera, and with a 55mm f1.8, it could be in a museum of modern art.<br/>+ Phenomenal focus accuracy - as with all mirrorless cameras that focus primarily with contrast-detection, *WHEN* the Sony gets focus, it get's it dead-on, tack sharp and perfect.<br/>+ Nice video - Unlike DSRs that focus during video by clanking in and out trying to keep focus, the Sony works just like a camcorder: smooth and quiet.<br/>+ Nice electronic viewfinder. Some love EVFs, some hate them. I love them. The picture is bright and it shows you a lot of information you could not see in a DSLR viewfinder like a real-time histogram, the actual white balance the camera is about to capture and an immediate review of the picture you just took right in the viewfinder. Many times, you can see things in the EVF you could not see in an optical viewfinder, especially when the room is dark.<br/>+ The camera and lens is lighter and more compact than any DSLR that I am aware of (in this category of cameras).<br/>+ Built in steady shot is nice<br/><br/>What I didn't like:<br/>- It is still heavy!! It is not exactly a pocket camera, and when you put a 24-70mm lens on it, this things is not exactly lightweight either. With the latter lens, it is about 2 lb 5oz while my D750 with 24-70mm lens is 3lb 15oz. Big difference, yes. But the Sony is far from being a feather around your neck.<br/>- The auto-focus system is accurate when it actually focuses. But it is primarily contrast detection (CD) in bright light (with some phase detection) and totally CD after about f8 and in low light. So, like all CD focusing methods, it is slower than phase detection. This is maddening when you are trying to capture spontaneous moments or fast moving action. In low light, you might as well be taking pictures of statues in a museum, because if your subject moves at all, you will either get soft focus or be out of focus completely. This is 90% of the reason I gave up on the A7II. Sony also has an "Eye AF" which will focus on a subjects eye. Again, when it finds the spot to focus on and does it, the results are perfect. But if your subject is moving or it's a bit darker, forget about it. You will miss half your shots and start yelling at the camera (at least that's what I did).<br/>- The battery life is horrendous. This has been griped about extensively online, but it's true. It makes me feel insecure taking it on any meaningful trips without several extra batteries. No big deal right? But there's the weight again! You just added more weight to this seemingly lightweight package.<br/>- You cannot get a native zoom lens from Sony faster than f4 for this camera. Yes, you can mount a giant lens on there from Nikon with an adapter, but there's the weight again! Why would I buy this camera that is supposed to be light and easy to carry and then strap on this giant contraption to make it do what I want? Forget it. And sorry, but f4 is not fast enough for indoor shots of people with ISO less than 6400. You also lose out on some bokeh there as well. This was the other major reason I decided to forget about this camera.<br/>- Low light performance leaves much to be desired. I am comparing to a D750 which uses the same sensor and the D750 blows the Sony away. Look at the dpreview site and compare them. Once you get to ISO6400, the Nikon puts the A7II to shame. Also, Sony RAW files are compressed to 11-bit while the Nikon is lossless14-bit. So even if the low light performance on both was identical, you can pull a lot more information out of the Nikon for noise reduction and other improvements in post processing.<br/><br/>In summary: I bought this camera because I wanted a light and compact full frame sensor camera. What I got was a slow focusing, battery devouring and sluggish device which doesn't live up to it's potential...and with crippled RAW output and noisy low-light performance (compared to a comparable sensor in the D750) to boot! And all this doesn't come cheap! It is a beautiful camera though, and it's certainly smaller and lighter than the D750 or any Canon, for that matter. But for my purposes, taking higher ISO images indoors and of fast moving objects, the Sony just could not keep up and it doesn't hold a candle to the D750. I am sure mirrorless cameras are the future. There is little doubt about it in my mind, but that time is not here yet. At least not for me.</span>

<span>I was first attracted to the Sony A7 II because of the small form factor.  I already have the Nikon D800 but I wanted something much smaller.  I also have a very small Olympus OMD EM10 but I wanted something with much shallower depth of field.  In some ways, the sony A7 II meets my needs but I will not get rid of the Nikon or the Olympus anytime soon.<br/><br/>The Sony A7 II meets my needs for a small camera with a 35mm sensor.  I am a bokeh obsessed and when I shoot with my Nikon D800, I attach f/1.4 lenses and shoot wide open!  The problem with this is, with the lens and the body combo, they weight too much to carry around everywhere.  So I got the Olympus OMD to fix the weight issue.  The Olympus OMD is very small and light, with even smaller and lighter lenses.  I love the form factor of the OMD.  I got some pretty good bokehs out of it too with the 75mm 1.8 lens but that focal length is not very useful everyday.  So here I am with the Sony A7 II, with the small form factor and the full sized sensor.  Iâ€™ve been using the camera for a week and here are the things I like and do not like about the camera:<br/><br/>Likes:<br/>The sensor: The A7 II, has the same sensor as the Nikon D750/D610 so the photos coming out of the camera are great with very wide dynamic range and good color.  And with the Sony 55mm 1.8, the bokeh is delicious.<br/><br/>The built-in SteadyShot:  I can consistently get sharp photos of static objects at 1/10 sec. (this is useful for shooting fireworks handheld, and shooting with lower shutter speed in a dim light condition), using the Sony 55mm 1.8, wide open.  This is great but not as good as the Olympus OMD EM1 which I can get sharp photos at 1 sec consistently.  With that said, I do realize that the Olympus sensor is one fourth of the size of the Sony sensor so I am not complaining about it at all.  In fact I am very happy with the system.<br/><br/>Customizable buttons: which I set them to mimic the functionalities on the Nikon and the Olympus.<br/><br/>The size/weight: my initial attraction to the camera.  it meets my needs.<br/><br/>Dislikes (why I took off stars):<br/>The UI/menu system/general user friendliness:  I love the Nikon UI and Olympus.  I find them very user friendly and some what intuitive.  My bigger issue with the Sony is how the focus selector is designed.  I am very use to selecting my focus point using the 4-way pad on the back of the camera body.  I do not rely on the camera to select my subjects for me because many times this is not reliable at all.  On the Nikon, I use the 4-way pad to select my focus point and click the shutter button to shoot.  On the Olympus, I either use the 4-way pad, or the touch screen on the back to select my focus point and click the shutter button.  On the sony, I have to first configure the 4-way padâ€™s left, right, and down (You cannot configure the up button) to focus settings.  What the focus settings does is it let you change the focus method and lets you move the focus point.  So you have to press at least one button to initiate the focus point change.  I say at least one because sometimes, I push the up button first, which is not assignable, and fixed to display functionality.  Even worse, when you are in the focus settings, if you accidentally touch the scroll dial, it will change the focus mode to something else.  This could lead to 3 or more button pushes to just set the focus point.  Iâ€™ve missed many shots of my fast moving daughter because of this issue.  I am taking off one star for this madness.  I feel like I want to take off 2 stars for this because this is extremely critical to me.<br/><br/>Auto focus: I didnâ€™t have a high expectation for the auto focus but I am somewhat let down by it.  The auto focus is slow and inaccurate at times.  I only have one lens at the moment, the Sony 55mm 1.8.  When taking photos of my very active daughter, the auto focus would focus in and out several times and when it does lock-in, I found many of the photos soft.  I confirmed itâ€™s not the lens by taking sharp photos, manually focusing.  Coming from Olympus, this is very disappointing.  The EM10â€™s auto focus is as snappy as the D800, very rarely slows down.  I think this may be a learning process and hopefully I will get better at it.  I am taking 1/2 star off for this though.<br/><br/>One other issue with the UI: the ISO functionality.  I set the ISO to the C1 button and the scroll wheel.  the way the C1 button ISO works differently from the scroll wheel ISO.  When you use the C1 button to change the ISO, the exposure meter disappears so you have to guess what ISO to use.  When you use the scroll wheel, the meter is there so you can set the ISO manually.  I am not taking any star off for this because I actually like using the scroll wheel but the button should be consistant.<br/><br/>Sluggishness: After taking photos, I like to verify that I took in-focus photos by zooming into where I focused.  A7 does have this functionality but itâ€™s slow.  When you click on the zoom button, you have to wait about a second for the camera to zoom in, then the camera zooms to the middle of the photo, not the focus area I used.  With Nikon and Olympus, you click one button while viewing photos to zoom into the focused area and itâ€™s instantaneous.  I am taking off 1/2 star off.<br/><br/>The battery life:  I am used to mirrorless cameras and not so good battery life.  But it seems like the Sony A7 II has the worst battery life yet.  When I got the camera, I charged the battery fully.  After that, I opened up the menu to learn the camera and change different settings.  I changed around some setting, took some photos to with different settings, took some short videos.  2 hours later, the battery was dead.  This seems really low.  1/2 star taken off.  Need to get some extra batteries.<br/><br/>I will be keeping the A7 II. I like it enough and I will have to get used to some quirkiness and hope that Sony will address these issue via firmware.<br/><br/>******************************************************************************************************************************<br/><br/>Update #1: There is a functionality called "Standard" that you can only set to the center/OK button.  When the standard assigned center button is pushed, it will bring up the focus selector.  This is different from the focus setting functionality.  If Sony would let me set the standard functionality to the directional buttons (including the up button, which currently is not changeable), it would solve the most serious problem that I have with the camera.  When this does happen, i will up the review by one more star!</span>

<span>I was very let down when I first used this camera out of the box but then I popped a prime lens on it and it was AMAZING! Normally I think kit lenses are underrated and take too much abuse but this camera's kit lens is just horrible. Once I put a $198 50mm lens on the camera is was incredible. So this is one of the few times I found recommend you go for the body without the kit lens and buy yourself a good prime instead.<br/><br/>The menu on Sony is terrible and I can't get used to it. It's completely upside down to me coming from Nikon but all that said the camera is just amazing. It's fast and lightweight. It's smaller and lighter than my Nikon DX crop sensor. It's incredible to have what feels like a micro four thirds but is a full frame camera! The 50 and 85mm f1 8 lenses are super affordable and are incredible paired with this camera. I got a 35mm f2 Rokinon pancake lens ($200) to keep on this camera between shoots and with that tiny lens I can carry this camera with me everyday everywhere I go and have a full frame mirrorless on me all the time!  Incredible that after all these years as a photographer I finally got a full frame digital camera and it was only $900! You can't beat the price. It's such a great deal.<br/><br/>In body image stabalization is so valuable by itself. I remember when VR lenses were new and that seemed crazy but now any lens I out on this camera gets an extra 2 stops handheld! For video it makes everything looks so smooth.<br/><br/>You can literally shoot at 3200 ISO if you have to and it works. At 1600 ISO it's not even something I have to worry about. I never used to go over 400 ISO on a digital camera, 800 for black and white street stuff but now I will shoot at 800 just to be able to stop down more because it's honestly not an issue.<br/><br/>Oh BATTERY LIFE, not nearly as bad as what I exoected! I think that it's fine. It lasts me all day on one battery without a problem. Also the batteries are super cheap. I got 2 extra batteries and a double charger for them for $35 (in total) with that I have 3 batteries at all times if I need them. If you are really paranoid spent $30 more and get 6 batteries.  I'd rather have a small battery and camera and be able to just swap in these cheap tiny batteries as needed. I found that a full day of regular life use can easily last on 1 charge.<br/><br/>Amazing camera!</span>

<span>To preface this review, I think the time for purchasing this particular camera is when it is being sold for under 1000 dollars. This tends to happen frequently throughout the year, especially around the holiday season. In fact, one could also find the body for ~900 new on black friday/cyber monday deals on amazon or other camera stores.<br/><br/>If you already have invested in one system, say Canon or Nikon,or even already own a Sony APS-C camera, I would not recommend the a7II. The a7II is a gateway product that provides the most value to those who have not yet experienced the mirrorless movement of cameras, or even cameras in general.<br/><br/>I will also not recommend this camera to those who are looking into seeking photography as a career. You would probably be better investing in a camera which is 'competitive' to offer top results to clients.<br/><br/>So to begin, who is the Sony a7II perfect for?<br/>This camera is perfect for those who are interested in full frame photography and not so much interested in shooting video. This is the camera for the amateur or the casual shooter who want to reap the rewards that mirrorless designs offer.<br/><br/>While the camera is fairly old, around 4 years as of 2019, do not mistake it as a bad camera. Even in 2019, the image quality and sensor performance is quite impressive. The IBIS, a feature seldom found on cameras of this price range, allows you to take very sharp images in low light situations. Auto focus on this camera is fairly quick and will get you sharp focus in most, if not all, situations. Just know, that high action or high movement subjects will not be easy to focus on using this body. Dynamic range on this camera is also very impressive.<br/><br/>Aside from the built in features, the E-Mount system is the most mature mount system on the market. Since Sony adopted mirrorless designs early, there is a large selection of high quality lenses that can fit almost any budget. The current high value lenses to be looking out for are:<br/><br/>- Tamron 28-75mm F/2.8 which runs for just under 900 dollars MSRP. It is the most bang for you buck zoom lens on the market for the E-Mount system and potentially a lens you will never take off.<br/><br/>- Sigma Art Primes come in various focal lengths and sizes. Again, these lenses are razor sharp and don't break the bank. One could get the a7II kit for 1000 dollars and the Sigma Art 35mm F1.4 and that would still be cheaper than buying an a7III body.<br/><br/>- Samyang/Rokinon lenses. For every Sony lens on the market, there is a Samyang/Rokinon of similar design at a small fraction of the Sony price. This glass is cheap, but quality for what you pay for. Some would even reckon that these lenses surpass some of the available Sony options.<br/><br/>Of course many will be purchasing the a7II Kit which comes with the 28-70mm lens. This kit lens is about the epitome of the 'jack of all trades and master of none' title. It gives access to a pretty standard zoom range, the sharpness is pretty solid even at its wide open aperture of 3.5. It is small and light weight as well, meaning you could easily carry this lens around with you in a bag. But that's about it. You can take very good pictures with this lens, but you'll always be wanting for more in terms of sharpness and aperture options.</span>

<span>I bought the lumix as a lower cost replacement for my Sony zv-1 that met with an untimely demise. I love that it’s mirrorless and offers the option to change lenses. The onboard mics are good and it has audio tracking so the audio follows you around. Good face recognition autofocus. The only thing I miss with the zv-1 was the ability to blur the background at the touch of a button. This camera actually requires you to do that with aperture settings. The kit lense isn’t great but it’s good enough if you’re vlogging and using intelligent auto settings. If you want more performance you’ll need to pick up a better micro 4/3 lense which there are a ton of affordable options out there.</span>

<span>I used to have a huge DSLR, but after we had our baby it felt impossible to lug around and get a quick photo with. As much as phone cameras have improved, I will still take the professional look and experience of using an actual camera any day. My favorite features about this camera is that everything retracts in completely. When the camera isn't in use you don't have to worry about a lengthy lenses to potentially destroy because it's like it isn't there and the camera itself is small in size which is GREAT for travel. And with it being so small, you still have great quality videos and photos in 4k! Not to mention the awesome quick upload feature. It's not like other cameras where the photo downloads to an app and then you have to download the photo from the app (losing quality). The photo goes from your camera straight to your phone's photo library, not losing any quality.</span>

<span>I've had several M-series cameras, this one has much faster auto focus and better light sensitivity then the predecessors. I have tried telephoto with the 50-200mm lens, but the pictures aren't sharp, perhaps it's the lens or it really requires a tripod even in bright light. It's decent for macro work, I'm using the 22mm for that.  I've taken some nice landscapes with a Rokinon 8mm and I've got a 12mm Rokinon on the way to do a little astro photog.<br/>I've decided I'm not a huge fan of not having a real view finder and the zoom in on the screen is limited so fine focus can be a bit of an issue at times.

<span>I don’t like the lack of weather sealing and built-in viewfinder, otherwise it is a great camera.<br/><br/>Edit after 8 months of use: I still like the camera a lot. I think it was the right choice for me.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Speed: It is a fast camera. I don't think this is an obvious choice for action and bird photography, but it is definitely a capable crop-sensor camera compared to alternatives (as of 2020).<br/><br/>Auto-focus: Reasonably fast and very accurate.<br/><br/>Image resolution: 32.5mp is more than enough, especially given the sensor size.<br/><br/>Ergonomics: It is comfortable and small. It has three dials, you can use one for shutter-speed, one of aperture and one for exposure compensation (or ISO). It is fun and convenient to use in the manual mode. I also like the custom modes. I don't use back-button focusing much, but it is easy to set-up if you need.<br/><br/>EF lenses: You can easily adapt older and cheaper EF and EF-S lenses with an adapter. There are many options for adapters starting from around $50. I got the official Canon adapter at a discount for less than $100. I tried Canon EF 50mm STM,  EF-S 55-250mm STM and couple of Sigma DG lenses. They are all excellent, no problems in focusing and no reduction in the image quality. Especially the cheap and lightweight EF-S 55-250 STM works great (but, I cannot recommend the IS II version).<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The viewfinder: The lack of built-in viewfinder is really inconvenient because the add-on viewfinder sticks out from the camera and makes it impossible to put it in a case. Taking the viewfinder out each time and storing it separately is a big hassle. I also tend to hit it to tree branches accidentally as I hike, and worried that it will be broken at some point. However, since it sticks out, you can use your left eye at the same time while tracking, which is a big advantage for action photography.<br/><br/>No weather-sealing: I wish it was weather-sealed, but this given the price point I don't expect this advanced feature.<br/><br/>No in-body-image-stabilization: Again, something I wish it had, but no Canon camera has this feature except the most recent R5 and R6 models (as of August 2020).<br/><br/>No RF lens compatibility: The M lenses still don't have a good selection. It is impossible to adapt the most recent RF lenses due to physical limitations. There will never be a proper RF to M adapter. So if you switch to a full-frame Canon in the future, you will not be able to use your old lenses, unless you buy only EF lenses.</span>

<span>I didn't just wake up one day and say, "Screw it, I'm buying a new camera!" I actually spent quite a bit of time online reading and watching reviews from competent sources, including several who aren't known as Sony fans. The consensus seemed to be that it is a competent camera that performs well above its price range.<br/><br/>Following are my impressions of my new travel companion.<br/><br/>Look and Feel/Menus and Customization:<br/>While it lacks the brick-like, all-metal build of the NEX-7, it feels solid and the fit and finish is excellent. the controls are enough different from the 7's to cause me a little fumbling at first but after a day or two, I wish the 7's controls could be updated. The custom function buttons are very useful and the Alpha-style menu is a huge improvement (NEX-7 firmware update please, Sony!)<br/><br/>The lower resolution viewfinder is listed as a negative on most of the review sites but I have to strain to see a difference and it handles dim light a bit better than the 7 with less color static. The rear LCD is the same as the 7 but here the new menu system is a vast improvement with a Fn button that allows direct interaction with the status indicators on the LCD sort of like the A700 DSLR. Very, very easy to access settings.<br/><br/>The pop-up flash features the same articulated setup as its predecessors that allows for bouncing within it power limits. My only gripe is that Sony abandoned theexcellent Minolta hotshoe for the newer "multi-interface" shoe. I will probably pick up one of the $30 adapters and a new small to medium flash that fits it directly but honestly, I seldom use flash while travelling and I am keeping my A77 (or its successor) for events and studio stuff. Come to think of it, my Alien Bees radio flash commander will fit the new hotshoe without an adapter! Ok...a small plus for the new shoe.<br/><br/>The only NEX-7 feature I miss is the dual rear dials while shooting in manual. Not a big deal since I use A-mode most of the time and I won't miss the inadvertent exposure adjustment caused by the outer dial when not in manual mode. Since we're back to controls for a moment, I have to praise the design genius that located a custom button right next to the shutter button. I have programmed it to control focus assist magnification and it has made using manual focus and fine adjustments much easier.<br/><br/>179 Point Hybrid Autofocus:<br/>Wow. The NEX-7 is no slouch but was never noted for its blazing autofocus. The A6000 is noted for its blazing autofocus and rightly so. I shoot with the NEX cameras a lot more than the A77 these days and am always shocked when I pick up the DSLR and focus on something. Pop! it's in focus! Well, all I can say is that any new mid-range DSLRs had better have crazy-fast autofocus and huge burst buffers or mirrorless hybrid-focus cameras are going to start eroding their market share even more than they are now. Lightning fast with more focus area options than I care to write about. The three-zone multi-point focus like on the A77 has become my favorite but I will be exploring more during the months leading up to our next trip. It does hunt a bit in really low light but no worse than most and better than some DSLRs at and above its price range that I've played with. The autofocusing with the 16-50 PZ is pretty amazing and if it is any better with a lens like the 70-200 f/4 FE lens, it may lead to a lot of soul-searching before I spend any money on a new DSLR.<br/><br/>Burst Shooting:<br/>Burst shooting? You betcha! I am used to really fast burst shooting from the A77 and wasn't disappointed. The A6000 is only 1 fps slower than the A77's 12 fps speed-priority mode and will maintain autofocus and metering for each frame. The A77 has to "slow down" to 8 fps to match that. The buffer is a lot larger than the NEX-7 and even larger than the A77. Unlike the A77, it needs 15-20 seconds to clear after a long burst (up to 49 JPEG/22 RAW) which may be an issue if you shoot a lot of action. If you only shoot heavy action occasionally or limit yourself to short bursts to catch the peak moment, the burst speed and its ability to track focus performs far above entry-level DSLRs and most-mid-range models.<br/><br/>Image Quality:<br/>The NEX-7 was a incremental step up from the A77 in my opinion, probably due to not having the mirror stealing some of the light. The A6000 is at least one full stop better in low light and in my opinion, shoots acceptable (your mileage may vary) images up to ISO 12,800. At low ISO in good light, all three produce spectacular detail with excellent color. the A6000's AWB with CFL or incandescent lighting is hit and miss but that is true for almost any camera these days with 1000 different temperatures available in residential lighting. Fortunately, setting a custom white balance is ridiculously easy and the results are spot-on.<br/><br/>Bottom line? If you are coming from a NEX-7, you will be pleasantly surprised. if you are coming from a "Sweet-Sixteen" camera by Sony, Nikon, Pentax or any other that uses the Sony 16.1MP APS-C sensor, you're in for a bigger surprise. The detail captured with a good lens and normal care in how you shoot is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>Why I Now Need WiFi on a Camera:<br/>'Cause this one has APPS! (See below.) Other than that, it is of marginal use at this time since I use a Windows phone. While I prefer the performance, desktop integration, awesome camera and intuitive interface, it's a bit of a pain to be last on the dev list for things like camera controls and smart home stuff. I will likely dig out my old RAZR Maxx and set it up as a camera remote control just to say I did. In practical use, I seldom (if ever) need a remote in a way the wireless Sony RMTDSLR2 can't provide.<br/><br/>Why I Now Need Apps on a Camera:<br/>You know that convenient, inexpensive wireless intervalometer you use on your older NEX camera for time-lapse and astrophotography? Yeah...that one. The one that doesn't exist. Well, now there's an app for that. There are several apps available with many of them being free. Some of the paid apps have the same functions as those already on the A6000 and seem to be available as upgrades for the web-enabled models that don't have the option built-in. The Time Lapse app is really pretty cool. In addition to all of the interval settings, it can be set to create a movie automatically at the end of the sequence. There are also Motion Shot and Star Trail apps that look like they have some potential. The Time Lapse intervalometer app was only $10 (cheaper than the wired Chinese knock-off controllers) and has me smiling for now.<br/><br/>The Return of Tethering:<br/>Absent from Sony/Minolta cameras I've owned since my Konica-Minolta A2, tethering has returned!<br/><br/>It's pretty limited but I'm hopeful that it will evolve. Hey, it's a step forward!<br/><br/>The New 16-50 Power Zoom:<br/>My original SELP1650 that came with my NEX3 was a good walkabout lens with reasonably good image quality and was amazingly compact (for what it is) when powered down and retracted. I bought the A6000 with another 16-50 and a kit because of the sad little reminder sitting on the desk in front of me as I write this. During a recent trip to Disneyland, I snapped a picture in the courtyard between the two parks upon arrival then proceeded immediately into the park. Immediately. Quicker than the time-out setting on my camera. The time-out that would have retracted the lens and kept it from wedging between my hip bone and the turnstile as I went through. BlackRapid is still my favorite strap but I learned a valuable lesson involving strap length, clearance and the fragility of kit lenses. So how much better does the younger sibling of the permanently extended, slightly angled corpse sitting on my desk perform? Can't tell. My old copy was pretty good and this one seems to be at least as good. Focusing speed seem about the same so I would guess that any improvements were minor refinements. Not as sharp as the Sigma primes but as a travel lens with jacket pocket portability, it is hard to beat.<br/><br/>The Only Camera I'll Ever need?:<br/>No. That camera doesn't exist yet. I will not be selling my A77 or NEX7 anytime soon. The 7 is still a workhorse and while it lacks some of the next-generation improvements, it is still the great camera that lured me into buying it a couple of years ago. It will also be a better second body than my trusty little NEX3N. The A77 is still superior in handling long lenses and its battery life with the battery grip is good for any day of shooting. I may replace it if Sony comes out with an A-mount version of the A7 family with Canikon-killer features but for now it still has a home.<br/><br/>That wraps it up for now. Having come from an A77 and a NEX-7, I am not "blown away" by the A6000 but I am very pleased with its performance and not at all regretful of the (reasonable) expense for what now appears to be a decent upgrade of several vital performance points.</span>

<span>I did not purchase this camera for video.  If I wanted video, there are plenty of other options.  This is a great camera for what I want, a step up from a point and shoot but better quality than a iPhone 5. Plus, a full manual mode.<br/><br/>Six hours to charge the battery seems excessive but ha, the battery life once charged is pretty good.  I love how the same cable that charges the battery also connects to the computer.  Less things for me to lose. Plus, Sony has a battery exchange program if there are any issues.<br/><br/>Pros for me:<br/>AF is amazing. Has "eye" tracking for when people move. The subject can leave the shot and reenter. The camera will refocus on the person.<br/>Customizable function buttons. Think AF, Zoom, B&amp;W, white balance at the touch of one button.<br/>Pancake style lens. Zoom lens is fab!<br/>Powers up quickly - great for catching moving kids/action.<br/>Talks with my Mac - does have delete issues.<br/>Plenty of lens options and other accessories. Works with all other 3rd party lenses with adapter.<br/>LOVE the lack of weight.  So much easier to hold and focus when weight is not literally holding you back. I wear it messenger bag style and it does not bump against my hip.<br/>Great auto everything feature for non-camera guy, hubby. The "perfect setting."<br/>Wireless sends photos to my phone - amazing feature, just download the app and ready to go. Photos go straight into my photo library not app library.  Huge USP in my book. Plus phone can control camera for remote work. Try that with another camera!<br/>Pop-up flash works surprisingly well for something so small but great. I tend to shoot w/o flash.<br/>Others complain it has a plastic feel but after almost a year of use, it holds up very well.  Never had an issue.<br/>The EVF is wonderful to check your shot before pressing the shutter button. The built in histogram is a time and shot saver.<br/>Love the Zebra and grid lines settings.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>High learning curve coming from a point-n-shoot but that is me. Manual and menus are not user friendly.  I wish Sony had more tutorial videos for the a6000 line. Here is a good tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYXwCGWb7Yg<br/>Wish for a touch screen for zoom feature. Think iPhone pinch after taking a shot to ensure edges are clear.<br/>Does NOT play well with Mac computers.  I need to dump the iPhotos trash each time in order to delete off camera. I prefer iPhoto over the Sony software.<br/>Because of the lack of size, many people think it is a point-n-shoot. Which is fine but be prepared not to be taken seriously as a photographer.<br/><br/>All in all, I still love this camera.  The lack of weight, AF and lens options put Canon and Nikon's entry level DSLRs to shame.  One day they will enter the mirrors revolution with two feet. Until then, this camera works. For the nay sayers, Sony makes the Nikon sensors.</span>

<span>A solid camera but you're paying for what you get 100%. This is an old(ish) camera and you could spend a bit more to get something nicer. That being said, I'm a big fan. I feel that you just have to work a little harder to get great photos whereas life felt a bit easier with a 'nicer' more expensive camera. Still a happy camper shooting good quality stuff.</span>

<span>Bought as my first camera as it said it would come brand new in an unopened box but I found out when it arrived to have been used as the box was a little roughed up and the contents weren’t organized, the power brick was scuffed and had faded letters as well as the stickers and labels that suppose to come on a new camera were absent along with pamphlets to the camera</span>

<span>Everyone knows the strengths and weaknesses of this Lumix.<br/>You can find numerous technical reviews on YouTube and many other specialized websites but no one can know what your oratich needs are.<br/>Personally I am very satisfied with the G95, I don't go around at night taking pictures, the video crop in 4K does not bother me, if the quality of the viewfinder or the LCD screen is not enough for me I use a small external monitor and solve every problem.<br/>This is not a professional machine and the price is more than justified.<br/>Do you want better lenses? Purchase an adapter and use lenses with a Canon or other mount, the camera body will always give you an optical stabilization support .<br/>What can I say, needless to add obvious things, it depends on your expectations and what you want to achieve and how you want to work.<br/>For me it's an underrated product with obvious shortcomings ... but Panasonic would have killed a higher market segment.</span>

<span>It’s a very good hybrid camera, I said  “very good" , but not excellent. There are some features in video and photo that are lacking in this camera, making it looks like Panasonic is clearly “holding/neutering" the camera's full potential. Some examples of that in video: Doesn’t shoot full hd 24fps, doesn’t shoot full hd at high bitrates (24 mbps is outdated in 2022), Crops in 4K even more than the micro 4/3 crop (it means that it has to shoot very, very wide, to look a little bit wide), does not record 10 bit in full hd or 4K to an external device, the focus peaking for manual focus lies a little bit (does not works perfectly), little noisy in the shadows (but this is common even for far more expensive cameras). For photography in my opinion it’s a fine camera, I only felt it lacks HDR pictures, and as I said in video, the response is a little noisy in the shadows. So if you are searching for a great camera for video in a similar price range, go with the GH4 or GH5 (used), X-S10 Fuji (body only), Sony A7s2 (used, body only). But there are good points on this camera, that makes me believe it’s surely costs what it costs: Beautiful 8 bit colors, no limit of recording time, stabilized sensor, great photos files (comparable with much more expensive full frames).</span>

<span>I used this for kids sports, stills and portraits.  The features and performance are very close to the Lumix G9 while still being quite compact.  I'd consider this for a hiking/camping camera due to the compact size and low weight.<br/><br/>Picture quality is excellent, low light performance is a struggle but that is due to be being a micro four thirds sensor.  The live composite feature is great to get your exposure right and helps cut down on post processing.  The DFD autofocus works well for kids sports in AF-C but burst mode slows down to 6 fps.  4k video recording is OK if you can live with the 2x crop.  The G95 is billed as a hybrid camera, it does both but I find that it is better suited for stills.</span>
