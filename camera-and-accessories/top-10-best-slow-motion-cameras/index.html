<span>Never have I seen such an amazing camera! Don't hesitate on spending the money for this. We've bought 2 for our production company and we will certainly buy another one when we are ready. You can add an infinite amount of accessories to this camera. The rigs for this camera, like the Camtree, make it completely stand out. It's a show stopper for sure!!!  The slow motion on this camera is by far the absolute best we've ever seen! The only issue with this camera is low light circumstances. The ISO isn’t adjustable other than a high, medium, and low. You might as well use your iPhone because dark settings will not work with this camera.</span>

<span>Finally pulled the trigger since the price dropped so low.<br/>This camera is still a solid performer for professional video.  It is able to be matched up shooting with my lesser Sony cameras (EA50U) yet offers abilities beyond my other cameras: usuable 120fps, 240fps, 480fps, better low light, 4K upgrade (with Odyssey 7Q+), built-in ND, Cine gammas and more.<br/>I have been happy with native E-mount lenses and by using adapters, you can mount other kinds.<br/><br/>This camera has been criticized for horrid ergonomics, and rightly so. It is a box with a bunch of buttons on it and an LCD on the top rear.  However, as long as you do not intend to shoulder hold it, it has worked fine for me, both on tripod as well as hand-held, cradled down against the chest hasselblad style.<br/><br/>It's rather heavy, but feels solid. The LCD screen is not great for focussing (like the EA50), but is usable due to focus peaking, and much better than something like the Panasonic HMC 150 has.<br/><br/>There are certainly better cameras available for much more money, but if you are a low budget operation this affordable camera delivers a pretty heavy punch.  I am grateful it came down in price enough that I could step up my game with it.<br/><br/>I would not hesitate to purchase it again. I'm looking forward to adding the Odyssey 7Q+ to allow for 4K.</span>

<span>This camera is not without compromises, that being said for it size it's really amazing all that it can do. I don't use it for video so I can't comment on that aspect of the camera. The lens for me is the biggest compromise when it comes to edge sharpness and distortion. Basically the edges of the frame are poor and suffer from distortion and coma is really really bad. If you're a pixel peeper and care about your corners this camera won't make you happy especially for night shots. The camera is TINY so I expected some trade offs with the lens. You have to buy the grip with this camera, without it doesn't feel right. The sony menu's are probably the worst I've ever used of any brand. Now that all the negatives are out of the way, the autofocus is excellent, no issues even in low light. The lens center sharpness is excellent and the stabilizer works great for low light. Slowest handhold speed at 24mm is 1/8 and 1/25 at 74mm. This is for 100% success rate. Auto mode on the camera is surprising good. The color tone on this camera is on the green side which can be a pain to correct for in post. It often leads to unpleasing colors compared to my canon gear. Sony is definitely a step behind in the color reproduction department. Finally the viewfinder is a complete waste of space. It's really not functional at all, and it's extremely small. It's purely there for marketing. If you're buying this for the viewfinder get the Canon G5X instead. So much more functional.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Image Quality (one step below Cropped sensors in signal to noise ratio)<br/>Dynamic Range is very good ( but not excellent )<br/>Super Fast Autofocus<br/>Tiny<br/>Quiet<br/>Build Quality Seems very good<br/>Image Stabilization<br/>Rear LCD<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Lens corner sharpness and coma<br/>no battery charger (come on, really?)<br/>Menu system<br/>Terrible Manual<br/>Expensive<br/>No Grip included<br/>Made in China ( Camera in this price range should be made in Japan )</span>

<span>I really like this camera. It produces very good images in spite of its small size. Low light performance is amazing, I've got some fantastic night time shots. I've never done video, but I'm starting to, this camera makes it easy. The slow motion feature (high frame rate, HFR) of the Sony are impressive; it opens a whole new creative path. I bought it for travel, and because of its small size, I always have it with me.<br/><br/>But the camera is not very robust. I have been using it heavily -- I've been traveling for six months, averaging 100 photos a day -- and it is starting to fail. The control wheel on the back no longer works, so no shutter speed or f/stop adjustment, no manual focus. Still works great in auto. Some of the buttons on the back are becoming intermittent. Disappointing!<br/><br/>  Follow on --<br/>I'm now in Seville, Spain. I took the RX-100 to a camera shop (I had emailed them earlier). I was told to wait 30 minutes. I came back expecting a diagnosis and a time frame. The camera had been fixed! My Spanish is not so good so I did not fully understand what the repairs were, but I heard the word "solder." It works fine now. Cost me $25USD and 30 minutes, and caused me to ponder the lack of decent repair shops in the US. (But that's off topic.)<br/>  I still like the camera, but it seems best for light use, or as a backup. The high speed video is fantastic, but if you're a pro, keep this camera for backup only!<br/><br/>Since it's two months out of warranty, Sony wants me to send it to their repair center for a flat rate of $306 USD. But I'm out of the country for a while longer, so I'll have to find another repair place.<br/><br/>I'll update this review in a few weeks...</span>

<span>Purchased for travel photos.<br/>The good:<br/>This little camera is a powerhouse.<br/>It consistently produces great images.<br/>It is dead simple to use.<br/><br/>The not so good:<br/>My chief complaint is with construction. The camera does have a nice solid weight to it, despite being so small, but is not robust in exterior construction.<br/>The pop up diopter broke free a month into my ownership. I was fortunate enough to have the knowledge to fix it back to working order, but now when depressed for storage, it often triggers the camera to automatically start up randomly, and often at inconvenient times, (like when in storage.)<br/>After investigating Sony’s FAQ section, as well as local camera repair, it’s one of a few know issues with this model.<br/>Reaching an authorized Sony repair shop was no fun. Basically, a US West or East coast solution, but problematic for anyone who happens to live in between.<br/>Additionally, I own Hasselblad, Mamiya, and Nikon cameras, and seeking repair for this little RX100IV is easily the biggest manufacturer headache I’ve experienced in 23 years of photography.<br/><br/>In summary, I love the package size and images, but dislike how fragile the camera is, and sour on Sony repair services and customer service.</span>

Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<span>The Wyze team are killing it with this one.  Their low cost products have always been a good draw.  My prior Wyze camera was the pan camera - good price for one that I could make spin around and look up and down.  I bought two v3 to get my side yards.<br/><br/>My primary cameras are nest...traditionally seemed to be the top of the line for this new generation of cloud based IP cameras - highest quality but highest cost.  But at least with the nest app I felt I was getting what i paid for.  Now those guys at Google made their new cameras not work with their own nest app, only the Google Home, which is crazy to me.  The Google Home currently doesn't let you see the *entire* 24 hour history within your subscription time frame, which was always a key distinguisher from Ring and other IP cameras - only highlights!  I had ordered a 2 pack of their new cameras  on Prime Day but then did some more reading and found out about the lack of nest app support, and found my existing nest cams could not access more than highlights/alerts in Google Home app, and decided that was just not going to be good enough.  I want to be able to look through the entire feed in case an alert didn't catch everything.<br/><br/>Then I decided to look at Wyze - I'd read their emails and was interested in their skylight night color and decided I would 'try' their $35 camera instead of the nest $120 camera.  After all, the new v3 is outdoor rated, has great night vision and has a lower cost, can install SD cards for onboard extended feed coverage (not just alerts) and I'm already using the Wyze app for my two pan cameras so I'm already in the ecosystem in my Google Home.  So I ordered 2 Wyze v3 cameras.<br/><br/>Installation - First, even the box is small...reminded me of the Blink camera size.  I ordered SD cards for the v3 cams to give me that very long look-back ability (very cheap for the sizes needed).  When I went to install I realized the USB cable/power line was thin - and I was able to run it inside my window track so as to NOT DRILL into my siding (because lets face it, eventually i may change to something different and who wants to put holes in their siding).  Unfortunately I did have to poke the cable through the screen b/c my screen didn't slide up/down.  Like I said, the camera is very small and light, so when I mounted I only needed one small screw (provided with kit) to hold it in place.  There was a magnet ring around screw area, and that could have helped with the mount, but I didn't use it.  The camera has left right and up down hinges so I was able to point it in the place I wanted to.<br/><br/>Performance - I am happy with the camera's performance.  Its 1080p.  One camera is on side with street light, and that area stays color lit with the starlight feature and yes can see pretty well.  The other camera is in more shaded part and uses the gray IR feed, and yes I can see what's going on there pretty well.  Unfortunately I don't think any of these cameras can "zoom" in and really see someone's face or a license plate, but that's just a limit they all have if you don't have a mechanical zoom presumably like the traditional fully wired camera security systems.  But I'd say the picture quality is on par with my $350 nest outdoor v2 IQ camera.  I haven't tried the higher level wyze plans with their version of person recognition, so can't comment on the facial recognition aspect, but I'm totally fine with losing that one feature when everything else has the $35 camera totally pacing the $350 camera.  What a value difference and its crazy the quality you get for this price point.  Wyze is really a super top level choice in the budget to mid-level home camera market.  Extremely happy.</span>

<span>I installed several v3's  7 months ago. They worked well. However, Wyze was constantly requiring me to install endless updates. It seemed like every week or two. Well, the last update bricked all of my camera's.<br/><br/>Power cycling did nothing. So I took a couple of the camera's down and reset them. All of them went back on line without a problem. However, as soon as I unplugged them to reinstall them, guess what! Dead again. I reset them again--three times same result. Each time they were power cycled they went into the install mode and wouldn't come out of it so they could reconnect.<br/><br/>I called Wyze tech support and they made me repeat all the steps I had already done multiple times. Why? Because the support person doesn't know much about the cameras. They're simply reading from a help desk script, and they have to check off the boxes, or they get in trouble.<br/><br/>They tried to convince me it was my fault. The network router wasn't good enough. Too many things were connected to it. On and on. I'm an engineer so I know BS when I hear it. All the cameras worked fine including the previous updates until this last one. Then bricked. That's not a coincidence, and they know it. They've had the brick problem happen numerous times, so tech support has heard it all before. Any little info packet problem, minor power spiking, wifi signal wavering or any other type of interference can cause the flash update to go wrong. All of these things are normal and should be expected with any wifi connected equipment.<br/><br/>Wyze finally agreed to replace all of the cameras, but it took about three hours going in circles with them. I've already spent close to six hours taking cameras down, testing them, talking to tech support twice, and now I've got to reinstall all the cameras again. These are good, inexpensive cameras--when they work. Tech support is available, but watch out because every problem is caused by something on your end. They really love to blame the router.<br/><br/>Bottom line--they just don't want to replace the cameras if they can convince you everything is your fault. This time they did replace them, which I appreciate. They asked me to return the failed cameras, which I don't mind, but it's just more of my time. Of course, their engineers want to look at them. Really! They'll be sitting in a box somewhere with the other few thousand failures. They'll get to mine around 2026 when someone throws them in the trash bin. They want the cameras back to insure I'm not trying to get over on them, and get free cameras.<br/><br/>When the time I've spent is taken into consideration, these cameras aren't very cost effective. My time isn't free, even though Wyze acts like it is. We'll see how long the new ones last. If their "technical team" keeps updating every few weeks like they're doing now, they'll brick some more cameras. It's the risk of e-prom updates. I would skip the updates, but they pop up a nag screen every time I open a camera. It's annoying. Clicking "don't show again" is just another waste of time. Customers aren't sitting around waiting for every minor change in the software. One or two updates a year would be adequate. Let me decide if I want the updates. Oh, that won't work because some of the updates are about taking away stuff like the 12 second videos that originally came with the cameras. What a crock!<br/><br/>It takes at least an hour to set up a half dozen cameras. Each camera has to be updated from 1 to 4 times during the setup process, depending on when it was manufactured. That takes a lot of time. Then it will take me another hour plus to reinstall them. In total, this brick update will cost me 9 to 10 hours of my time, at least.<br/><br/>Wyze has better tech support than most security camera companies. It's just slow having to go through the help screen over and over no matter how many times something has already been done.  One tech support person was willing to sit on hold while I uninstalled one camera from the roof. Ok, let me whip out the ladder, climb on the roof and do that for you. I guess they wanted their lunch break.<br/><br/> At least they replaced the cameras, THEY ruined.<br/><br/>I took one of the old bricked cameras that I didn't have to send back, and I re-flashed it with a clean update. That failed also, so whatever happened during the update is permanent. That's another design flaw. There's no way to reverse an update and fix a problem. That's also a problem that should be addressed.<br/><br/>Tech Support  3 or 4 stars--depending on who happens to answer the phone.<br/>Cam V3  (when it works)  4 stars<br/>Constant Updates  1 star<br/>Camera Software  3 stars<br/>Wasting my time  1 star<br/>Wifi issues 2 stars<br/><br/>I'll use them without EVER updating them again--at least until they force an update which they do from time to time. Maybe they have a hardware problem that needs fixing! When lots of people are reporting their cameras have bricked after updates, or after a power recycle, it's not a random glitch.  When I was buying the camera's, Wyze didn't mention anywhere in their advertisements or product descriptions that I needed to have them within 10 feet of my router, or whatever they think the maximum distance should be, for them to update properly. They didn't say I had to have less than X devices connected to my wifi. Smart home devices (especially switches) show as connected even though they don't degrade the wifi signal strength except for the split second when one is activated, and the loss of signal strength is marginal.<br/><br/>The problem with their wifi strength argument is if my cameras are in a location where  they have a constant, stable wifi connection 24/7 with no problems recording video to the micro SD card, then that should be adequate wifi connectivity for an update. The previous  10 updates completed with no problems. Again, they should be asking a lot of questions about why some updates and a few random power cycling events are bricking v3 cameras. There's a solution to this problem, if they want to find it.</span>

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35.

No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<span>This is truly a junky camera that will become a totally inoperable brick after the first upgrade patch.  This glaring patch problem has happened to me several times and each time Wyze has done nothing to resolve the problem.  Microphone and speaker are unusable static.  So-called new and improved night vision is a joke. Wyze used to be a good bargain because you didn't have to sign up for monthly services now they require you to sign up for monthly expensive services for their junk camera.  Junkie product with increased prices makes it a horrible value. The only thing Wyze wants to do is take your money and give you nothing in return.  Stay away from !</span>

<span> This is one of the hardest reviews I have to give. There is a lot I like about the go pro 8 black. I primarily use as a "dash cam" when I'm biking around the city, mounted to my helmet.<br/><br/>I love the interface, it's modern and easy to understand. can press one button to turn on and instantly start recording. Has good wide field of view. Image quality is best in class. Can move files relatively quickly wirelessly to their app. Huge variety of mourning options. The mics pic of really good audio.<br/><br/>BUT, these are the downsides that make it not perfect for me. First off the battery life is way shorter than I expected. Even when I'm shooting at the lowest possible resolution and frame rate(1080p/24fps), each battery only lasts about an hour of filming. For comparison, I purchased a simple $100 crosstour action camera and it films for twice as long if not more. And since I'm taking long bike trips around the city, battery life is priority to me. To me that's a make or break feature.  Somehow the hero 8 black suffers from power efficiency - the outside of the metal gets very warm which tells me they designed the hardware and software wrong to use all the juice so quickly. Also no real "loop recording" feature.<br/><br/>Will I keep using it? Absolutely, I'll just keep a spare battery in my bag. But would I buy it again? No, I would keep looking for the perfect helmet mounted camera with longer filming time.</span>

<span>My wife and I got into YouTube content creation a few months back. We initially started with knockoff GoPros and while they were great for getting us started, we want a more professional look now that we're building up a subscriber base. We already have a Panasonic Lumix G7 for recording "selfie" style shots so this camera was going to be for second angles and tight shots where the G7 won't fit. With that in mind, we opted to save some money buying this Hero 8 rather than the latest and greatest Hero 11 seeing as we didn't need all the bells and whistles (including the front facing screen). We have been more than happy with our purchase. Keep in mind, though, we record at 30 fps in either 1080p or 4k depending on the needs of the particular shot so we're not pushing the camera to its limits. With that said, we use a USB battery bank and leave the camera plugged in and, in combination with a 256GB SD card, we've left the camera recording in the Texas heat and sun for several hours and never run into overheating issues. That's even with the media mod attached, btw.</span>

<span> I purchased a Hero 8 and they sent me this Hero 9.  My first test out on a bike ride this morning, and I can really tell the difference between this one and my cheap little Sportscam.  In the GoPro video, you can see the horizon and trees and road and surroundings all stay stable and don’t move. Only my bike is moving. In the cheap camera video, everything is jiggling with my movement. This was well worth the money I believe.  The only thing that never improves from product to product is battery life. There’s really no answer for that other than to buy multiple batteries and keep them handy. This battery lasted me about 59 minutes before it died.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.<br/><br/>First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)<br/><br/>Blink Outdoor:<br/>Motion recording speed &amp; Delay:<br/>The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --&gt; Encode --&gt; Cloud --&gt; Decode. I"d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.<br/><br/>Motion sensor &amp; sensor distance.<br/>the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.<br/><br/>Speaker/Mic<br/>the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.<br/><br/>Wifi Wireless<br/>i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this "might" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage.  it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.<br/><br/>AC Wireless.<br/>part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.<br/><br/>Resolution/video quality<br/>the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield "some" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.<br/><br/>Storage<br/>ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup "from their cloud server" "once a day". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that "local storage" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.<br/><br/>Now onto Blink mini (junk)<br/><br/>Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it.  The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.<br/><br/>Software UI/UX<br/>the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the "motion sensor" distance (not wifi distance)  is well shy of advertised 25ft.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.<br/><br/>i will update the review on the battery life</span>

<span>Honestly, this is a good-almost great camera to use. I don’t have a doorbell so opted for this one instead. It will do what you need it to and the night vision is not terrible either. The main complaints I have with this model are the battery life and motion sensors. The battery life is supposed to(according to description) last for about two years- but that’s very far off. I have to change my batteries like every two months. granted, in the app it says my camera has high usage, but that’s the point of it lol. The motion sensor is iffy for sure. I have a lot of stray cats by my house and it rarely picks up on them walking through my porch… and if it does pick it up it’s always super delayed (the cat is almost off my porch by the time the camera records it). Oh one more thing - it gets super frustrating when you get the notification of movement on your phone, I click it, and it takes forever to load the live view (usually the mailman is gone by the time it pulls up and works). Usually, when doing that or just checking live view in genera the app sort of like crashes and I end up having to close it and start over. So I can never really use the talk feature since it usually takes awhile to load and then the person is gone by the time it works lol. But those are things I can live with and it overall works like it’s supposed to!</span>

<span>When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):<br/>PROS:<br/>&gt; #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams.  POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.<br/>&gt; So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.<br/>&gt; The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few "advanced features" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas  and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.<br/>&gt; Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.<br/>&gt; Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.<br/>&gt; Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.<br/>&gt; No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.<br/>&gt; Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.<br/>&gt; Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.<br/>CONS:<br/>&gt; So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.<br/>&gt; The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.<br/>&gt; You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.<br/>OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.<br/><br/>El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.<br/><br/>La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.<br/><br/>La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.<br/><br/>Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.<br/><br/>Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.<br/><br/>Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque<br/><br/>El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.<br/><br/>Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción  de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.<br/><br/>En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.<br/><br/>Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.<br/><br/>Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la  prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.<br/><br/>The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.<br/><br/>The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.<br/><br/>The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.<br/><br/>Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.<br/><br/>Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.<br/><br/>This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.<br/><br/>The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.<br/><br/>Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.<br/><br/>No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.<br/><br/>Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files.  They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<span>It clicks loudly when capturing video. When using it to monitor how my grandmother was being treated, it was obvious when the cameras started. It lets you disable the power light but then makes a loud clicking when capturing video. Other than that, they have been actually better than I thought they would be. The app needed to control and use them, is pretty good but using the Ecco Show to monitor them is a mess. Way too many unnecessary features turned on that you have to hunt down to disable. Even after that, it’s impossible to continuously monitor the cameras through it. There is no way to set it up to stay on the cameras. Amazon never misses a chance to force you to watch adds or view Amazon products they want you to use.</span>

<span>We bought a set of these on sale to help keep an eye on our dogs while we are away/ to keep an eye on the baby cribs when the children go to nap.<br/><br/>They work great for the dogs but it took a little adjustment for the babies. The reason is because at night the cameras have to switch to night mode when activated. This causes the camera to make a slight ticking noise. Of course babies being babies, picked up on this right away and were originally weary of the camera.<br/>However, they got used to it quickly and now have no problems with the camera.<br/><br/>I can say that the night vision works well and I like the alerts provided when movement is picked up.<br/><br/>Another slight hiccup I've experienced a few times is that if the motion alert is activated, you can't turn the alerts off until the camera is done with its 10 second recording.<br/>Not the biggest deal but it makes it challenging to time it correctly to deactivate the alert.<br/><br/>Overall, I think its a good budget camera and it works well with the rest of our Blink system.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have several of both the Minis and the outdoor models, and this Mini is almost identical to the outdoor and indoor models in terms of quality and features. The only real difference between them is the Mini isn't weather-proof, cannot handle the extreme temperatures of the outdoor models (-4 to 113 F), has a better mount, can be image-flipped, and runs solely on a power adapter instead of batteries.<br/><br/>* Not Weather-proof: DO NOT use this mini camera outdoors or in an uninsulated building. It is not water-proof and will likely be damaged by humidity and high or low temperatures.<br/><br/>* Mount &amp; Image Flipping: this mount is great and allows easier installation locations than the indoor and outdoor cameras, because it's mounted from the bottom/top instead of the back.  Since this Mini can be mounted from the bottom or top, this means it can be turned at many more angles on all 3 axes than the Indoor/Outdoor. If you have to mount it upside-down, such as from a ceiling, the app simply allows you to flip the image vertically. The problem with the indoor/outdoor models is the mounting is on the back, which means you can't "hang" it from a ceiling and point it in any direction. Instead, if you want to mount the Indoor/Outdoor on a ceiling or near the ceiling, you have a very small angle to point it. This makes the Indoor/Outdoor cameras inconvenient to install from above in most situations because you'll end up having to point the camera directly outward from your mounting surface. If from a ceiling, it'll face down. If from the top of a wall, it'll face outward along the ceiling. The Mini's mount is much better.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>* The "Talk" feature is totally useless. Regardless of bandwidth or proximity to the router or a sync module (purchased separately), the Talk feature produces broken sound that is impossible to understand. Plus there's a long delay of 3-6 seconds, making this feature useless for conversations, even if the other person understood anything you were saying. Over several tests with all of our different Blink cameras, none of them produce clear enough speech that someone can understand you, no matter where the cameras are located.<br/><br/>* No wired Ethernet option. This camera can only be used with a wireless router and Internet connection. There are no other options.<br/><br/>* Cannot be used as a USB web cam<br/><br/>* Cannot be used for continuous live feeds. The live feed only allows up to 30 seconds of viewing, and you must hit a Continue button every 30 seconds to keep it going. So if need a camera to leave running for frequent live video, Blink isn't what you're looking for.<br/><br/>* Cloud Storage Subscription semi-requirement: the Blink Home Monitor App's features become limited if you don't purchase a cloud storage subscription. If you stick with the Sync Module for local storage and do not purchase any of the cloud storage plans, VIDEO CLIPS CANNOT BE VIEWED THROUGH THE APP. The app will only allow you to view the live feed, adjust camera settings, and use the Talk feature. Without a cloud storage subscription, the only way to view your camera's video clips is by physically taking your USB storage device (purchased separately) out of the Sync Module (purchased separately) and placed in a USB port on a computer (purchased separately).<br/><br/>To be very clear here, if you do not purchase a cloud storage subscription, you will not be able to view any of the stored video clips (including motion-activated clips) from your phone. Period. This point has not been made clearly anywhere in the advertisements, support screens, Amazon product pages, or Blink Web site, but it's a crucial piece of information that the company is being very ambiguous about.<br/><br/>To repeat, IF YOU DON'T PURCHASE A CLOUD STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU CANNOT VIEW YOUR VIDEO CLIPS THROUGH YOUR PHONE. I have seen some reviewers assert that this isn't technically possible, but as a software engineer I know this isn't true. The Blink developers clearly focused on developing the cloud storage and subscriptions, using the mobile app as the user's "portal" app to access and view the cloud-stored video clips, and have simply decided not to develop a mechanism for the mobile app to access the video clips stored in your Sync Module. I want to be very clear here....this IS POSSIBLE and would require a lot of development to accomplish, but Blink just doesn't provide this functionality (yet). Whether they are working on this feature and plan to add it in the future is unknown. But the lack of direct integration between the mobile app and the Sync Module's local storage (over the local network, especially) is a significant shortcoming in the entire Blink system. This also means that if your camera loses its internet connection, it will not capture video, you can't view the live feed, the Talk feature won't work, and you can't change the camera's settings.. The Blink system simply does not allow the mobile app to connect directly to a camera or Sync Module on your local network. It is designed to use the Internet only. This is a very important point that customers must understand. Both the camera and the Sync Module require an active Internet connection to function. They will not work independently or with just a wifi router. Internet is required.</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>I know it's got to be a good camera because a pro-video friend uses one in his free time with the family because he doesn't want to bring $35K equipment around a bunch of kids!  It's still a little confusing for me only because I'm just coming from using an iPhone &amp; this has more dials.  Now I know how my Mom felt when I bought HER an iPhone!!!</span>

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>I'm a beginner at photography and have always wanted my own camera so this is my first. With thorough research I wanted to make sure I got a camera that was good and worth the money I would be spending. Not only does this camera have great zoom and focus but also the settings gives you great range. The battery lasts pretty much all day, it's pretty easy to navigate without instructions, and it's nice and compact. Love this camera!</span>

<span>This camera is the best! It helps me watch my fur babies while they're home alone. I get to talk to them too! The camera pans and tilts as well as detects sounds to capture the area sound is detected. BEFORE, I had to get several cameras to cover different corners of the room but this eufy cam took the place of three seperate cameras. DEFINITELY reccomend!</span>

<span>Overall really like them. I've had their wired 1080p doorbell since March and much like that one, the features are rich but the motion detection is definitely... iffy. It works when it's supposed to without fail, but will definitely sense and see certain things incorrectly. My favorite example is it saw my cat stretching in his cat tree as a human. Easy enough to adjust the motion zones, but expect some false alarms if you have notifs enabled. Another is if you look around manually while the camera is armed, you can trigger false alarms since the motion zones move with the camera instead of staying put in 3D space (which is asking a LOT, so I understand the limitation. A very minor gripe, just maybe don't try to scan the room for your pets while motion zones are enabled).<br/><br/>I use the geofence feature so I don't have to worry about false alarms going off at random much, and at large setting the sensing to human only ignores my personal milling about very well, but your results may vary.<br/><br/>Overall insanely easy to set up, very clear, very responsive and very stable connection after about a week. The two cameras alone can capture basically my entire upstairs area confidently. Very glad to have them even with their flaws. Nothing's perfect after all.</span>
