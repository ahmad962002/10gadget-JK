                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>So this happened to me in two different houses with two different sets of blink mini cameras. when i was setting up the camera, it would not connect to wifi. it would blink blue and green and then the light would go to a steady red and after a couple mins the app would tell me it couldn’t connect to wifi and that it’s usually poor signal or incorrect password. Sometimes the lights on the camera would just turn off and it would be unresponsive. I retried so many times with same outcome. I reset my wifi countless times and changed the password and reset the cameras and even got right next to my router for maximum connectivity, because according to the internet that’s what I’m supposed to do. Well it’s actually the complete opposite. After some research, these cameras connect to 2.4 GHz band. Some wifi routers give off both 2.4 and 5.0GHz, some have two separate routers for each band. I have spectrum wifi so my one router has both bands. Anyways the point is the 2.4 covers larger, further out areas but with lower signals. 5.0 covers less area with better signals. So in order for the camera to connect you have to go the furthest away from your router to be able to connect to the 2.4 GHz band. So if you have a similar sounding issue try connecting furthest from the router. Also i did contact blink support but no response and i went to Best Buy to ask and they didn’t know what to do. maybe blink should include this info in the instructions</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Let me start off by saying that these Blink indoor mini cameras do NOT prompt you to continue live view after 30 seconds, or whatnot, as other reviewers try to say. Maybe they did at one time before I ever got mine, but with the current software there is no interruption to live view.  However, the doorbell and the outdoor cameras will prompt you to continue. And the only reason I can think that the company sets the cameras up this way is due to the fact that the indoor cameras are plugged in to an electricity source  and the outdoor cameras and the doorbell run off battery and maybe it's a battery saving tactic. Then again, as far as the outdoor cameras having interrupted live feed. Is it really that big of a deal? Who is just steadily watching outdoor feed unless something suspicious is going on? So why complain? It's really not a hassle to tap a button if you're seriously need to watch something live.<br/><br/>Honestly, for the price, I'm pleased with these cameras. My main reason for buying them was just to home some type of home security incase someone was to break into my house. And to also check in with my kids as I please to make sure they arent up to no good after school until im able to get home from work. I have no problems with the motion detection working as it should. The image is great for a 30 some dollar camera and the night vision is also good.<br/>I have pretty good WiFi so I've had no issues with these cameras nor any of my outdoor cameras.<br/>You really can't complain about these cameras. If you do, Invest in a $1000 security system.<br/>If you're here reading my review then obviously that's not in your budget. So go ahead and purchase some. Unless you have crap WiFi service which will cause problems with the cameras working properly....they should satisfy basic needs.</span>

<span>UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn’t the best but once you change the video quality setting to “Enhanced” it’s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won’t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT &amp; XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don’t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage &amp; subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that’s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use ‘em where you don’t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.</span>

<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<span>I love these cameras they are so easy to use so easy to hang up they stay up with the sticky pad that comes with or even just a little duct tape or blue painters tape if you want to reposition them multiple times to get the view you want.  No need for complicated outside cameras that need wire or batteries. These cameras work right through our windows while plugged in to any outlet. They even capture excellent pictures through screens with just a tiny amount of distortion. Definitely get the 32 SD card so you can keep track, so easy to erase, reset-<br/>all remotely. Excellent voice and sound quality-- outstanding product.  I have views out all sides of my house with just 4 of these! What a deal. Color and vision is excellent day and night. I either set them on a window sill inside my home or configure their bases to hang them (with a little painters tape) up against the window glass.</span>

<span> EDIT: I uploaded a video of the camera's sound quality in action, so if you view the video turn on your sound BUT KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN (initially). No need for bleeding ears.<br/><br/>During the Wyze portions of the video I was sitting roughly 20 feet away and six feet below the camera; There should be no feedback at that distance.<br/><br/>During the iPhone portion (where I filmed the same space as the one the V3 is normally set up to film) I was roughly six feet away and six feet below the camera. The point was to capture the same sounds in the same room.<br/><br/>All the videos were taken very early in the morning, with no traffic or human noise outside, and with what I'd call regular ambient interior noise (the humming of appliances, the running of a computer in the vicinity, etc). No other people were present to make noise inside.<br/><br/>The first portion of the video is the sound that the V3 produces when I am viewing the live feed. It was screen-captured with my iPhone.<br/><br/>The second portion is a comparison demonstrating the sound my iPhone picks up in the same general space, at the same general time, in the exact same conditions, and with the exact same ambient noise in the background as in the first portion; This is not to show how much better the iPhone's mic is than the Wyze (obviously it's better) but to give you an idea as to what noise and sounds were actually present in the room while I was viewing the V3's live feed of the same room, and capturing it with my phone camera.<br/><br/>The third portion is the same space with the same ambient noise, plus conversation from the television that is eight feet from the V3. I chose a scene that sounds a lot like regular conversation, set it to conversation volume, and it has some light score that comes in at the end.<br/><br/>The final portion is what my iPhone picked up in the same space during the same time and conditions, and while playing the exact same scene/conversation on the TV at the same volume as while capturing it on the V3. If you listen VERY carefully you MIGHT be able to pick up a word or two in the V3's video that you can compare to the iPhone's. Maybe. It took me three tries. Hint: listen for the word "Garrett".  Hope the video helps you make a more informed purchasing decision!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Picture is ok. Night vision/low light is very good. Motion detection is spot-on. The camera looks good, design-wise.<br/><br/>Why the one star?<br/><br/>Because that's where the good ends.<br/><br/>The problem is the mic/sound quality is appalling bad. That's such an old, tried-and-true tech I have no idea how they managed to bungle it so much, but managed they did.<br/><br/>Maybe they are using the very cheapest, most absolute garbage quality components on the face of the earth, which sucks, because better components don't cost that much, especially wholesale. They're just squeezing every penny out of profit and selling garbage wrapped up and promoted as quality.<br/><br/>Frustrating.<br/><br/>So, what sound does it pick up?<br/><br/>From what I've read online there are various audio manifestations/issues ranging from nearly no sound at all, all the way to my problem, which is the sound picked up becomes a garbled, distorted, feed-backed  jumble of sometimes jarring noises that maybe sort-of could be interpreted as words (in the case of people taking) but nearly nothing's decipherable by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Pet noises, like barks, meows, growls, etc. are literally non-existent. If it picks it up at all it's just converted to "noise".<br/><br/>All other sound is just as bad. Sometimes there's these random-seeming staticky "bangs" every once in a while. Who knows what that is.<br/><br/>I hate it.<br/><br/>You hear that developers?<br/><br/>I. Hate. This. Camera.<br/><br/>And I wish I didn't because otherwise I like so much about it.<br/><br/>But, alas,  I need sound so I am able to use the function where you talk to someone through the camera and hear them when they respond. I also need to be able to hear what's going on with my pets.<br/><br/>I need to be able to hear when the camera's motion-detection is tripped and the cause of the trip has moved out of the line of the camera but is still out there rustling and bumping around, or otherwise making noise out on my porch and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>If I had children I wouldn't be able to hear them, or speak to them through the camera. or hear when one is crying.<br/><br/>So, be forewarned, if any of the above is one of your needs/goals you probably won't be able to do that with this camera. Buy elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's incredibly stupid they didn't fix this problem before releasing the V3. A lot of people online report the V2 being awful as well, so the developers knew. That means you shouldn't put off buying one for when the next gen comes out (whenever that is). They probably won't fix it.<br/><br/>The worst part, I think, is it doesn't support the use of an external mic, which would be such an easy solve. There's no input port and the simple hardware and software to support that, and that really is stupid AF. If it did allow the connecting of an external mic all I'd have to do is plug one in and I would have the sound I need. At least then I wouldn't be writing this scathing review. It would be a win-win for everyone!<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>Finally, apparently contacting customer support is a total waste of time, and the people you talk to (bless their hearts, it isn't really their fault) have no tech experience or understanding whatsoever of how these things work. I don't know about you, but I find that exhausting. If one were to spend the time necessary to troubleshoot all the garbage products we wind up with one would never have time to do anything else, and even with that effort 95% of the time it results in no improvement, and no resolution. I'm tired of it. Just make a solid product, and when something goes wrong, replace it or refund the money, don't make anyone jump through hoops.<br/><br/>Finally, fix the issue, fast. And don't repeat it in the next iteration.<br/><br/>Long and the short of it is I need a camera with a functioning mic and/or that has an input for an external mic. The end. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even at the price-point these cameras are at.<br/><br/>I regret buying these, as now they're going to be tossed after I buy another brand (according to message boards even cheapo Chinese no-name brands have a better mic than these things!). What a waste of time, money, and resources.</span>

<span>Much improved over 1st version.  Night picture is much clearer.  I use them outside under eaves, porches &amp; patios.  Last one has been there 4 plus years &amp; was still working. Temps ranging from 110 degrees to zero.  After seeing the new vision I’ve replaced all 15 cameras at both homes.  2nd home is a cabin in the mountains so I get many videos of lions, deer, raccoons, skunks &amp; birds.  Some have even captured mice.  My biggest complaint is the constant upscale pressure of their longer cloud videos.  Whenever I replace an old camera I 15 days of their free longer videos &amp; I hate them.  Do not need to see the trees blowing for 5 minutes.  Then when free trial expires you have to figure out how to get free cam lite videos which are 12 second snapshots.  Longer videos are recorded on a 32 gig micro sd card which you access in the phone app.  So if you need the longer video it’s there you just need to look at sd card from your phone &amp; it’s there.  Works great for what I need.  Many false events outside but I realize they are an inside camera.  I’ve tried their wireless outside version &amp; they’re horrible.  They eat batteries miss the wildlife &amp; other events.  They do not have any range of wifi so they are junk.  They lack the ability of seeing the sd card from phone app. so you need to retrieve card to download events.  Never have even done that cause it’s a hassle to pretrieve card.  Just been viewing the 12 second videos.  If I had to pay to use them for videos I would change them all out for different brand.  The price point for cameras &amp; 12 second videos can’t be beat.</span>

<span>I like these little cameras!  Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below).  Real time live video is important to me for various reasons.  For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.<br/><br/>These cameras are small and light.  The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting.  Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.<br/><br/>The app is so-so..  it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked.  For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings.  To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline..  it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead.  I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain.  You have to guess where to look for things.<br/><br/>For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events.  Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.<br/><br/>Speaking of recording events only to your SD card:  SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings.  If you choose "events only" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops.  This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information.  I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook.  The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.<br/><br/>The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events.  It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone.  When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good.  It is slightly better indoors.  I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera.  (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that.  The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).<br/><br/>For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio.  Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced.  As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.<br/><br/>Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons.  This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.<br/>I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all.  You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings.  I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet.  No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.<br/><br/>1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017.  They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years.  They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal).  The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed.  (My network is not the issue.)  It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise.  I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards.  No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.<br/><br/>3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc.  Priced around what wyze cameras cost.  As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house.  Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them.  That feature does work and is actually really nice.  Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.<br/><br/>4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit.  These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point.  The cameras seem really solid and well made.  I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked.  Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay.  For the price, they would have had to be perfect.<br/><br/>5. Eufy Solo  IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more.  I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster.  I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras.  Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion.  Audio quality was really good with these.  But the delay was a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>The End.  I applaud you if you got this far!</span>

<span> FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data..  I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨<br/><br/>UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.<br/><br/>The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.<br/>👇😕<br/><br/>This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍<br/><br/>The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.<br/><br/>So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.<br/><br/>Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.<br/><br/>After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐<br/><br/>This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍<br/><br/>UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.<br/><br/>Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.<br/><br/>I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.<br/><br/>Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.<br/><br/>The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍<br/><br/>Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.<br/><br/>Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.</span>

<span>Bought the 3 camera kit back in May due to a lot of sketchy characters roaming our neighborhood at night.<br/>About 2 weeks ago the camera we have set up under our carport captured a man trying to break into my car at 12:43 am.<br/>I would definitely recommend these cameras however there are a few things i think could be tweaked.<br/><br/>*PROS:<br/>-BATTERY: 5 months in and so far the batteries are still good<br/><br/>-PICTURE: quality is great in the daytime, decent at night.<br/><br/>*CONS:<br/>-MOTION DETECTION: good but would be better if sensitivity could be set a little higher without risking draining the battery.<br/><br/>-NOTIFICATIONS: notifications to your phone aren’t very loud/alarming. Which is fine during the day but at night it’s not enough to wake you if something does happen.<br/><br/>-CLIP LENGTH: ours is set to record 15 second clips, that’s the highest you can go without getting the “clip length could shorten battery life” message. Would be more convenient if it would record until motion stops.<br/><br/>-DELAY: There is a 10 second delay between when a clip finishes and when it starts recording again, which doesn’t seem very long but it is actually kind of inconvenient when someone is trying to break into your car.<br/><br/>*Side note*<br/>After the incident, I bought a floodlight and installed it underneath the carport to get in color videos at night.<br/>I also, bought a couple motion sensors (sensor outside, alarm inside) to wake us if something else happens.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Empecemos por decir que lo que ofrece el producto es lo que vas a obtener ni mas ni menos.<br/><br/>El producto es totalmente inalámbrico , lo que le da ventajas a la hora de una instalación limpia rápida y sin cables a simple vista.<br/><br/>La conexión vía remota desde el celular a través de app es genial y muy fluida, cuando quieres ver los videos, aunque la conexión con mi dispositivo echo show 5 a sido casi imposible para el control de voz y para la visión en vivo tiene un delay bastante desagradable.<br/><br/>La duración de las baterías es excelente tengo 5 camaras instaladas y una de ellas esta en la entrada del conjunto residencial, lo que hace que diariamente este por las 70 notificaciones de movimiento promedio con sus respectivos videos y aun después de un mes dice que esta sobre el 70% de vida.<br/><br/>Las notificaciones son casi que en tiempo real max unos 10 a 15 seg después de la detección de movimiento llega la notificación a la app de celular, pero la conexión con alexa en mi caso a sido terrible y bastante deprimente porque me decidí por el producto justo por esa función y no he podido darle solución a los errores constantes entre alexa y el skill de blink.<br/><br/>Ahora indaguemos mas en lo tecnico y por lo cual me ha decepcionado un poco el sistema.<br/><br/>Este no es un sistema de vigilancia de video es mas en mi opinión un sistema de alarma de movimiento con capacidad de grabar el evento que activo la señal de alarma, aunque muchas veces ese video termina por frustrarte mas y a continuación explico el porque<br/><br/>El sistema solo puede grabar entre 5 seg y 60 seg de grabación y aunque a veces 60seg es mucho tiempo, tiene una opción que permite parar el video antes si el movimiento se detiene, pero aca es donde comienza el problema en realidad, si activas esta opción, el sistema tiene una contra que la camara al desactivarse tarda 10 seg en volver a estar lista para registrar otra alerta lo cual hace que a veces pierdas información valiosa en cuanto a seguridad, si el movimiento para y luego se reactiva mientras la camara esta en el reposo de los 10seg, la camara no registrara nada en video y si el intruso sale fuera del rango de detección ya no podrás saber que paso luego, incluso si el movimiento llegar a seguir después de los 60seg max de grabación por alerta, la camara entraría en ese mismo tiempo de descanso de 10seg.<br/><br/>Aunque las alertas en la app son muy rápidas este Tiempo se puede ver afectado si la opción  de alertas rápidas no esta activada, ya que esta viene desactivada por defecto y si no se activa en cada camara puedes tener unas que te avisen y otras que las notificaciones llegue siempre tarde o después que ya se detecto el movimiento.<br/><br/>En resumen si lo que quieres es un sistema de alerta de movimiento o cercanía este es el sistema que debería comprar pero si quieres un sistema de vigilancia de video busca otras opciones.<br/><br/>Dentro de amazon hay varias opciones de camara ptz wifi con grabación continua, detección de movimiento, alarma sonora y audio doble vía que trabaja muy similar a este sistema y con una memoria de 32gb tienes hasta 4 dias de grabación continua y son mas económicos, aunque no son tan excelentes como este en visión de video en vivo o revisando archivos de alarma te serán mas útiles si lo que buscas es un sistema cctv, por lo menos en mi opinión.<br/><br/>Postdata aun no se como funciona el sistema sin la membresía a Blink plus aun estoy dentro de la  prueba gratis y aunque ya tengo todo el sistema para grabación local pronto volveré con mi opinión de como se porta el sistema una ves no tengas el soporte de Blink Plus.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Let's start by saying that what the product offers is what you are going to get, no more, no less.<br/><br/>The product is completely wireless, giving you the advantage of a quick clean installation without wires at a glance.<br/><br/>The remote connection from the cell phone through the app is great and very fluid, when you want to watch the videos, although the connection with my echo show 5 device has been almost impossible for voice control and for live viewing it has a delay quite unpleasant.<br/><br/>The duration of the batteries is excellent, I have 5 cameras installed and one of them is at the entrance of the residential complex, which means that every day there are 70 average movement notifications with their respective videos and even after a month it says that it is over 70% life batteries.<br/><br/>Notifications are almost in real time, max about 10 to 15 seconds after motion detection, the notification arrives on the mobile app, but the connection with alexa in my case has been terrible and quite depressing because I decided on the right product for that function and I have not been able to solve the constant errors between alexa and the blink skill.<br/><br/>Now let's dig deeper into the technical and for which the system has disappointed me a bit.<br/><br/>This is not a video surveillance system, it is more in my opinion a motion alarm system with the ability to record the event that activated the alarm signal, although many times that video ends up frustrating you more and I will explain why below.<br/><br/>The system can only record between 5sec and 60sec of recording and although sometimes 60sec is a long time, it has an option that allows you to stop the video earlier if the movement stops, but this is where the problem really starts, if you activate this option, the system has a counter that when the camera is deactivated, it takes 10 seconds to be ready again to record another alert, which sometimes means that you lose valuable information regarding security, if the movement stops and then reactivates while the camera is At rest for 10 seconds, the camera will not record anything on video and if the intruder goes out of the detection range, you will no longer be able to know what happened next, even if the movement continues after the maximum 60 seconds of recording by alert, the camera would enter that same rest time of 10sec.<br/><br/>Although the alerts in the app are very fast, this Time can be affected if the quick alerts option is not activated, since it is deactivated by default and if it is not activated in each camera you can have some that notify you and others that Notifications always arrive late or after motion has already been detected.<br/><br/>No me In short, if what you want is a movement or proximity alert system, this is the system you should buy, but if you want a video surveillance system, look for other options.<br/><br/>Within amazon there are several wifi ptz camera options with continuous recording, motion detection, sound alarm and two-way audio and lights that works very similar to this system and with a 32gb memory you have up to 4 days of continuous recording and they are cheaper, although They are not as excellent as this one in viewing live video or reviewing alarm files.  They will be more useful if you are looking for a cctv system, at least in my opinion. Postscript I still don't know how the system works without Blink plus membership I'm still in the free trial and although I already have the entire system for local recording I'll soon come back with my opinion on how the system behaves once you don't have Blink support Plus.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.<br/><br/>First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)<br/><br/>Blink Outdoor:<br/>Motion recording speed &amp; Delay:<br/>The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --&gt; Encode --&gt; Cloud --&gt; Decode. I"d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.<br/><br/>Motion sensor &amp; sensor distance.<br/>the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.<br/><br/>Speaker/Mic<br/>the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.<br/><br/>Wifi Wireless<br/>i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this "might" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage.  it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.<br/><br/>AC Wireless.<br/>part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.<br/><br/>Resolution/video quality<br/>the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield "some" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.<br/><br/>Storage<br/>ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup "from their cloud server" "once a day". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that "local storage" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.<br/><br/>Now onto Blink mini (junk)<br/><br/>Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it.  The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.<br/><br/>Software UI/UX<br/>the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the "motion sensor" distance (not wifi distance)  is well shy of advertised 25ft.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.<br/><br/>i will update the review on the battery life</span>

<span>I have 5 of those cameras to monitor my aging mom and keep an eye to her. Setting up the cameras was pretty easy. Cameras are great and does everything what they are supposed to do. I also enrolled to the Cloud storage of the videos. The iPhone app is also great.<br/><br/>Recently I had issues with the cameras that were losing the WIFI connection. So, they become offline and useless. When I tried to reconnect to WIFI it didn’t work. Resetting the whole camera didn’t work either.  I contacted to the Wansview help center via email and they responded within 24 hours. After some research, the issue was not with the cameras but the WIFI channel being too congested. Our router had WIFI channel selection set to auto and was using the channel 6. I scanned the neighborhood WIFI and most of the WIFI’s were using Channel 1, 6 and 11. I switch to channel 9 and everything worked fine.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the cameras and Cloud Storage to anyone want to keep an eye on loved ones.</span>

<span>I got these cameras on sale a few weeks ago and so glad I did! I have one set up in my main living room as well as my basement living room and LOVE how clear the images are!  The app is super easy to use and I really enjoy being able to move the camera to see around the rooms.  The night vision is fantastic, almost looks like daytime with very clear images.  I have blink cameras and I like these Wansview cameras much better - better picture quality, easier to use and can continually watch without being asked to “continue watching?”  In general these cameras were easy to set up, the app is easy to use and I enjoy the quality of the images - highly recommend.</span>

<span>So I got this camera to monitor a stray with a severely fractured pelvis that I am fostering. It’s in a 30” kennel mounted in the top corner that’s covered by a sheet often. It’s always what we be considered “low light” so probably the least ideal conditions and I still love it. I have not one ounce of regret. Could it be better? Sure, but I have a feeling most of my cons are addressed in the higher tier items so I’m not complaining at all.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1 it just works! I didn’t have to fuss and fight with it, didn’t really even read the manual aside from what app to download. I had to try a few times to scan the QR code on my phone, it still only took 3 or 4 minutes.<br/>2 the clarity of the picture in normal &amp; IR mode. It’s gives a nice defined image from close like I have it or across my apartment like when setting it up. it will work great when he’s all healed to maybe catch some fun cat antics in my apartment.<br/>3 on that point the connectivity on the wifi and cellular is fantastic!!! I haven’t had a single issue with it not connecting or behaving improperly once connected. It even warns on cellular that it may use alot of data. Take notes Wyze I think I could go on vacation and actually connect to this camera, I have been converted!<br/>4 It is great in low light, especially if you use the IR light in pitch black situations! I don’t because although the internet says cats can’t see infrared light my kitten disagrees when he tries to hide from the camera when I turn the IR on.<br/>5 the included mounting stuff works great. I may have made a frankenstein out of it now, but once it’s not in the cage that hardware will work great.<br/>6 it does well at all the normal camera stuff it should like adjusting focus, adjusting lighting, moving without binding, taking pictures and videos from the app, reviewing footage… all the normal stuff.<br/><br/>Cons, they are slight and if I used it like a normal camera all but one wouldn’t be an issue.<br/>1 when you move the camera with the app the camera itself can make a very slight sound. Through the app, it’s a pretty loud sound. It wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t 16 inches or less from a hurt/scared kitty… it doesn’t surprise him after 2 days but he notices. Again it’s really barely noticeable.<br/>2 it sometimes makes a slight “clickity clack” when adjusting the focus when say I reach my hand in the cage. This might not be a thing if mounted more than 2 feet from something. It also may be switching to the non IR night vision (B&amp;W). Again not real loud unless you’re right there, still not a problem.<br/>3 this one is the app, but again it’s probably because of the small kennel it’s in. I wish the motion detection could be less sensitive than it can currently be. Again when 1/3 of the image moves there’s not much you can do.<br/>4 this one isn’t specific to my situation, but I just wish the degrees of rotation for every camera movement up or down/side to side wasn’t so drastic. Not a complaint as the slightly higher priced offerings from WansView probably have finer rotation, I’m just cheap 😁<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a great camera! I will recommend it to anyone that wants a camera to monitor something whether that’s property, pets, people, nature or the inside of a small kennel. It’s just great. Not just good for the price just good. 10/10 I would buy again</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I recently adopted a one-year old dog through a local rescue agency, and, very dishearteningly, I soon learned that the situation from which my dog had been pulled was an extremely abusive one, where most of the dogs were left to fend for themselves or kept in groups in cardboard boxes. At only five pounds, Lily, my new (and most wonderful) friend, has had a great deal of anxiety as a consequence of these early-life experiences. When I leave my house to run errands on which she cannot accompany me, I crate her, and I have been (out of my own dog-guardian anxiety!) worried about how she handles my absence during those periods. A colleague of mine suggested Wansview, and she could not have been more correct.<br/><br/>Reviews of the application through which the Wansview camera works (I will discuss set-up momentarily) paint a curiously negative picture, some saying that recent changes in the application have made it difficult to sustain a connection with the camera. I downloaded the application, as the instructions requested, and I began the setup process. I thought I had done it properly and was thus surprised when the camera could not seem to establish an audiovisual connection between its recording lens and my cellphone. Here, two points must be noted, both of which will hopefully gesture toward the quality of the product and the excellent customer service Wansview offers.<br/><br/>First, the error on my part--the instructions say clearly that a new user must wait to hear certain phrases emitted by the camera's microphone to confirm that it is completely operational. Due to hasty reading on my part, I did not notice the final phrase for which one was supposed to wait, the content of which offered confirmation of a secure, steady Internet signal. Within about ten minutes of the camera having been installed, I received a notification to update my firmware to the latest version (this notification was not the consequence of any complaint I had registered; it was simply the application informing me that new firmware was available). I downloaded the firmware, and the feed began to work. Since then, I have never had a problem with accessing the feed, and I am able to check in on Lily while I am running errands. Never having owned a dog, I have had my fair share of first-dog anxiety, and I am now able to determine how long after my departure Lily whines (steadily decreasing and now only lasting a few minutes) and check in on her while she is in her crate to ensure that she is sleeping and safe. The relief of that knowledge alone makes the product worthwhile. The quality of the feed is also excellent, so much so that I play it in its SD variety (I haven't needed to go the HD route because everything is already clear as crystal). The application is incredibly easy to use, and since the successful installation I have not had to do anything.<br/><br/>Now, for the second point. Between my initial installation of the application and the ten to fifteen minutes it took for the firmwarm to update and for the camera to start working (during that time I could not maintain or open a connection between the camera's feed and my cellphone), I sent an e-mail to Wansview's customer service department. One of their agents, Melody, responded within 24 hours. Not only did she provide me with instructions on how to begin to assess what the potential issue might be and how she could help me address that, she explained that Wansview so stands by its products that if my camera proved defective I could return it at no charge or have it replaced. Because the camera was already working, I made a note to myself to reply to her e-mail later in the day.<br/><br/>When, due to my own error, I forgot to reply to Melody's message, confirming that the camera was indeed working, she followed up me with via e-mail to confirm that I had received her message and to ask what she could do to help ensure that the camera was working. I do not know if I have ever had a customer-service experience during which a company representative reached out to me a second time because I mistakenly failed to reply to their first message. In her second message, she reiterated her commitment to helping me ensure that the product worked properly and that Wansview's ethic was one that stood behind the quality of its products and the quality of customers' experiences with those products. I immediately replied, thanked her for her message, and explained how happy I was with the quality of the product.<br/><br/>In short, even if you experience any issues with this camera during setup, it seems like Wansview takes very seriously its commitment to customer service. As someone not altogether fluent in techno-gadgetry, the abundant interest in helping to ensure that I could use the camera with use certainly marks out Wansview as unique in my experience. And, the price is a terribly affordable one. All in all, I would encourage anyone to consider buying this camera, and, if they choose to do so, to buy it with the ease of knowing that there is an active customer-service team happy to interface with you and help resolve any issues.</span>

<span>I own 5 Ring indoor cams, along with a Ring Elite doorbell and a stick up elite POE cam.  This is just my input regarding these cams as I have been testing them and using them for quite sometime.  First thing is not every indoor cam works the same, some arrive with older firmware and need updating.  Plug in close to your router and do the full set up and do your updates.  Once you add the cam to the app and it’s working well, unplug it and move it to the area you want to monitor.  Do your set up either by mounting it or setting it on a shelf.  Get the angle of view your looking for and then set up your motion zone and sensitivity.  Make sure you check the “health” box to see your signal sensitivity.  If you are using a mesh router network, you should reconnect to the closest link for it, if not you may have to reconfigure to the nearest of it isn’t automatic.  Make sure you turn on the snapshot option as well.  If you don’t want to have the indoor cams record or send alerts while your home, you can turn that ability on and off with the new quick access buttons in the app.  You will get 30 days of free recording for ALL your cams, with each cam you buy. So if you decide to buy one a month, till you cover all your angles in the home, you will literally get an additional 30 days for every cam on your network covering the 50 days of cloud storage for free.  Why not use this option while it’s still available.  After you cover your needs, opt for the yearly service.  I have 5 indoors cams, covering almost 4000 sf.  I love that I can drop in and watch over the home as well as hear and talk through the cams.  Night vision in a room is great too. Makes a great baby cam as well.  I have had 2 indoor cams give me problems in the past, either dropping off my network, or the snapshot option not working.  If you have read my ring reviews before, I am well versed in networking and I have found that some ring reps want to always point the finger at every else but their devices.  I can say I have found problems in a couple of their devices and once they were replaced, the problem was solved.  Don’t allow them to drive you insane, the community forums are good but they only can go so far for help as well.  Sometimes a quick swap of the unit with a new one solves the problem.  Amazon has always backed me and they are truly behind their customers.<br/><br/>4/2020:  I wanted to be able to watch the main entrance and hallway in my home, have an eye level view, no wires at all showing, and nothing that stood out of place.  So review the attached pics, maybe this install will gravitate people who are inclined to custom installs, know there is no limit to what you can do.  Just plan out your work and never rush.  I was able to recess an indoor cam into my wall, and still provide me with all the aforementioned needs.  I used a double electrical box as it provided me the necessary room without modifying the box.  I used an indoor/outdoor ring power supply and reused the indoor cam plug on the power supply as it fits perfect and locks in.  I obtained 120v power from a nearby electrical outlet, and brought my wire into the box from behind the wall.  I mounted the ring power supply on the back of the electrical box, and prepped the box to accept the camera.  I created a clear acrylic template and was able to use that to cut out the blank wall plate.  What’s really nice is I can still unscrew the wall plate and easily remove the cam if I need to do a reset or adjustment.  This solved many issues for me and still provided an eye level video shot of persons entering the front door.  Since the ceilings are 12’ high, mounting the cam at the ceiling with a downward angle wasn’t conducive in getting a good facial shot.  This is just one example of several I have designed myself to combat issues most of us have dealing with wires, angles, placement, etc.<br/><br/>11.21.20:  After almost a year of Ring use, I have to say I am disappointed in the Ring community forum, their tech support, and products.  Just recently, I had two of the ID cams drop offline.  No matter what I did, no luck getting them back to work.  I actually unplugged a back up ID can and went to move it, that one also dropped offline and never came back up.  Tech support was of no help, and the community forum mod just tells you to call in.<br/><br/>I would think using 10 ring cameras, I know a little about them.  Based on my research, they connect to WiFi, but can’t get to the internet.  It appears that there is a high probability that my ISP is blocking the camera for possible threats, even though I turned off my firewall, set up a DMZ zone, and just about created a WiFi bridge to push the Ring cameras too, they still won’t work.  They don’t play nice since the last firmware update.  So as they fail, I am replacing them with another company.  Honestly, I don’t care what brand I use, as long as it works.  Read the community forums, and see for yourself.  Setting up cameras is not really that difficult, troubleshooting isn’t either as long as you have full control of all devices.  Ring doesn’t allow for device control outside of normal settings.  Also, Ring devices CAN NOT, be wiped clear of stored memory setting for your home network.  It’s embedded in the device.  Even if you remove it from your home network, and sell it.  It still has your network mirrored in its memory.  Found this by pure chance.  At the very lease you should have the cams IP address to clear out stored info and reset it.  Wow</span>

<span>I love this camera. I have four of the 365 day battery ones that I have mounted outside for perimeter surveillance of my home and when I was told about this one from my Son I decided to give it a try.<br/>I purchased one to see how it would preform. I set it up in less than two minutes and turned it on and left it on all night.<br/>It kept my pet in check and the video and images are so clear in night mode I had to try daytime. My goodness I couldn't believe the quality of both .<br/>I ordered four more. Now I have nine Eufy cams and I'm pretty sure I'm going to order the floodlight cam for the front of my home.</span>

<span>Unfortunately, Eufy just started forcing users to look at a shameless full screen advertisement before being able to see your camera stream in the app, and there’s no way to disable it. Worse is that it’s a white screen that is blindingly bright if you make the mistake of viewing the app in the dark.<br/><br/>10/31/22 Update:<br/>Review changed soon after writing customer service and bringing this annoyance to their attention, requesting a way to disable this full screen ad, the company removed it.</span>

<span>This gives me a better idea of what my pets are up to when I'm not home - or even just not in the same room. Night vision, motion detection, and range of motion is all great. I like that I can turn the motion detection on/off, as I don't need to be alerted when I'm at home or with them in the room. I haven't used the sound detection feature (with a puppy still getting used to his crate, it won't be helpful just yet). The only complaint I have so far is that at night, the red lights for night vision look to be on even when our apps are closed, and notifications are off. That doesn't feel right since that doesn't happen with our outdoor cameras, but I could be wrong.</span>

<span>I bought this to set up in our condo in Costa Rica and am thoroughly impressed at how easy it was to set up.  I can easily access the camera any time over wifi or cellular even though it's in a different country.  The video is clear both day and night and the motion detection is excellent.  It's much better than I was expecting given the price.  I may order a second one.</span>

A feature-packed high-speed currency counter, the Cassida 6600 is a professional money counter machine designed to tackle a wide variety of counting jobs. Fast, accurate, and equipped with a host of smart features, it is a reliable all around performer. Cassida specializes in business-grade cash counting machines, and the 6600 is no exception as a currency counting machine you can rely on for all your professional money handling needs. The feature calculates the dollar value of a denomination, as selected by the user. By activating in the add mode, users can count different denominations while keeping track of the total value. The 6600 has add, count, batch, and add + batch modes, making it the perfect choice when all around performance is a requirement. When detected by its infrared sensors, half, double and chain notes will stop the count, alert the user with beep, and display the error type on its screen. The counterfeit detection sensors are able to detect a wide range of counterfeit bills. Once a counterfeit is detected, the 6600 stops the count and dispenses the suspect bill into its stacker for removal. Pressing the start button continues the count and automatically deducts the counterfeit from the overall total. An intelligent bill density recognition system eliminates time-consuming stops common in conventional bill counters. An innovative mechanism combines the smooth counting of a back loading machine with the convenient hopper of a front loader. A built in handle makes transporting the unit easy. If you count cash for your business, or are a discriminating consumer looking for durability, reliability, and features to make your currency counting experience effortless, look no further than Cassida 6600 series bill counters.

<span>This is a SOLID money counting machine. Best by far when considering price.  I’ve been using it daily in heavy volume for 2.5-months now and it has yet  been wrong a single time.<br/><br/>I’ve also tested some counterfeit bills we recently confiscated and they never slip through undetected.<br/><br/>Build quality is great, as is the coin-counter from the same maker that I purchased, and are both much better than others including one that I’ve seen available at Costco for a similar price-point.<br/><br/>It does everything including adding up totals through easily set denominations, auto-start/stop for regular, preset, and/or custom batches.<br/><br/>The only way I could see this improved would be to have auto-detect &amp; count of mixed bill values/denominations in a single stack. But then again, that feature is usually reserved for machines 3-4x’s the price and isn’t very accurate.<br/><br/>TIP:  Use the included brush to clean the rubber wheels to keep a clean feed &amp; passthrough. The unit also comes with a extra set of replacement wheels which is great for the future once worn down.</span>
