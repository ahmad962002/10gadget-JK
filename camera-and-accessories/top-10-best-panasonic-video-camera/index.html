<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is unbelievable. At first, I was a little annoyed that you have to pay so much for a camera that lets you set manual iris/focus/sound etc. But I finally but the bullet and paid 4x as much as a regular fully auto HD cam. I'm so glad I did. I just tested all of the fancy bells and whistles that I was skeptical about. Holy crap, they all work! I got this camera for recording my own concerts. The audio is on par with some of the field recorders out there. The 4k resolution means that I can leave this at a wide angle from across the venue and later in editing, zoom into my bandmates it as if it were a second and third camera. On top off all that, I don;t have to run out into the audience to press record right before the show and then run out after the show. I can control it from my phone (this is what I was sure wouldn't work properly but it did)! The wifi range isn't long enough for a large venue or festival, but you can tap into a wifi router which I already have on stage for our sound gear.<br/><br/>I only got this camera because of it's manual control. Don't try shooting concerts with an automatic camera. The cameras don't understand stage lighting and it will look horrible unless it's a well lit outdoor show (of if the stage lights never change). Plus, they alway automatically focus on the stupid little toys and signs and beach balls that pop up from the audience. Manual settings solve all of that. You can get that with several different Cannon and sony cams for around the same price. But this camera absolutely CRUSHES it with the extra stuff. I am amazed.<br/><br/>Tip: don't bother buying the expensive larger battery. Get a usb backup charger. The kind that you can use to power a phone or tablet. I have a heavy duty one that will outlast any camera battery. If you're using a tripod, you just rig up a place to put it and you're gold.</span>

<span>I would have kept this camera if would have suited my purposes of getting professional sound out it, and it came SO CLOSE, but not close enough. I need to plug my mixer into a camcorder as I am doing Youtube demos of guitar pickups, using 2 XLR microphones into a stereo mixing board. I did get really great sound, but not at higher amplifier volume levels. The audio meter in the camera is just about worthless, very crude. I had to turn my mixer down literally almost to nothing or the camera's audio board would clip in a real ugly way. I have to use manual settings because auto gain control wouldn't give true sound for what I need to do. Otherwise, its an excellent walk around camcorder with a ton of great features. Battery life wasn't all that great, barely an hour, but most of them are like that anyway. I am sending it back and rather sad about it, but I ordered a JVC professional camcorder that has XLR inputs and a line input and a big level meter in the display, so its costing me double money to get that, but I need what I need and this camera just doesn't go there. So, if you read people plugging mixers into this camera, forget it. It can work but is just too primitive and hard to get it right. There was no level that I set that would stop the audio from peaking and distorting. But buy one if you want great 4K and aren't recording loud concerts of need to do pro audio.</span>

<span>Super impressed by this camera. It's lightweight and yet so beautifully designed to look bulky.  It has image stabilization which is a huge plus.

<span>This camera generally pretty good but may not be for everyone. The most impressive feature is the quality of the video/picture when playing on your big screen TV at home. Second is its zoom quality.  If you are filming things like kids sports you’ll need a tripod to keep the picture steady. The feel of the camera is kinda like a plastic toy not a high end camera if that matters to you. You’ll want to buy an additional battery because the filming time with multiple pause and recordings is approximately 45 minutes on the battery it comes with.  The worst feature is the touch screen. It’s very frustrating scrolling through your clips.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera after purchasing a Lumix FZ1000Mk2, to compare the two. The FZ300 was US$300 cheaper, and I wondered if I could get by with it instead of the FZ1000Mk2. I found the form factor to be a bit small for my larger hands, and didn't really care for the zoom control on the lens barrel. There have been some instances "in the wild" of the zoom lever surrounding the shutter release failing, so having a secondary zoom control is good, but this one seemed somewhat vague.<br/><br/>My background is a series of digital point and shoot cameras going back to the Agfa 1250. I've had perhaps 10-12 digital cameras since that time, culminating in the Sony Alpha 900, with a complete, and I mean complete, kit of Minolta lenses for that body. That said, I got to the point where dragging along a backpack of lenses and filters to be more than I wanted. My Lumix LX5 and LX7 languished in a drawer, the iPhone 10Xr had taken on more and more photography duties, but it in itself let me down on many occasions, especially in low light.<br/><br/>I ended up getting the Canon G5X Mk2 as a new pocket camera with a better zoom range than the LX7. What I needed along with that was a super-zoom bridge camera to take the place of the lenses I was giving up with the Sony A900, and the furthest reach I had with that kit was an f8 500mm reflector...<br/><br/>In the end, I found that neither the FZ300 or the FZ1000Mk2 really met my needs and settled on the FZ2500, which while still a very good camera for stills, has a more impressive video capability, even though that is secondary to my needs. The FZ2500 has a weight and size that feels better to me, the ergonomic feel more like a traditional interchangable lens camera, and it will record video only limited by battery and memory capacity.<br/><br/>The FZ300 is a VERY capable camera, and it is a favorite among people who shot birds. The 1/2.3" sensor gives it better optical zoom reach. In the end, I wanted the larger camera and a 1" sensor to match the Canon. so the FZ300 was returned along with the FZ1000Mk2.<br/><br/>That said, I did recommend the FZ300 to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I believe she will be happy with it. Indeed, I think for anyone wanting something that is a huge step up from a smart phone, in a fairly light package (600+ grams) with weather sealing will appreciate this camera. It simply wasn't right for me.</span>

<span>I've only had this camera for 2 or 3 weeks so my experience is limited, but so far I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.<br/><br/>This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.<br/><br/>It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is "open" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)<br/><br/>It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.<br/><br/>Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The "mixed" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)<br/><br/>The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of "creative" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.<br/><br/>The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable "quick menu", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.<br/><br/>Drawbacks I've noticed:<br/><br/>You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.<br/><br/>It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.<br/><br/>I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far.</span>

<span>This is 1 of the better entry level camcorders that I have tried and I tried a couple different brands before this 1.  Most of the other brands have some manual settings but not too many so you kind of have to live with the auto and preset settings or limited manual settings, I needed a lower priced camcorder with a few more options for manual settings and the panasonic v180 fits the bill, as well as manual focus, you can set white balance, shutter speed and iris as well as mic audio level and i am happy with the picture quality.  so I am sure a more expensive camera might do it better and have even more options and better quality video for a entry level camcorder It is pretty good, If i have a knock on it, the sound for me is not the best, I have had a little trouble setting the mic levels so it can still be heard well and not distort but maybe this is just me. So now I just hope the longevity of the unit holds up but time will tell. So if you need a nice entry level camcorder with quite a few features this 1 might fit the bill.</span>

<span>The video quality on this camera is great in the day and it's decent in low light. The camera (picture) quality is not good but its it's not the worst by far. Still have to remember it's a camcorder so it's not expected to be the best in picture mode. It's pretty small, at least for my hands, which is good for carrying in pockets but it sometimes would feel strange trying to hold with the strap around my hand. Took me a few hours to realize how to switch from seeing pictures and videos, which I'm sure they explained in the manual that I did not read. The zoom is awesome though and for the most part it's very steady, of course, until you reach past 60x and enter digital zoom. The touch screen could be a lot better and is kind of tricky if you have medium to large hands but it is still manageable. Overall I will give this 4 stars because I got it for my wedding and I know the church has low light and the videos were very nice but not professional so dont think it's going to be crystal clear. But I enjoyed it and watch it often. There is no mount in case anyone is wondering. There is no flash either. I'm only mentioning that for the ones wondering about it. I like this Panasonic camcorder though and is deciding if I want a camera from them, Nikon, or Sony around $500 so if anyone reading this have a suggestion, including Panasonic, which would tell me why I should choose them, let me know what you think. HAVE A NICE DAY</span>

<span>This is my first Camcorder, and I absolutely love it. I love to take pictures of birds, but they are too easily spooked before you get the picture taken. So, I purchased this camcorder with a 50X optical zoom lens. Wonderful! I can be 200 yards away, and still get a decent picture, and they don't fly away. I have set the maximal zoom to 90X, and I still get very good pictures! I have taken a lot of footage of Mule Deer, and I can get as close as I want - in most cases.<br/><br/>I took a picture across the mighty Columbia River and on top of a mountain on the other side in the State of Washington, at least a mile or two away, and I showed the object to my wife. It took her a few minutes to find it, but she was amazed that I could take a picture that far away. In other words, she could clearly make out the object that I took a picture of, and find its location. Most camcorders come with a 20X Optical Zoom, but this has a 50X Optical Zoom! It rocks! This is an awesome wildlife camcorder!<br/><br/>I'm still learning to pan smoothly by hand, but I now have a video head that pans perfectly. It almost cost as much as the camera, but it was worth it. Hoping to get into some action video at a zoo, races, or windsurfing. Having fun, and you will too!</span>

<span>Unlike Panasonic's own YouTube tutorial, the advertised WebCam capability is not incorporated in this model.  With the Lumix WebCam software installed, when you connect the camera using the supplied cable the viewfinder does show the necessary PC (Tether) option.  It will only output the Lumix Home Screen, not the lens image.  Since there is zero coverage of the WebCam feature in the manual or Panasonic's site other than the YouTube video, you aren't getting that feature.<br/><br/>OK, so you don't want to use it for video streaming.  Is it OK?<br/><br/>It apparently has no onboard storage like some of the cameras in this price range.  Regardless of the word OPTIONAL associated with the SD card, you need one it appears.  Nothing in the instructions say it needs additional storage unless you go past 4GB, but it does.<br/><br/>OK, you didn't expect it to have onboard storage, is it OK?<br/><br/>The camera is quite dainty.  The ON/OFF switch is smallest I've seen on a camera.  If it cold out, or you are wearing thin gloves, you might have to operate the switches visually instead of by feel.  You have to operate some of the features, like charge port, the LCD viewfinder, the top view focus knob, the flash, with your fingernails.  If you have no fingernails?  You might have to bring something to work it.  I will guess the charge port door will be the first thing to break on it, since it's flimsy and not restrained well.<br/><br/>I haven't decided whether I'll field test it or not.  I was going to use it for automotive vlogs, but I doubt it will handle light field duty.  Am I expecting too much at this price point?  Perhaps.  That's why I gave it two stars.  I'll keep using my 7 year old camera until I make up my mind.<br/><br/>I wasted 3 hours trying to make the Webcam feature work.  I have many webcams, but I thought this would be a step up.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  While the camera was sold in mid-February 2021, it did not have the November 2020 camera body firmware update v1.2.  This is what enables WebCam capability.  Sort of.  It does not transmit audio like most webcams do, it is simply a device driver for the video output.  The updating process is not well documented, but here is an overview:<br/>1)  Formal SD card with Camera.<br/>2)  Put SD card in computer.<br/>3)  Locate v1.2 firmware on Panasonic's site and download.<br/>4)  Unzip the file into the root directory of the SD card.<br/>5)  Put SD card back in camera, turn on camera, switch to review images mode.<br/><br/>The documentation does not necessarily match the DC-G100 screens.<br/><br/>It doesn't change my opinion on two stars, since the docs are poor, and it becomes a Video-Only webcam even though it has a microphone.</span>

<span>I bought the lumix as a lower cost replacement for my Sony zv-1 that met with an untimely demise. I love that it’s mirrorless and offers the option to change lenses. The onboard mics are good and it has audio tracking so the audio follows you around. Good face recognition autofocus. The only thing I miss with the zv-1 was the ability to blur the background at the touch of a button. This camera actually requires you to do that with aperture settings. The kit lense isn’t great but it’s good enough if you’re vlogging and using intelligent auto settings. If you want more performance you’ll need to pick up a better micro 4/3 lense which there are a ton of affordable options out there.</span>

<span>I was a Nikon shooter and have owned several DSLR bodies and lenses. But ever since the iPhones came out, I just wasn't using all of my "good" photography equipment as often as I should. The iPhone cameras had become "good-enough" for what I photograph (school events, concerts, vacations, family, etc...). Currently, I carry an iPhone 6 and feel that its picture quality has exceeded most 2/3" sensor point-and-shoot cameras. Still -  I often miss the detail of the DSLR sensor, clarity of true optical zoom, and the DSLR's superior low-light capability.<br/><br/>That's where this Panasonic fits in. I've been looking for a pocketable travel camera that can bridge the gap between an iPhone 6 and my Nikon DSLRs.  My requirements were as follows: small camera body, attached lens (so it can be used at concerts), 1" sensor, and a generous zoom range.<br/><br/>What's so important about the sensor size?  A camera with a larger 1" sensor is able to capture more photo detail with less noise than the usual 2/3" size.  This is most noticeable when taking photos in low light.  The Sony RX 100 III and Canon G7x are the benchmarks for the 1" sensor cameras, but I needed a longer zoom in order to shoot concerts, and sports.  As far as I can tell, the Panasonic is unique in this price range for the combination of the 1" sensor and longer-than-the-competition zoom.<br/><br/>Likes:<br/>* Solid Feel<br/>* standard micro-USB cable<br/>* Larger 1" sensor (larger than the majority of point-and-shoot models)<br/>* Longest zoom in this price range amongst its peers<br/>* RAW+JPG option<br/>* 4K Video<br/>* Touchscreen<br/>* Electronic Viewfinder<br/>* physical lens-ring control<br/>* thumb-wheel control<br/>* Smartphone integration (I can only test the iPhone app) - Live real-time camera controls, transfer photos and videos, GPS tagging<br/>* Fast menus<br/>* Fast focus<br/>* Custom White Balance<br/>* Full manual controls<br/>* Customizable Dials<br/>* Create features such as Post Focus and 4K Photo<br/><br/>Dislikes:  (these are really first-world problems)<br/>* no flash hot shoe (but its competitors may not have one either)<br/>* no external microphone option (but its competitors may not have one either)<br/>* It barely fits in my front-jeans pocket.  I have to be careful not to scratch it with the metal rivet on the jeans<br/><br/>Panasonic has this very interesting feature called Post Focus. The camera will rapid fire a series of shots using different focal points and let the user choose what to focus on AFTER the picture has been taken. Another unique feature is 4K Photo, the camera will basically take 4K video and let you extract high-quality 4K stills from the stream. I can see this being extremely useful with fast moving kids and pets.<br/><br/>I plan to add more to this review in the future...but for now, I've attached some photos samples.  I've also included a size comparison between the iPhone 6 and Panasonic.  As well as low-light comparison shots between the iPhone 6 and Panasonic in a poorly lit room. All shots including the low-light shots were hand-held without a tripod.<br/><br/>So far, every camera feature appears to work as advertised. There were comments on another website about wifi problems, I had none.  The wireless bridge between the camera and iPhone worked every time.  Note: I do have a dual-band router and although the 2.4Ghz channel was found, the 5Ghz was not. That may be why it didn't matter in my place.</span>

<span>I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's obviously solid and precise build quality. Every bit as nice as the Sony RX100 cameras. The viewfinder is very usable. I had heard it was almost too small to use but I felt comfortable using it all the time and I wear spectacles.<br/><br/>The lens is not as sharp as I expected. I understand that in putting such a huge zoom lens in this camera that there would be some compromises. Unfortunately, a loss of sharpness is not one that I can abide. If you don't intend to enlarge your photos you should be fine. However if you crop your photos there just isn't much sharpness to work with. I'm sure things would be much sharper with a tripod support, however, for a walk around travel camera who really wants to burden themselves with extra gear? I know this makes me a lazy photographer. However, I have lugged full-frame cameras with huge telephotos and a bag of lenses and flashes all over the place and back and let me tell you, a small camera like this with all its features is a joy. Still, I want a sharp lens.<br/><br/>The lens is too slow for me. While perfectly adequate for static subjects like landscapes or achitecture, you will tear out your hair trying to stop even the most gentle motion. Either you crank up the ISO and suffer increased noise or you can slow the shutter and tempt camera shake.<br/><br/>The viewfinder is very low contrast and seems hazy. Physically, it is clean. However, it just looks hazy and washed out. It is certainly usable, but the poor image quality is annoying. If you have ever used an old-style rangefinder camera with a fingerprint smeared up front glass, it looks just like that.<br/><br/>The battery life is good, a bit better than I expected. Also the camera gives several options for working with reduced power so your mileage might go up by 20% or so from usual. Also, you can charge the battery in the camera. Very nice for travel as you can use the same charger for phone (in most cases) as the camera and have less gear to pack.<br/><br/>The menus are very complete and not too disorganized.<br/><br/>The 4K modes are astonishingly useful and the focus stacking can help you get a usable photo in a difficult situation. This camera lets you exercise your creativity with so many modes and options. Or, if you want simple, just put it in iA mode and let the camera do the work.<br/><br/>The camera is made in China. (Just like the RX100VI)<br/><br/>The wireless features work as expected with my Android phone. Bluetooth location tagging is top notch for travel. On the down side, there is NO airplane mode. You have to wade through the menus and turn all the radios off if you need to go dark.<br/><br/>No "Delete First" option when viewing photos. You always have to press a button to confirm you want to delete. The extra step annoys me especially because I am so used to having this available with Nikon and Sony cameras.<br/><br/>The touch screen is what everybody seems to clamor for these days. I'll say it works as it is supposed to. Unfortunately I grew so tired of touching the screen inadvertently and having annoying things pop up that required attention that I just turned the darn thing off.<br/><br/>Be prepared to read the manual. Even if you consider yourself a photography whiz this camera can baffle you right out of the gate. For example, if the monitor does not work you may have inadvertently pushed the LVF button. Press it a few times to cycle through the options and bring things back to life. Also, what does LVF mean anyway? I finally figured out it means "Live View Finder". It's buried in the big manual online. Just like other things such as "Starlight Mode" and others. The camera has vast capabilites but they are not all laid out in a linear easy to grasp fashion. You have to practically stumble onto each one and then grope for understanding in the manual. Various bizarre icons drove me nuts trying to look them up when they pop up. Stay strong, persevere and you will catch on to it all. (Or, just go to iA mode and wrack your brain some other day.)<br/><br/>I don't like where the movie button is. I keep pressing it to turn on the camera. Perhaps I should say instead that I hate how long it takes me to break old habits but still, that's where the power button should be in my opinion. Generally speaking, all the buttons should be larger and a little bit easier to press. After an all day session with the camera my button pushing finger was pretty sore. On the contrary, the large lens ring is way too easy to turn. This makes it pretty much useless as it takes nothing to bump it and change a setting.<br/><br/>I've made some negative comments but I do find this an acceptable camera for the right user, namely, casual photographers who will not be overly critical of the picture quality and who want the many travel-oriented features.</span>

<span>I picked up the ZS100 as I was going to some indoor sporting events and they didn't allow camera bags/or backpacks, but I wanted something better than my iphone to work with.  There are several choices in the "big" sensor compact-point-and shoot camera arena.  I went with the  ZS100 due to it's superior zoom (25-250mm equiv).  However, there's a big trade off that comes with that reach, namely the slow lens. 2.8f-5.9 (tele), if you're zoomed and indoors, and if whatever you're shooting  is even remotely moving, you're going to get a blurry mess.  It's main competitors, the Canon Powershot G7 and Sony RX100 both have much faster lenses, but don't have nearly the reach of the  ZS100.  So it's a trade off either way.  Outdoors, things get a bit better, video is also quite good as you'd expect with a Panasonic .<br/><br/>As far as using the camera goes,  if you've used Panasonic DSLR before, you'll be right at home,  it's an easy camera to use.  Battery life is very good, I did a couple hundred shots without the flash and used less than 50% of the battery.  The EVF is very small, and is basically useless IMHO.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fine camera,  It won't replace your DSLR/mirrorless big sensor camera, but it does offer up a quite of bit of capability for a camera that easily fits in your pocket.</span>

<span>I previously had Canon, Casio and Sony compact digital cameras until I switched to the Panasonic LUMIX travel zoom cameras which I liked for their image quality, ease of use and great zoom range. This is my third Panasonic travel zoom camera with this one replacing a ZS50.  The ZS50 was good but it had a small image sensor and I was looking for better image quality along with low light performance.  The ZS200 is slightly thicker and heavier than the ZS50 but it feels more solidly built.  With the introduction of the ZS200, this is the first compact camera which I thought combined a large sensor with a zoom range that would be large enough for travel photography, so I purchased it for an upcoming vacation.  The previous ZS100 had a more limited zoom range and produced unacceptable “softer” images based on reviews.  A co-worker of mine has a ZS100 and complains about the camera producing soft images with a lot a purple fringing occurring around foliage.  The lens and image processor are different between these two cameras.<br/><br/>I just came back from a 23 day trip to Greece visiting Athens, Santorini, Mykonos, Delos, Meteora, Delphi and used the ZS200. I used SanDisk Extreme Pro 128GB Class 3 95MB/sec SD cards and took 5,200 photos (24GB) with the ZS200 using 16:9 format for widescreen displays, 8MP jpg, high-quality setting since am not planning to make any large prints or do any post production modifications.  I set the camera to full intelligent auto+ mode for ease of use while traveling and found the camera easy to use in terms of start up, shut down, focusing, image stabilization and framing the view using the screen.  Regarding Image quality, I feel that this camera takes excellent images in terms of sharpness, color rendition and  low lighting when placed in full auto mode.  Compared to all the other digital cameras that I have had, the battery life of this camera is truly remarkable.  After a full day of taking over 300 photos, constantly zooming, cycling on and off the camera, the battery still had two bars left.  If you just take photos with no videos, then I don’t ever see a need for having a second backup battery if you charge at night like I did<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the touchscreen because it is too easy to mistakenly bring up the side menus and make unwanted adjustments to the camera.  The on-off switch could also use more resistance since I mistakenly turned it on in my camera bag several times. It would be nice to have some water and dust resistance incorporated but maybe Panny is saving these features for future versions.  I also installed a Peak Design Leash Camera Strap Black (L-BL-3) which works better than just a hand strap in being able to walk with the camera hands-free on my neck or over my shoulder and take images on the fly.  There are some major features like manual modes, RAW format and 4K video which I am not interested in and did not use.  I am a casual travel photographer and this camera on full intelligent auto+ mode works for me.  Having owned three Panasonic LUMINX cameras, I have not had any problems which required me to contact Panasonic for servicing so I cannot comment on their quality (or lack thereof) of customer care.  I may just have been lucky in getting perfectly functioning cameras but I am not complaining:)</span>

<span> I'm going to give a review based on what I expected the camera to do, and there are a couple of reasons why I think it's a hands-down camera and who should use this kind of compact camera. It may not be for everybody, but I think I like it more than any other compact camera. I'm not going to complain that there are a limited number of features and they are not on par with features that you'd normally get on any high-end DSLR or mirrorless camera. I think it's just enough for me and those who have recently ventured into the photography world. I've been using this point-and-shoot camera for about a month and a half and these are my thoughts on it.⁣<br/>⁣<br/>An intuitive UI and a foolproof system⁣<br/>⁣<br/>When I first bought it, I had a lot of things going on in my mind. How the heck should I utilize this fancy kind of camera? Until it landed on my doorstep, I did a little unboxing and tested it out right off the bat without looking at the manuals. Toggling all the settings and features is a lot easier than I thought it would be. It all goes down to how patient you are with all the settings set to your liking. A very responsive flip-out screen makes everything seamless in focusing on subjects and tweaking exposure and ISO. You don't have to worry about the settings you use even after turning it off because it'll go back to the previous features and settings you set to. ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>Portability⁣<br/>⁣<br/>The purported weight of 11.36 oz or 322 g seems like a little burden to carry around in your pocket or fanny pack because it's very lightweight without a case on. I don't have to carry a huge backpack on my shoulder and whenever I have something to capture, I just take it out and shoot right away. Easy peasy!⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>Who is qualified to use this camera?⁣<br/>⁣<br/>I'd say most of the beginners who are on a budget are looking for the perfect camera to start off with and not for claustrophobes. ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>Focus accuracy and image quality⁣<br/>⁣<br/>The focus in the AF mode is quite spot on when there is sufficient light on the subject that you're going to capture. If not, it may be out of focus for a moment, and it'll refocus again. The AF Macro and the Macro Zoom are incredibly impressive when taking pictures of bugs and flowers with sharp details around them, and the focal point where the light enters through the lens is not too terrible when shooting in a low-light condition with minimal blemishes and grainy elements. Equipped with a 20.3MP, the output from this camera is insanely good under some circumstances where there's enough lighting. If you're into those kinds of portrait shots, this camera may not be good for you as the maximum F-Stop is only set at 3.3, but you can put a fake depth of field in the background using an advanced software called Luminar AI. ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>All in all, it's an impeccable camera for avid photographers with a reasonable price tag compared to other point-and-shoot camera brands and this one is affordable. Ease of use, portability, and great features are what I'm looking for when buying a low-budget one, and this camera does cut it and I highly recommend it!⁣<br/> ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>⁣</span>

<span>Oct. 2020: If you're photographing foliage with a lot of stems &amp; leaf edges, turn off/down i.Resolution. The "i" isn't that intelligent &amp; makes some nasty over-sharpened halos in some spots. My advice, if you like the overall look of the jpeg, shoot raw+jpeg &amp; process the raw using the jpeg as a guide. This isn't needed all the time. Only some scenes have this problem.<br/>8/14/2020 I never played with the weird 4K burst modes. I just mucked with them today. They tend to hang up the camera. They don't seem to offer much over the regular drive modes. They take up two programmable buttons I can put to better use.<br/>7/18/2019 Low light. No camera of this type is going to do well in natural light at last light (9 PM here.) This one is noticeably worse than my SX720HS. And that's bad.<br/>6/29/2019 With an upgraded SD card, I tried the high speed video. The 240 fps VGA mode worked like a dream. To access it, you have to have the camera on [Cinema Camera]M mode. WARNING: Objects in camera fall 1/8th as fast as real life. :)<br/>6/24/2019. With hundreds of pictures down, I really like the flip screen. I also like the auto bracket. I tend to keep it on 1/3 stop; 2/3 seems to be a bit wide. I've turned off the touch screen. Moving the focus position with the tip of my nose whenever I use the EVF is right out.<br/>6/21/2019. Video playback seems to be twitchy on this model. Apparently some cameras, some times have trouble playing back some videos. Check your memory card specs. Even with a high end card, playback is chancy. Recording is fine. Playback on a PC is fine.<br/><br/>6/17/2019. The only serious negative about this camera is the slight increase in size and weight over my old SX720HS. It's about twice the volume. It has reasons for that, with the added features, particularly the tilt-screen and the EVF.<br/><br/>I really like high-end, 1/2.3"-sensor, long-zoom, point &amp; shoot cameras. This one is pretty close to the limit. Much more and you have to go to 1" sensor designs, which hurts your zoom range. I currently have:<br/>-Canon SX280HS--great camera, still has features no one else has, terrible for videos (I don't care), battery hog (I do care)<br/>-Canon SX720HS--basically the SX280HS perfected. I wouldn't normally upgrade this soon, but for,<br/>-Panasonic ZS70--this camera, which I got for very short money (thanks Amazon warehouse)<br/><br/>* I wasn't that interested in the  flip-up screen, I don't do selfies or vlogs. Boy was I wrong. It allows you to snake the camera into positions that would otherwise require a contortionist.<br/>* I was interested in the EVF. It's good in dim light, but I'm used to eyeballing pictures from an external screen. Still a plus, but less of one than I thought.<br/>* I was interested in the powerful bracketing functions. Still interested, but I'll need a bit more study to make it work.<br/><br/>Generally, I shoot in P mode or M mode. Both modes work fine on this camera. The autofocus is better than on the two Canons. The focus modes take a little experimentation to find the one that works best for you, but they all seem to work. 'Standard' color balance is fine. I need to play with 'Natural' a bit to see which one I prefer. The attached photos were all taken on standard. All on a single sunny morning walk after a rainy night in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>First impression? This is a really good camera, even at the list price.</span>

<span>I have a ZS40, which I love. I sit a a bay window on my computer that looks out over my garden. I see lots of birds and use the camera to take shats using most of the time the full magnification. A couple of things don't function. The cover for the battery and SD card broke. It a really stupid design. I use some electrical tape. More critical the zoom can be sluggish and does not also extend quickly. It may just need cleaning. Its very light and small. The replacement is significantly larger and heavier. However, it has improved performance probably from the high resolution of the chip. What surprised my is that the improved screen makes it much easier to use the tiny images I am trying to find. Typically with my old camera I have to zoom in on a tiny bird from knit sat the shrub on which the bird is now perched. I can easily see the bird on the screen even before I magnify. The is very helpful when the bird is not in an easily identifiable larger object.<br/>The cover is now much better designed but ironically the cover on the side to the socket, which had an excellent design now has a staid design. It has a hinge only at the Botton of the "door", which means it twists when you swing it open. When you swing it back it remains twisted so you have to fiddle with it to get it closed. Hard to understand why they just did not use the old design. It covers the two sockets one for charging and the other an HDMI.</span>

<span>Short review for the ZS70 here, my full review shortly will be published on my blog (google camera name and photographic-central). Quick rant/explanation: I'm giving it 5 stars for two reasons- One, I can't choose 4.5, and two, there were a couple one star reviews here when either the camera wasn't released yet or there was obvious user error. To me, those aren't valid reviews so the extra half point helps to mitigate them (since Amazon hasn't removed the reviews, and probably won't I'm doing my part to keep things fair). Moving on...<br/><br/>Review: There simply aren't any decent pocket-able super zoom cameras on the market that shoot raw. As a professional and enthusiast, I demand raw. I suggest readers who don't use raw learn how to so that they can get the most out of the TZ70. This camera has a very small sensor, but, it is a modern BSI CMOS, which means it's very efficient for the size of its pixels. As long as you have reasonable expectations from a sensor this size, it will probably exceed those expectations. Image quality from raw is much better than I anticipated. The lens is very sharp through the range (just don't go over f5.6 if you can avoid it, natural diffraction kicks in). Therefore the sensor and lens combo out perform a camera of this class. Even dynamic range is better than I could have possibly thought. Credit to technology moving on.<br/><br/>When you factor in all its features (a vast array from 4k video to wireless to time lapse video), it's top notch design aesthetics (minimalist, classy, utilitarian), excellent build and ergonomics, this camera is a powerhouse of a pocketable "all in one" compact. My only wish is that the lens were slightly brighter (max aperture through the range), but otherwise it's a camera in its class of sensor size that shadows all others. At first I dismissed the ZS70 because of its packed tiny sensor, but I was shocked and pleasantly surprised looking at the image quality in raw. 1" sized sensors are still going to outperform it mind you, but this sensor is much better than you might think. Once you get it set  up, it's a joy to shoot with. That lens is so versatile for all kinds of snapshot photography- from landscapes to macros, action shots to long range stills or portraits. Its fast focusing so even actions shots are within reach.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is everything  you need in a little point n shoot, and nothing you don't. The controls on the exterior are plenty and holding it is quite lovely for one handed shooting- it's slightly larger, thicker, and heavier than the ZS50/60 but that is a good thing for a camera with such a long zoom. It makes a more stable platform when you are shooting at full telephoto. It has just the right heft to it for a camera of its size and type, welcome if you ask me. The five axis stabilization helps tremendously to keep blur at bay. Most of the controls are customizeable. The LCD is helpful for waist level shots and acts as a sort of angle bi-pod when you place the camera down for more stable shots (if you don't have a tripod for example). The EVF is welcome and usable, and helps in bright light and for extra stability when you are looking through it with the camera pressed to your eye/face.<br/><br/>I cannot get over how lovely its designed- all sides are nice n flat, nothing protrudes to snag, there's no obnoxious advertising of features on the camera itself, and everything appears proportionate and cleanly organized. The front and rear grips are improved and excellent. The design looks very Leica-esque - minimalist and beautiful. Great choice in exterior materials, the blend of flat fleck paint and satin metal. The black and silver versions are both excellent and classy.<br/><br/>If you print, you can easily make lovely prints to 13x19", and if you have some talent or stack your raw images, you can raise that number substantially (30x40" perhaps!). To me this camera is the sleeper compact out there right now. And it's likely to get more reviews and fans as a result.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is the best of the newer ZS series (or TZ series if outside the USA) cameras. It's classy, versatile, discreet, minimalist, and utilitarian. I wish more cameras were designed like this. Keep it up Panasonic!<br/><br/>Edit: My full review is now up on photographic-central blogspot dot com :)</span>

<span>In this day of camera smart-phones, is there still a place for DSLRs?<br/><br/>I say yes, if you actually want to take pictures rather than snapshots and if you are willing spend some money and are ready to haul some stuff around to take those pictures. I settled on the Micro 4/3 format because it is the most easily portable DSLR camera, and therefore the most likely to be used by me.  I don't see myself printing larger than 8x10 photos so 16mp is more than enough and overkill for social media. The regular-speed 4K video is more than adequate for and videography I will be doing (invest in a good mike to up your game).<br/><br/>A HUGE plus is the fact that this camera and kit lens that cam with it are weather-sealed so I have peace of mind taking it on a hike.<br/><br/>I look forward for using 4K pre-burst mode, it is literally a time machine, letting you capture an event up to one second before you push the shutter button! It allows you to follow your child on the field and to get the shots you really want with having to take thousands of pictures.<br/><br/>There are trade-offs for not going full-frame sensor (e.g. low-light performance, less depth of field) but the price differential, $697 on sale with a 12-60mm weather proof lens, rather than thousands for the bigger camera? It was a no brainer for me.<br/><br/>Great ergonomics, custom setting modes that can be saved to allow up to 4 different set-ups, a very good and versatile kit lens (24-120mm 35mm equivalent focal length) all in a camera that I will take on day hikes.<br/><br/>Go on Youtube and watch some videos about what this camera can do. You will see that it is still more than adequate for a hobby-enthusiast.  It has rekindled my love of photography.  Happy snapping!</span>

<span>I mostly use this for video and I'm very impressed with this camera. I want to shoot and then minimize editing as much as possible so that's why I like the G85 so much. The 4k video quality with standard un-graded settings is better than the GH4 I replaced this with.  The clarity and color is better with the standard settings and I don't really have time to get lost in post processing.  I also compared this to the Sony RX10iii and its 4k video quality was just a tiny bit less detailed but the overall look was better with the G85. Also the menu settings are so much easier with the g85 over the Sony.  Also the button placement is much more intuitive with the G85. Auto focus seems about the same but I mainly use manual for video to make sure it stays in focus.  Especially because I'm shooting in a controlled environment.  I'll miss the wide focus range but not by that much and I can always buy more lenses with the G85.  Another thing is the G85 seems like it has a touch less crop shooting in 4k so I can get a slightly larger angle.  That bothers me with all cameras when shooting 4k and I wish I could get the 35mm equivalent of 24mm out of it instead of more like 28mm in 4k. Also it seems that the  Pictures were much better with the G85.  It seems that whenever I put the RX10iii in auto focus to try to get some kid pics for fun 1 out of 5 pics came out correctly where almost every pic comes out correctly with the G85.  For me the f3.5 does a good job but it sure does look better with the f2.8 12-35 lens. I thought my untrained eye might not pick that up but it did. Everything looks better even when comparing f3.5 vs. f3.5.  It's pricey so it might not be for everyone.  I also tried the Sony a6300 and it was an amazing camera but it overheated very quickly weather I pulled the monitor away from the body or not.  So there was no way I could keep it and that's a major deal breaker.  The G85 can get warm but never get's so hot that it over heats and shuts down when shooting for extended periods in 4k.  I shot for about 4-5 hours in a row shootiing 5-8 minute vids at a quick turn around and it never shut down. It got a little warmer than the GH4 and Sony RX10iii but never malfunctioned so all is well.<br/><br/>The one issue I have with the G85 is I wish there was a 4k 30mbps instead of just 4k 100mbps.  I shot around 40 5-8 minute videos and it was something like 122Gb.  I had to use compression software to keep it which is a bit anoyying.  Love the water/dust resistance and that is what kept me from keeping the G7.  It also feels like a better made camera than the G7 with a more intuitive layout too.<br/><br/>If you are like me, an intermediate, who needs a good camera with 4k for work but doesn't want to go too deep into the post processing world it's hard to find a better camera.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Preface: I've had the camera for about 2 months now and I must say it's packed with a lot of robust and versatile features though the image quality is just okay. Let's be real, it's a small chip camera so it's naturally bad in low light and fairly grainy on cloudy days. Try to keep the gain as close to zero as possible as anything above 6dB is almost unusable, so noise correction software like Neat Video will be a must with this camera and is something to consider if new to your work flow. I already had Neat Video plugins for Sony Vegas which I have been using with my Sony AX100 for quite some time and it works well at cleaning grainy footage from the X1500 too. The Sony AX100 and 700 are very comparable to this camera, so I will be using that in my review. I am also amused by the negative reviews that complain about the manual and customer service...it's 2020 folks, learn how to Google for the full manual which is very detailed, helpful, and available on Panasonic's website.<br/><br/>Value: Buy used. This product is $1699 new, which is close to $500 less than the Sony AX100 released in 2014 when adjusted for inflation. It's clear by the reviews that a lot of people haven't taken the time to learn this camera and immediately returned it, so there are quite a few good new cameras showing up already on the used market, and quite frankly I'm jealous I did not wait to purchase one used to save a few hundred bucks.<br/><br/>Target audience: Not sure who Panasonic had in mind, but I'd say this camera is best used as a B cam for a news crew; for wildlife and bird watchers because of the long zoom, and general hobby level or semi-pro videographers (me) who want a compact run-and-gun rig and aren't always doing commercial work. That is not to say you can't get film quality shots from this camera if you know what you are doing, but I would recommended it for general ENG or documentary scenarios where you just need to get the picture and move on. I don't consider the reviews of live-streamers of any relevance to people who actually take these cameras out into the field.<br/><br/>Pro features: First off, finally getting Panasonic's robust scene file management and user buttons in a compact prosumer camera is outstanding. And compact and lightweight it is! Programmable user buttons are a must (take note Sony) and really allow customization and ease of use. User 1, 2 and OIS (3) and 5 are conveniently located and I've provided an image for my settings. I changed AE (4) to Zebra as I don't use any auto settings. User 6-12 are in the menu only and I don't find this useful, but it's there if need be. As far as Scene File, I find CINE D with KNEE mode at MID to be most useful, adjust detail and chroma as needed for your grading output.<br/>4K-60p and 10 bit H.265. Finally! 4K-60p on a prosumer build that Sony has neglected for years. I film a lot of trains, sometimes high speed Amtrak trains and high shutter / frame rate combos are a MUST. Finally some good news for budget action shooters.<br/>Oh the ZOOM range, obviously another gain of small chip sensors giving you up to 600mm (35mm equivalent) of zoom. It's a bit excessive though, unless you're a birdwatcher zooming into a tree, most of your daylight shots in practice will be marred by heat distortion, so I think a 1" sensor with less zoom range would have suited a lot more people.<br/>Let's not forget that there's a full color correction menu that allows you to dial the camera in to almost any setting to make the image look like another camera. Watch Barry Green's tutorial on this, though I suspect most people will leave this untouched.<br/>The LCD monitor is bright and adjusting to 2 is good for outdoors. It may take awhile to get used to what the image looks like on the LCD versus what the camera is really capturing, I recommend setting Zebra to 90 and KNEE to MID to avoid unnecessary over-exposure and testing this a few times over before taking it on a day of shooting.<br/>The dial knob to set gain and shutter speed is similar to the Sony AX100 and fairly straight forward, though I haven't found a way to turn off the ICON which is annoying since I only want to adjust gain and shutter and WB. Having another ring is useful and I programmed one for IRIS which took this out of the dial knob thus making it quicker and easier to use.<br/>The variable zoom speed seems good, but you need to enable fast zoom separately which is bizarre, I made User 5 this setting. I use the Magnus VC-20-SCP LANC controller and so far so good (albeit it only works when set to Sony, how about that?)<br/>The full manual available online as a PDF is very detailed, and unlike a physical manual, you can use control F to quickly find what you need.<br/>Gain settings can be adjusted by 1dB at a time, unlike the Sony which jumps 3dB at a time.<br/>Rolling shutter effect is not noticeable, which is another benefit of small sensor size that are capable of faster vertical scans. I've shot a few wide shots of 110 MPH Amtrak trains and could barely tell any distortion. The Sony AX100 is awful with rolling shutter, but that's a sacrifice with larger sensors.<br/>Focus settings are robust, auto focus seems surprisingly good for Panasonic. I am still experimenting with this, but the area / touch screen focus is really cool. If you set an area focus, you can also lock it into manual mode so if you pan across an object it won't refocus; however, in scenarios where you want it to change focus leave that on auto and if the area is panned onto an object closer or further away it should adjust without touching the screen, though it isn't always responsive. Again, play around with it.<br/>Lens hood design is really handy with the switch to flip it open. I like this a lot better than a cap that you can easily drop and lose. Of course, it comes off if need be.<br/><br/>Cons: Small chip sensor is bad in low light, obviously. I found that using any other scene file than the CINE settings showed grain or weird discolorations/artifacts even in the dark areas on sunny days. You will need to spend a lot of time dialing in the camera for your needs, but it's highly customizable and I assure you if you take the time the settings are there, I too was very frustrated at first. They really over-hyped the performance of this camera, but compared to older sensors this size, it is a major improvement.<br/>The fast zoom doesn't stay enabled when you turn off the camera and turn it back on. Seriously? Fix that in a firmware update please.<br/>There is an LCD level and frame size indicator, but no grid lines like in the Sony AX100 for quickly framing rule of thirds, I hope they add this too.<br/>No 1/50 or 1/90 shutter speed, which I found very useful on the Sony AX100.<br/>Grainy above 3dB gain, as well as no negative gain. Negative gain to -3dB would be very helpful when trying to get shots of high depth of field when opening the aperture wide.<br/>Depth of field. Well it's okay but you really need to zoom in to get any decent bokah, that's the other downside to small chip. But at least your wide angle shots will look in focus!<br/>Audio quality through 1/8" jack is BAD and UNUSABLE. I plugged in a RODE Stereo Videomic X directly to the camera and no matter what gain settings I used on the mic with the camera gain at -30dB the grainy noise of the audio was unusable. Same thing happened when used through the XLR inputs on the detachable handle, which I immediately return and renders it useless. I am now recording into a Tascam DR70D with no issues. An extra $200-300 budget for an external audio recorder is a must with this camera. Perhaps I got a bad unit, but don't take the chance. The audio quality of the on board mic is actually very good which is highly unusual, though these are hard to shield against wind and other noises, but I've found some instances where it was worth mixing into some of my tracks since I have a huge custom windshield on my Rode mic that sacrifices some quality and range at the ability to cancel out up to 30 MPH wind gusts.<br/>4K images are very soft compared to Sony. To be honest, the quality seems like 2K or upscaled HD, but it's better than any HD images out of the Sony AX100. I'm getting used to it. It by no means is bad but for such a high bitrate you'd assume the detail would be greater. Perhaps it was engineered a little softer to not reveal just how grainy this camera is in low light. People complain about blurry spots when in wide though I haven't noticed this ruining any shots, it seems if you manually set the iris and close it a little more this reduces or goes away entirely.<br/>Image stabilization. I put this is a con because it's a two-way street. The handheld image stabilization is pretty good even at zoom. I don't have a gimbal, but I suspect that combo would be very robust. As far as on a tripod, it's not that great with or without OIS on. I wouldn't use OIS on a tripod unless getting a static shoot at zoom, but, it seems as though cameras are being designed more for handheld use (WHY?) rather than on a tripod like they should be. I don't know enough about image sensor and stabilization design, but over the years cameras like these on tripods are a lot more prone to vibrations and little bumps and jar the image thus losing a lot of professional quality, which is probably due to how the sensors now "float" in the camera. Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise as maybe I should just ditch the tripod and get a gimbal, but I cannot fathom why a camera at this price point, on an ash wood tripod designed for vibration dampening no less, picks up distortion so easily.<br/>H.265 is a gift an a curse, at least for now. Not really a con of the camera, but keep in mind these files are huge and you will need to budget in plenty of hard drive space for primary and back up storage, especially when most editing software currently cannot smoothly play back H.265 (even with high end computers) and you will need to spend time making proxies into H.264 which I do with the free version of Davinci Resolve. This is something to keep in mind as part of added workflow, but the benefit of the archival quality of H.265 is great. It's just like 2006 all over again when we struggled to play back HD, lol.<br/><br/>Conclusion / TL;DR: In my opinion this is NOT a camera to be used on auto with out of the box settings, I wish camera companies would stop trying to push that. Learn manual folks, or don't film at all. If you never used a camera similar to this and are upgrading from a small home video camcorder, it will take you a LONG time to learn, longer than the 30 day return period, but it's worth it. Two months in and I am still dialing in settings and learning new things and that's after coming from a similar camera like the Sony AX100, it gets better as it goes, trust me. Price point is good, but I never thought I would be buying small chip in 2020. Despite some decent pros of this, I think Panasonic would have satisfied a broader customer base by making this a little brother to the CX-350 and packing a 1" sensor into the design for better low light and DoF performance, and don't say it can't be done because this camera is basically the same size as the Sony AX100. This camera feels like a 2015 design that got delayed until 2020, but the user interface and customization to almost any application is there. Panasonic clearly thought about a wide range of users and engineered the UI of the camera well, but what good is all that if the image quality isn't quite there? Now, it does come down to picking the right tool for the job, so I hope these points I outlined help with that decision. Overall, a solid 3.5 or 4 star camera, though I might grow to like it more. Lost a star for sure for the unusable 1/8" audio jack (see above), so you will need to budget an external audio recorder. The camera as a whole really needs a firmware update though, but as is I would still recommend (save money and buy used if you can!).</span>

<span>First off, the camera produces beautiful image quality in both 4K and FHD. The compact size and features makes it perfect for on-the-go setups where you need to grab a camera and shoot with little setup time. I think with the increase in online streaming for especially house of worship this camera will fit into many single camera setups. I bought it for the compact size, the SDI output and the hope that the low light capability will work in the environment I shoot most of the time (inside a building with not so great lighting).<br/><br/>I give the camera 4 stars because it is compact and packed with features. It fit the bill for two of my setup needs but the part that did not work so well is the low light capability part... the low light capability is really bad. If you will use in a place where you cannot control lighting and lighting is not ideal then you may end up with dark images or grainy if you increase gain to compensate.<br/><br/>Otherwise if you are shooting in really bright settings like outdoors or a controlled environment where you can control lighting then this will fit in perfectly. Consider what is important to you and your setup and where you need to compromise before buying. Unfortunately I returned and went with Sony PXW-Z90V. For a few dollars more you get amazing low light capability with all the same features.</span>

He likes that it uses lithium rechargeable batteries so we bought extras, but it has great battery life.  No problems with it so far.
