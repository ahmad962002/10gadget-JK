<span>I have a 37’ fifth wheel and we had the rear view camera installed by the dealer, we then decided to add the side view cameras our selves it was a very easy install with the pre wired system my trailer came with and the pairing went smooth. The only negative i have is the view i wish i could change the angle of the camera view just a little it seems to be angled out more than i would like. Other than that i love the cameras and the brand name.</span>

<span>Very easy install especially if you have the Furrion prewire from keystone.  Just undo two screws, remove the blank, add the camera(note it comes with the camera and the marker light but if you have the prewire from keystone you just need the camera as you already have a Furrion pre mounted light), two screws back together to hold it in, and pair it to the camera. Note i already had the backup camera and 5" Furrion vision S monitor.  Total install time 10 mins and that was in the dark.  The marker light they send you is LED, the one my 2021 montana had is old school bulb, but it still works.  Now have two spare marker side lights in case I ever need them.  I havent road tested these yet. My backup camera signal is very weak as 41ft fifth wheel, ,the signal is much stronger to the side cameras. I lose signal from time to time on the backup camera(pretty common on big truck and long fifth wheel)</span>

<span>I installed these in place of the front side marks lights on a 30 ft trailer. Other than reversing the wires to start the install was very straight forward and simple. Just be sure you have the positive and negative wires on the trailer correct. The only work when the lights are on so keep that in mind. They five a great view down the side of the trailer and aid greatly in negotiating lane changes and tight roads.</span>

<span>After spending hours doing a careful high quality installation into our 2010 VW Jetta TDI, with a modern Sony head unit, the video quality is very poor.  I tried rewiring it all based upon rumor that VWs (and other German cars) use an oscillating voltage technology called PWM.  The video is great when the engine is off, but it flickers wildly when the engine is running - especially when we need it the most, when backing up in reverse.  I like the form factor (how it mounted on the license plate) but I would not buy this camera again.  It's unusable.</span>

<span>If your RV trailer said it’s pre wire it’s not . You will need to run a few more wire to the unit to make it work the right way. For example if you run the turn signal wires it will automatically change to that side once you turn your turn signal on . Also to be able to use it at night for security you need to have a + wire and to your batteries. I put a in-line fuse 5 amp that we remove when we store the RV in out house .</span>

<span>Just a quick note to let other 2014 model 2 Prius owners that this harness worked good for me.  I used this to allow me to connect a back up camera to my cars original radio head unit.  With my connection I connected the power to my camera through my accessory power (I connected to the 12v wire just behind the cigarette lighter which is located in the area under the shifter).  I know that these backup cameras installation instructions tell you to connect to the reverse lights, but the computer tells the radio head unit that the car is in reverse and switches the video to the backup camera.  The only connection that I used was the RCA jack for the video.  There were two wires that intended for connection, but I did not connect either one.  The are a couple of you tube videos that clear up the camera connections.  The other thing that I learned from a YouTube installer is that you don’t need to connect the ground to the camera as it gets ground through the video (RCA) jack’s shield ground.</span>

<span>The unit looks well made and everything you would need is in th box. But, and now i have bought "used" from Amazon a bunch, with very little to no issues. both of these products were in the used catigory. but have either of them work is just dissapointing. I'm just nearing the final days of a 1 1/2 year truck build and thought/know this would be a perfect addition to the custom interior.. that being said, asi stated vbfore the product looks to be well made and i love the screen size, which made me purchase it again even after the first one being defective.. im hoping to return them both just as soon as i can get down to one of those drop locations. I dont think ill be chancing it a third time. What a bummer...</span>

<span>Setup was easy enough and it worked as soon as I turned it on. It comes with only a quick start guide which does not have enough operations info. I had to play with it to figure out how some things worked. I hate that. A manual is online which contains more info, but still the bare minimum. The manual is well translated from its original Chinese, but one annoyance is the MPH indicator on the display is shown as mp/h.<br/><br/>All the connections are on top of the unit so the cords poke out and look ugly. The huge brackets holding the unit to the mirror look ugly as well.<br/><br/>I bought this for a small box truck which has no clear rear view. I mounted the camera above the roll-up door. When aimed so I can see close to the truck (for backing up), I can’t see more than a few feet down the road. When aimed further out so I can see traffic behind me, I can’t see what I might back into. The camera doesn’t have enough angle to do both. The camera needs to be mounted low to get both views, but there isn’t enough cable to do so.<br/><br/>The unit is designed to stay powered all the time since it has a parking mode. I didn’t drive my vehicle for three days and when I tried to use it, my brand new truck battery was so dead I had to replace it which cost me $90. After that I pulled the power plug whenever I parked. This runs down the dashcam’s internal battery. Now I get a “low battery” message in the middle of the screen until the internal battery recharges.<br/><br/>It records in settable 1-5 minute clips. Locking the video (either manually or due to G-sensor shock) locks the current clip only, which could have just started and be only 1 second long so most of the action may be on the previous clip. There is no way to lock the previous clip once it has completed. If you want to preserve it, you need to pull the microSD card out until you can copy the file to your computer.<br/><br/>The mirror-like display is only half as tall as the video being recorded. Therefore, you can only see half the picture on the display. You can scroll it, but this isn’t very useful when driving. You can display both front and rear views side-by-side in which case you can see the both pictures in full, but the pictures are tiny and hard to see. Plus displaying the front view is not very helpful except when aiming the camera.<br/><br/>The record indicator is located in the upper left corner of the display and flashes constantly. It is very annoying. I put a piece of electrical tape over it.</span>

<span>This mirror is a nice and easy way to add a dash cam and a backup camera to your car if you don't have an in-dash display. However it has some major drawbacks:<br/><br/>1.) Most rear view mirrors have a tab below them that you flick at night to prevent you from being blinded by the headlights of cars behind you. This no longer works with this mirror installed, so you end up getting blinded at night or can't see behind you.<br/><br/>2.) On a lot of cars, especially older ones that this product is ideal for, when you start the car the accessory power turns on for a second and then turns off when the starter motor is running and then comes on again. This confuses this mirror and it ends up thinking you've turned on and then turned off the car, so it'll end up shutting down right as you turn on your car. Extremely frustrating, because then it ends up turning off right as you start backing out of your parking space, and you can't use the backup camera. This mirror should just stay on as long as power is applied.<br/><br/>3.) It's impossible to remove the Kingslim watermark from the videos<br/><br/>Because of these issues the mirror becomes almost unusable at night and very frustrating to use during the day. I paid extra for this mirror because I wanted a higher end version with all the features but it seems to be lacking in some key areas, and I would look for another option.</span>

<span>It is a well thought out design. One of the best elements is the adjustability of the screen. It allows for easy adjustment and stays in place after its adjusted. The ball and socket mount is a great idea and allows easy viewing angle no matter which way the sun is entering the car windows. The volume knob stops you from searching for it while driving, that is a nice feature as well. It doesn't have some of the features as other units which cost more but what it does have actually works. Android auto works like it should, back-up camera view is clear and makes it easy to see what's behind you. The only thing I wish is that you could dim the daytime screen more. Overall for the price and its options, is worth the purchase. I am very happy with its performance.</span>

<span>So, Boss has never been synonymous with high quality stereo equipment. Let’s be honest. It’s no kenwood, alpine, etc. However! I’m actually impressed as I’ve had no issues buying $1k head units over the years. This is quite decent considering this massive touch screen! Graphics are decent for an automotive unit. It’s no 4K TV, and i haven’t found any company that can stack up to that claim for a 12 volt audio system. Touch screen is nice and sensitive as a modern phone would be. Boot time takes about 12 seconds which turns out that I don’t even notice as I start my truck and get settled in. Menus are easy to navigate.<br/><br/>A complaint (and I’ve order a replacement that hasn’t arrived yet) is that when the system turns on the volume is very loud. You go to turn the knob to make it quite and it shows the volume is already at zero. It stays loud, rotate the knob forward and the volume suddenly goes quite! Very strange!<br/><br/>Now, for phone calls it does the exact opposite. It rings at a normal volume, and once someone picks up and the counter timer starts for the actual phone call, the volume goes to zero and you can’t hear the other party and you have to turn it up quickly. So, you are forced to pay attention to the timer so you know when you can turn up the volume. If the car stays running after these initial adjustments, it will act normally until you power off and on again. Then life repeats itself. Seriously hoping the replacement doesn’t act this way.<br/><br/>It’s definitely annoying and assuming it’s an isolated incident, this is a very good unit.<br/><br/>As for basic software on it, I just don’t use it. It’s always CarPlay.<br/><br/>I am running Apple as well.</span>

<span>The backup camera image is poor. It lacks detail, there is too much contrast which prevents anything in a shadow from being visible, the banner across the top blocks too much of the view, there is a constant wave-like distortion in the image, and the backup guidelines cannot be adjusted enough to be useful. Boss replaced the cable and the camera, but it did not solve the issues.<br/><br/>The Blue tooth connection cuts in and out.  The handsfree calling does not always work. When I call out, the person can hear me, but I can't hear them. The opposite happens if they call me.<br/><br/>The radio works, but the sound quality is mediocre. The programmed station application is quirky.<br/><br/>The Android Auto works but loses connection frequently.<br/><br/>When my headlights are on, I have to turn the dash light intensity to max to prevent the monitor from flickering on and off.<br/><br/>The monitor sticks out too far and looks like a monstrosity.</span>

<span>Bought these to replace my canary cameras due to them moving everything under a subscription. So im using these with the sync 2. Quality is pretty good but grainy when zoomed in and they don't seem to connect to the 5 network. only the 2.4. App is pretty basic and the login gets stuck sometimes making it so I have to close the pap out and reopen. This is for android. What really stinks is the app doesnt have a gps feature to auto arm and disarm when you leave/com home but you can work something out using IFTTT but it really should be built in. YEs you can schedule times to arm and disarm but that isnt too convenient when you don't have set times that you leave and if they are armed when you are home the notifications just pile in.</span>

<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<span>Let me start off by saying that these Blink indoor mini cameras do NOT prompt you to continue live view after 30 seconds, or whatnot, as other reviewers try to say. Maybe they did at one time before I ever got mine, but with the current software there is no interruption to live view.  However, the doorbell and the outdoor cameras will prompt you to continue. And the only reason I can think that the company sets the cameras up this way is due to the fact that the indoor cameras are plugged in to an electricity source  and the outdoor cameras and the doorbell run off battery and maybe it's a battery saving tactic. Then again, as far as the outdoor cameras having interrupted live feed. Is it really that big of a deal? Who is just steadily watching outdoor feed unless something suspicious is going on? So why complain? It's really not a hassle to tap a button if you're seriously need to watch something live.<br/><br/>Honestly, for the price, I'm pleased with these cameras. My main reason for buying them was just to home some type of home security incase someone was to break into my house. And to also check in with my kids as I please to make sure they arent up to no good after school until im able to get home from work. I have no problems with the motion detection working as it should. The image is great for a 30 some dollar camera and the night vision is also good.<br/>I have pretty good WiFi so I've had no issues with these cameras nor any of my outdoor cameras.<br/>You really can't complain about these cameras. If you do, Invest in a $1000 security system.<br/>If you're here reading my review then obviously that's not in your budget. So go ahead and purchase some. Unless you have crap WiFi service which will cause problems with the cameras working properly....they should satisfy basic needs.</span>

<span>I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.<br/><br/>Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.<br/><br/>I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!<br/><br/>Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>What is best wireless backup camera?</h3></h3>
    


There is no best wireless backup camera because what may be the best for one person may not be the best for another. Some factors that should be considered when choosing a wireless backup camera are image quality, portability, and price.
<h3><h3>Which reverse camera is best?</h3></h3>
    


The best reverse camera would be the one that is most easy to install and provides the clearest view of what is behind the vehicle.
<h3><h3>Which is better wired or wireless backup camera?</h3></h3>
    

Wireless backup cameras are typically easier to set up and use, but wired backup cameras can be more reliable since they don't rely on battery power.
<h3><h3>Are wireless backup cameras worth it?</h3></h3>
    


There is no definitive answer, as it depends on many factors such as the size of one's vehicle, the model of backup camera and what type of wireless receiver is used. Generally speaking, wireless backup cameras can be a helpful tool, though they may not be necessary for everyone.
