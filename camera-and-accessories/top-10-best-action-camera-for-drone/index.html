<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I recently purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim for traveling and jobs. I usually put the data on USB sticks, but I wanted to use something better. The IdeaPad has a MicroSDXC slot, not a SD slot. I looked for a MicroSDXC that was faster than my USB Sticks.<br/>I was surprised that 1066x cards were now selling at reasonable prices. And I have been using Lexar and Samsung - the Lexar won in this purchase.<br/><br/>It is fast as a high speed drive through a 3+ USB port.<br/><br/>Recommended!</span>

<span>I purchased this camera specifically for its ability to live stream in the 360 degree viewing angle (uses lenses on both sides of the camera) when it worked, it was great, however, over a short time period, it became inconsistent and then stopped live streaming in 360 degree view altogether. I contacted customer support which if I understood correctly, one person works in customer support that is able to communicate in english. This means leaving a message and they will call me back as soon as they can. I was getting error codes on the insta360 One x2, often. When I read the codes to customer service, they said their engineers had not ever received these error codes before but that they would get back to me when they had a solution. I also sent (by their request) video of the malfunction (I screen recorded the error codes and what would happen when the camera would not allow me to live stream in the 360 degree viewing angle). Tech support and the engineers did not ultimately offer a solution and I did not hear from them again. Because all of this happened within the thirty day return time period, I was able to return the camera but had to wait two weeks from the date they received the camera, to receive my refund (this was highly frustrating) and I also was not given the choice to exchange the camera which would have allowed me to be sent a replacement, right away, and return the malfunctioning camera. But this option was not available to me. A highly frustrating experience. I give the camera five stars because I really like it in every other way and it’s a great idea, great build quality, and if they can fix the live streaming in 360 degree viewing angle, would be a masterpiece. I still like the camera but will wait until they offer a solution to the live streaming in 360 degree.<br/><br/>Also, to clarify, the many times I called and spoke to customer support (I would be required to leave a message) the same person (I recognized her voice) called me. So I asked if she was the only one that works in customer service and she said no, but that she was the only english speaking person that worked in customer service. Stating that if I knew their language, they have many customer service I could speak to. She was nice except when a couple of times she told me I asked too many questions. I’ve never been told this by any customer service, before. To me, it’s normal to ask questions when I’m trying to understand something and especially when I’m trying to find solutions.<br/><br/>Also, it would be wise to mention, I had purchased the additional warranty offered on the insta360 One X2 website, I think it cost 39 dollars and provides a one year free replacement (one time only). This warranty at the time of purchase, was not available here on amazon. It appeared I was required to purchase this warranty from the insta360 one x2 website. Which it says one has three days maximum to purchase this free replacement warranty, from the date of camera purchase. I purchased the free replacement warranty and when I returned the camera, insta360 customer service told me that the free replacement warranty is not returnable, even though I clarified that the camera was still within the thirty day return policy and is not working properly.<br/><br/>All that said, I still like the camera very much and hope to one day own one again. I will watch closely to see how the live streaming feature in 360 degree viewing angle is working for everyone on their YouTube videos and social media videos altogether. Thank you for reading my review! I hope you have a wonderful day!</span>

<span>UPDATE 12/2021: Regarding the lens guard comment at the bottom and the Insta360 Care plan you can purchase - GET IT! I used it for the lens scratches and their service is great! It saved me a $220 repair. But I’ll definitely be using the lens guard as I don’t want to have to get it repaired again. And they were super fast sending me the details.<br/><br/>This review is for the Insta360 One X2 camera.  The personal and professional possibilities with this thing are real. There are a lot of Tutorials on the app to create some cool looking stuff, but it takes some thought and creativity ahead of time and some of them don't work as well as they should. HOWEVER, the real beauty of this thing is the invisible selfie stick and the "VIEW FINDER" feature. The invisible selfie stick (I bought the 2 in 1 selfie stick and tripod which was a good move) works great. The camera stitches out the stick very well. The View Finder feature allows you to basically be a "live" camera man after the fact. You shoot the 360 video, then when in the app to edit, you move the phone around as if you're shooting a video, but you're recording your camera moves within the 360 video clips. You can pinch and zoom and if you play around with how you're holding the camera when filming, you can get some REALLY unique and cool shots that you can't get with any other camera. The one lens action cam setting is good, and I really like the dual multi view mode where it films the front camera and the back camera. Stabilization and horizon lock is insanely good.<br/><br/>WORDS OF WISDOM: ABSOLUTELY GET THE LENS GUARD! I did not and I regret it. Spend the extra $20. The lenses protrude (as 360 cams do) and if it hits the ground, it WILL scratch. It fell lightly on some rocks from 2 feet up and got a scratch that was bearable, but noticeable in video. I crashed on my bike and the lens hit the concrete and it's unusably scratched. Also pay for the Insta360 Care on their website. I did and I'm sending mine to get the lens repaired and then will promptly be putting on the lens guard.<br/><br/>If this thing would do something higher than 30fps in full 5.7k resolution, (like maybe 60 or 120), overall rating would probably be a 5 star.</span>

<span>The GOOD:<br/>This camera alone is a fun camera to use and play with.  I love the fact that you can record all directions without worrying about missing a shot (but you still need to be mindful of the direction you point your camera).  To get the best video quality  without giving yourself or the viewer a headache you need to actually point and record with the lens facing the subject (if you're taking clips from a weird angle the video doesn't look that good.)<br/>The battery life for the most part is pretty good considering it's supposed to be waterproof (haven't dared to test it in water yet).  I find the battery outlasting the gopro and also the dji osmo action.<br/>Price vs video quality is not bad, I would say it's very competitive with gopro and dji BUT still not as good as my phone (S22 Ultra) video quality.  I mainly choose this over my phone as I wanted to have a camera that acts like a cameraman for me so as I'm doing activities this will be able to capture myself.  (very capable).<br/><br/>Now... The CONS:<br/>I really hate that there are no good lens protectors (well they have a premium protector that is like $50, but even that can get scratched or cracked and you're out $50) that are cost efficient and don't hurt the video quality.  I've read many reviews that any lens protection available still depreciates the quality.  I've opted to not get a lens protector yet but just the rubber lens cap for now.  I'm extremely worried for the lens getting scratched or worse cracked.  I don't see this as an action cam and the GoPros and DJI osmo action definitely has this beat as far as durability.<br/>I do find that the camera does heat up pretty warm when recording for awhile, I haven't got any errors in regards to overheating but have had issues with the micro SD card not being able to record fast enough (even though I'm using a 128GB Sandisk Extreme 160MB/s card.  The camera just ends recording and shuts down.<br/><br/>Video/Data Transfer to Phone &amp; Mobile App - A HUGE NEGATIVE and<br/><br/>Potential Deal Breaker:<br/>First off, the Insta360 app is a pretty decent app which allows editing to be fun and intuitive BUT... I find the process EXTREMELY frustrating, time consuming, and not efficient.<br/><br/>The ONLY way I currently can transfer the recorded videos from the camera (micro sd card) to my phone (S22 Ultra) is via wifi connection with the camera and only through the Insta360 app.  (I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY OTHER WORK AROUND).<br/>I've tried via USB cable - USB C to USB C does not work (I read on forums that ONLY THE INSTA360 USB C cable will work, I haven't tried yet because it was not provided with the camera and can only be ordered through the Insta360 site for $8 + $18 shipping and tax?)<br/>I've tried taking the micro sd card out and using a card reader - DOES NOT WORK, the app doesn't load any of the files via card reader.<br/><br/>I don't mind taking the time for post production editing the videos (ie adding keyframes, exporting, adding music).  Took a few hours just to edit a 7 minute clip, and I still needed to import the clips into another video editing app, BUT the end product is awesome.<br/><br/>THE ISSUE - they advertise that you don't need to download the clips in order to edit in the app BUT if you choose not to download and edit straight from the camera you are consuming the camera battery as well as your device battery (the camera itself also gets very warm, also the video clips lag when editing).<br/>If you decide to download the video clips from the camera to edit it TAKES FOREVER! and on top of that you still need to spend time to re-frame then export which also TAKES FOREVER!  During the download and export times, your phone or device is pretty much unusable because you have to wait for the processing to complete.<br/><br/>If I had to reconsider my purchase this big issue would have changed my decision... Hopefully this information helps others to make up their own minds.<br/><br/>If Insta360 would of just provided the USB C cables (USB C to USB C) this issue probably wouldn't have been a deal breaker.</span>

<span> This camera changed the method of filming. I always caught myself behind the camera lens instead of in front of the camera lens missing the action or just basically not being in any footage. This changed the whole method as I now just hold the camera in front of me and its if I have a personal camera crew following me. I don’t have to spend so much time behind the camera and focusing on what I want to film and not to mention I am in the actual footage now as well. This has brought a whole new light to being able to enjoy where you are instead of spending so much time on trying to capture it all behind the camera and missing things at times. Post editing allows you to rotate and focus on the key points of your footage. Do not get discouraged with the post production editing as the Free insta360 application is very helpful in pulling out creative shots and there are tools and tips for everything. It will seem challenging at first but I guarantee the more you fool around with it and watch some how to videos you will be breezing through your editing and be back to enjoying the whole experience of 360 degree photography.<br/><br/>There are many 360 degree camera on the market but insta360 one X2 has been around and keeps improving with every revision. This camera has a small footprint and has all the pluses you would want with removable batteries and storage as well as a small LCD screen to check on media or change settings. Quick access button on the side to press and jump right into recording the action. Works well with picking up 360 degree audio as well. Solid premium feel in hand with nice grip, no cheap feeling.<br/>Comes with a protective pouch as well to protect that every so delicate lenses but I would suggest the other thicker silicone lens guard that the company sells. The footage and overall experience I have had with the camera combined with the software has led me to not look towards competitors. I just look forward to the next revisions as it’s amazing on the new innovative things they come up with to make your video recording even better. If you are in the market for a 360 degree camera, there is no need to look around more as I cant see you having any complaints with this camera as it hits all the check marks for a camera in this market.</span>

<span>I love this camera in its design. It's like DJI listened being very forward thinking and revolutionary but some things were not worked out before they released this.<br/><br/>This takes a rip from the Mocacam. Except the Mococam was nowhere near this level of quality but the concept is the same. Same magnetic modular concept.<br/><br/>But we're not here to talk about that camera we're talking about this Action 2. Let's go over the 5 aspects a camera should be.<br/><br/>Image quality: Its good. Good colors clarity its there for an action camera. On par with the leading competitors. Good POV 4x zoom nice controls Pro option for a little more hands on adjustments.<br/><br/>Image stabilization: It is one of the best without a mechanical 3axis gimble. Again on par with the leading competitor. Nice horizon lock and options. Its quite good and a leader in this area.<br/><br/>Audio: Records Good audio. Good playback speaker as well. But ya gotta be in a somewhat quiet area. No need for audio boosts in post. The recording gets better using the attachable module. More mics 👍<br/><br/>Audio input: External mic input. I can plug in my mics with USBC. Trying to find an adapter from 3.5mm to USB C ... 😐 Good thing I have mics with USB C.<br/><br/>Waterproof: The camera is waterproof but only the main camera not the secondary screen or battery pack with SD card. 😕<br/><br/>So this is pretty cool and I like it for the most part. They came up with the simple magnetic lanyard that I have been making myself with magnets for mounting on my shirt for years. I use round magnets that you can purchase anywhere. I started this with the Snapcam as there was no stability in wearing a camera around your neck. Its a simple thing.<br/><br/>The magnets on this camera are strong and it's backed up with clips 👍 must have read my Mocacam review. 😆...🤨<br/><br/>This comes with good attachments. Gopro style mount a table top stand the lanyard you can screw on to a 1/4 20. I like this camera. It's pretty good but could use some updates and changes. So if I like this why does it only get 1 star? ....<br/><br/>This thing overheats fast. It gets hot in 5 min. Not warm HOT. Even not recording in 4k. In 4k depending on ambient conditions the camera too hot warning im going to turn off and if your not paying attention to my screen because you're focused on your video you're not going to know and get mad later warning comes on in 10min - 20min 😳 in 1080p there's a power reserve setting and I can go 35min before the warning but the camera is hot. Right now it's a nice hand warmer 👌 it's about 50deg.<br/><br/>Battery life is tricky. The main camera can get about 35-40min before the red bar. And you kinda think we'll it is tiny so... but my Hero Session goes way longer. So does my Drift Compass. Even my Polaroid Cube goes longer. 😮<br/><br/>But I still like this camera.<br/><br/>The other thing that I have complained about to DJI because I have the Action, 4 Pocket 1 and 2s and gimbles and whatnot is the Activation and App. It took me hours of downloading and redownloading and turning off just about all my security measures on my phone to download this intrusive spyware app. I tried from the Playstore and it did not work and had to go to their website. The Action 2 isn't even listed. So scan again and again the QR code, my phone even gives me a warning that downloading from this site could damage my phone. 🤨 I sign away all my security just to activate this camera. 😡<br/><br/>We all know it's a data grab. Why do you need access and control to all of my phone. Contacts text messages why are you tracking me? I said I would never purchase another DJI product because of this because it does compromise your security. Spam and Eggs.. But this was a camera I thought of and DJI made it. The price tho is a bit high at $520. When action cams go over $400 ... 🤡<br/><br/>Is this a camera you should go out and buy? No. You're not going to be happy with its flaws. Is this a camera you buy because you're a camera nut like me and can live with its quirks because the revolutionary outweighs the quirks. Yes. I will say though you probably should wait for a price drop and I have a feeling this will go on sale for Black Friday. 😉</span>

<span> AVOID THE PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS! IT RUINED MY TRIPS WITH GIRLS.<br/>English is not my native language. Forgive me if any issues.<br/><br/>1. EXTREMELY HOT!<br/>HOT TO TOUCH after running 10mins at 1080/30. Don't dream you could take a 4k handheld with it. 4k60 would only record less than 5 MINS before it stops. Even after updating to the latest firmware, the battery balance function between the main module to display module would never work. The display module WOULD CHARGE THE MAIN MODULE CONSTANTLY if the main module is not a full-on battery. (Which drains the battery, cause heat even you turn off the machine). Not only does it generate heat, but also ruined your videos. For example, I was shooting 4k30 under straight sunlight for three minutes and it popup a hot warning. BUT IT DOES NOT STOP RECORDING!  The voice recording getting more and more lagging and finally cut off, than the video's signal.<br/><br/>2. Production or Design issue with the pin connection ( See my video, sorry for its the Chinese language)<br/>I found the issue when mounting the cubic on my car hood. If you mount the two cubics together on mounts runs with a shake, it would lose communication between the card and machine randomly. Start recording, few seconds, and it beep, then stop. WHY DID YOU MAKE A CAMERA THAT COULD NOT USE IN ANY MOVING SCENARIO?<br/><br/>3. THE DJI MIMO APP WAS A NIGHTMARE<br/>On Android 12, which few lastest phones got, every time you load with apps it loads resources and asks for permissions. OK, I can take it. But AI editor was working on android 11 would not work anymore for half a year. (I have other DJI products too, exp OSMO mobile/Action) Downloading any clips from cubics would drain its battery, and the fastest I got is 20m/s. The most of time, it pop-ups saying an unstable connection only got 6 to 10 mb/s. You probably think you can use the cable to connect it to the computer. NO, THE USB PORT IS USB 2.0, which is super slow. IT WOULD BE A DAY AND NIGHT DIFFERENCE IF YOU TRANSFER FILES WITH A CARD READER.<br/><br/>4. PICKY CARD CHOICE.<br/>I got there Sam's EVO Select card, it's got 90m/s read and write on all test software. But you the machine can take it at the original firmware, not the updated one. It runs hots, and card speed getting slow down. Boom all things happened inside the 3 mins timeframe. 40m/s MicroCenter TF card? Yep, I will take it. 60m/s Sandisk? Why not. 90m/s Sam ? Nah Nah Nah. But Sam's PRO card works. I got no idea<br/><br/>5. TOO MANY PROBLEMS I HAVE NOT ENOUGH TIME TO WRITE DOWN.<br/>Using this is like asking your father to help you with your housework. It never works man, it never works.<br/><br/>Thanks to Amazon providing me with the best solution they could. I called them, they redirected me to the DJI care team. I gave all the issues and suggestions. YES, I AM A DJI FANBOY, I AM JUST SAD. Not disappointed just sad man. I do not trust this device at all scenario anymore.</span>

<span>At first I was a bit hesitant to get the Action 2 because it looks different, but after looking at a few Youtube reviews I got really interested because the modular design actually makes the Action 2 more adaptive than usual cameras. Whereas the GP10 got heavier, the Action 2 got lighter compared to its predecessor. It is more comparable to the modular Insta 360 One R but I preferred the Action 2 because you can't go wrong with DJI. 4k videos are buttery smooth and I really enjoy the wider FOV. Cropping for stabilization is very acceptable and horizon levelling is better than a GoPro. The Action 2 has tons of features and I really like gesture and voice commands so you can take videos and photos even when you're on your own. The DJI Mimo App is really helpful for some light editing work and for sharing files.<br/><br/>I have both the DJI Pocket 2 and the Action 2 and both have their uses. For vloggers and for those who want a tough handy device that can virtually do anything you want with it, the Action 2 is a must have. I've put the Action 2 through the wringer and it has survived time and time again. I can't say enough good things about this thing.</span>

<span>Insta360 ONE RS<br/><br/>After having this camera for a few days. I can say I am impressed. I own the ONE X2 and the GO2 from Insta360. Both cameras are nice but I wanted something to compete with my GoPro Hero 9. Looking at the ONE RS and this Twin Edition it makes perfect since to go with this camera if you are looking for a 4k action camera and a 360 camera.<br/><br/>The two lens allow you to be so much more creative. Getting normal action camera shots and the wild 360 shots all from one camera. Here are my pros and cons so far.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>-Multi lens compatible<br/>-compact size<br/>-amazing stabilization<br/>-easy to use<br/>-nice tough screen<br/>-great case design, easy to take the camera in and out of it<br/>-amazing app for editing<br/>-No memory card errors like GoPro has all the time.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-sound, this is a downfall of all action cameras<br/>-low res 360 when exported<br/>-no ens cover for the 4k camera<br/>-4k Lens is not replaceable like the GoPro 9 and 10 are<br/><br/>For the week that I have had this camera I am impressed with it. After using 3 different GoPro’s over the years, and also using the ONE X2 and GO2 cameras I feel Insta360 has a great camera with the ONE RS. The new 4k boost lens is nice since it has in camera flow state stabilization. This will save time if you don’t want to use the app and go right to your favorite video editing software.<br/><br/>If you have used the GoPro Hero 9 and 10 you will know the touch screens are not as good as they should be. The ONE RS seems to have solved this issue. The screen feels more like a phone screen and response to your touch quickly and accurately.<br/><br/>The number of accessories that are out already is really nice. Most of the ONE R accessories will work with the ONE RS. Also if you have a ONE R you can upgrade batteries, the Core or Lens if you want. No need to buy the whole camera. I hope that Insta360 sticks with this design for years to come.<br/><br/>Having a Insta360 camera now that can recored in 4k is a really nice add to my camera collection. I feel in the months to come I will use this camera a lot more than some of my others. Having the two lens and the ease of use really helps with that.</span>

<span>I have purchased this camera for a week and it is my first action camera. I have found a lot of fun using this camera. The camera came with a 4k lens and a 360 lens. I use 360 lens most of the time. There aren't many camera came shot 360 video and photo. The camera come with the normal and HDR vides mode. Compared with normal and HDR mode, I had tested and put the came on my windshield when I was off-roading. It has done a great job on stabilization. The videos were explicit and without any bury. By using the 360 camera, I can take a 360 degree picture and choose what I want to show. This camera has powerful mobile eiditing app and fast WIFI transfer data to my phone. With the 4K lens, the videos fouce on 4K wide angle. I feels like I can use this camera to build my videos collection on sports and my daily life. The camera gets hot when taking any videos. Overall, I LOVE this camera. I.m looking forwrad to fullfill my daily collection. The pictures shown was using long exposure.</span>

<span>The camera itself is competing with GoPro and many others - but it stands out of the crowd.<br/><br/>Beside having a 48MPel sensor + 360 dregree full sphere view + gyro stabilization + ... the camera has also great editing software for your phone and your PC/Mac which allows to e.g. create a spectacular video very quick " *post* production".<br/>Capturing the video couldn't be more easy - and the selfi stick doesn't even show up on the final video. Thanks to the gyro, the camera knows always the direction and lets you edit the camera movement easily later on when using the 360 camera. You can do things quickly what usually requires pro equipment.<br/>The result is really good!<br/><br/>The 4k burst lens has then (only) one lens reaching (less than) 180 degree - but a really high pixel density of 48 mpels to get high res shots.<br/><br/>Again - the built in software has lots of programs / settings to utilize the power of the camera.<br/><br/>So how does it work? You pick the lens you want - so 4k burst or 360 degree lens, take the camera base (computer) plug them together, take the battery and plug it on, then you take the bracket frame and click it around. Done. You might want to also add a selfi stick. Now you are ready to use it even within salt water to do some snorkling!<br/><br/>The phone can be used to control the camera - or the built in screen (even though the many swipse need to get used to - but a built in first use help is getting you on the way.<br/><br/>So this sounds all great! Are there also downsides?<br/><br/>Well - yeah.<br/>- You need to decide before you do your shoot what you want to use - 360 or 4k burst. Changing the configuration does not work in some environments. If you like one over the other it is easy! but then there might have been cheaper choices?<br/>- I was using the 48 mp mode in brightest daylight in Hawaii. I was quite surprised to find some noise in the pictures. I would have expected that to be nearly not noticable with that resolution. But - I suppose that many people do not go so much into details. So call me a pixel peeper.<br/>- If you are into quality you will notice the slightly blurry seam between the two 180 degree sides of the 360 camera after stitching. However this is of course expected if you have only 2 cameras. So this isn't really a surprise, In fact the surprise was that it was better than from other cameras I have seen before.<br/>- I tried to download a 3 minute video to my phone - and it worked for ... 20 minutes? without finishing. [Note: this might be because of the next point - so your experience might be better there than mine.]<br/>- Well - after exchanging the 360 lens with the 4K lens the wifi connection to my phone died. I pinged the customer support which was surprisingly online at a late hour - but the ping pong between messages was about 30 minutes - so after 40 minutes you got instructions on what to do next. In the end it turned out that the Wifi was apparently broken and I was asked to send the camera back. As I just got it a day before and I have barely used it (8 minute of recording) I did send it back for a refund.<br/><br/>So in short:<br/>+ I am really impressed by the camera and the included software - really excellent!<br/>+ Lots of use cases which allow you to create spectacular content of your hobbies!<br/>~ Do not expect the quality from a good camera only because it is 48mp. However it is decent.<br/>- (For me) the wifi died within 20 minutes of overall use.<br/><br/>Would I have kept the camera if the wifi would have not died? Heck yeah!</span>

<span> My experiences with action cameras have been with inexpensive off-name brand knock-offs, which, while they do get the job done, they’ve always fallen short on performance.<br/><br/>Pulling the trigger on buying this camera was at first a gamble for me, but the payoff was quickly realized literally right out of the box. The included video was the first footage I shot using the 360 lens, capturing the night sky, and using a template from the mobile app brought. More stunning footage has come from other uses of the app’s templates which instantly produce results, but also teach you tips &amp; tricks on using the camera. There’s so much more that this camera offers than any other action camera. It’s well worth its cost.<br/><br/>It’s not without a couple of nits however, it’s given heat warnings while shooting on a hot summer day, and not coming with a separate battery charger makes fiddling with a USB access cover a nagging chore. Both of these gripes are easily correctable.<br/>Beyond the beautiful imagery and awesome functionality, Insta360’s design path of modularity has made this camera a GoPro killer. You need two GoPros to equal this one, and don’t count on the camera to be yesterday’s news later on. You can count on more lenses, &amp; upgraded firmware to extend its live &amp; your investment. I’m glad I waited to buy big, with the arrival of this camera.</span>

<span>I owned drone for 5 yrs and after a dozen flights I put my drone in its case and thats it. I lost interest to fly until I bought this fpv avata. I can’t wait for my three more batteries to enjoy the whole weekend with my 10 yr old boy. I tell you he even fly more aggressive on this drone lol. That’s why you need to get from dji the insurance. And he didn’t know how much this little thing cost :) and Don’t get the Asurion here. I heard a lot of complaints. All in all get this drone with the latest goggle. And you will enjoy this with motion controller. You might but the extra controller but for me the motion controller is more than enough. And don’t forget to register this to FCC.</span>

<span>I’ve had an Air 2S for a little over a year now and wanted to experience an FPV drone but hesitated because I get motion sick. The Avata is very sleek, compact, and rugged. I’ve only flown the Avata 3-4 times but it’s been an overall pretty good experience, expected from DJI.<br/><br/>The first time I flew it, maybe 5 minutes I did feel a bit dizzy after, even with some motion sickness bands. I’ve read other reviews where it’s something you’ll get used to more in time. The next few flights I would say I didn’t feel as dizzy. The Motion Controller is a fun new way to fly your drone but without an actually controller, there is no way to put it in manual mode and it is limited to 30mph. The controller is another $200. I would rather have had that and purchased the Motion Controller if I wanted it.<br/><br/>Battery lasts maybe 12 minutes before you need to make sure you’re close to Home. It will auto land and there doesn’t seem to be a way to cancel it. Battery will charge faster with a 65W laptop USB C charger.<br/><br/>Even though the Avata is compact, the glasses, controller, and battery pack make for a less than light pack. At this time I am likely going to return it, mostly due to motion discomfort and I don’t think it adds much, for me, over my Air 2S. Annoyed that it didn’t come with a real controller, my Air 2S in Sport flies faster. May purchase again if they offer a better package but paying another $500 for a controller and 2 batteries, and a carrying case is not exciting above the $1200 to buy.<br/><br/>Lastly, there does not seem to be a way to transfer videos from the Avata or glasses to your iPhone. Perhaps I am wrong? Otherwise you need to connect it to a laptop which is strange.</span>

<span> The Avata should appeal to pilots of all experience levels who want to capture high-quality, dynamic, cinematic drone footage. It's fun to fly, captures great video, and is a stepping stone for anyone who wants to dabble in the world of FPV.<br/><br/>Forget about the people complaining about DJI's decision not to sell a package with the FPV controller. I believe this was done in order to prevent inexperienced but overconfident pilots from crashing their drones and causing a bunch of supply chain headaches by demanding replacements through the Care Refresh program. I'm sure DJI will offer a package with the FPV controller in the not-too-distant future, if you don't want to have to purchase the controller separately.<br/><br/>First, the Avata is a BLAST to fly (even with the motion controller). It's designed for flying in close proximity with other objects. Indoors, through trees, under and through obstacles - this thing really performs. It's been a while since I've had this much fun with a drone. I'm also blown away by the quality of the footage that comes out of it. The colors are great, right out of the box, and the stabilization is fantastic.<br/><br/>The Motion Controller is NO GIMICK. It's a really amazing piece of technology that allows inexperienced pilots to get their feet wet with FPV without months of practice and expensive drone repairs. It's intuitive, responsive, and accurate (check out the attached video to see what you can do with the motion controller). It does have limitations - for example, you can't fly backwards with the motion controller, nor can you do a proper orbit without engaging the head tracking feature in the goggles - but the pros outweigh the cons. Once you're ready to up your game, you'll be able to buy the FPV controller and continue your drone journey.<br/><br/>The goggles are simply amazing. The image quality is spectacular, and the transmission distance is just as impressive. Transmission distance decreases sharply when there are a lot of trees or other objects between the drone and the controller, but it's still very impressive. I will add that the goggles can be a bit uncomfortable when worn for an extended period of time, but taking a little break between batteries should help with that issue.<br/><br/>Battery life is also very impressive. From what I understand, the typical cinewhoop battery will provide 3 to 7 minutes of flight. I've been able to get 14 minutes with the Avata with brand new batteries, and expect that they'll provide a little more after they've gone through a few charge/discharge cycles.<br/><br/>All in all, the Avata is a fantastic product that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone in the market for a new drone.</span>

<span>I won't lie I was tremendously skeptic about something this small and lightweight being able to produce any kind of good quality photo. Sometimes you'll get something that advertises one thing but then when you get it there's pixelation and distortion. I was tremendously proven wrong! This thing gives amazing photos and videos! I do videography on the side and one of my obstacles has been packing so much equipment and getting it through airport, to unload it on the other side, to get it into the car and then on to my event. For smaller events that don't require a lot this thing is absolutely amazing. And the best thing is it can fit in your back pocket.<br/>The one thing that I did not know in advance is what was needed for live streaming. I assume that once I connected my phone to the camera which provides a bigger screen for you to see what you're filming, I thought that I could stream through my phone. You cannot. You have to have the transmitter that fits into the bottom of this device in order to stream. The device calls $99 here on Amazon. The gimbal itself is very functional and it's tracking. What I mean by that is if you are walking it doesn't necessarily do a quick tracking that sometimes causes the camera to move too quickly. It's more of a slow gentle glide which is great depending on what you're filming. The downside to that is if you're filming something where you are moving rather quickly the gimbal will lose the subject and you'll have to recalibrate it again. All in all I would highly suggest this for anyone looking to do great photos or video while traveling.<br/>As far as it being water resistant I do not dare to try that out yet. But I'm currently just enjoying how this works. Battery life could be a little better. After 45 minutes of continuous filming I was down to 27% battery. And that was from it being charged 100%. So if you need to film longer this is a challenge as to the charging port may make it difficult for you to charge and film at the same time. You definitely would not be able to plug in your phone and the charger at the same time on the gimbal. All in all is a great product I highly recommend it</span>

<span>I had the first Osmo Pocket for two years and I really enjoyed it, it had a few downsides though like when a room was even a little dim, you could see visual noise in the footage and photos. Also whether you were outside or inside, the contrast and exposure were sometimes all over the place. The only way to TRY to fix it was to adjust the settings manually for each shot...but even then...there were limitations.<br/><br/>This Osmo Pocket 2 is much better in the sense that when I filmed the same dim rooms or low light settings, the camera performed much better with little to no visual noise. The contrast and exposures are much more even. If you're filming a landscape that is in shadow, but there's a bright sky, this Osmo Pocket will adjust the light so you can see the ground and landscape -which is an improvement because the last pocket would adjust for the sky and make the landscape look even darker.<br/><br/>The Pocket 2 also has better sound, its clearer and sound tracking allows it so the microphones pick up wherever the camera is pointed. I generally use an external mic, so I'll admit I haven't used the built-in mic features much. The Pocket 2 also starts up faster, but the power button is now a separate button on the side of the camera, be careful not to accidentally press the button when you're taking the camera out of the case or pushing it into the case.<br/><br/>Speaking of case, the last Osmo was held into the case with a silicone strap, this one doesn't use a strap, it uses friction...which I think is a bad idea because over time It will wear away at the sides of the camera, making it look bad. I can already tell that's whats going to happen.<br/><br/>The camera advertises 4k and HDR.. BUT what they don't tell you is that the HDR is not available on the 4k setting, it is only available on the 1080p setting. That being said, the 4k setting by itself is a vast improvement over the first Pocket, and by doing a bit of color grading in post-production, it could pass for HDR footage.<br/><br/>I was a bit confused when I bought it because DJI kept saying this has zoom, but they went back and forth as if it not only possessed digital zoom but also optical zoom. Let me clear that up. THERE IS NO OPTICAL zoom not even 2x optical zoom. It uses digital zoom only, which I personally don't like, so I don't use it.<br/><br/>The camera still gets warm when shooting in 4k mode, however it doesn't get nearly as hot as the first Pocket. My first pocket would get so hot the camera would shut down. This one doesn't. At least it hasn't yet. I like the little joy stick that comes with the camera. It allows you to move the gimball without neading to physically move your arm. This is useful for steadycam walking footage where you need to suddenly look up or down without switching to FPV mode. Just use the joystick. It moves the gimball at only 1 speed, but its a slow steady speed which is still good for getting steady footage. It would be cool if DJI incorporated software that allowed it to speed up or slow down from that speed when you push the joystick...but otherwise its a nice feature.<br/><br/>If you're new to Osmo Pocket, it is NOT an action cam, and it is NOT a lowlight cam. It's best use is for daytime/sunset vlogging, walking tour, steadycam, or getting high-quality footage in a convenient pocket size. So don't get it wet, and don't try to shoot in near darkness or extreme sports.<br/><br/>Everything in your shot is always in-focus, so don't expect the kind of background blurring you get with DSLR's focus. But if you want that kind of blurring, you can do that with Adobe Premiere Pro or Photoshop, so don't worry. I have shot near-DSLR quality footage with this camera and after doing some adjustments in post-production it looks amazing. I highly recommend this camera for vloggers, or for professionals when you need some extra camera work done with convenience.<br/><br/>As for the camera, the old pocket advertized a 12 MP camera, this one advertises a 64 MP camera. Normally that would mean the 64 MP would have a resolution almost 5 times the size...but in this case, the resolution is only a little bit bigger, the difference is in the camera's ability to capture detail.<br/><br/>I really like this camera, I think its a huge improvement over the original Osmo, for me it is the perfect camera. I personally don't need any other cameras because this one does everything I need it to do. But I know a guy who uses this camera ALONG WITH his DSLR and he gets great footage that he pieces together into a cool video.<br/><br/>So try it out. I think you'll like it.</span>

<span>The DJI mini 3 pro does live up to the hype. Great camera and the DJI RC is a step ahead.<br/>However, unlike the durability of other drones I've flown, this one will break apart if obstacle avoidance doesn't detect an object. When I used follow mode, it was flying at 4ft and hit my house. The gimble and one of the LED lights broke apart. For such a slow speed and low elevation, it shouldn't break like that. I returned it, but I did order a replacement.<br/><br/>Just a precautionary tale for anyone looking to order a mini 3 pro. It's the most delicate drone I've flown.

This is why I wanted my first drone to be under the 250g weight threshold to avoid registration and avoid obtaining a certification/license while I am still learning. You will see that opting for DJI's Fly More Kit Plus (extended range batteries) pushes you over this limit and may subject the user to the registration process. I suspect the DJI app would know that you have inserted the heavier-extended range batteries and would require you to enter your certification/clearance permit before taking flight. I truly am impressed by the weight of this drone. Even the controller is heavier than the drone itself!<br/><br/>Geo-restrictions Built-in:<br/>From what I can tell, the DJI Fly app is robust and includes local geo-restrictions that may prevent you from taking off in a restricted area. I still use apps such as the B4UFly app to ensure that there are no local or temporary ordinances I may violate before taking off. But having geo-restrictions built into the app helps beginners who don’t understand the hazards a drone may cause to not fly in an area until it is safe. I am also certain this feature has something to do with DJI’s eventual remote ID to comply with any future FAA drone registration requirements.<br/><br/>Camera:<br/>The camera on this drone is a BEAST! It takes breathtaking videos and pictures. You would expect the standard night shooting results on a camera when taking a video (though a word of caution when flying in low-light environments). However, night pictures using the 48mp camera easily capture the hidden scenery. The various pano settings also generate beautiful views regardless of time and makes you wish you were actually in the area observing everything below.<br/><br/>Battery Life:<br/>Can I just say WOW! The battery life is very impressive. Even though I would like to purchase the Fly More Kit Plus to utilize the longer-flight time batteries, the extra weight would kick this drone out of the 249g range. Fortunately, DJI has done a fantastic job with its sub-250g batteries. The flight time always depends on conditions (e.g., wind), but I have averaged anywhere from 25-30 minutes in a single flight. Given how fast these batteries charge, having a few extra spares charging while you fly would give you unlimited flight time! Of course, ignoring the standard longevity of lithium batteries when discharged fully between cycles, haha.<br/><br/>Personalize Controller Setup:<br/>The controller has on function button that can quickly change two settings that would normally take several clicks in the app to reach. Pressing this button once or twice in quick succession would trigger two different functions of your choice. In addition, the app has allowed me to flip the flight control of the joysticks. Growing up, I played many games where flying a plane was required. The default flight settings were inverted to what I am used two. I was very surprised that DJI included this feature which has made me learn to fly a drone easily.<br/><br/>Binding of the Fly-away Refresh coverage:<br/>I purchased DJI’s 2-year Refresh Plan that includes fly-away coverage. But for some reason, the setup has always been confusing. The app appears to know that I have an active subscription because I needed to include my drone’s serial number when purchasing the plan. However, I am randomly stopped from taking off because my plan has unbounded from my drone, and I would have to restart the system before it would bind properly. I am sure this is an easy software fix, but I do not understand why the plan does not simply remain bound in-between some flights.<br/><br/>Sound of the controller:<br/>The speakers on the controller are loud and grabs your attention. This is great when you are so caught up in the breathtaking views that you may miss important warnings like your drone is low on battery. However, there have been multiple occasions where I simply turn on my controller, which beeps continuously, even after the drone is connected. I have no idea why but it gets annoying very fast. There is no hard switch on the controller to silence this beeping, and restarting everything does not help. Eventually, it will go away unless there is something wrong with the drone. When you finally connect to the drone, you may finally see notifications that need your attention.<br/><br/>The Durability of Propellers:<br/>Extremely poor! Be very careful when flying with imperfect props. The slightest divot may send your drone rolling during take-off. These props do not withstand even the slightest impact at all. I strongly recommend having extra spares on hand if you are a new pilot because you don’t want to run into another supply crunch. Having extra good props on hand will get you back in the air quicker, rather than waiting for days after ordering.<br/><br/>Return to home ("RTH") Inconsistency:<br/>The GPS feature on these drones is great. You can visually see on the app how many drones are currently connected to your drone. However, if you use the RTH feature, BE VERY CAREFUL and watch it closely. You can still maneuver the drone after enabling RTH. So when your drone begins to descend on your neighbor’s roof instead of your driveway, gain some altitude and cancel RTH. Then manually land where you need. Simply put, DO NOT TRUST RTH.<br/><br/>Obstacle avoidance:<br/>Unfortunately, the must-have feature I waited for before buying my first drone also falls under the con portion of my review. Recognizing the need to stay below 249 g, it would be difficult to include omnidirectional sensors. The Mini Pro 3 only has forward, backward, and down-facing obstacle avoidance sensors. This means flying it sideways or in orbit would expose a new user to the hazards of hitting an object if they are not watching the drone in the air as they should. Remember, there are NO side sensors for obstacle avoidance!<br/><br/>Runs Hot on Idle When Transferring Recordings:<br/>DJI should implement sensors in the drone to turn off certain flight features, like the gimbal, when the drone's props are folded in. While transferring footage to my phone, the drone can run extremely hot because it is not air-cooled as it would when flying. Even when my props are folded, the power-hungry flight components are still being used. I normally stick my drone in front of a fan when I am transferring to cool it down. This method works, but I shouldn’t need to do it in the first place.<br/><br/>Inconsistent Transfer Speed:<br/>The app offers a quick-transfer feature by allowing your phone to connect to the drone directly via WiFi. You can turn off the controller in this mode and get a theoretical transfer speed of 25 mb/s. But for some unknown reason, the transfer speed can get stuck at five mb/s or bounce between 5-10 mb/s. I am not sure what is causing this difference. When I get the advertised 25 mb/s, it is under the same conditions as the 5-10 mb/s transfer rate. Just be mindful of your drone running too hot with slower transfers and reference the header above.</span>

The ONE X2 is Insta360's pocket-size spherical VR solution with dual- and single-lens modes. In dual-lens mode, also called 360 Cam Mode, the camera uses both its front and rear lenses to capture immersive 360 5.7K resolution video with automatic internal stitching, and then using the companion iOS/Android app, you can navigate through the shot and select a specific angle and share it directly to social media. Single-lens mode turns this 360 camera into a standard camera that you can capture regular shots with. This mode, also called Steady Cam mode, uses FlowState Stabilization with an advanced scene-detection algorithm to digitally smooth out your shot so it looks more steady. The ONE X2 is designed 33' waterproof as is, without any waterproof housing required, so you can take it underwater with you as well as use it in the rain. The camera also features a round touchscreen on the front for framing and monitoring your shots.Type-C * Note: This version only supports wired connection to Android devices (via Micro-USB or Type-C).

<span>it took me awhile to figure out the interface on the little screen. Other than that camera is pretty good. I have already experience with Gopro Fusion, and I can tell that this one is much easier to work with. Not sure what's with the invisible stick. Part of it is visible, and besides, it could be any selfy stick for that matter. I like the stabilization, definitely working good.</span>

<span>POS<br/><br/>In order to use any AI feature, you have to download videos to your camera over its wifi. There're more problems than I can count with 1 hand: 1) You can't use internet on your phone while this happens. 2) Wifi is slow 3) Files are large 4) You can't put files in you sd-card, all goes to root. 5) This connection is spotty, and app is buggy, so expect to spend hours before editing anything. 6) AI feature is buggy, so expect re-work.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, I don't have that kind of time. Sure never miss a footage because it captures 360, but you're gonna miss a lot of  life getting anything from this camera to facebook.<br/><br/>So again POS.</span>

<span>This camera does a pretty good job of 360 degree videography. Due to its straight and slim profile, and the standard 1/4 inch screw mount slot at the bottom. it's the best on the market for invisible selfie stick shots. Competitors which use the standard GoPro type mount are far more likely to have tiny misalignments which will give you the ghost stick problem in your image.<br/><br/>The colors and clarity are quite good in good light, but lose something in less than perfect light. If you're hiking in a shadowed area, or in the time before dusk/just after sunrise, the colors will get dull and muddy. The HDR function seems to give duller colors pretty much full time, so I stopped using it.<br/><br/>The one really irritating problem is that the voice command function became problematic after just a few uses. It will only respond to voice commands about 1/4 of the time, if that. You can hold it right in front of you and say "stop recording" loudly and clearly, and it will keep on recording. Get used to trimming the ends of your videos, because you'll need to trim out the part where you lower the extended selfie stick and stop the recording manually.</span>
