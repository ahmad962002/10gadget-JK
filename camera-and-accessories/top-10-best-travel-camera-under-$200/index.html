Perfect for travelers, the Panasonic Lumix Digital Camera DC FZ80K brings the legendary optical performance of a super long 60X (20 1200mm) DC Vario lens with amazingly stable O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) to a highly portable point and shoot travel camera. With a powerful 18.1 megapixel MOS sensor, the Lumix DC VARIO camera lens features a super bright F2.8 5.9 aperture range that is optically stabilized with Panasonic’s Power O.I.S. technology to add striking depth of field dimension to your photographs even in low light conditions. The high resolution power of 4K video technology captures up to 4X the resolution (3840 x 2160) of standard Full HD, enabling you to create printable photos with 4K photo's blistering 30 frames per second burst feature. Post Focus and Focus Stacking provide for additional creative freedom by allowing you to change depth of field or focus points after you take the picture. The Lumix FZ80 perfectly fits in your hand with an ergonomic grip while its rear touch enabled 3 inch LCD display and high resolution 1,170K dot viewfinder remain clear even in bright sunlight. Convenient travel ready technologies like USB charging and Wi Fi connectivity to your mobile device make the Lumix DC FZ80K a digital camera that everyone can enjoy.

<span>Great easy-to-use camera, you don't have to know all the tricks, the camera has options to do the work for you.<br/><br/>Great zoom for video - Excellent captures of my son's football games even from the stands.</span>

<span>Bought this for our granddaughter as her first non-iphone camera.  She is thrilled with it so far.  It has a fully automatic program mode that allowed her to begin shooting good looking photos immediately.  She loves horses and has been using the camera to take photos and videos.  Yet the camera has many advanced features like a serious telephoto zoom, full manual, aperture preferred, shutter preferred modes, and much more.  Nice touch screen to allow easy access to menu options.  At this price, it seems like a very good deal.</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.<br/>4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.<br/>Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.<br/>Cons:<br/>Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no "action" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.<br/>No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.<br/>Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode)<br/>My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only "A", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.</span>

<span>THIS IS a great camera for the price. The optical zoom is the equivalent of a 1000mm-1200mm manual zoom which is incredible and the wide angle is 24mm. SO I can take beautiful up close flower shots AND last winter I shot a lighthouse that was 400 yards from where I stood and it looked like it was 50 foot away. I have ONE SERIOUS ISSUE with the camera. The 3"  LCD screen washes out so badly in bright light I had to buy some sun shades from Amazon so I could focus on my target, but they are cheaply made, fell off, and break easily, and only help the wash out a LITTLE bit. IF Cannon would put a viewfinder on this camera it would be THEE best Digital Camera in it's price range. Honestly I would have easily paid another $50 for it if it had a view finder. Otherwise, I DO LOVE this camera, I belong to a photo group called NY Outdoor Photography and receive fine responses for my posted pics!</span>

<span>This was a gift to my husband. He uses this LUMIX for a lot of macro photography, related to his work. Getting focus on desired subject can be challenging. The instruction manual could be improved. By improved, I mean more complete. It’s like parts of it are to refresh one’s memory, not to actually teach usage. Also the automatic metering gives such priority to the outer/background of the frame that the background when dark leaves the foreground subject over-burned. Macro capabilities could be upgraded. My last model showed an anti-shake feature. Is this here somewhere?</span>

<span>Surprised at first came out blurry. I use this for work. Takes a while for the taking picture to process so you can see it on the screen. Zoom could be better. I highly recommend staying with Sony batteries. I tried an offbrand and it had 50% of the life that the Sony battery does. When I am on a job site I usually have to change batteries halfway. So having the Sony brand battery really does help.</span>

<span>***UPDATE AFTER MANY MONTHS OF USE***- For my videos, this is an OK camera, but it dies SUPER fast. You need like 3 extra batteries on hand if say going out for a day trip No other camera I have had (about 20 of them in my life) has died this fast. The pictures are rough. I would say 3 out of 5 are blurry. I have to take numerous photos to get any that aren't the least bit fuzzy. It might be closer to 4 out of 5. Sometimes it's minor and you don't notice w/o zooming in. I didn't realize that problem very fast because I use it more for YT videos than anything else. Also, the shutter speed for photos is rather slow, but it's a cheap camera, so that isn't too abnormal there.<br/><br/>The pros to this camera are that it is small, light-weight and films video in the 16:9 widescreen I need for my online videos. IF I could turn back time, I would have returned this camera and bought something a little bit pricier and better all around. Oh well. Hopefully, I get a better one from Santa Claus :)!!<br/><br/>I love this camera so far, as far as what I bought it for, my You Tube videos and other stuff. I only used it one full day, but the battery STINKS!! My other cameras last 5x's or more longer. Did I get a bum battery???? I charge it fully and take video and it starts going down to one bar and done FAR too fast to be normal. I read reviews that said it lasted people through many flash photos and videos during the day. I'm wondering if this is a camera I can take out for a day trip or not. My husband thinks maybe I got a bad battery. Anybody have any issues??? I love that it doesn't change the lighting to an orangey color, which is what the problem was with my more expensive, larger cameras. It's all over the place with those, which makes editing sooo difficult. This seems to stay true, and the video quality is very good. I wanted a 1080, but I cannot tell the difference to be honest. This is worth the $$ in the quality dept. &amp; it is a Sony. I haven't taken photos yet. I'm just concerned about the battery. If the battery gets replaced and lasts a lot longer, than I will give this a better review. PS- The size is great, but very tiny compared to my old point and shoot. In a crazy house like mine it may not last the year lol. All is good but the battery. I'm thinking that may be a defect.</span>

<span>Before I begin, my previous camera was a Sanyo vpcT1496R 14MP camera.<br/><br/>The people that say their phones are better either have brand new phones, which some of them come with 13MP+ cameras....or got a defective camera.<br/><br/>This is a good camera. I can actually use the zoom and it isn't always a blurry blob. (It can still be a blurry blob depending on settings, but it doesn't have to be) I haven't really messed with any settings. I've put it to where the display shows standard and not the actual quality of the photo to save battery, and the pictures still look way better than my old camera. I can't wait to someday go to the zoo and take pictures with this thing.<br/><br/>The battery life is fine.<br/><br/>I bought this from Focus Camera on Amazon. I mention this due to the one problem. I got the European version and I live in America. It came with a European charger which isn't compatible with American plugs. It came with an adapter that isn't even listed in the parts that can come with the camera....which means this could've been a used camera (albiet one that was taken care of) since someone had to open it to add the adapter that doesn't come with it. The adapter could be a POS and cause problems. Amazon did fix it by letting me order a charger and refunding me the amount (Amazon, not the seller). Note: the authentic looking chargers (the ones that look like the one it was supposed to come with) are the ones where you take the battery out to charge it. Which I dislike because that means every charge....gotta put the date in and everything (warning for those who get the correct charger)<br/><br/>Minus the charger thing, it's a good camera. It's fairly cheap as well. Sony usually has good quality in their electronics, though you can always get a dud.<br/><br/>Edit: Since reviewing this, things have changed: This thing is flimsy. Out of NOWHERE the part that pushes out and pulls in the lens broke so now the camera refuses to do anything beyond tell me to turn it off and on again. So I can't suggest you buy this camera unless it's the only half decent one in your price range.</span>

<span>I am not a professional photographer by any stretch, but I did meet one years ago. He has nothing to do with this review. Sony was not the first name I thought of when searching for a digital camera. However, I am happy I made this purchase. My lady and I are both nature enthusiasts and both love local historical sites. The size of the DSCW800 makes this product easy to carry on all of our adventures. With the addition of an SD card, we never seem to run out of memory. The Sony Memories online program is easy to use and a great way to back up the shots we take.<br/><br/>Now, what do people expect from "point and shoot"? You are not going to get a super clear zoom from far away. At least not if you are looking to highlight a specific object. The DSCW800 is fantastic for capturing photos in the moment. Landscapes are beautifully rendered and the panorama feature, which is my favorite way of shooting the outdoors, is seamless. Highly recommend this item.</span>

<span>Great little camera.  It won't win any photo contests but it takes good, clear photos with decent light.  Bit uneven / can get blurry in low light conditions without flash, but no worse than any other pocket camera or even the best smartphone cameras out there in my experience.  In dark settings with flash, it does good enough, no complaints.  True optical zoom in a camera this price is a huge bonus.  The LCD/display isn't too choppy or slow, but you won't mistake it for a high dollar camera.  It's got a fast enough refresh rate/quality to do the job without being frustrating.<br/><br/>My only qualm is it either eats batteries quickly or doesn't read battery level correctly with rechargeable Ni-MH batteries.  With a fully charged battery, after a couple dozen photos (some with flash, some not), the batteries read low.  I continued to use it without the camera dying, so I assume it's conservative in it's battery level readout, or it's optimized for 1.5V alkaline batteries.  No big deal, I didn't buy this for long photo shoots, just something I can give to the kids on trips and things, since it will be a cold day in the underworld before I buy my kids cell phones until midway into their teen years or later.</span>

<span>Yes, as others have said, this will eat your batteries in a few days to a week. We tried it because of the price. It was a return and worth a shot at 75$. It did not disappoint. I was surprised at how some simple shots looked much more professional, while others were something you could get from your phone. We bought it for my 12 year old daughter. It is a good learner camera. Factor battery cost into the amount you plan to use it. If you know ahead of time that you will be using it a lot, it may pay to get a more expensive camera as the battery cost could soon surpass a more expensive camera anyway.  We actually mounted it to a tripod and got a decent family photo. I'm not sure I would buy it a t full price though.</span>

<span>Camera is gorgeous to look at.  Needs four batteries instead of two.  This will cost more to run.  Can put together easily and take some pictures.  So far it works.  Pics turn out blurry. Thanks for fast shipment.  Will be a big challenge and everyone knows me that I take too many pictures.  It is going to take months to figure this one out.  I take pictures all the time.  The manual is not inside I have to go look it up online and it has very many pages.  Should be a printed manual and put inside the box.  Why not?  Kodak do better next time!  Complicated.  This camera is very heavy and I have arthritis so I had to go by a used, cheaper Kodak old camera so I could hold it in my hand.  My other Kodaks lasted many, many years but mine broke finally.  This one is too fancy better for a professional camera not one if you want a easy camera.</span>

<span>This is the third Kodak I've purchased in the last 10 years. The first two were Kodak Share's and were great, but no longer produced. When I say the third camera a person has to realize that I use my camera heavy duty 7 months out of the year. I'm a field appraiser and do real estate tax appraisals for three different counties every year. As I'm doing my work I take pictures of any new structures or anything that would affect value of properties. Often that can mean as many as 50 per day. They took lots of wear &amp; tear but held up really well. The first I dropped on a concrete walk. Needless to say, not the fault of the camera. The last one developed a problem in the spring lever that holds the batteries causing it not to stay closed well. I've spent the last three weeks with packing tape holding it shut! 🤣<br/>Then I decided to try the new PixPro, which I ordered through Amazon with very quick service from the dealer. It's so closely made to my others that I don't think it will take any time to master! And even better magnification! 40x where my others were only 20x. I use this feature a lot as many properties are inaccessible with a normal range.<br/>My only problem that is preventing using it right away is the camera to computer downloading. With my previous cameras I could download my pictures with the days pictures dated and numbered 1 through the end. I could delete those pictures then start over the next day with 1 . I've not figured out how to master this and am planning on calling the company for help. Right now, if I delete 12 and delete, the next day will be 13, etc.<br/>I know there are lots of $$$cameras out there but for my use, Kodak can't be beat! I'll follow up with my service form the dealer if my concerned can be addressed.</span>

Powerful 50x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer for outstanding optical performance50x Optical Zoom (24–1200mm)Once you experience the reach and versatility of this camera's astonishing 50x Optical Zoom, you'll wonder how you ever did without it. From sporting events to travel highlights, wildlife to landscapes, the powerful zoom lets you capture the details that make your photography stand out. Not only will you have the ability to move in to the shot you want, but you'll also be able to capture those shots with incredible Canon quality. The camera's secure ergonomic grip makes steady handheld shooting easy and comfortable, while Intelligent IS analyzes the shooting situation and applies advanced stabilization technology to help keep images clear and virtually shake-free in a wide variety of conditions.Intelligent ISIntelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies a suitable shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make effective IS settings to help capture a steady image. Still Image Shooting Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. Video Recording Dynamic IS Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered IS Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the Image Stabilizer is active to compensate for slight camera shake.  20.3 Megapixel* CMOS sensor with DIGIC 6 Image Processor helps deliver stunning image quality even in low light20.3 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS SensorThe PowerShot SX540 HS camera employs a 20.3 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers powerful imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for high ISO capture with reduced noise. It's also incredibly fast, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, as well as enabling fast continuous shooting and fast autofocus.* Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.DIGIC 6 Image ProcessorThe PowerShot SX540 HS camera is equipped with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which helps boost image quality in both stills and video. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to help create video that's virtually free of distortion. The processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot SX540 HS camera, enabling high-speed, high-quality continuous still image shooting at up to 6.0 frames per second. And video recording is impressive as ever, as the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables Full HD at 60p, as well as MP4 recording. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on compatible mobile devices.

Image quality is luminous and lifelike in 1080p Full HD, with selectable frame rates of 60p and 30p to match the situation and end use. MP4 format, ideal for sharing and mobile devices, is also available. Dynamic IS offers 5-axis image stabilization that corrects even the strong camera shake that happens when you shoot while running or walking backward.  Zoom Framing Assist now features a lock button option for quick and accurate subject recognitionWith its 50x Optical Zoom lens, the PowerShot SX540 HS camera has the telephoto reach to capture subjects a long distance away. At maximum telephoto, however, it can be challenging to track a moving subject. The Zoom Framing Assist seek function makes it much easier to use the camera's powerful zoom lens. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist button, the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original zoom position, intelligently keeping the subject in focus until you're ready to shoot and capture the perfect close-up moment. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position. And with the Zoom Framing Assist Lock, the camera will use image stabilization techniques to lock onto and automatically track a subject, keeping them in the center of the frame until you're ready to capture the ideal close-up shot. Zoom Framing Assist can now be turned on and off with the simple press of a button, allowing for easy and automatic subject selection.  Zoom Framing Assist offers a seek assist function that detects when you're panning (for instance, to search for the location of a soccer ball) and automatically zooms out to help; stop panning, and the zoom returns to its original position. Zoom Framing Assist keeps your subject's face the same size in your frame no matter how they move. Tap the Zoom Framing Assist function button to detect your subject's face. As your subject retreats and advances the camera automatically zooms in and out so their face remains the same size. It's especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children. The feature has been further enhanced by letting you choose the subject's size: choices include face, upper body, whole body, manual or off for superior assistance and control. And, for even more convenience, all Zoom Framing Assist functions are also available when shooting video.  Large 3.0-inch LCD (approx. 461,000 dots) allows easy viewing even from a wide angleThe large, 3.0-inch high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to both frame and review your shots. A resolution of approximately 461,000 dots helps make even small details clear, and images are viewable even from a wide angle, so showing others what you've captured is easy, too.  Hybrid Auto lets you record up to four seconds of video before each image you capture, then automatically combines each clip and still into a quick video recap of the dayHybrid Auto records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips and pictures* into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions or any time you're shooting many shots in a day. In this mode, Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings for incredibly high image quality. The resulting 1080p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady, so your "highlight reel" is stunningly beautiful.* Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.  Story Highlights enables the camera to automatically compile images and videos from a certain day or event into a mini highlight reel with music and effectsView your still images and video* as a fun short story with the Story Highlights feature on the PowerShot SX540 HS camera. Improved for convenience, you can choose to have the camera create this reel automatically by using advanced algorithms to classify your images according to date, event or people, then compiling a short video of approximately three minutes** with suitable background music and color effects applied. You can also customize your Story Highlights reel for a fun, unique video. Story Highlights BGM lets you add background music (choose from three pre-loaded songs) to the clips that Story Highlights automatically generates, for a new level of emotive expression. It's all done in camera, without the need for any additional software. Easily access and enjoy your Story Highlights – simply press the Story Highlights button to start creating your highlight album. The Story Highlights album can be saved to the camera's memory card for quick replay and also shared with the PowerShot SX540 HS camera's built-in Wi-Fi technology.* Videos must be shot in Hybrid Auto or Short Clip. ** Length of highlight video varies according to the photos and videos added to the Story Highlights album.

<span>Love the camera, takes great pictures at great quality images. BUT, you have to be willing to just dive in and start playing with things to learn how to use it because it doesn’t come with a users manual. When I looked it up, it was 188 pages!  Who wants to print all that, not I. To much ink and paper.</span>

<span>Takes clear easy to shoot photos especially for an armature, and has great telephoto  for "long" shots. This is very easy to use, not overly heavy and you don't have to carry numerous lenses to get quite nice photos. I would recommend this camera for anyone interested in more than  point n' shoot but is reasonably priced and easily takes very nice photos.</span>

<span>The picture quality is great. I have been using the camera for photographing suburban wildlife. I previously had a Canon PowerShot SX400 IS, which had 30x zoom. I upgraded to this and am happy with the decision. My photographs impress friends and family.<br/><br/>I have two criticisms: 1. the camera did not come with a bag; 2: the shoulder strap supplied did not fit through the loops on the camera. When I tried trimming the ends to make it fit, the strap frayed and is effectively unusable. My wife ended up sewing a wrist strap that I use to prevent dropping the camera.<br/><br/>The shoulder strap issue is the reason that I have only given this a rating of four stars. Picture quality and ease of use I gave five.</span>
