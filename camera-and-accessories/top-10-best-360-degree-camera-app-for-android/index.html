<span>Great little, inconspicuous camera that fits just about anywhere. We have one in the kitchen and one in the living area so I can check on my parents when we are not home. The audio wants to go in and out but I think that has something to do with our internet.  Video quality is great day and night!!!  Easy to set up but can’t use 5G. Storage is good and easy to playback after download. Highly recommend for the price.</span>

<span>I have 5 of those cameras to monitor my aging mom and keep an eye to her. Setting up the cameras was pretty easy. Cameras are great and does everything what they are supposed to do. I also enrolled to the Cloud storage of the videos. The iPhone app is also great.<br/><br/>Recently I had issues with the cameras that were losing the WIFI connection. So, they become offline and useless. When I tried to reconnect to WIFI it didn’t work. Resetting the whole camera didn’t work either.  I contacted to the Wansview help center via email and they responded within 24 hours. After some research, the issue was not with the cameras but the WIFI channel being too congested. Our router had WIFI channel selection set to auto and was using the channel 6. I scanned the neighborhood WIFI and most of the WIFI’s were using Channel 1, 6 and 11. I switch to channel 9 and everything worked fine.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the cameras and Cloud Storage to anyone want to keep an eye on loved ones.</span>

<span>This is great camera for those locations where you need active monitoring.  I carry a couple with me as I travel to use at a location doesn't need a full blown camera security system, but just a way to remotely monitor an area or employees.  For that these cameras are great.  Setup can be done in about 5 minutes, and the ability to remotely move the field of vision is a great feature on such an inexpensive web camera.  Picture quality is also great, and the night vision works well too.  I which the desktop software worked better and was easier to use, as I would rather store my video locally than in the cloud.  Overall though if you need a quick and cheap monitoring solution, this is it.</span>

I own a property in Mexico, there I keep some of this cameras, I love that I can have a look of what is going on in there from my house in the US, it gives me so much peace of mind, this means you can place the camera anywhere and use it from any part in the world thru the app which is very friendly to use. Very easy to set up, just make sure the back of you QR code is white, I had a bit of trouble since I had my phone in night mode and the back of the code was black, the camera didn’t read it like that but once I figured this out everything went smoothly. I have alarms set up for movement inside the house, sometimes it gets triggered by the change in light at sunrise and sunset which I like to see and it reminds me to take a look at the house every day. For me this has been one of the best purchases I have made. Excellent image and sound quality, specially night vision, also the sound and speaker system work great! Totally recommend this camera!<br/><br/>Esta cámara es fantástica para usarla dentro de casa! Tengo una propiedad en México, ahí tengo  de estas cámaras, me encanta poder ver lo que está pasando allá, me da mucha tranquilidad, esto significa que puedes instalar la cámara en cualquier lugar y ver las imágenes desde cualquier lugar del mundo a través de la app. Muy fácil de instalar, solo recomiendo que el fondo del código QR sea blanco, yo batalle al principio porque tenía mi teléfono en modo nocturno y el fondo del código era negro, la cámara no lo leía, pero cuando me di cuenta de esto, la instalación fue inmediata. Puse que me enviara notificaciones cuando hubiera movimiento en la casa y a veces la alarma se activa con el cambio de la luz del amanecer y atardecer, lo cuales me gusta ver y me recuerda a echar un vistazo a la casa todos los días. Para mí ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho. Excelente imagen y sonido, especialmente la visión nocturna, también el sistema para oír y hablar a través de la app funciona muy bien. Totalmente recomendada esta cámara!</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I switched over to the Wyze Cam Pan v2 camera from the Cam v3 camera. I like the Cam Pan better. It has a wider view because I can pan and I can fine tune the coverage by panning up and down and left and right. I now see 1/3rd more then before. $44 delivered : )<br/>I use a Twist mount with flexible gooseneck with standard 1/4 threaded hole to hang the camera from my curtain rod.<br/>I use this to catch package thieves. Since I and 2 neighbors bought them and setup in our courtyard apts there have been no further stealing.<br/>Picture quality is so so like many security cameras. You need 4k and a DVR for excellent vision. Otherwise it is good enough for close up of people. Cannot read license plates as too blurry.<br/>Use the free LDPlayer app for Windows to run the android WYZE app so you can see the bigger picture on your monitor instead of just the cell phone.</span>

<span>I finally figured out how to get the "Color Night Vision" to work. There is a setting in the application that you have to set. Once you do that the color night vision will work in well lit locations. I was worried that it wasnt going to work at all based on the reviews but once I found out what we were all doing wrong I am now pleased with the product. I am curious how long the motor in the camera for the panning motion is going to hold up. I also like that you can set "zones" for it to scan.</span>

<span>I'd made an earlier review, expressing frustration over the inability to get our two new cameras to connect to our in-house network. I'm now happy to share that TP-Link Support came through for us! It took several days of perseverance before I was able to connect with an agent. They were thorough though, and called repeatedly as well as sending follow up emails asking whether we still needed customer support for our issue. I finally got wise and identified their caller ID to "TP-Link" (rather than a random 800 number) so I knew to pick up the call instead of letting it go to voicemail. I also replied to their emails and asked them to call during a specific window when I was likely to be at home (knowing I'd need to be able to access the camera when speaking to the tech support). They complied and today, a very knowledgeable and helpful tech support agent, Sarah Enojas, walked me through all the steps and we were able to get BOTH of my cameras CONNECTED and FUNCTIONING! I'm very pleased and satisfied with this tech agents capability and the company's tenacity in following through on providing me with tech support. Our particular problem had nothing to do with the cameras and everything to do with two different wifi networks in our home and the necessary passwords. I appreciate TP-Link following through on remedying my problem.</span>

<span>I have had security cameras about 20 some years now, first all hard wired then later wireless with cameras like this.  I think I had 14 setup at one time, now down to 9, soon to 10 as I am adding another one of these.  If you want to complain about quality and features not being the same as the much more expensive cameras, buy one, this is an under $30 camera.  Think I got it for $23 so even it it only lasts a year, it's $23-$30 you simply buy another one.<br/><br/>This is nice but it's a simple rotatable camera.  The image quality is very nice, make sure to check the settings as it's default is NOT 1080, much lower.  You don't have to worry about cloud storage or paying for storage as you can just get as many cards as you want.  These are indoor cameras, so not going to be hard to swap the card out if/when needed.  Mine is mounted in the top of a doorway so I can monitor 2 rooms, and I can swap out the card easily in seconds.<br/><br/>You need to tweak the settings and movements to "your" liking.  I have mine set to continuously record 24/7, also alert to certain movements.  Like I mentioned earlier, just let it record and dont be cheap and buy the smallest storage card you can, buy the largest one you can or even 2 so you can swap them out and save recordings "if" that is what you want to do.</span>

<span>I bought this to check in on my cats when I’m out for extended periods of time. It took me about 2 hours to figure out how to set it up, as I couldn’t get it to connect to my local network. This ended up being user error, not a product problem but my experience with customer support wasn’t great. Granted, it is a Sunday, I had to wait about 45 mins for someone to respond to me via chat and by that point I had finally reached someone via phone. After getting all of my personal info, she asked if this was my first time setting up a device (which it was) and proceeded to tell me she was going to send me a step-by-step instruction video. She didn’t ask any specifics and did not offer to help me any further. Total time spent with customer support was about 2 hours and I never even ended up receiving the video… or support. After some googling, I figured out what I was doing wrong and then it only took me about 10 mins to finishing setting up. Overall, I’m quite impressed with the quality of the product for its price point. I considered a Blink camera but ultimately chose this one for its ability to pan and rotate, which allows me to see different areas of my apartment. There is a talk feature as well. I’m excited to test it out when it is dark. Would recommend.</span>

<span>I bought this as a test against the blink can. And this one is 100 times better. The unfortunate thing is that the detection is very sensitive so things such as lightning bolts, Moths/bugs, And the suns rays can set off the motion detection. Sounds like thunder, and doors opening and closing also get Detected and send you with notifications frequently. The good thing is you can change the sensitivity of the detections and it helps a lot. The bad thing is you do need a subscription for this device if you want it to record videos or small clips.  If the notification goes off and you miss the person in the cam it doesn’t save so you will have to be super quick about it if you’re not going to buy a subscription it is worth it though. The night vision is also very bright and better than the other cameras I’ve tested. All in all worth it.</span>

<span>I love these Wyze cams. I own three of them and use them to view outside and inside my house. The night vision lights up the night and the picture is clear. The last one I bought was working great until about a week ago. All I hear is a static scratching sound coming from the speaker on the camera and it can no longer connect. Tried reset, but no go. I guess I have to contact the manufacturer to see if it's under warranty.<br/>UPDATE! Spoke with one of their support people. We went through some troubleshooting steps and determined there was a problem with the camera. It was still under warranty. I have a new camera the next day! Great support!</span>

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<span>I like these little cameras!  Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below).  Real time live video is important to me for various reasons.  For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.<br/><br/>These cameras are small and light.  The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting.  Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.<br/><br/>The app is so-so..  it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked.  For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings.  To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline..  it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead.  I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain.  You have to guess where to look for things.<br/><br/>For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events.  Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.<br/><br/>Speaking of recording events only to your SD card:  SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings.  If you choose "events only" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops.  This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information.  I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook.  The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.<br/><br/>The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events.  It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone.  When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good.  It is slightly better indoors.  I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera.  (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that.  The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).<br/><br/>For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio.  Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced.  As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.<br/><br/>Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons.  This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.<br/>I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all.  You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings.  I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet.  No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.<br/><br/>1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017.  They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years.  They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal).  The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed.  (My network is not the issue.)  It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise.  I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards.  No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.<br/><br/>3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc.  Priced around what wyze cameras cost.  As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house.  Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them.  That feature does work and is actually really nice.  Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.<br/><br/>4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit.  These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point.  The cameras seem really solid and well made.  I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked.  Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay.  For the price, they would have had to be perfect.<br/><br/>5. Eufy Solo  IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more.  I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster.  I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras.  Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion.  Audio quality was really good with these.  But the delay was a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>The End.  I applaud you if you got this far!</span>

<span>First I must say if you have never used a 360 camera before, it is unreasonable to expect the photo quality you are used to from today's flagship smartphones and cameras and the only way to get closer to that is to buy commercial cameras that can cost over $5,000.<br/><br/>The new 360 is a camera for the masses and comes at a very reasonable MSRP around $250. The photo quality is top notch for the current generation consumer cameras (insta 360, theta, lg, etc). The beauty of these cameras is you capture a full 360 image and can revisit the location in the future via a VR headset or look around on a device like staring through a window. You can also post these images to social media sites like facebook so your friends can look around much like you can.<br/><br/>In comparison to the old gear 360, this one is much smaller (you can fit it in a pocket!) and is also easier to hold. The tripod was removed and instead a rubber ring is attached to the wrist strap that can be placed on the base for increased stability. The overall megapixels were decreased however images still appear great, low light performance is increased, and there is a sharpness setting you can change to offset the density loss if you would like (but remember megapixels aren't everything). The lenses have been moved closer together which improved the stitching and a new HRD landscape setting is present that can be used with a tripod to capture impressive landscape shots. It also charges with usb C now and compatibility was expanded to IOS.<br/><br/>This is now my favorite 360 camera and took the place of my old Theta S. This will likely be the best consumer 360 camera for the year 2017. I will also say I live in the US and purchased this early (international edition) to have in time for summer. The new 360 app is on the play store and connected easily with it. It will still update as updates are released and everything was in English so no problems there!</span>

<span>Booted this up and my phone, the S8+, immediately found and set up to pair with it before I had to go into settings. Within 2 minutes, the whole thing was updated, I had the app on my phone and was ready to use the device.<br/><br/>I love using this thing, I've been doing 360 shots for a couple of years now, and this is a fantastic device for the money. I'm hoping that in the future there will be options for ISO and shutter speed like how there are on the S8 camera. If there already are, I just haven't fooled around with the settings enough yet. Works with a standard tripod mount, got myself a little magnetic one and the pictures come out stunning on HDR mode. I really like that I can choose to just take a normal picture with it by only choosing one of the sides in the settings rather than dual lenses. If the app editor doesn't work for you, there's tons of 360 editing software app on the Play store.<br/><br/>If your phone can support it, definitely pick this camera up.</span>

<span>Love this camera. Photos and videos come out seamless even if contrasting light with each lens. Very pleased with the quality of footage especially for the price. Definitely need a tripod and use the timer or else your thumb will be in the picture. Have had a lot of fun this camera. Nice to get the full scene in a selfie or other pics. Settings are easy to navigate even without using the smartphone app. I use it with my Galaxy S8+, connects flawlessly. Using the Samsung Gear 360 app you can even make tiny planet video and photos right on your phone. Easy to convert from equirectangular to stitched footage right in the Gear 360 app on the smartphone as well.  This is the selfie stick and tripod combo I've been using with this camera, tripod legs are barely visible in footage </span>

<span>The photos are perfect. Stitching of the 360 videos are beautiful. I will do more testing, and update this post, but I wanted to show some photos of the unboxing the international version.<br/><br/>So posting photos isn't so easy on Amazon. I have put up a raw still photos. Amazon, of course, degrades the quality, so I'm not sure how relevant the photo is. But even in its reduced quality, one can see that the photo is not "horrible" and is quite good. The stitching is impressive. What makes the still photos even better is the ability to use HDR, so one part isn't blown out, while the other part is underexposed.<br/><br/>The simple fact is that a 360 camera rig costs about $7,000 to $12,000. If you don't have that sort of money, this Samsung is the next best thing. Sure, there is a blur line where the two lens are stitched together. Again, if you want 7 to 12 or more lens, then be prepared to pay the professional price.<br/><br/>The video and photos are easily uploaded to Facebook (which owns Oculus, the big name in VR) and are truly impressive. I can't give everyone my Facebook (or even web page) because Amazon doesn't allow that. But try looking up reviews of the 360 2017 to find out if the lower quality fits within your limits. Every review I have read says something to the effect of the video not being quite 4K, but hey, Samsung is the best 360 camera for the money.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with my purchase. It gives a sense of being there that no single camera can do. It's easy to operate and has a great connection to many Samsung phones.</span>

<span>Impressive! This camera does so much for the price. All you need is wifi! Fantastic picture quality, camera moves when motion is nearby and stays on target, you can talk into the app and it plays through the speaker, it has a icloud for playback, you can set up notifications through the eufy app when motion occurs, it even comes with mountings for the ceiling or wall, overall great camera!

<span>Overall the camera does what I need it to. I can see clearly with the night vision. When set to “away” if you enter the room the alarm goes off (pretty loud for a small speaker, sounds like a phone alarm) and it sends you a video of the person that set it off.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that the “pan and tilt” is extremely limited. The camera would have to be pretty much near the ground to catch everting in the room. I bought it to support my in home dog daycare so if I put it low enough to see, they will definitely break it.<br/><br/>Also, I wish I’d known it needs an SD card that it doesn’t come with.<br/><br/>The “home” feature is pretty annoying as well, it sends you alerts all day, so I just set to disarm.</span>

<span>I purchased this item to use for my recently adopted kitten. Set up was incredibly easy, and the associated app and device are VERY userfriendly - which was what I was worried about. You're able to customize the recording and monitoring in many different ways: manual, scheduled, geofencing. I'm currently using the geofencing timer for this device, and I got the alert that it switched the second I stepped into my vehicle to leave. The camera quality and zoom feature are great. You're also able to easily rotate or communicate through the camera easily. I got an alert of pet movement, and it was when my kitten woke up and walked a few feet to the feeder. The motion sensor works very well. I would definitely recommend this item to friends &amp; family. There is also a setting to alert for crying if you have a baby or toddler.</span>

Product Description   Essential is a new kind of company Founded on our commitment to true craftsmanship, personalization and simplification. We're using 21st century methods to build products for 21st century people. Andy Rubin, Creator of Android Founder and CEO of Essential  From the Manufacturer    Essential Phone Essential Phone is expertly crafted using titanium and ceramic, has an edge-to edge Full Display and captures stunning images (even in low-light) with a color and monochrome dual system camera.  Free Yourself Your phone is an expression of who you are and it should have only the things you want and need. No logo. No forced loyalty. 128GB Comes Standard. Future Proof is Essential The innovation opportunities are endless with our magnetic connector. Keeps your phone cord-free and always up-to-date with accessories that click. Sharing is Essential Simply click the world's smallest 4K 360o camera to capture all of the important moments in complete surround. Style is Essential Titanium is the perfect material to create one of the most essential things in our lives. It resists scratches and dents far better than aluminum. World’s Smallest 4K 360° Camera Other 360° cameras are big, bulky, and complicated to use. We thought it was about time someone made a 360° camera for the rest of us. Simply click the 360° camera to your phone to point, shoot, and share. It’s that easy. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.Freedom is EssentialHow did you come up with the idea for this product?I know people are going to ask me a lot of questions about why I started this company. Why didn’t I just travel the world, ride my motorcycle, tinker with my robots, hang out at my bakery with friends and family. And to be honest I still do ask myself that sometimes…but not too often. So why did I create Essential? Well, my hardware engineers wanted me to talk about how we are bringing real passion and craftsmanship back into this category. My software engineers wanted me to talk about our vision for making all devices, even those we don't make ourselves, play well together. My partners wanted me to talk about how we are using methods that could change how successful technology companies are built forever. And this is all true. But the real reason is because of what happened during a night out with an old friend of mine. As the night went on we inevitably began talking about what we didn't like about the current state of technology. Less and less choice. More and more unnecessary features cluttering our lives. An increasing sea of products that didn't work with one another… And just when I was about to drop another criticism it hit me: I am partly responsible for all of this. For all the good Android has done to help bring technology to nearly everyone it has also helped create this weird new world where people are forced to fight with the very technology that was supposed to simplify their lives. Was this what we had intended? Was this the best we could do? I left that night reflecting deeply on what was great and what was frustrating with the current state of technology today. After another long talk with my friend we decided that I needed to start a new kind of company using 21st century methods to build products for the way people want to live in the 21st century. What makes your product special?This is what we believe: • Devices are your personal property. We won’t force you to have anything on them you don’t want to have. • We will always play well with others. Closed ecosystems are divisive and outdated. • Premium materials and true craftsmanship shouldn’t be just for the few. • Devices shouldn’t become outdated every year. They should evolve with you. • Technology should assist you so that you can get on with enjoying your life. • Simple is always better. What has been the best part of your startup experience?I have used the above principles to inform everything Essential is doing and they have helped me attract some of the best and brightest people from all over the world to join me in bringing this vision to life. We won’t achieve everything we hope on day one, but if you’re one of those people who also thinks it’s time for something new, please have a look at www.essential.com to learn more.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought the essential phone mainly as an test into how much I would like the plain android OS. I did not have any intention of getting the 360 camera. I happen to see a video of it on Youtube and was intrigued. Then the price dropped down to $40 and I figured why not.<br/><br/>I will start with the build quality. This does not feel like something that costs $40. This feels solid, not cheap at all. It feels like it could survive a drop or too depending the landing surface, but i am not gonna try it. Speaking on that, I recommend getting some sort of carrying case, since it has lenses on two sides and most likely is going to spend most of it's time in a bag or pocket, you dont want it to get scratched up.<br/><br/>How to use? Line up the 2 connectors with the 2 on the phone and it pretty much slams together due to magnets.  It seems to be a little more complicated then simply that however, I found myself a few times getting no reaction from my phone when it was hooked up (light on too) and I have to take it off and adjust it slightly. Once it is connected correctly, the phone is suppose to open up the essential camera app automatically and you are set to start snapping or videoing away. A few times I found this not to be as flawless as it sounds. The camera app would crash or freeze, or no matter how many times I connect and adjust the camera, I would get no reaction from phone. Usually a phone reset corrected it and then i was good to go.<br/><br/>Picture quality? I am not an expert in it, but seems pretty good honestly for what your doing. This takes up to 4k videos. The stuff I seen on it however doesnt seem overly sharp or clear but could just be me. The best  thing (which is really what its all about anyway) is the type of pictures it takes and the ease of it (once you get it up and running). Taking a 360 video or picture takes no extra effort then taking a regular one since you pretty much hold the phone the same way and use the same camera app. For me, the 360 has no major use everyday, but I have taken it to outdoor BBQs and some dinners and took some great pictures. (Capturing everyone around the fire pit for example). Everyone seems very impressed with it.<br/><br/>I don't plan on keeping the Essential phone as my daily phone much longer, but I will definitely be keeping it solely because of the 360 camera. This would be great for vacations, taking 360 videos on some beautiful beaches.<br/><br/>For 40$ , even if you dont see an immediate use for it, just get it anyway. It's a steal, and you will regret not getting it if they go out of stock or the price returns to its normal MSRP. If you have the Essential phone, you are probably missing out on the best feature of it if you don't have this. If you don't have the essential phone, well then you can't use this anyway.</span>

<span>I purchased it with my ph-1 with just 399. For this price I would say 360 camera is quite good.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Small size<br/>Light weighted<br/>No need to charge<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Paring time is quite long, sometimes unable to pair unless I restart the phone, situation improve with software upgrade<br/><br/>After viewing the 360 image and go back to shooting mode, it take some times to pair<br/><br/>Can't shoot normal photo in 360 mode<br/><br/>Become quite hot after using for several minute.<br/><br/>No official sharing platform like other 360 camera<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/>If you have don't have essential phone now and you don't have 360 camera, it is worthwhile to purchase in bundle, 360 camera is really fun to use. Most of the cons can be improved with software update<br/><br/>Image quality is not great but you can't expect good quality 360 photo in such a tiny device. I would say its done its job, feel happy to use this.</span>

<span>I own several 360 cameras but the one I generally take with me for fun is the Theta V.<br/><br/>This doesn't quite match the quality of that. However it's close enough that's I've stopped taking the Theta with me already and now just throw this in a pocket or my bag before I leave.<br/><br/>Besides loving the phone.. this little 360 camera is amazing for the price they're selling it for now! I didn't really feel like I needed it so I wouldn't have paid the higher original price however I'd still pay at least double what I paid for it knowing what I know now.<br/><br/>I might even go crazy and buy a second one to keep around as a spare. Then again when this phone finally dies there's a good chance the phone and a 360 camera will both end up in the garbage (recycled of course) so one Essential 360 camera might be enough for now. At least until I know if it will work on the new essential phone that's coming out or not. I'm doubtful but hopeful!<br/><br/>Once again it's a steal at this price!</span>

<span>I was informed by my neighbors that I had someone peaking into my windows. I decided to get a security camera and didn't want that would be outside for fear of it being stolen. I got this indoor camera to just set in my main window. It has done amazing! It was also super easy to set up; both the camera and app. It picks up people and vehicles in the street and the pictures don't seem too bad either! The low night review is only because my window makes it hard to see at night, but the camera still picks up activity. I will purchasing a couple more later!</span>

<span>I bought this product for its high tech ability for its price. But It does not work. DOES NOT WORK! Maybe it works if you live in a house where your router is close by, but I live in an apartment complex with buildings high-speed wifi and I could not get it the app on my phone to pair with the camera. I even went as close as I could to the buildings router that was behind a locked door in the main hallway to try to get it to pair. Didn’t work. Also, online it says that non flashing red lights on the camera mean the router and camera function is fine, and if it’s blinking theirs connection issues. Mine was nonflashing! I assume being close to the router for pairing was the reason it wasn’t working because the app mentions it multiple times. But also, it kept saying “password error” when trying to pair. But the password was correct! So The entire camera was just not working for me. The lights indication is confusing and non helpful, to pair you must be touching your router I assume, and I still don’t know how you can get past the password error. I know it was the correct password, I typed it in to turn on and off my wifi repeatedly trying anything for my camera to recognize it. Overall, it Made me so SO angry. So I am returning it because it’s not working for me. Unfortunately, I loved the idea of it for the price. The device 360’d bodily, and camera lense. And it’s 360 function and motion detection seemed so advance and fun. I was excited for this product. Very disappointed. Try your luck, maybe, but definitely don’t buy this if you’re on a time crunch and need surveillance as it is 100% not reliable.</span>

<span>I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.<br/><br/>Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.<br/><br/>I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!<br/><br/>Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.</span>

<span>UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn’t the best but once you change the video quality setting to “Enhanced” it’s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won’t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT &amp; XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don’t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage &amp; subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that’s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use ‘em where you don’t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.</span>

<span>So this happened to me in two different houses with two different sets of blink mini cameras. when i was setting up the camera, it would not connect to wifi. it would blink blue and green and then the light would go to a steady red and after a couple mins the app would tell me it couldn’t connect to wifi and that it’s usually poor signal or incorrect password. Sometimes the lights on the camera would just turn off and it would be unresponsive. I retried so many times with same outcome. I reset my wifi countless times and changed the password and reset the cameras and even got right next to my router for maximum connectivity, because according to the internet that’s what I’m supposed to do. Well it’s actually the complete opposite. After some research, these cameras connect to 2.4 GHz band. Some wifi routers give off both 2.4 and 5.0GHz, some have two separate routers for each band. I have spectrum wifi so my one router has both bands. Anyways the point is the 2.4 covers larger, further out areas but with lower signals. 5.0 covers less area with better signals. So in order for the camera to connect you have to go the furthest away from your router to be able to connect to the 2.4 GHz band. So if you have a similar sounding issue try connecting furthest from the router. Also i did contact blink support but no response and i went to Best Buy to ask and they didn’t know what to do. maybe blink should include this info in the instructions</span>

<span>It clicks loudly when capturing video. When using it to monitor how my grandmother was being treated, it was obvious when the cameras started. It lets you disable the power light but then makes a loud clicking when capturing video. Other than that, they have been actually better than I thought they would be. The app needed to control and use them, is pretty good but using the Ecco Show to monitor them is a mess. Way too many unnecessary features turned on that you have to hunt down to disable. Even after that, it’s impossible to continuously monitor the cameras through it. There is no way to set it up to stay on the cameras. Amazon never misses a chance to force you to watch adds or view Amazon products they want you to use.</span>
