<span> I bought this camera to see if I could use it to record what is behind me on bike rides. Since most crashes are from the back it gives me a little peace of mind while I'm biking. I uploaded a short video of part of my recording while biking.<br/><br/>As you can see the picture quality and amount captured is really good for $18. The audio is a hot mess since there is a lot of movement of the camera (there is no audio in the video because I screen recorded the small part of the video.) Luckily I didn't buy it for the audio. It records continuously for 20 minutes tops. So on my commute that day I rode 20 minutes out and then started recording to see quality.<br/><br/> I attached the waterproof case to the left side of my rear rack basket (see photo) with the provided velcro strips. It comes with a lot of pieces for mounting and carrying the camera in different ways. For stability and to get the best image of the approaching cars in the lane next to me I found the velcro was better. I might order another one and mount it to my front handlebars.<br/><br/>If my ride is more than 20 minutes (it typically is) I stop every 18 minutes and restart the camera to make sure I capture the whole ride. The camera holds a charge for quite awhile and I have had success using it to record two hours of biking round trip. I charge it nightly so I haven't really tested the full extent of the battery.<br/><br/>Mine did come with a micro sd card. I bought a small usb converter for my mac book dongle. Due to the file type (.avi) I did need to download the free app 'omni player' to play the files on my macbook. For that app you just drag and drop the video into the player to see it. They have an app for converting to different file types called 'omni converter' as well.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this camera for outdoor recordings.</span>

<span>My family and I took a trip to Hawaii, and I wanted my kids to be able to record video of their snorkeling adventures. It turns out that these cameras worked great for that purpose, but they have some serious negative aspects.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>* The water resistant housing worked great. The kids were able to record underwater without any trouble. These housings are rugged - one of the kiddos buried the camera in the sand and it still worked fine after a quick rinse.<br/>* The kids liked the aesthetics of the camera - the camera and strap had fun sea creatures.<br/>* The kids were surprisingly wrapped up in playing the games on the camera. I thought the games would be worthless, but the kids actually played every chance they could get and were competing with each other. Go figure.<br/>* The camera came with all sorts of mounting hardware (which I didn't use) and two rechargeable batteries.<br/>* Each unit came with a 16GB micro-SD card. One of them had to be formatted to be usable. The other was usable straight away. I ended up replacing them both with 32GB cards anyhow. That worked fine.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>* The image sensors on these cameras are awful. I mean really, really bad. I think my first digital camera from the late 90s took better photos.<br/>* The 'megapixel' settings for still images appear to be pure marketing fluff. It seems like the 12MP setting just takes the standard low-resolution photo and makes the image larger without any increase in clarity or resolution. The image size is definitely 3136x3920 and takes up around 1 MB of space, but the pixels are huge. When viewed at 100% resolution it looks like someone took really small photo and enlarged it without any increase in resolution. So... seems like a marketing gimmick to me.<br/>* The video is equally poor. The technical specs claim to support '1080' video. Well, that's only partially correct. When most people see '1080' video, they are looking at 1920x1080 pixels. The video from this camera is 864x1080, which means the sensor is cropping the left &amp; right sides of the video so you just see a narrow strip in the middle. I am attaching the actual attributes of the video that came from the camera so you can see for yourself.<br/>* There are no fancy features like HDR or image stabilization. I wouldn't expect that at this price point, but i just want people to understand what they are getting.<br/><br/>The conclusion:<br/>Ultimately I do not regret buying the cameras. They are being sold at a super low price point, and young children will love playing with these things. Just don't expect any prize-winning photography from it. This product is fine for what it is intended for - an action cam for kids. Shame on the marketing team for misrepresenting the specifications.</span>

<span>1. Great picture with 1080p at 30fps, 720p at 60fps or 30fps, and VGA (640 x 480) at 120fps.<br/>2. The high FPS makes it easy to do slow motion video.<br/>3. The touch screen is very convenient being able to review your pictures or video on the fly.<br/>4. The accessories really enhance the experience of almost having everything you need to get started with a project right out of the box.<br/>5. The remote can control more than one camera, so if you have multiple in an array, one remote will control them all.<br/><br/>Not so much cons, just observations.<br/>1. The 60fps 720p recording is not as light sensitive as the 30fps 720p or `1080p, so the picture may come out a little darker if there is not sufficient light.<br/>2. The touch screen works, it just takes some time getting used to; I have bigger hands so sometimes my finger does not hit the buttons correctly.<br/>3. The camera LCD has a grid box on the video recording menu, which helps greatly for aligning multiple cameras, the only thing is that sometimes it does not appear on its own. Clicking the video selection button on the bottom right of the screen will manually bring it up however.<br/><br/>I have done a few Time Slice and Slow Motion recordings with it; just search Pyle Time Slice Rig on YouTube. I have also taken it out on a Mud Run, and it lasted over 2 hours even in a water dive on the "Walk the Plank" obstacle (20ft jump into water)</span>

<span>Camera is a great little camera that I mainly bought to play around with and shoot some action video (not really picture taking).<br/>I chose this camera over a gopro for the simple reason that it was less expensive, yet still provided functions that I needed like motorcycle mount, strap mount (for custom made chest mount for sports), and dash cam. all these were met<br/><br/>Pros i didnt see in other reviews:<br/>120fps allows for some excellent slow mo shooting which is hard to find on less expensive action cams. this cam has it, shoots pretty well, but you need a lot of light (indoors wasnt great, but outdoors worked well). Indoors the shutter speed must not allow enough light in, resulting in dark results<br/><br/>waterproof case comes with it.. I haven't used it underwater yet so I cant account for the quality of shots. one thing to note, I threw the case on the camera to protect it from bugs when I took the bike out for a spin and there was moisture in the case. 30minutes into the ride and the lens of the case fogged over. id suggest you make sure you dont let moisture in there/ wipe the case down with IPA or something equivalent<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>When the camera shakes on the bike, usually around 35 40 mph, the camera does some funny video wavy video effects. i havent noticed that when mounted to my body/car, but should be noted<br/><br/>mounts that screw in only seem to screw in partially.. i mean the screw does not engage past a little over 1 turn. typical screws should turn in more than twice to fully secure whatever they are attached to<br/><br/>the camera comes with an rf controller (like a tv remote). the receiver is next to the lens in the upper left corner (see the pictures included on the amazon page). the tough part is that you need to be facing the camera from the front to activate the camera/video. depending on the setting (it starts on video mode) you cant use the other mode (so if you are set to video, you cannot shoot a picture). Also, the case covers most of the rf receiver, making it all the harder to use the remote<br/><br/>the playback frequently freezes the camera if you have shot with the 120fps. id suggest not using it and instead upload it to your computer (works fine with vlc and even media player).<br/><br/>Also if the camera freezes, you have to use a pin to press the reset button... holding down the power button doesnt work making this quite a task if you dont have pin<br/><br/>Lastly, the camera does not have that heavy-quality feel, but the quality of the videos and pictures makes up for that<br/><br/>Alex</span>

<span> I love that I get a great camera for $30. I have two of these that I have mounted in my car (front and rear). This blue one, for some reason, has really bad audio. Not sure if theres a loose wire in the mic or what. And being in my car, early morning and late night recordings are almost nonexistant. takes great quality photos and I love that it comes with almost all the mounts you could want. Just need to find an thread to "GoPro" style and I'd be golden. Now it's not recording in Uber-High-Def, but the videos are decent quality. It takes great photos, but I feel like most smartphones can do about the same quality or better. Sure they're not submersible like this is (in its case), and they cost more. but for the $30 price tag. I would buy two or three more of these. You can stick them anywhere. about as big as a GoPro HeroSession.</span>

<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>Ok after a lot of research I decided to get this Cam as it seemed to be the one with the highest resolution for taking "Still" panoramas. I don't do videos so the 5.7k promise from other makers didn't entice me. I do virtual tours for real estate. Fast forward to delivery date (Kudos to Amazon btw for fast international delivery) the thing that jumped straight at me was the unusable Android app, it lags,  disconnects and never connect until you restart both camera and phone. And that is after you take just one still.<br/><br/>Ok I wasn't going to get an IOS just for my Cam so I decided to hog my PC just for the panos. At least I've got to make money out of my investment, not until I realize that most of the camera settings aren't accessible on PC.<br/><br/>The main issue and devastating of them all is a prominent blur that jumps right out of stitch whenever I take panos of any resolution stitched or global rendering my virtual tours unacceptable by clients. Now I'm stuck with an expensive 360 Cam that can't even take stills good enough for my business. In my dictionary that's a total loss. No reliable app, settings not accessible on PC and useless panoramas. I have attached a picture to show the blur.</span>

I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

<span>Since my iPhone can take better pictures than most professional cameras, I wanted one that would give me the Zoom that I cannot get with the iPhone<br/><br/>This camera is great for macro, wildlife, and other although you will need to learn its features and tricks to get the best out of it<br/><br/>The sensor is small although you get a nice smaller size than a professional one in exchange with a very nice price for the Zoom optics<br/><br/>This camera is a great compromise that offers good price, great zoom, OK quality and battery<br/><br/>If you want a professional camera with all bells and whistles and great flexibility, there are better options are a higher price</span>

<span>I know it's got to be a good camera because a pro-video friend uses one in his free time with the family because he doesn't want to bring $35K equipment around a bunch of kids!  It's still a little confusing for me only because I'm just coming from using an iPhone &amp; this has more dials.  Now I know how my Mom felt when I bought HER an iPhone!!!</span>

<span>I'm a beginner at photography and have always wanted my own camera so this is my first. With thorough research I wanted to make sure I got a camera that was good and worth the money I would be spending. Not only does this camera have great zoom and focus but also the settings gives you great range. The battery lasts pretty much all day, it's pretty easy to navigate without instructions, and it's nice and compact. Love this camera!</span>

<span>I bought this camera because it has the basic controls that I need and because it uses AA batteries. All of my cameras use AA batteries, and I have boxes of NiMH rechargeables that I use in many of my electronic devices. They work fine in all of my other cameras.<br/><br/>The KodakAZ401 camera itself is not bad for the price, but in spite of what it says in the documentation, it will not run on the power supplied by NiMH batteries.  With freshly charged NiMH batteries in it, the camera works for a few hours, and then it turns itself off declaring that the batteries are dead.<br/><br/>I put top-of-the-line Eneloop NiMH batteries, fresh out of the charger, into the camera. The camera immediately showed that the batteries were low. A day later, the battery indicator showed that the batteries were dead. I had taken about 6 photographs to test the camera.<br/><br/>I took the batteries out and measured the Voltage. It was 1.320 Volts. That is a fully charged NiMH battery. I continued testing it to see what would happen, and a few hours later, the camera displayed a message saying that the batteries were depleted and then turned itself off. I measured the Voltage on the batteries, and it was 1.26 Volts. 1.26 Volts, is normal operating voltage for a NiMH battery.  NiMH batteries come out of the charger at up to 1.4 Volts, but then quickly drop down to 1.2 Volts for the duration of their charge cycle. So 1.26 Volts is a fully charged NiMH battery.<br/><br/>The camera battery type was properly set to NI-MH in the settings menu.<br/><br/>I took the very same batteries out of the Kodak camera and put them into my Nikon CoolPix camera. The Nikon indicates that they are fully charged. I cycled another set of freshly charged NiMH batteries through the Kodak AZ401 and they had the same problem. The camera immediately indicated that the batteries were low, and after a short time it indicated that they were dead. There is nothing wrong with the batteries. They work in all of my other devices.<br/><br/>I took a total of 10 photos with this camera, and that depleted two sets of freshly charged NiMH batteries. That makes the camera unusable.<br/><br/>The Kodak AZ401 camera will not run on the power supplied by NiMH batteries.<br/><br/>Given the many other comments about battery issues, this is clearly a design flaw and not a malfunctioning device, so I returned the camera for a refund.</span>

<span>I bought this camera for a photography class.  If I use manual settings and can get the ISO as low as I can and the depth of field as high as I can, the pictures come out pretty darn good.  Most of the time I just use auto.  Any motion will cause motion blur.  My iPhone 8 doesn't have this problem.  It also tears through batteries like no tomorrow.  I was planning to use this to capture pictures of my child for years to come.  Now I will just sell it on facebook marketplace and count my losses.</span>

<span>The camera comes with lots of accessories except for a ball mount. So be sure to order that if you need it to work on that type of mount. The camera has a good weight and is easy to use. Pictures came out nice and clear and stabilization was good as well. I have not used the app to improve stabilization as of yet but the app seems to work as needed.</span>

<span>So I purchased the action bravo eight camera for an airsoft Milsim event that I went to, absolutely amazing. At the time that I ordered the camera they did not have spare battery packs available for purchase but I did contact the company to purchase more and they were amazing enough to send me two extra batteries at no cost. The four batteries that I had along with a 22,000 mA hour charger lasted me six hours I only used three batteries and had two others on the charger and didn’t have any issues with the batteries. I ran the camera on the 2.7 K setting 60 FPS and had a pretty good average battery life for an action cam on par with GoPro. Footage by far was the best I’ve seen on a budget action cam image stabilization worked wonders I had it on a head strap mount running all over the place only complaint there had nothing to do with the camera my headband just kept sliding up on my head because I was wearing it on the outside of a Boonie hat. I did purchase the waterproof case to protect the camera during Airsoft but I eventually just took it out of the waterproof case because it was extremely heavy on my head and we had rain that day for the first few hours did not affect the camera or picture quality at all it picked up the sound really well sound quality was decent. All in all I would highly recommend the brave eight to anybody who’s looking for an action cam on a budget it serve me well and I’ll continue to keep using it now I have not used it since then.  Storage space is something to be desired on that but as with any camera that shoots 4K it’s gonna eat up a lot of memory I’m a do believe that the packaging said the biggest memory card that it could take was a 512 GB SD card might’ve been a one terabyte card I can’t remember but I had a 500 GB in mine and it was able to record 368 minutes.</span>
