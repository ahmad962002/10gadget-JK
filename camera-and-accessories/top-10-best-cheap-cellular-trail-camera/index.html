<span>I ordered this thinking it was a two pack since the first two pictures were a box containing two cameras…. Which I get was my fault for not reading the fine print. And I choose they unlimited plan and have adjusted the camera a ton of times and still isn’t sending me the photos and I’m positive there are deer and turkeys right in front of it since I’ve jumped them twice …. I had a stealth cam loved the product and after one year it stopped working so I tried everything to get ahold of them and no response to emails calls etc.</span>

<span>This is my 2nd cell game cam.  The first one (different brand) was a complete zero so I was hesitant to buy this one.  However, the price point ($100) was pretty good so I gave it a shot.<br/><br/>First of all, it was very easy to activate.  Just make an account at Moultrie, install the app, scan the bar code on the cam, and you are off to the races.  You then just pick a monthly plan for pictures/videos.  I picked the $18/month unlimited photo plan since where I hunt is extremely game rich and I get approximately 125 pics per day.  I get 50 videos with my plan but I don't plan on using it.  Also, it you get more of these cams, you can add unlimited accounts to those cams of $8 each (I think).<br/><br/>The cam is managed through the app on your phone.  The only thing you can do on the camera itself is turn it on, the rest is controlled by the app.  The app was VERY easy to use and configure.  You can take a single pic or a 3 pic burst.  You can also pick 4mb pics or 33mb pics.  No brainer.  You can also change the sensitivity of the cam to take more or fewer pics.  You can also configure how often you want the cam to send the pics to your phone/computer from immediately to every 24 hours.  It takes FAR less battery power to send pics less often.<br/><br/>The only downfall is that it takes a lot of battery power to send pics.  You can install either 8 or 16 (yes, 16) AA batteries.  However, I bought a 12v solar powered battery pack so I should not ever run out of battery power.  I bought this one from Amazon and the jack jack fits perfectly:  HAWKRAY Trail Camera Solar Panel, Dual Male Connector Waterproof Solar Power Charger Kit 6V-12V Built-in 5200 Rechargeable Lithium Battery for Trail Game Camera.  Just be sure to fully charge the battery pack before using it.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very excited to use the cam!  I recommend this product.</span>

<span>I’ve had these now for two weeks. I got two of them and they both are awful. One takes literally thousands of photos and the other one doesn’t take hardly any. I set them both up and was getting a picture every 4 seconds from one of them and the other one I can walk in front of and it won’t take a picture. Customer care reached out after a few days of telling them and they told me to reset the cameras well didn’t work. Gone through 16 batteries in one camera in 4 days so I stopped using it after the reset didn’t work. Bottom line is these are a massive disappointment. Does take great quality photos though.</span>

<span>When I turn the camera on an let it boot, the camera will send a single photo (usually a close-up of me setting it up or some other silly pic). However, after this, the camera will never send another picture. I can walk in front of the camera, let it sit for a while and walk straight through its field of view, and I never get a single photo. In addition, we have animals that constantly parade past the camera all day long (2 donkeys and a half-dozen sheep). Not a single picture comes through.<br/>I'm sending the camera back for a full refund.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/>I started the return process with Amazon but kept using the camera for a few weeks. Unfortunately, the performance did not improve. The camera will trigger and send a picture if there is movement within 10 feet, but the reported "80 foot detection range" is wildly inaccurate. I can stand 20 feet away and wave my arms around and the camera just ignores it. Since we are using the camera for remote security at our property, it's unusable and, sadly, has to be returned.</span>

<span>As a owner of several covert cameras, I am very disappointed with battery life, I use rechargeable batteries and understand they do not have the life of the others, but after 6 days the batteries had dropped from 100 percent to 39,  and that's less than a 100  pictures. Now after being put in use it has quit taking pictures after dark.cannot recommend this camera to any one. Now they are putting ads in the ap, so you have to wait for it to close to see your pictures, and you have to pay for the use of the ap. Look elsewhere,  this company has gone down hill since they were bought out.</span>

<span>Review of: **Covert Scouting Cameras WC30-A (AT&amp;T LTE) Cellular Game &amp; Trail Camera For Hunting Deer and Wildlife (CC2762)**<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>-Was pretty easy to get up and running, including setting up account with Covert to save and store images and videos<br/>-Fairly reliable and motion sensor triggers with decent reliability, and at a fairly good distance (~50 feet)<br/>-Battery life is ok, but works great with solar panel/battery system<br/>-Love being able to get real-time alerts when motion is detected - works as a decent security camera<br/>-Image resolution for pix and videos is quite good<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>-Has issues once in a while downloading videos<br/>-No way to get real time video or pix<br/>-Need to request videos or HD pix and then wait to get them pulled from the camera and then uploaded to the Covert server.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line:<br/>I ordered this camera to use as a sort of basic camera, primarily to monitor a property we have that is a few miles from our home.  Setting this up took less than a half hour to get fully up and running, including setting up my account with Covert.  I did have issues changing my subscription online a month or two after setting it up (I wanted a plan with more included pix and videos), but a quick call to Covert support took care of things - the person I spoke with was very helpful and instantly updated my plan.  And the plans are pretty reasonably priced,  I'm currently paying $20 a quarter for 3500 pix.  Note that it supposedly costs 3 cents extra to download HD pix, and 7 cents for videos, but I have yet to see a bill for this.  Maybe those charges are waived with the subscription??<br/><br/>Overall performance is quite good.  I have a solar panel with a battery installed with this camera, so I haven't had to touch the batteries (or the camera) in over 6 months.  All settings can be managed via the app, and you can view current and old pix directly through the app as well.  I also like that Covert has a website where you can view your images too, and also manage your account and billing.<br/><br/>Motion detection is pretty good, allowing us to see if people or animals are on our property.  In addition to the occasional trespasser, we have seen owls, dogs and a pair of elk go by.  (See night shot of an elk).  Once in a while I have had issues where I cannot get the videos to download, but that has been hit or miss.  I may contact Covert support to check into it if this persists.<br/><br/>Overall, quite happy with the performance here and believe the cost of the camera and subscription is is quite reasonable.  I would definitely consider this camera again if I need another for monitoring for people or animals at a remote location with no wifi.</span>

<span>The camera works.  I regret buying this camera and will not buy another camera due to the manufacture lack of support.  This is cellular camera so you are billed monthly or yearly.  I have a problem with an overcharge.  I have called their 800 number 5 times and have been on hold over an hour each time.  Tried their email support several times and never received a response.

<span>The pictures are good as you can see, I can clearly identify the animal in the picture or a vehicle in the drive. It is a minimum of $15/month for service for up to 3 cameras and $5 per month after that, and ¢5 per picture for a high res download when the camera syncs (every few hours I think). I almost never have more than 1 or 2 bars but it always works and works fast (though I probably should have gotten AT&amp;T, they have better coverage in my area). I have a large property by some standards, specifically meaning that I can't see all 20+ acres from my house, and these hide well from human eyes which is why I got them. The ones I got came with the Muddy solar panel so they ought not to need any real attention for a while other than clearing off the spider webs. The product feels sturdily built and has remained functional in all sorts of inclement weather, without fail. This will sometimes trigger when there appears to be nothing there, if that happens you have to adjust the delay and photo burst settings and you will usually get a picture of a deer butt (or maybe sasquatch, who knows? The truth is out there). Of course, with this and not a way more expensive unit, you get pictures only, but I have other cameras closer to the home itself that record video, so this fits the bill for my needs and doesn't break the bank. I do plan to buy more so that is why I wrote this when I saw so few reviews on Amazon.</span>

<span>Looks good, sturdy but....  Unless you have super sonic Wifi in your neck of the woods you will not be able to use this camera.  They also do not specify you will have to sign up and pay for a monthly automatic usage plan with Covert.  We did all of the above and the camera never picked up the Network or even turned on unless you were in the set up mode.  We re-did the set up 4 times, and nothing.  The customer service is only open weekdays and only for a few hours, so support is basically no help if you need them on a weekend or when you get home from work.

<span>It was fairly easy to install, and setup the APP. Put it up, it worked great for a few days. Adjusted the settings so it would trigger and send photos with a better delay, as it was sending me photos the second the motion hit, which usually meant the game hadn't even came into the frame yet. Made the adjustment, then the camera started sending a photo every 30 seconds of nothing. Talked to tech support, they told me to reset the camera, and update it. Also told me the camera only can see a 32GB card, anything else will make it error out. So put the new SD in it, updated firmware, it reset all the settings. I put another new set of 12 lithium batteries in it! Left the property, and hour later started sending massive photos of nothing again. Talked to tech support they suggested I reset the camera again, did so, put new lithium batteries in it, and boom, did it again. Finally worked with them again, put new batteries in it, now the camera will not trigger at all. Once when I walked out to my blind, then hasn't sent any pics since. WASTE of Money, now they want me to pay to ship it to them, for testing. The menu is unresponsive most of the time, and I just went through $80 in batteries, trying to get the piece of junk to actually work, which it only did in the beginning.</span>

<span>The photos are just ok, nothing special.  I don't know why trail cams claim such high resolution, but deliver mediocre photos.  For this price point I expected better.<br/><br/>Now, on to the app--using the app with multiple cameras is just awful.  Photos from one camera show up in the other cameras list of photos.  There is no way to download the photos from the app to the photo storage on your phone.  You have to screenshot what is displayed and then save that screenshot--really?  The worst part of the app is the billing--they say you can have up to 2 cameras on the same subscription.  Ok, that sounds fine, but then they hit you with another $5 per month charge for the additional camera.  There is no support available either to work out this, so ultimately I'll be dropping off my subscription.<br/><br/>I expected better of Browning.....</span>

<span>I was hoping to improve the quality of my images with these cameras. I bought two, but they have both disappointed me a lot. They are both set to take 7 images in a series, but I am lucky if I get even one. I was surprised at how few photos were on the cards when I retrieved then, so I set up a cheapo camera nearby to see what was going on , and it turned out there was a wildlife garden party happening that the browning simply didn't see. Maybe it does better with video?</span>
