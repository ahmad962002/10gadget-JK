<span>I have a Canon SX-50 HS digital camera &amp; been using it for about 4 years now &amp; needed something newer now. I wanted at least a 50X optical zoom lens since my older Canon SX-50 HS camera has 50X optical zoom. So, I got this Canon SX-530 HS camera as its replacement. Basically it's just like the SX-520 HS with the exception of the Canon Processors used and the strength of the optical zoom, megapixels max and some features lacking on the newer Canon. The SX-520 has a 42X optical zoom and this SX-530 HS has a 50X optical zoom. I think this Canon is a step backwards compared to the older SX-50 HS because the SX-50 HS has the Canon Digic-5 processor &amp; this Canon has a Digic-4+ processor, this camera lacks optical viewfinder [only a LCD viewfinder that cannot be twisted/swiveled around at all], &amp; seems a bit more poorly designed compared to the SX-50 HS camera. Of course, this newer Canon is cheaper also...which is why it lacks some of those features found on the older and larger SX-50 HS. Photo qualities outdoors or indoors without flash is fair to good. Using flash indoors will improve the photos a bit for indoor photos. Low light photos are poor with this camera, indoors or outdoors. Video qualities is pretty good in daylight conditions for this camera. Overall, this camera is pretty easy to use and it has manual setting modes if you prefer it that way. The menu on this camera is typical Canon menu format.....very easy to navigate. Smaller CMOS sensor will make these photos come out just average, but using the manual or programmable modes may improve the photos a bit. Overall not a bad basic super-zoom digital cameras for those going on vacation or just for general photography. Not really for the serious photographer from what I have got out of this camera so far. It uses the same battery that powered the older Canon SX-510 HS &amp; SX-530 HS also, battery life is so-so with this camera. There is a "Eco mode" on this camera which is meant to extend battery life somewhat. I have not tried it, so I cannot comment on the "Eco Mode" for this camera at this time. 3 of 5 stars I rate this camera due to a variety of reasons. It's most certainly better than the smaller point &amp; shoots Canon has, but not quite as good as older Canon super zoom bridge cameras such as the SX-40 HS or SX-50 HS versions.....but well enough for general vacation or family photos.</span>

<span>Bought this for my wife for Christmas and wanted to wait until we had it for a while before writing a review.  I gave it three stars because it’s cumbersome and hard to use. There’s no built in battery to charge which is a pain. It takes four AA batteries, but when it gets cold out (I live in Colorado) the camera doesn’t work. The battery light flashes and then shuts off. This is with new batteries too. The focus is pretty straight forward but working the functions is tricky and hard to understand. The picture quality is alright, about the same as my iPhone X which isn’t saying much for this camera. It does take a memory card that’s if you can keep fresh batteries in it long enough to fill the card up. There’s no option to change out lenses should you want to, I know we didn’t plan on this option we just wanted an easy to use camera. In this day and age of smart phones, you might be better off just using your phone rather than buying this future paperweight.</span>

<span>You can get good pictures from this camera if you have PLENTY of light but I think that has more to do with the sheer size of the photos it takes.

It only feels like a crop of usual photos. .<br/>This camera doesn't shoot in RAW so don't expect to do any major photo editing with these photos.<br/>And lastly the auto focus is hit and miss.

<span>I certainly had high hopes given the brand name of this camera.  However, if I had taken the time to check out prices on ebay, I might have had a better idea of its worth (like a fourth of what I paid on here.) The reason I got this was because I'd recently gotten into birding, and I really needed a good camera. I had been using my phone with a scope attached, mounted on a tripod, but maneuvering isn't always the easiest, and photos come out a bit pixelated.  Well, I have found it's not much different with this camera.  The zoom I get on my phone's scope is actually better than the Nikon's.  I can only zoom so much and it won't even focus at a certain point, and it really doesn't take much to reach that point.  I have gone back to the listing to try to find photos of the back of the camera, you know, the side you'd be looking at and use the most with all of the buttons, but I can't find them. For those wondering, there's no viewfinder.  If you're getting a little up in age and almost in need of the dreaded bifocals, this will be a little bit of a challenge for you. I have to hold the camera at quite a distance from my face to find what I'm looking for on the screen.  Zoom out, and it's a miracle if you can find anything worth photographing. This is not helpful to me, as I need to be a little covert around the birds and not all sprawled out with the camera.  Two other complaints I'd have is the amount of time the camera takes to reset after taking a photo. Seriously, I just want to try a snap as many photos of a bird as possible, and then weed out the one that turned out okay.  I have missed so many birds because the camera takes several seconds before it's ready to snap another photo.  Maybe there's a setting that needs changing? I don't know. The manual doesn't cover that. The last issue I have is being able to focus on slim subjects. I was trying to take a photo of a butterfly on a flower, but the camera refused to focus on the butterfly or the plant it was on, and only focused on the background. On my previous camera, a Kodak, I could slightly depress the button to focus, and it would give you options to focus closely or far away.  This is not what I'm finding with this camera, even after playing with all of the settings.  I am sad that I spent so much money on such a thing. It was supposed to be a special treat as I prefer to spend money on my hubby or kids, and the one thing I finally buy myself sucks.</span>

<span>My daughter saved up her allowance for a year to purchase this camera. She is very interested in photography and we ordered this camera to replace her older and inexpensive little Samsung digital camera. So far she is learning how to use it and take the best quality pictures she can. She's been online and on YouTube looking up all kinds of tutorials and info about how to use all the features of the camera.<br/>I am no expert on digital photography by any means so this review may not be super helpful to you, but so far she has found the camera easy to use, the picture quality is very nice. It arrived in 2 days with Prime shipping, and was packaged securely. As she and I have more experience with the camera I will come back and update my review!<br/><br/>***Updated, 4/19/2016<br/>So my daughter is still loving her camera and is getting pretty good at taking photos with it. She is really interested in nature photography and has taken hundreds of photos with it over the past month. The only thing she wanted me to add to our review is that she finds the zoom on the camera really excellent, and that you should make sure you invest in some rechargeable batteries because this camera is battery powered, doesn't charge on a USB like others do. I have attached a few pictures she's taken with the camera in the last couple weeks, the pictures have been turning out pretty well for someone who's almost 12 and she's getting the hang of using it.<br/><br/>Overall, still a five star purchase for us.</span>

<span>This camera does take beautiful pictures, but it is not the kind of product to order and get in on a Wednesday if you are shooting a friend's wedding on Friday. Part of the reason it takes gorgeous pictures is that it has about two dozen settings in the professional realm. I am not a professional, but have taken my own pictures for magazine articles for decades with Canon cameras (which wore out). But to me, it has taken many reviews of the quick basic guide (which comes with the camera) and the basic camera instructions (printed from the internet). On the plus side, this means you can adjust the quality of the white based on the type of light; ISO, add fill flash, you can adjust the exposure to lighter to darker, take sports photos, movies, fireworks, etc. But if it hadn't been for the book by Syl Arena called Lighting for Digital Photography, which I read twice, I would still not understand this camera. Additionally it is absolutely essential right from the first to load this with rechargeable batteries or you will only get 15 to 20 pictures per shoot on standard or heavy duty AA. Overall, a great camera for the money. A little tough to figure out.</span>

<span>I wanted a camera that took good pictures, without requiring a lot of fiddling with adjustments and without breaking the bank. This camera has filled the niche for me. The camera has several settings that are automatic , which cover different photo situations. The “Smart Scene” is your go to automatic option. It works well most all situations, whether normal or long distance. The “Macro” for up close on small objects works nice too. In the photos I attached, the flower was taken on Macro. This flower was about 3/4 of an inch wide. The lizard in the photo, was about 5-6 inches long and I took the picture from 20 feet away, with the camera set on Smart Scene. I was impressed that it took such a good picture of a small object, from so far away. The zoom is great. The camera isn’t too bulky and the weight is good. I carried it around my neck for three long days of checking out a zoo, an aquarium and a museum. Battery life was good too. I took a lot of pics and never changed batteries. On that note, it uses 4 AA batteries. I like this as opposed to a rechargeable battery, as you can throw extra batteries in your pocket and switch them out n the fly if the camera dies. Here are the  cons: The  auto focus can take several seconds to resolve itself. Not a deal breaker, but can be irritating. The flash will not auto deploy. You must manually extend it, if you think flash may be needed. I just left it up while inside. Other than that, the camera is great. It took a little practice and trial and error, but after about 45 min, I had it down. I can definitely recommend this camera.</span>

From the Manufacturer    For stunning photography with point and shoot ease, look no further than Canons EOS Rebel XSi. The EOS Rebel XSi brings staggering technological innovation to the masses. It features Canons EOS Integrated Cleaning System, Live View Function, a powerful DIGIC III Image Processor, plus a new 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and is available in a kit with the new EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens with Optical Image Stabilizer. The EOS Rebel XSis refined, ergonomic design includes a new 3.0-inch LCD monitor, compatibility with SD and SDHC memory cards and new accessories that enhance every aspect of the photographic experience.   Canon EOS Rebel XSi Highlights   New Technology for Outstanding Images   New Canon 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC III image processor Canon's CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. It offers many of the same new technologies to maximize each pixel's light gathering efficiency that were first seen with the professional EOS-1D Mark III model. It's an APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm), and there's an effective 1.6x increase in the lenss marked focal length when attached. Canons DIGIC III Image Processor dramatically enhances image quality and speeds up all camera operations for intuitive operation. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel XSis sensor to achieve unprecedented levels of performance in all lighting situations.   14-bit A/D converter With the EOS Rebel XSi, analog to digital signal conversion is executed by a 14-bit processor, which generates digital data with incredibly smooth tones. Formerly a feature only present in top-of-the-line pro digital SLR cameras, the 14-bit conversion gives incredibly smooth transitions from light to dark colors, with far less risk of "banding." A sky at sunset is a perfect example. With this rich 14-bit gradation the EOS Rebel XSi offers RAW images of the highest quality that can be processed with Canons Digital Photo Professional software. Even JPEG files, which are always finished at 8-bits per channel, use the full 14-bit conversion initially to generate the best possible color and tonal detail. Another huge benefit of the 14-bit conversion is the Highlight Tone Priority option, which allows critical shooters to increase the level of detail in bright areas of a scene up to one stop, without affecting overall exposure.   Auto Optimization The EOS Rebel XSis Auto Optimization is yet another image-quality tool that comes to the rescue in tricky lighting conditions. It can actually lighten dark areas of a scene while ensuring that bright areas maintain tonal detail. It's now available in all shooting modes, including P, Tv, Av, and Manual.    DIGIC III image processor Developed to maximize performance between the capture and recording stages of digital photography, the EOS Rebel XSis latest-generation DIGIC III Image Processor works in concert with Canons CMOS sensor to achieve even higher levels of performance. The entire electronic system is totally redesigned, giving the camera its incredible combination of speed and image quality. Digital noise is significantly reduced in shadow areas, and color reproduction is superior.   Speedy, Precise Operation   Excellent performance with 3.5 fps continuous shooting, up to 53 full-resolution JPEGs or 6 RAW images in a burst The EOS Rebel XSi operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS Rebel XSi is one of the fastest cameras available today. It can shoot up to 3.5 frames per second, in bursts of 53 JPEGs or 6 RAW files, so youll never, ever, miss a shot.   See the image in large LCD with Live View Function The EOS Rebel XSi has a huge, bright 3.0-inch TFT LCD monitor with 230,000 pixels and a viewing angle of 170 degrees. Its perfect for Live View composition or viewing camera settings like AF, ISO, Metering, AF Point selection and flash options. And the maximum brightness of the EOS Rebel XSi LCD monitor is about 30-percent greater than its predecessor, which is a big benefit when you're using the camera in bright sunlight.   Live View Function Live View Function enables you to view your subjects directly on the huge 3.0-inch LCD monitor. It's easy to magnify any part of the scene 5x or 10x for precise manual focus. And now, there are two ways to use Autofocus along with Live View Function in the EOS Rebel XSi. You can even choose a grid overlay, perfect for keeping straight lines in your subject straight in your pictures. In the studio, Live View Function can be used remotely via a computer through the EOS Rebel XSis USB connection.   Fast 9-point AF system, and two types of AF during Live View Function The EOS Rebel XSi has a high-precision 9-point wide area AF sensor for fast, accurate focus even in dim lighting. It has a number of focus modes, including One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF, AI Servo AF and Manual. In Live View Function, the EOS Rebel XSi has two AF modes: Quick mode, which uses the camera's standard 9-point AF system, and Live mode, which is a contrast-based AF system that reads the sharpness of subjects right from the imaging sensor, and can be overridden by pressing the AF mode selection button. A familiar feature in PowerShot cameras, Live mode AF uses similar technologies to achieve focus, while Quick mode is more appropriate for capturing action or for shooting in low light.   Compatible with compact SD and SDHC memory cards The EOS Rebel XSi is the first EOS Digital SLR camera to use popular SD and SDHC memory cards only. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD and SDHC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel XSis compact and lightweight body design.   Advanced Features for Advanced Photography   New advanced features include spot metering, external flash settings on the cameras menu, and a new higher-magnification viewfinder The EOS Rebel XSis 35-zone evaluative metering system with improved white balance analyzes light based on each zone in the viewing area, enabling the camera to choose the overall best exposure for the entire scene. It now features a spot meter, which reads a tiny area (about 4 percent) of the picture for extremely precise metering. It also provides Center-weighted average metering and partial metering for accurate exposure no matter the situation. The EOS Rebel XSi also has an improved, high magnification viewfinder that provides a larger overall view, and increased brightness and clarity. And the EOS Rebel XSi has a Display-Off sensor that automatically turns the LCD monitor off whenever the camera is at the photographer's eye. All relevant shooting information, including ISO, is displayed right in the viewfinder so its easy to change settings without moving the camera away from the eye.   EOS Integrated Cleaning System Photographers who must change lenses in dusty environments will find the advanced Canon EOS Integrated Cleaning System a tremendous time saver. Dust that settles on the sensor surface is removed using ultrasonic vibration. This Self Cleaning Sensor Unit routine is automatically activated whenever the camera is powered on or off. (It can also be manually activated.) A special collar positioned around the sensor collects the loosened dust. Dust particles can also be automatically removed via software. By shooting a plain white subject, the photographer can acquire dust position data that is transmitted along with the image (whether JPEG or RAW). Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) version 3.3 or later software can be used to manually or automatically erase the dust spots. It's not one feature, it's a built-in system to minimize the effect of dust in high-resolution digital images.   Self Cleaning Sensor Unit A key element of minimizing dust is preventing it from clinging to the front surface of the imaging sensor. To combat against this, the EOS Rebel XSi features a Canon-designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low-pass filter at the front of the sensor shakes off dust automatically with ultrasonic vibrations, removing dust from the sensor assembly. The EOS Rebel XSi has a new coating on the front surface of the low-pass filter, to increase its resistance to dust sticking to the sensor.   Dust Delete Data Detection Dust that may still remain on the front of the sensor can also be erased with software included in Digital Photo Professional (DPP) Version 3.3 or later software. A simple test shot of a plain, white object can be taken, using a menu setting. This Dust Delete Data image is analyzed in-camera, and the location and size of any remaining dust is added to any subsequent pictures taken. This data is transmitted along with the image, whether JPEG or RAW, and can be either manually or automatically erased in Canons DPP version 3.3 and later software. This added software option ensures the cleanest possible image, perfect for printing or archiving.   Picture Style settings With the EOS Rebel XSis Picture Style technology, photographers can change the look of their digital photographs. Color, saturation, sharpness and contrast settings create noticeable variation in the saved image. Changing a Picture Style setting is almost like a 35mm film user switching from one type of color film to another. In addition to six preset Picture Style settings, Canon offers additional downloadable "Picture Style Files," that can be installed into your camera for even more imaging options at your fingertips.   Highlight Tone Priority This vital Custom Function lets photographers get even better detail in bright highlights, even in contrasty lighting conditions. Its beneficial for nearly any type of picture, from mid-day shots on a safari to portraits in sunlight, where a user may encounter bright highlight areas where he or she wants to preserve details. Finally, theres no impact on the cameras shooting speed or burst rate when Highlight Tone Priority is engaged. It takes full advantage of the EOS Rebel XSi's new 14-bit per channel conversion, meaning there are 16,384 distinct colors from darkest to lightest in each color channel.   Shooting and Sharing Made Easy   Includes EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilizer lens The Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS zoom lens features the wide-angle to mid-range zoom flexibility of its non-IS predecessor with the significant advantage of Canon's true optical, lens-shift image stabilization system that yields up to a full four stops of image-shake correction.   Fully compatible with over 60 EF/EF-S Lenses and a wide range of EOS System accessories EOS Rebel XSi is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as Aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L Series lenses, and Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology are featured in select lenses to minimize the effect of camera shake. Through Canon lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS Rebel XSi.   Flash Photography The EOS Rebel XSi features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering -- giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering, there's a menu setting to change to "Average" flash metering, where the entire 35-zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure.   The Canon Speedlite 430EX is the ideal step-up accessory for powerful flash shooting with the EOS Rebel XSi. It has excellent flash power (maximum guide number of 141 ft./43m at ISO 100), and is the perfect way to get great flash pictures when you can't get right up to the subject. The 430EX is also great for bounce flash, with its tilting and swiveling flash head. It automatically zooms the flash head to cover lenses ranging from 16mm up to 105mm or longer with the EOS Rebel XSi. Of course, it works with the camera to provide full E-TTL II automatic flash exposure. And the 430EX has a powerful AF-assist beam, which allows the camera to autofocus even in total darkness on subjects as far as 32 ft. from the camera.   Included Software   Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 17.0) The EOS Rebel XSi comes bundled with an updated Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer. These include Canon's ZoomBrowser EX for Windows (Version 6.1), ImageBrowser for Macintosh OS X (Version 6.1), Digital Photo Professional (Version 3.3), the totally new Picture Style Editor (Version 1.0), Canons EOS Utility (Version 2.2), RAW Image Task (Version 2.8), PhotoStitch, and PTP TWAIN Driver. Each application is designed to perfect the captured images and streamline the digital workflow. ZoomBrowser EX v.6.1 and Digital Photo Professional v.3.3 for Windows are compatible with the new Windows Vista operating system.   Digital Photo Professional (Version 3.3) is an image processing program that enables high-speed RAW image processing, high-speed previewing for real-time image adjustment and support for sRGB, Adobe RGB and Wide Gamut RGB color spaces. Because its CMS (Color Management System) compatible, Digital Photo Professional allows for easy image layout and printing in Adobe RGB in conjunction with Easy-PhotoPrint and PictBridge printers. It also features the Dust Delete Data Detection tool for cleaner images.   EOS Utility (Version 2.3) for Macintosh or Windows handles the connection between the camera and computer, whenever theyre connected via USB. It allows remote controlled shooting from the computer, handles downloading of images from the camera to the computer, and allows seamless linking to either Canons ZoomBrowser/ImageBrowser or Digital Photo Professional software once images have been copied to the hard drive. Furthermore, its used to upload settings back into a USB-connected camera.   ZoomBrowser EX (Version 6.1) for Windows and ImageBrowser (Version 6.1) for Mac OS X are the easy, user-friendly options for viewing and editing of JPEG and even RAW image files. Both allow viewing of numerous types of images including finished TIFF and BMP files. Both also have a variety of search options for finding images, allow re-naming of single images or batches of files, and offer a variety of options for printing without using a separate image-editing program.   RAW Image Task (Version 2.8) for Windows/Macintosh This software is an integrated component of ZoomBrowser EX (Windows) or ImageBrowser (Mac). It allows processing of RAW images from EOS cameras, including the new EOS Rebel XSi, with a variety of adjustment possibilities. These options, as well as the overall color, contrast and "look" of RAW Image Task, closely mimic the characteristics of Canons in-camera JPEG processing.   What's in the Box   Canon Rebel XSi camera, EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilizer lens, rechargeable battery pack and charger, USB and video cables, a neckstrap, an EOS Solutions Disk CD, and a 1-year Canon U.S.A., Inc. limited warranty

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'll start by saying that this is my first SRL and I'm hooked.  I liked taking pictures but I never was "into photography" until I got this camera.  My wife used to have a film SRL and kept wanting a digital one, which eventually led to this purchase.  No regrets whatsoever.  I have had the camera about 9 months now.<br/><br/>Uses: I use this camera most frequently to capture moments from get-togethers with family and friends.  It's great for taking pictures of children who don't sit still.  I've taken lots of pictures of my dogs.  It makes them look sweeter than I think they are.  : )  The majority of my pictures are indoors but I take a large number outside too.  I'm the official family photographer now.<br/><br/>Children:  It is great for capturing personality and expressions of my young daughter.  Often, I just point the camera at her and hold down the shutter release and let the continuous mode capture all the poses and expressions.  I have gotten so many priceless pictures that never would have happened with a point and shoot (P&amp;S) camera.  Family and friends are always appreciative of me taking great quality pictures of their children as well.  My pictures with this camera are usually better than what they have taken.<br/><br/>VS P&amp;S:  Too many times, I would grab my P&amp;S, see a photo op, and take the picture only for the moment to be gone by the time the picture was actually taken.  The speed of this continuous shooting mode on this great.  The FPS of continuous mode is one of the main points that would get me to upgrade to a "nicer" camera.  Lack of money and time (to really learn the DSRL) are really the only reasons to stick with a P&amp;S.<br/><br/>VS Video:  I think it is a personal preference thing but I prefer great pictures to video.  Video is good to capture moments but there is just something very special about a great picture that I do not get from watching a video.  There is a reason for the saying "a picture speaks a thousand words."<br/><br/>RAW vs JPEG:  I tried going RAW for a while but every time I showed my wife the RAW I had tweaked in Photoshop Elements vs. the JPEG of the same shot, she almost always picked the dang JPEG so I'm almost always shooting the highest res JPEG these days.  I do still plan to do more RAW in the future though.  RAW gives you more options but takes more work.<br/><br/>Kit lens VS others:  Hmm, this is always an interesting debate.  I'm a visual guy but I'm not always the most detail oriented.  I rarely use the kit lens though I like the focal length it provides for indoor pictures.  My most often used lens is the Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM prime lens.  I'll be writing a review of that in the future and posting some pictures too.  I'm thinking about getting a high end zoom in the next 6 months to a year.  Basically, I want the quality and speed of that prime but the convenience of a zoom.  That combination costs about a grand.  I just have not decided to let go of that much money since I'm not a professional and do not receive any money for my pictures.  I got the EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom as part of a package deal when I got the XSi kit.  I really like the focal length, especially for outside nature pictures.  250mm on this camera (1.6x crop factor) really reaches out.  Having said that, it still makes me want more at times.  There are some wildlife (mostly bird) pictures that I wanted that needed some extra reach.  I got some pretty good zoo pictures with it.  This camera's resolution with take advantage of the high end lenses so my wish list has gotten quite pricey.<br/><br/>Lens wish list - these are all expensive, maybe even crazy-expensive for an amateur:<br/>EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM (macro photography is just fascinating to me)<br/>EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM or the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom (both have pros and cons)<br/>one of the EF 70-200mm L series lenses<br/>longer reach 300mm-400mm lens<br/><br/>Ease of Use/Quality of Pictures:  I am combining these two qualities because basically, with a DSLR, it comes down to how easily can you take really good pictures.  I think it is a combination of luck and skill.  You are not going to magically start taking the best pictures of your life just because you buy an expensive camera.  It still takes work.  I have a couple of coworkers who got a Nikon D90 around the same time I got this XSi.  They have taken good pictures, but both have make comments that it is hard to take tons of really good pictures with a SLR unless you spend time learning about the camera, photography concepts, and practice.  I think this is a great camera, but that 5 star rating doesn't mean it hands awesome pictures to you.  I've seen quotes of the % of "keepers" that good photographers expect to have from a photo shoot.  It isn't a very big number.  I just want perspective buyers to know that it takes some effort to get consistently great pictures out of any SLR, especially the more varied the conditions and setting you are photographing.<br/><br/>Accessories:  I've spent more on accessories than the price of the camera.  Is that required, no.  But it sure helps.  : )  That is a main reason why I'm glad I didn't start out with a more expensive camera.  It leaves money for other goodies.  I got two lenses in addition to the kit one, a backpack, remote, tripod, several books, Photoshop Elements, and a couple of SDHC cards.  Oh yea, I spent a pretty good chuck of change on the  Speedlite 580EX II Flash too.  It's great but can be harsh and startling to those being photographed if you aren't careful.  I'm trying to take more natural light pictures instead of flash, hence some of my lens choices.<br/><br/>I hope this long review was helpful.  I have really enjoyed this camera and starting photography as a hobby.  It has opened up a whole new world to me.</span>

<span>A very popular review here suggested that the 40D was a better deal.  I'm here to say I ignored his suggestion and am glad I did.  I've only had the XSi for a week, so haven't taken more than 100 real shots yet, but I'm really pleased.<br/><br/>First off, the XSi is $200 cheaper than the 40D (at the moment, it varies greatly) and 2/3rds the weight, both of which I appreciate.  I've never used the 40D so my comments below are about the XSi and the improvements over the Xti.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>* Bigger screen is great for viewing your results and checking the settings.<br/>* Seeing the ISO in the viewfinder is wonderful!  In the past I'd messed up shots because I'd left it set wrong, but no longer.<br/>* The viewfinder seems brighter and easier to view (haven't used in low light yet).<br/>* New Auto ISO makes getting quick shots in changing light easier, though I'll manually set it for shots when I had time to check all my settings.<br/>* Digital noise seems to be slightly reduced than the Xti.<br/>* Battery life is *excellent*.  I've only charged it once so far.<br/>* Even though the Live View focusing is a little funky, it works pretty well.  I can definitely see using it for night shots when the viewfinder is too dark (or maybe it won't be anymore?).  Nice touch that you can display a 3x3 grid on the screen for composition.  For auto-focusing, I prefer the Quick Focus mode, which blanks out the Live View while you're holding down the * button and the focusing is happening, but it's definitely usable.  The other auto-focus mode (Live Mode) takes so long that I won't use it.  Manual focusing is made much easier since they've added the ability to zoom in 10x in Live View, which is *wonderful*.  I'd missed that feature when I moved up from my Panasonic FZ30, which had it.<br/>* I like having the new spot metering for night shots.<br/>* I *really* like the new "My Menu" where you can select your favorite 6 menu options and they show up first, which means less digging through menus.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>* Highlight Tone Priority feature eliminates the ISO 100 option, which means you can get a little more digital noise.  And you can still get blown out highlights.  Maybe I'm not using it right or expecting too much?<br/>* Buttons on the back of the camera are more recessed than the Xti, making it less-obvious when you're trying to hit the right one w/o looking.  It's also *really* crowded back there!  Tough having fat fingers!<br/><br/>Neither pro nor con:<br/><br/>* RAW files are much bigger than in the Xti, many around 14MB, which means you get fewer shots per memory card (135 RAWs on a 2GB card, vs 197 on the same sized card in my Xti).  I expected a little increase from the increased resolution, but didn't count on the increase in the A/D bits from 12 to 14 to increase things too.  This also makes file transfers and loading into image editing software slower, and I think I'll need a bigger hard drive soon!<br/>* When reviewing photos, you can hit the Disp button to see more shot details.  Hit it once to just add that the storage format and picture count, which I *don't* think is worth its own step.  Hit the Disp button again to see the brightness histogram.  Hit it once more to see the luminescence histogram plus 3 small histograms for Red, Green and Blue.  Personally I don't have use for this last mode (or the second), so wish there was a Custom Function to disable them.<br/>* High ISO noise reduction - another feature I've turned off in Custom Functions.  Better to do advanced noise reduction on the computer.  Plus is slows down the continuous shooting mode to about 1.5 shots per second!  Ugh.<br/><br/>All in all the XSi is a really nice pro-sumer camera that lets you get down and dirty with details when you want but can also rip off quick shots w/o thinking about every little setting.</span>

<span>This is my first venture into buying a DSLR and I have a college budget so I made sure I was spending my money on the best camera possible. I had been reviewing DSLRs for months and months before finally deciding on the XSI, and I could not be happier with my decision! From the moment I took it out of the box I have been taking better pictures than I ever thought I could.<br/>  I have some photography experience from a black and white photography class my first semester, but I am still quite green when it comes to the finer points of photography. It didn't at all matter with this camera.  Right out of the box it didnt take me long to figure out the controls and which buttons did what. I love that there was a dedicated ISO button, white balance button, metering options button, AND shooting mode button. The worst thing is when you have a great shot that wont last long (think kids, animals, nature) and you have to dig through menus to get what you want. This camera eliminates that worry.<br/>  The lens that came with this thing is also much better than I expected in a kit lens. The image quality looks amazing while doing both very close up shots and landscape. I am not an expert on lenses, but I used one of my fathers lenses that cost several hundred dollars and there REALLY was hardly any difference in picture quality. Especially for a kit lens, I was quite impressed.<br/>  One last thing I love, THE LCD screen! This thing is HUGE and has very good image quality. It is great for reviewing your shot, right up to the fine details. It really makes it easier to see if you got the shot you wanted before you take it all the way back to your computer and see you screwed it up. As for the live view, I wasnt real sure when I would use it, but I found out the other day. There was a nest of hornets low to the ground and I sure as heck wasnt sticking my face down there. I convieniently used the live view feature to get the camera close and compose the shot while keeping my body in position to run :)<br/><br/>Really the only thing that has annoyed me so far is how you have to smush your nose and face into the LCD when using the viewfinder. I am all the time having to wipe smudges off. But really, after having this camera for a week and all I have to complain about is smudges on the LCD? That really is hardly a complaint at all. I would recommend it for anyone from complete newbies, to people like me with a smattering of experience, to those that actually know what they're doing. This camera is amazing.<br/><br/>Also, to anyone interested. I posted some of my first first pictures on my Flickr account. These are pictures from a guy who has basically forgotten most of his photography class 2 years ago, and has had little time to do much photography at all.  The XSI went a long way in covering up my inexperience. At least I think so :)<br/>[...]</span>

<span>This was the third DSLR I purchased, the other two being Nikon D60's. (returned both of those and bought the Rebel, which I should have done in the FIRST PLACE). I wanted to get back in to SLR/35 MM equivelant cameras from POS ones I used for many years now. Compared to the Nikon D60, this camera is well worth the extra money. I have used the Xsi for three months now and my daughter has also used for school. I have taken sporting shots, animals, family, scenery etc..and except for the auto settings to be sometimes inconsistent, the picture quality overall is fantastic. I take most of my pictures on full resolution and crop to my liking later and the Xsi allows for some really nice cropping results because of the 12.2 MP it offers. The Nikon is only 10.2 MP but that was not a deciding factor.  The extra MP are a bonus, but you will see no difference in prints between 10 and 12 MP in reality. Battery Life has been excellent and since I like to take action shots, I have used this camera at several sporting events this year. Most of the bad pictures, (yes, there are some from time to time) are likely as a result of the user, me. Once I got to understand the settings a little better, my action shots got better. If you want a DSLR and do not want to spend much more than $1,000 for a body, and two lenses, this basic kit plus the EF 55-250 MM lens, this is a great camera. I still have a few POS cameras that take equally good pictures, so won't recommend on picture quality basis alone. If you want a camera that takes great pictures, and do not really want the DSLR for it's SLR capabilities, save your money and get a POS. The Rebel is not really portable, and unlike a POS, you cannot fit in a pocket or conceal if you need to. It is a DSLR for more serious photography. I do recommend this camera, but please do not consider as a replacement to your POS, but rather a companion to it. I still enjoy my Panasonic TZ5 POS camera, but really like the Rebel XSi and would recommend over any other entry level DSLR camera. Spend the extra for this (or Rebel Ti) if you are also looking at the Nikon D40 or D60.  Also, it IS made of basically plastic, as are the other cameras on the market of this grouping.  It does not feel particularly clumsy, but I did purchase a Delkin rubber skin and it works wonderfully!</span>

The Canon EOS Digital Rebel camera now has a new, faster, even smaller big brother. Sibling rivalries aside, the 8.0-megapixel Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT SLR adds resolution, speed, extra creative control, and enhanced comfort in the hand to one of the smallest and lightest digital cameras in its class. Even with its advancements in ergonomic design and technology, this easy-to-use EOS digital camera is compatible with all of Canon's EF lenses, including the EF-S lenses.

Re-hab? maybe.<br/>Poorly done all around. Not recommended for anything else from this provider..</span>

<span>I'm brand new to the SLR world and decided about a month ago I'd continue a hobby I had started in middle school.  I was torn between the XTi and the XT.  After doing much research, learning, and getting information overload, I decided for my needs, I'd pick up the XT.  From what I read, the difference in MP wouldn't be much of an issue for me.  The self cleaning on the XTi would be awesome.  It came down to an issue with money and "wife" approval.  At just under $600 with kit lens, the XT was "psychologically" a little easier to buy than the XTi.  Anyway, I'm in the tech field and began thinking of the bodies like computers.  New and better stuff will keep coming out faster and cheaper, in this hobby the lenses seem to be the real investment.<br/><br/>Anyway, so far I love the camera.  I'm learning still but I do like the creative modes the XT offers.  Kind of like step learning.  I've got down all the terminology and what each thing does, but need to learn how it actually works and think the creative modes offered on XT are the perfect bridge.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no complaints so far about the camera (although i did get the dreaded 99 error that I've read about, but I turned off the camera and it went away.  I hope I didn't get a dud).<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>1.  Great value in my opinion<br/>2.  Camera feels good overall (some have complained about it being too light or feeling cheap).  I don't get this impression at all.  Although one of the cons I'm listing does have to do with the shape.<br/>3.  Easy to use with plenty of different modes to help you along the way<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1.  Like others have complained, the grip feels a bit compacted.  I don't have really big hands, but it feels a tad unnatural holding the camera.  Its not terrible though, but its a little annoying<br/>2.  Not necessarily against this camera, but one thing I didn't think about is that you can't shoot with glasses on.  Too hard.  But it does have an adjustment that goes to -2.5 (right at my vision) and I can shoot with no glasses, or contacts.<br/>3.  The kit lens leaves something to be desired.  I'm a newbie and I can already feel the limitations of this lens.  Under sunny conditions, the lens performs pretty good, no complaints.  But indoor photography sucks for lack of a better word.  Plus the range doesn't seem useful.  Its a short telephoto and maybe a long wide.  Would I buy it with the kit lens?  Yeah, for only $70 or $80 more, I think its worth it.  However, if choosing b/w the kit lens and picking up the nifty fifty (Canon 50mm prime), I might have been better off picking up the body only and getting the nifty fifty.  I'll know when I actually order the nifty fifty.  I guess I felt I wanted some range, so I went with the kit.<br/><br/>I am going to pick up the nifty fifty to see what this camera can really do.  I'm pumped about the hobby and so far so good.  I think I'd be even more excited if I had better glass on the cam.  But I'm still learning.  Maybe the kit lens isn't all that bad and its the photographer.<br/><br/>The only bad thing about this hobby though is that initially, I thought I would be happy with the body + kit lens.  Now I want more glass, better flash, monopod, etc, etc.</span>
