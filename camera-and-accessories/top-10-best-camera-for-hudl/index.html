<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>Overall, this camera would be better suited to monitor a room, not as a WebCam.<br/><br/>I spend most of my days in teleconferences. When speaking with people. I wanted a camera I can put on the tripod and place it in FRONT of the screen so they feel I am speaking to them, not looking in a strange direction.<br/><br/>I have tried a few cameras, including that built into my Mac, but I always got a bad view angle.<br/><br/>This camera allows me to place it on a small tripod and in front of the screen so I look at the people I am speaking to and straight into the camera lens.<br/>However, the camera, being 1.5 feet in front of my face, shows the whole room which for working from home makes little sense.<br/><br/>In addition, the camera, compared to others, shows the skin tones which less than flattering.</span>

<span>I received this C960 webcam yesterday. I bought it because it seemed simple to use, looked like great video at 1080p hd, dual speakers, low profile, good price. Since it's a PLUG-N-PLAY, why not put these words first on the user guide so users don't have to figure out what all the documents are for, in addition to indicating on user guide a #5. eMeetLink for Windows/MacOS to learn how to adjust the camera.....ughhh, it was so disappointing to spend over an hour figuring this out only to find out, the webcam installed itself as soon as you plugged it in. One guide had me find the device manager and 'UNINSTALL' the webcam off my laptop, unplug,, then plug it up again......WHY???? On the EMEET website there are 5 downloads for the C960, with a couple of them having ZIP files that I extracted, and some having a different webcam model number on it. THERE IS NO SOFTWARE TO DOWNLOAD TO ADJUST THE WEBCAM. Adjustments, from what I can tell, are in the media app you're using the webcam with.....and that seems limited.<br/>This is my first review of this product. Tomorrow I begin the work week and will be using the webcam, which is why I bought it in the first place. I'll provide a review after using it for this first week. Hopefully I won't have to return it. YES the 90degree view is awesome and/or can be intrusive in a small place. Another issue was the "Quick Start Guide' #4. Mount to tripod......well, why not put optional here. I had to find a YouTube video to figure out how to put on my laptop's screen. This C960 webcam better be worth all the time it took me to figure this out.<br/><br/>10.7.22<br/>Adding to my original review....I used the webcam all week and I received good comments on video/picture quality and microphone. I also used it at night in low light, the image was great, no dullness, no darkness, I almost didn't need to use my video ring. The picture was clear and defined. At this point the only downside is that you can't zoom in. So although you're sitting a foot away, it appears like you're really far back from the camera. It's wide zoom, with from what I can tell, no way to center yourself in the middle of the screen. It looks a bit weird when everyone seems to be in a perfect position, centered in the middle of their screen and I'm sitting so far back....when I'm actually sitting as close as they are. Haven't decided if I'll keep it yet because of this.</span>

<span>This camera came highly recommended by Zoom to create a Zoom Room. I had an odd shaped room that was wider than long. I figured why not try a Panacast camera to accommodate the width of my room which was 36'x20'. I placed the camera in the middle of the room between 2 monitors and everything was working great until I tred opening a Zoom Room. That is where the functionality really dipped.  Only 2 out of the 3 cameras worked. No matter where I was at in the room. So I called Zoom and they said there Panacast camera has never experienced these problems before and that I should contact there specific customer service team that deals specifically with this camera. I called them and they said send us an email with pictures and screen shots of what the problem actually is. I did this and they said we have no idea what could be causing these issues. So I called back another day and I was told verbatim "The Panacast Camera only works in offices that are 12' wide and approximately 15' deep."<br/><br/>Needless to say I was completely shocked when the Jabra Rep told me this. So I returned the camera and got my money back.<br/><br/>Long story short this camera looked great on paper but the execution of it was god awful. Zoom needs to update there functionality and what they should push on customers.</span>

<span>This is a very compact rugged camera that is easy to set up and use. It requires a mini tripod or stand for desktops or a standard tripod depending upon use and placement. The auto zoom detection picks up people from the overall 180 degree view and is really nice vs the typical laptop camera that a small group has to crowd around.<br/><br/>The resolution does not stay 4K as you zoom in with a single camera element so a farther shot from the camera to the subject becomes less sharp as the camera zooms in. Resolution is great on all three cameras, very good with two and just average on a single camera.<br/><br/>Unit runs very warm to the touch and the microphone is quite good.</span>

<span>It is small and barely noticeable.  I have one on the little stand made for it in our Board Room so we can live stream Board Meetings straight out of FB Live.  I set it to a fixed 140 degree panoramic view that covers the entire Board and the podium.  While the built-in microphone works well, I do not use it. I have the audio feed from the pa system plugging into the live feed so I get really good sound.  Everyone than needs to be on the audio has a microphone, so that works well.  I used it about 1 year and then it went out.  I ordered another and checked online at the Jabra support page.  They honored a replacement under warranty, so now I have a spare.</span>

<span>I'm not a camera expert, nor am I a professional streamer. I just work from home and needed a webcam. This one was pretty good (honestly probably better than I realize), but it started flickering and having trouble about two months ago.<br/><br/>It finally got so bad that I called Elgato customer support. They were so helpful, I was amazed. You don't see good customer support anymore, and from the very first conversation, I knew I was in good hands. They got some information about the issue and asked for computer specs and a video sample of the flickering. Once they saw that, they figured out that I needed to adjust a setting and update my firmware.<br/><br/>I went back and forth with them for about two days but they were extremely helpful. That alone is worth buying this camera over others. They resolved my issue (updating the firmware) and I can still use my camera.<br/><br/>Also, I think it's worth noting that when I called them it was very easy to get ahold of them on the phone. There wasn't endless menus with robots running me around in circles.<br/><br/>I am very impressed, so much that I came here to write a review. Thanks Elgato!</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>—Replaces and performs better than the Logitech C922x Pro Stream Webcam when streaming/recording<br/>—Transmits uncompressed format to capture finer details, and uses a USB 3.0 port instead of 2.0<br/>—Closest to having a DSLR lens that's in a more expensive camera<br/>—Camera software has lots of features and manual adjustments for finetuning. Auto adjustments aren't always reliable, but manual adjustments can remedy this<br/>—Privacy lens cap included, though it takes a bit of fiddling when attaching/detaching. It's best to do it at a vertical angle to snap into place or remove<br/>—Fixed focus can range from several inches to several feet away<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>—A small pixel is present in front of the lens that likely happened during the assembly process. Though less noticeable at smaller resolutions, it's more apparent when the resolution is higher.<br/>—A bit pricey for customers who are searching for a more budget-friendly option such as a Razer Kiyo Pro<br/>—No autofocus present for very close shots<br/>—Tends to feel fragile when held or during horizontal/vertical adjustment</span>

<span>Reason for purchasing. I purchased this product for improving the picture quality of my Zoom conferencing and other things like that.<br/><br/>Did I achieve the result?  It does improve upon what I had previously, but I cannot see the 4K quality. Probably Zoom does not allow that (I tried it on a Super HD display!). Let's say that quality is fine, but not as good as I expected though.<br/><br/>Viewing angles: 3 different viewing angles (68 degrees, 75 and 90 i believe) provide a good amount of customization although for teleconferencing using a virtual background, I find the 68 the most suitable. If there were more people participating from the same location 90 is definitely the choice. Good option to have, not extremely relevant for a home office though.<br/><br/>Autofocus does its job and via the G-Hub it is easy to center myself inside the camera.  However, without the G-Hub, I would not know how to do it.  I am sure that there is a way. Autofocus can be replaced by manual settings, but when I tried I did not improve upon the autofocus.<br/><br/>Instruction manual is miserable, but I downloaded one from internet. Not too useful either. At least the schematics on how to install it are very clear and it is actually quite easy as written earlier.<br/><br/>Installation was super easy and it was working within 60 seconds from opening the box. I do have the Logitech G-Hub, as I have also a Yeti Nano microphone and thus the Brio camera appeared immediately on the Hub. To be fair, on a second computer, without G-Hub, I can start Zoom and Zoom gives me the option to select this webcam, but without it, I am not sure where to look for it as no software was installed. As you can see in the picture I attached, the webcam is discrete and it is easy to put and keep in place (I tried it on several laptops and display) I was even able to put it on top of my large speakers while testing with the camera from below my height.<br/><br/>Overall, I am fine with this webcam, everything seems to be in order and definitely it improved my situation, but I was expecting (maybe I had erroneous expectations) a tad higher quality of camera as I see many streamers reaching very nice qualities. Definitely better than mine. The quality is not professional grade, not at the top standards at least.</span>

<span>Omg!  I’ve been looking for a cam that does zoom in for YEARS! This cam has it!!<br/>Most cams are made for 17 year old girls who record vids on their laptop for social media.  Their laptop is 12 inches away from their face.  Most cams DO NOT take into account that you are using the cam in a business setting.  My camera (and monitor) are 24" away from my face, so until this point, having the camera zoom would have been quite helpful.  3 settings fit all biz needs.  Up to 3 persons in shot, 10 persons, 25 persons, which is 90%, 78%, and 65% respectively.  GENIUS settings!!<br/><br/>For this feature:  i give it 5+++ stars!  Well done!<br/><br/>Every time they launch a new iPhone, they always talk about what a great camera they came out with.  Again, there is NO ZOOM feature.  The phone is built for a 6' tall man's arm length (taking a selfie).  If you don't have that arm length, your shot is not ideal.<br/><br/>I upload a pic on Fb frequently.  Again, to replace profile pic, there is no Zoom in, only Zoom out.  If you Zoom out, your face will no longer be in the picture.  Stupid.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Skin tones weren’t good, but because of another photo app I use, I figured maybe there is an app that I can make further corrections.  My face was pink and my arms were orange.  This won't happen to you as the built-in color correction will likely work 95% of the time.  It didn't work for me as I am brown-skinned.<br/><br/>I called LogiTech to ask if they had an app.  Yes!  Success. Got that solved, too!  (It's called Contrast and Saturation).<br/><br/>All around great camera, I would give it more stars if I could.  Oh, and my friend told me to tell you, you DON'T have to wear makeup.  Full skin correction happens!</span>

<span>The camera is okay.  No one will watch your videos and say "man he should have gotten a better camera", but no one will say "OH WOW!" either.  It only has a modest zoom, Im not even for sure if it actually goes a full 3x zoom or not, maybe more like 2.5x.<br/><br/>But none the less it is a very cheap PTZ camera and to be honest, other than not awesome software support, I don't have much else to complain about.  It will be used to record church services to be uploaded to a website, and I think it will do a better job than any other camera under $500 that doesn't require a dedicated person to operate.  If you need a amazing zoom, this isn't for you.  If you want to wow people, this isn't for you.  If you want a camera that is simply good enough, you have a winner here.<br/><br/>Edit---<br/><br/>After further playing with the camera, I have one other complaint.  It doesn't have a high framerate.  I'm 90% for sure if Huddlecam made a dedicated driver for this device it would solve it, as using the generic Windows driver for such a complex device isn't necessarily the best idea in the world.  None the less, with a 1080p stream it stays pretty steady at about 14-18FPS.  I have not tried bumping it down to 720p yet, but I think that will be the way to go as long as I can get it up closer to 25FPS or so.  Although this is unfortunate, it doesn't change my rating as it still suits my needs fairly well.</span>

<span>After a few bumps in the road I can now say the HuddleCamHD 3x PTZ camera is worth looking at. It is a very robust PTZ camera for the price.<br/>If you’re a small business and on a pretty tight budget, at $400.00 this is a real bargain when it comes to PTZ conferencing cameras.<br/>The initial problems I had with the HuddleCamHD 3x PTZ camera were mostly self-made. Since it comes with a remote I started pushing buttons and I pushed the wrong ones. The remote will accept up to 3 cameras. I my zest at pushing buttons, I either pushed the button for camera 2, or maybe 3. After my pushing buttons frenzy, I could not get the HuddleCam to work (period) and at first I did not know why. After visiting the user manual and finally figured it out. Once I selected the camera 1 button the HuddleCamHD came back to life.<br/>The Pros:<br/>Economical ($400.00). You won’t find a PTZ camera anywhere that I know of at this price.<br/>Works great with programs like Skype for video conferencing.<br/>Can be used with most video encoders for live streaming or creating videos. I do know it works well with vMix live video encoder.<br/>2-Year warranty.<br/>HuddleCamHD 3x can be setup by just about anyone in a few minutes<br/>USB (2.0) connection will allow for use with older computers that do not have USB 3.0. Note, the HuddleCamHD is however backward compatible to USB 3.0.<br/>Camera best used in small conference rooms or studios<br/>360 degree rotation so it can pick up the entire room<br/>The Cons:<br/>The HuddleCamHD 3x does not accept bright lighting well. It works best in subdued lighting; like the type of lighting found in most conference rooms.<br/>Short zoom. Don’t expect this camera to work for large conference areas.<br/>The lens is a trade-off for the price of the camera. It is not a super high-quality lens as found in PTZ cameras costing much more. One thing you may notice is colors are not quite true.<br/>USB 2.0 vs. higher priced USB 3.0 PTZ cameras as a rule produce much better video.<br/></span>

<span>UPDATED September 18, 2020 - I’ve replaced the images with better examples.  The first two are of a mirror in an allegedly haunted and abandoned house.  One is infrared and the other full spectrum.  Notice in the infrared shot the wood grain in the mirror’s frame and how much of that detail is lost to full spectrum.  Also look at the many lens flares.  The next two compares both methods on a staircase in a completely dark house—I could not see my hand in front of me.  The last is a full spectrum image from a professional camera.  Notice the crisp detail in the leaves.  This is how full spectrum should look.<br/><br/>UPDATED June 24, 2019 - After using this camera for several months I am changing my recommendation to DO NOT BUY!  New information has been added throughout this review in brackets.  [I recommend instead any of the Sony night vision cameras that run from $210-$1k.  Sony - Handycam CX405 Flash Memory Camcorder - Black]<br/><br/>This Zohulu camera comes in a variety of names and custom configurations for different sellers.  I liked this particular bundle because it came with two SDHC chips, a great little IR flashlight [which we discovered does not come with batteries or a charger], and a Macro lens that some others didn't have [the macro lens blocks the built in IR light].  You should check around for the bundle that meets your needs.  The names can be Ancter, Zohulu, or even Cleveland Paranormal.  The main brand is Zohulu, a trademark of  ShenZhen PuFeiSi Electronics Co.  I spent a lot of time in China looking at digital video systems for security and was very impressed with the Chinese brands of night vision security systems. [In our testing my partner bought a different model, the Ancter and for some reason, it performs better than this one, although it appears to be essentially the same.]<br/><br/>AFFORDABILITY - The main struggle with any hobbyist "Ghost Hunter" is money.  We do this hobby for the love of the sport and we don't do it for money.  For every millionaire plumber doing this, there are tens of thousands of us struggling to pay our bills,  So when I evaluate equipment I hold the "value for the money" as the single most important feature.  This camera was made for Paranormal work which is what [I thought was]  so sweet about it.  I can film an abandoned house, switch on the spot to Infrared or with a couple of menu clicks get to the Full Spectrum feature.  [I have since learned that full spectrum is a gimmick.  If you have an object in focus, then you change the lighting type your object will need to be refocused because the focal point is based on the wavelength of the light.  Because ultraviolet is much shorter wavelength than infrared, it is a physical impossibility for a full spectrum shot to be totally in focus.  It will always look a little fuzzy.  Plus, infrared is a stronger wavelength that tends to wash out the ultraviolet.  There is no hard evidence that full spectrum provides any advantage in ghost hunting. People will show you evidence and claim that is their proof of the value of full spectrum, but the image was most likely made with infrared light and tinted purple by ultraviolet.  It would have been more clear in pure infrared]<br/><br/>I can connect to the camera with my phone and while I leave one downstairs guarding the front door I can watch it on my phone while I'm upstairs.  I can review the footage using the camera LCD screen or my iPhone, then easily download it on the spot to my iPhone.  Because I am one of those Apple techies, I have the full Apple entourage -  a Mac Pro, iPod, and iPad at home.  By the time I get home, all my footage has been downloaded to the Mac and to my iPad and iPod automatically.  It's inexpensive, it gets the job done [poorly], and it is very well affordable!<br/><br/>LENS IMPERFECTIONS - Now for the rest - I am an actor and a cinematographer, I have had films play at SXSW, Tribeca, and Cannes.  My favorite camera is my Blackmagic Cinema Camera.  Nothing beats it for Mirror Images Phenomenon.  Because it records in raw, uncompressed digital negatives, I can adjust all my white balance, ISO, etc at the computer just as if I am still at the mirror with my camera.  That camera was $2,000 for the body and $1,000 for the Canon lens.  This paranormal camera was $200 for everything.  We have to keep that in mind at all points in the review.  I only have the Blackmagic because I was filming customer commercials with it.  I couldn't afford it otherwise so I was lucky.  It doesn't handle infrared so it requires visible light - a real downer for paranormal work.  This paranormal camera actually has three lenses.  It has the standard lens with an average field of view.  It also comes with a Macro lens for super closeup work which is fantastic.  Then you add yet another lens on top of that Macro lens to come up with their Ultra-Wide lens configuration.  The result is horrific lens flares.  See my two pictures.  Lens flares are the result of imperfections in the lens glass - round objects will take on a hexagon shape when they get a little out of focus.  This is the lens inability to handle out-of-focus light.  I'd say those shots above look fantastic for a cinematic choice, but are a disaster for paranormal work.  Determining which anomalies are paranormal and which are lens problems can be quite difficult.  [after shooting a variety of investigations using other infrared and cinema cameras, I don't bring this one along anymore.  The lens problems are extreme.]  So I only shoot now with the standard lens which cleans up most but not all of the flares.  They make a distinction in their manual that the image is not an infrared image.  It has an internal infrared light (which the ultra-wide lens blocks by the way) and pushing the IR button on the back of the camera automatically switches off the infrared filters and turns on the light.  The camera looks at the scene and then recreates a black and white image to represent it.  At least, that's the way the manual is written.  It's an interesting read because the English is very good in the beginning but it looks like the interpreter got tired as she/he worked through the manual.  The English started getting worse and by the time it got to the Full Spectrum explanation at the end it was almost unreadable.  So it's possible it was a poor translation but the camera doesn't have the traditional greenish hue of night vision, it looks black and white.<br/><br/>FULL SPECTRUM - Full Spectrum mode adds a fuzziness or haze to the image.  The IR shots are much cleaner than the Full Spectrum.  I have tens of thousands of images from investigations with hundreds of apparitions in infrared.  I've yet to capture anything in ultra-violet.  Full Spectrum is made by merging 3 separate images - one from the near-IR range, one from the visible range, and one from the near-ultraviolet range.  That's why the image looks fuzzier, these are different focal lengths shot in one focal plane so of course it would be a little fuzzy.  I'm not convinced yet that there is any value to Full Spectrum.  IR is a snap, push a button on the back of the camera. When I’m out on a hunt being able to tap one button that turns on the infrared light and switches to black &amp; white mode is sweet.  Full Spectrum, however, requires doing that, plus going into the menu settings under ‘Color’, and changing the setting to ‘Vivid’.  So for me, I use just the single, built-in lens, and switch between visible light and IR by using the simple push button.  This also makes the internal IR light usable again as it is no longer blocked by the wide angle lens.  Additional information about full spectrum from Wikipedia says:  It is important to note that while the converted camera sensor is capable of recording in both the ultraviolet and infrared region, when mixed light hits the sensor it will be the longer infrared waves that will predominate in the recording. Little or no shortwave ultraviolet light may be recorded unless selective filtering is applied to cut some or all of the infrared light. The longwave infrared light may also wash out a considerable amount of the visible light in the blue and green areas in a full spectrum photograph. Similarly if infrared light is entirely blocked, the visible light can overwhelm the recording of the ultraviolet light. So there is no truly full-spectrum photograph that can be made [with this camera. Good full spectrum cameras exist and the standard method is to shoot the still-subject well-focused three times, with three different filters and merging the 3 images into one.  Video requires a complicated method of realtime splitting of the image 3 ways, applying the appropriate filter, then recombining before saving. $$$.  This camera has no manual focus, it is set for infinite focus.]<br/><br/>ODDITIES, RESOLUTION &amp;  FRAME RATE - This is a really strange method, there is no separate setting for frame rate.  The rates are matched to the resolution.  If you want a higher frame rate, you will have to accept a lower resolution.  If you want 4k or 3840 x 2160 you will have to accept 24 frames per second.  That's not a problem for me because that's what all my movies are shot at, but I can't match it to my iPhone's 30FPS - just let the editing software figure it out.  Another oddity is that for UHD they use the free disk archiver program "DAR" to compress the image to save chip space.  It's saved as a 4:3 video on the chip, then the DAR software uncompresses it back to 16:9 format.  However, my editing software says this clip is actually 2880 x 2160 @ 24fps.  [This probably contributes to the poor quality of the image] The next choice is QHD or 2560 x 1440 and you get this size at 30fps, no other option.  Next is FHD or 1920 x 1080 at 60fps.  That is standard HD running at 60fps.  [In bright light this seemed to produce the best possible video for this camera].  Next is HD or 1280 x 720 @ 120fps.  What?  120fps.  Crazy.  No other choice.  Historically I believe that was the first HD format that came out followed quickly by 1920x1080p.  Finally, we have VGA or 640 x 480 at 30 fps.  What?  30 fps.  That's just...weird.  It uses JPG for still images and the container is MP4 for video.  My editor says it is H.264 compression but my guess is that it's motion jpeg compressed again (barely)  by H.264 getting it into the MP4 container, that would make sense.  The two samples I provided show the first mistake I made - it's low resolution.  Evidently, it defaults to that every time, at least I haven't been able to get it to stay at HD so be sure check it before every shoot.  It does provide the recording format symbol on the LCD screen so it's easy to check.  The documentation said VGA is 640x480@30fps but my software said it was actually 640x360@30fps.  The third picture I uploaded is this UHD format but I cropped it.  I simply wanted to show the quality of the image and the fact that it is an infinite depth of field focus.  There is NO option for focus either manually or automatically.<br/><br/>FACE DETECTING FEATURE - in a poorly documented section it explains that you can enable face detecting, which I assume will then ensure a good focus on the subject.  Everything in your image will be more or less in focus, which could be a good thing I suppose for paranormal work.  It's often a problem that the key shot is out of focus.  Another poorly documented section is METERING.  I'm assuming this is how it handles light in the scene, from averaging across many samples to a single point sample, ergo, face detect.  Other than Full Spectrum looking fuzzy to me, I have no complaints about the instant focusing of this camera.  Having said that, the Zoom lever on the top of the camera is too close to the menu lever.  Trying to use your thumb to zoom your lens might accidentally kick it out of video recording mode sending it either the camera mode or menu mode.<br/><br/>AUDIO -  This is by far the worst feature of the camera.  The audio is atrocious.  It sounds like you are in a 55-gallon drum sinking to the bottom of the ocean.  It's very bad, and it can really mess up your editing too.  If you ever have trouble with things getting out of synch, look at the audio.  This is a common synch issue across all types of editors.  This camera shoots a mono signal, which I could live with but it is a bizarre 32 kHz.  CD's and DVD's are 44.1 kHz,  iPhones are 48 kHz and my best device, the Zoom H4n records uncompressed WAV files at 96khz.  So they decided to record the mono file at 1/3rd of the digital audio of my Zoom.  It's horrible.  Good EVPs don't need microphones, I've captured many EVPs in experiments with microphones totally disabled..  [But this camera will shred the EVP.].  I've recorded EVPs with the mikes completely removed, so that does work, but I don't get as many EVPs as I normally would.  I'm going to try to use an external mike, one that uses its own battery power and another that uses the camera power.  This camera, fortunately, has a working hot shoe, so many different attachments from IR lights to external shotgun mikes are possible.  I will update this review when I've done that. [I tried using different high-quality microphones, both stereo with adapter plugs for mono and mono microphones.  The quality of the microphone makes no difference because the camera shreds it to death when saving it to the chip.  I absolutely hate the audio of this camera]<br/><br/>DON’T take my word for it!  Look at the videos from other reviewers.  Blow them up to full screen and look at all the distortion, artifacts and pixelation in the video.  The compression destroys the video.  Now listen to their audio, don’t skip over it just take a quiet moment and listen to it.  It’s abysmal!<br/><br/>BATTERY - this bundle comes with two batteries, a regular capacity and a high capacity battery.  I used the high capacity battery on a recent investigation and it held up for an hour even using an external IR light on the hot shoe.  I had disabled the onboard IR light because most of it is blocked by the wide angle lens.  I'm happy that between the two batteries I should be fine.  I've learned to leave a complete set of everything, batteries, media, etc out in my car because if the entities kill the batteries in my camera, they will also kill them in my pocket.  For some reason, the ones in the car are not touched nor do they do a second attack.  I'm usually fine after reloading.<br/><br/>SUMMARY - there was a lot of negative in the last few paragraphs, for $200 this is [a terrible buy ].  By managing the issues [I still wish I would have bought one of the Sony handycams].  My final setup is this - I'm recording in UHD at 24 fps.  I'm using an external Sony microphone on the top hot shoe that does not draw power, it has it's own battery.  I disable the onboard IR light to save battery.  I have the spotlight that this bundle comes with mounted underneath the camera. [it did not come with a rechargeable battery nor did it have a charger.  I bought a kit with both for $23 off Amazon]  I also carry a Zoom recorder in my top shirt pocket to synch to the camera's audio channel.  Most of my evidence is then presented using the Zoom audio.  If I can start off in visible light I do so, but most times I'm running Infrared the entire time.  I can connect to the camera with my iPhone out in the field if needed, checking recorded evidence is a snap.  I found that once I get home, it's easier and faster to pull the chip out and stick it in my Mac for downloading.  The chip is formated in MS-DOS FAT32.<br/><br/>MAC COMPATIBILITY - Once last note about compatibility.  One reviewer said it is not supported by Apple, another reviewer said it is supported.  They are both right.  The files are standard JPG or mp4 files.  Any Mac can read them.  The SDHC Chip is formatted as MS-DOS FAT 32.  Macs can read those too and can indeed reformat them in that format.  However, while there is an app that one can use to view and download files onto your iPhone or iPad, they did not make one for an iMac.  Further, when you connect the camera to your Mac via the USB connector, it fails to connect.  The manual says it is not supported by Mac OS, only Windows or iOS devices such as iPhones.  Still, the chip works fine in the chip reader on my Mac.  I hope this helps people decide.  I hunted for years with the old fashioned Sony Nightshots with tape recorder which destroyed the audio with the tape motor, but the video was superb.  Now they are digital and are what I recommend for Ghost Hunters.</span>

<span>the camcorder/camera seemed to work decent. I did however notice that it wont zoom when resolution is set to the FHD or HD resolution types and only on 2K or 4K it will zoom in and out. the description failed to mention that there wasnt any batteries included for the flashlight attachment in which i had no idea what batteries it took. i had to research online to figure that out myself. that was really only part i disliked about it. other than that it seems operational and decent for the use of it with pretty neat features. Will test it out more here soon with my paranormal investigation coming up.</span>
