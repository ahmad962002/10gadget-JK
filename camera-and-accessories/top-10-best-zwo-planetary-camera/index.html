Building on the popularity of our NexStar 114SLT telescope, the 130SLT by Celestron inspires us to go bigger, with 30% more light-gathering power than our 114mm telescope. The Celestron NexStar 130SLT is a computerized telescope that offers a database of more than 4,000 stars, galaxies, nebulae, and more. The telescope locates your object with pinpoint accuracy and tracks it. At the heart of the telescope’s Newtonian reflector optical design, a large 130mm primary mirror gives fully color-corrected views ideal for astronomical use. The 130SLT comes with a fully computerized NexStar+ hand control. The computerized hand control gives you the ability to automatically slew to any of its 4,000+ objects, including over 600 galaxies, 300 clusters, and dozens of beautiful binary stars. This telescope for adults and kids to be used together is ideal for weekend camping trips or excursions to dark sky sites. Its compact form factor makes it easy to transport and assemble just about anywhere. With its pre-assembled, adjustable steel tripod, the NexStar 130SLT can be up and ready to use in a matter of minutes. Our SkyAlign alignment technology and the included StarPointer Finderscope with a red LED make aligning a breeze. Simply center any three bright objects in the eyepiece and the NexStar SLT aligns to the night sky, ready to locate thousands of objects. The NexStar 130SLT Computerized GoTo Telescope also includes a free download of our Starry Night Basic Edition astronomy software for an interactive sky simulation. The power of this computerized telescope allows you to view the details of the lunar surface, the rings of Saturn, the polar ice caps on Mars, the cloud belts on Jupiter, and a number of the Messier objects, such as the globular cluster in Hercules (M13) or the Great Nebula in Orion (M42). Explore some of the fainter Messier objects using the additional light-gathering capabilities of the 130SLT’s five-inch primary mirror. Buy with confidence from the world’s #1 telescope brand, based in California since 1960..

<span>Easy to setup and use, was even able to get my laptop to sync up with the scope and controls it via USB. This has been much easier than navigating the handheld. I've been able to see some great things, with Saturn and its rings, and Jupiter with its stripes. I could even see Jupiter's 4 moons! Very happy with my first scope.</span>

<span>My wife bought this scope for me for Christmas.  I had no experience with astronomy prior to that.  It's a little finicky to set up but once you do it correctly, it'll work well.  The image may not be exactly in the center but it should be close.<br/><br/>The eyepieces that come with it are just okay.  They're a step below kelner eyepieces (which is below Plossls).  For eyepieces, use a low power eyepiece (25mm) to scan for objects.  With eyepieces, the lower the number the higher the magnification.  If you buy eyepieces, stick to good quality eyepieces in the 5mm to 35mm range.  More magnification (&lt;5mm) doesn't really help as the scope is limited by the atmosphere. Lower magnification eyepiece (&gt;35mm) will result in an exit pupil that is too large (makes it difficult to see without a moving black blob appearing in the eyepiece).  Celestron X-Cel eyepieces would work well for this scope and aren't too expensive.  I like the Baader Hyperion as well.  It gives a wide angle view and a large eyeglass with good eye relief to look through (great for eyeglass wearers).  A x2 Barlow lens is a good option to pick up as well.  Combined with your eyepieces, it doubles your available magnifications (9mm becomes a 4.5mm, 25mm becomes a 12.5mm).  I have the Orion shorty x2 barlow.<br/><br/>Don't bother with the eyepiece kits.  The optics are too close together in strength so you'll probably only use 3 of the 5.  The color filters are pretty useless except for a moon filter.  All you really need are 3 eyepieces a low power (no greater than 35mm), a medium power (14-18mm) and a high power (no less than 5mm).<br/><br/>You'll need a collimator.  With Newtonians, you'll need to align the mirrors.  It's best if you check it each night before you use it.  Moving the telescope can knock it out of wack.  A collimator helps you line everything back up.  I have the Orion laser collimator.<br/><br/>Here are some setup tips for setting up the scope for Goto use:<br/><br/>1. If you picked a city instead of entering a latitude longitude, and you don't actually live in the middle of the city (you just picked the closest one), do a factory reset of the computer and choose latitude-longitude instead. It's much more accurate. You can find the latitude longitude with a smart-phone app (e.g. Compass for Android) or by googling your address. You'll need the lat long in degrees, minutes, seconds (not the digital version like -117.0101). It should look like W 117 15' 12'<br/>Sometimes a city selection is too broad. I am about 20-30 miles outside the city I chose and it makes a big difference when the scope is skewing.<br/><br/>2. Make sure you're using the correct time/date settings including daylight savings time vs standard time.  Use your cellphone time.<br/><br/>3. Instead of using 3-star align, use Auto-Two-Star align. It'll require you to know the names of the stars but it's much better.  I use Google Skymap to find one of the stars in the list if I don't know the name or the ones I do know are obscured.  If you use the 3-star align, chose bright stars that are on opposite sides of the sky and not in a line (a triangle pattern is preferred).  For example, if you just used the stars in Orion, that's probably too small of an area of the sky.  Choose one star in Orion (e.g. Betelgeuse), one in Gemini (e.g. Castor) and one in Cassiopeia.<br/><br/>4. When centering a star during alignment, defocus the star so it looks like a ball rather than a point of light. It'll be much easier to get in in the center.<br/><br/>5. When centering on the final star try to move the scope in the same direction as it was moving when it skewed to the star you chose. So for example, if it was moving down and to the left when it stopped, position the scope so that when you get it in the center of the view that you are moving it down and to the left when you stop.<br/><br/>UPDATE 5/19/2016:  I recently purchased a ZWO ASI185MC camera that I'm using with the 130SLT.  The camera will easily come to focus when used in the 2" adapter.  It will come to focus in the 1.25" adapter as well but it's a little closer to max in-focus.  I'm getting pretty good images with it doing short exposure (&lt;15seconds) and stacking.  You'll want to use a Bahtinov Mask to focus.  I purchased an Orion Accufocus which greatly helps with focusing the image without everything shaking.  Check my reviews for the correct items.<br/><br/>I also have it working with a computer (computer drives the scope).  You need to install ASCOM drivers (6.2) and ASCOM drivers for the Celestron product line.  Just search for "ASCOM drivers" on google.  It's not necessary but it's nice for an all-in-one software package (Astrolive USB).<br/><br/>I added some pictures I took of M51, M57, Jupiter and the moon.  These were taken from my front yard about 5 miles from the city.  The deep space objects won't appear that clear when viewing through the eyepiece (cameras pick up more light than our night vision does).<br/><br/>Update 6/28/2016:<br/>One thing to really improve your goto results is to use "Precise Goto".  It's undocumented in the manual. It's accessed differently than a regular goto.  Press the "Menu" button.  Then use the up/down arrows (6 &amp;9 key) to find "Precise Goto".  Then select "Database".  Finally, choose from the object list type using the up/down arrows (e.g. Messier, NGC, Named Objects).  So for instance, if I choose "Messier" and then enter the number for the Messier Object (1-110).  It will calculate and give you a list of 5 bright stars with #1 being closest to the object.  Select 1.  The scope will slew to where it thinks it is.  Center the bright star with the red dot finder and look through your eyepiece to see if it's centered there as well.  Once it's centered in the eyepiece, hit &lt;Enter&gt;.  The scope will slew to the object and there's a good chance it will be centered in your eyepiece.  I use this feature with my camera and it almost always gets it close to the field of view.  You should easily find the object in the field of view of a 25mm eyepiece (though it may be faint and fuzzy).</span>

<span>OK, here is the Bible according to Celestron SLT scopes.<br/><br/>When the scope is working, it's fantastic (see below if you have a non-working scope with a boot loader failure).  The Newtonian design is comfortable to look through - the eyepiece is at the front of the scope, and it is positioned around eye-level when standing.  Newtonian optics are also simple, which keeps the cost down (and minimizes light lost to lens absorption).<br/><br/>The optic properties of this scope are outstanding.  The 650mm focal length and 150mm (about 5-1/8") aperture are great specs, especially when paired with the highly-recommended Celestron accessory kit (Celestron Model 94303, available on Amazon).  The scope comes with a 9mm and 25mm eyepiece, for magnifications of 72 and 26 power (magnification is focal length divided by eyepiece length, so magnification increases as focal length increases, and decreases as eyepiece length increases).  The big 130mm aperture of this scope gives the scope a maximum useful magnification of about 307 power, using the rule of thumb that you can magnify 60 times for each inch of aperture.<br/><br/>At a focal ratio of f5, this is a fairly "fast" scope, meaning it lets in a lot of light for it's focal length.  The f-number is the focal length divided by the aperture size, and the lower the f-number, the faster the scope.  Faster is (generally) better.  F-numbers will be familiar to photographers, and telescopic "lenses" operate on the exact same concept as fast photographic lenses.  In photography, a lens is "fast" because it allows a shorter shutter speed (because it lets in more light), meaning you can capture faster motion that would be blurry with a longer exposure (as would be required by a "slower" lens).<br/><br/>The auto-orientation works like magic, but it's better to give it very precise time and location.  Use a GPS for location; don't just tell it what city you are in (you can choose your location input method).  For some reason, the controller can remember your last location and the time zone of your previous observation, but the controller does not keep time when it is switched off, so you must enter the (exact) time again whenever you switch the power off and back on (C'mon, Celestron - seriously?)<br/><br/>You can orient the scope by pointing the scope at ANY three bright objects (you do not need to know what they are) or two objects if you know what they are (but this is said to be less precise).  The scope must be level (it has a built-in level bubble).  Although this scope is not really classified as a "beginner's scope," it is great for beginners - you don't need to know anything to begin viewing amazing things, and a beginner will not "outgrow" this scope anytime soon.  The only comparable computerized Newtonian scope that I could find in this price range is the Orion StarBlast 6i IntelliScope, but it is available only with a table-top mount (???).  If that Orion scope (750mm focal length, 6-inch aperture) was available with a sturdy tripod mount in this price range then I would be writing this review for that scope, because I would have bought that scope instead, without a doubt. Orion lost my business because they expected me to have a study TABLE available at each observation site.<br/><br/>The optional Celestron accessory kit includes (among other things) 6mm, 8mm, 13mm, 17mm, and 32mm eyepieces and a Barlow 2X adapter.  With a 6mm eyepiece and a Barlow 2X adapter (which effectively doubles the magnification of the eyepiece, making it a 3mm focal length), the scope can achieve a magnification of 216 power (pretty respectable).  You could purchase shorter eyepieces or a 3X Barlow to push the magnification near the 307 power limit, but I don't think you will find yourself wanting to do so - you will be amazed at what you can clearly see (the bands of Jupiter and its Galilean moons, the rings of Saturn, etc).  Note that the 307-power limit cannot be exceeded with eyepieces or Barlow lenses - the image will be pretty much worthless if you try to exceed this limit, which is a function of how much light the scope can gather (which is determined by the aperture size).  As you approach this limit, the image quality decreases, so you will probably find images much more satisfying at low-to-mid-200 power than you would at theoretical maximum 300+ power.<br/><br/>The gray moon filter in the accessory kit is especially useful for bright objects (such as the moon, of course, but also Venus and Jupiter).<br/><br/>The longer eyepieces are needed for viewing large objects such as various asterisms, galaxies, and nebula.  Some of these objects span 2 or 3 degrees of sky (or more) - which is really big (the sun and moon are 0.5 degrees.)  Some objects can only be fully viewed at very low magnification (such as afforded by binoculars), so don't make the mistake of assuming that high magnification is always better.  If you attend a star party, expect to find binoculars (usually mounted on a tripod) in use.  The Pleiades star cluster, for example, is best observed at lower magnification.<br/><br/>The eyepieces that come with the scope (and the accessory kit) are 1.25" diameter, but the scope can also accept large, very nice (and expensive) 2" eyepieces - just remove the 1.25" adapter which comes with the scope.<br/><br/>The tripod mount is good, but will wiggle a bit in the breeze, especially at higher magnifications.  It helps to add some weight - the tripod has a small shelf which lends itself to this purpose.  A couple bags of rice or beans will do, but I bought a 20-lb theatrical-grade sandbag (double zippers keep sand out of my optics, and sand doesn't attract bugs or rodents).  Put that weight on your tripod and don't touch the scope while viewing (take your hand OFF of the focus knob) and you should have a steady view, even in breezy conditions.  Stiff winds may require additional measures, such as springs attached to the legs and anchored to stakes in the ground.<br/><br/>I was told by someone at a Star Party that this mount is not well suited for long-exposure deep-field photography.  As it tracks objects across the sky, the mount makes slow adjustments, but it does not adjust azimuth (side-to-side) and altitude (up-and-down) at the same time, but in succession, in a stair-step pattern.  The eye won't notice, but a long-exposure photo will see blurring.  Alas.  But I have not verified this info.  In any event, it should work fine for short-exposure shots, like the moon (you will need a camera adapter, of course).<br/><br/>The motorized mount goes through batteries pretty fast, especially if it is tracking something all the time.  The default power source of eight (standard alkaline) AA batteries will probably last a night, but I would not push it to two nights if I had been tracking the whole night before.  You can hook it up to a car battery and it will run forever.  I use a wheelchair gel battery - they are smaller and lighter than car batteries, and will take the deep-cycle use (charge and deplete, charge and deplete).  Buy a trickle charger and use it when the battery is not being used, to keep the battery fresh and extend its life.  Or you can get the Celestron Power Tank.  You can use an AC adapter if you have access to AC - any adapter that puts out 12 volts DC at 2.5 amps or more with a 2.5mm barrel plug (negative on outside, which is standard) will work just fine (you can have all the extra amps you want - it won't hurt anything).  There are scads of suitable adapters on Amazon that are a whole lot cheaper than the one Celestron sells.<br/><br/>This is a Newtonian scope, and Netownians are subject to collimation errors, meaning that the two mirrors are not precisely aligned.  I recommend the Celestron Collimation Eyepiece (Celestron Model 94182, available on Amazon).  This will allow you to quickly and easily (and accurately) calibrate your scope for an absolutely perfect image.  Some people do this each time they transport their scope, because any sort of vibration can cause the mirrors to drift (though it seems to be a rather minor problem for this scope, in my experience).  The instructions that come with the eyepiece are excellent.<br/><br/>Get a red flashlight.  Celestron makes one that has a dimmer.  Red won't mess up your night vision nearly as badly as other wavelengths.<br/><br/>I rate this scope at five stars, despite the BOOT LOADER problem (solution below).<br/><br/>========= BOOT LOADER PROBLEM ====================================================<br/><br/>Within two days of getting this scope, it failed to "boot" (the mount is computerized, and it needs to successfully "boot up," just like any computer.  If it cannot boot, it is useless).  When the hand controller was turned on, it said, "reading packages" and then stopped with an error message, "BOOT LOADER Invalid Pkg: 0080."  This renders the scope dead - it cannot be moved, even with manual arrow buttons.<br/><br/>Fixing the problem is a bit tricky.  You need to flash the firmware in your hand controller (which has somehow become corrupted), but it's not as simple (or as well-documented) as it should be.<br/><br/>First, you need to buy a serial cable to connect your computer to the controller.  It's 9-pin RS-232 (female) on one end and a modular connector on the other end (it looks like a telephone plug).  The Celestron model number for this cable is 93920, and you can buy it on Amazon.<br/><br/>If you have a reasonably modern computer then you probably don't have a serial port.  If you have a 9-pin MALE D-connector then you have a serial port (though it may be disabled in your system BIOS settings).  Otherwise you need to buy serial capability - I recommend a USB to Serial converter (also available on Amazon from many suppliers).<br/><br/>Connect the computer to the controller.  Make sure you are plugging the serial cable into the base of the handheld controller, and not into the body of the motorized mount.  Both the controller and the mount have modular serial connections (and both can be flashed), but you are flashing the handheld controller, not the mount.<br/><br/>You need to download and install the Celestron Firmware Manager (CFM) from Celestron's website (it's in Support/Downloads/Software, near the bottom of the list).  It's a Java application, so it should work on any computer platform.  But it will be downloaded as a zipfile - you must extract the contents and then run CFM.jar (on Windows, just double-click it). You can't run it within the zipfile - it must be extracted.  Make sure your scope is connected first.<br/><br/>THIS IS IMPORTANT:  There are two types of Celestron motorized controllers.  There's the Alt/Az (which is used by  this SLT mount, as well as LCM, SE 4/5/6/8, and CPC) and the Equatorial mount (used by CGE, Advanced, and CGE*). In the CFM menu (along the top of the CFM window), select "Hand Control" and make sure the proper type of control is selected for your model of scope (this CST scope is Alt/Az). THIS IS THE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT PART - Under the mount type selection you will see three radio buttons.  The first one is selected by default, and it tells CFM to automatically detect the mount type.  This is NOT GOOD.  CFM thought I had an Equatorial mount.  Even if I select Alt/Az, my selection will be overridden by the "Auto Detect" option.  Select the Second option, which says "Always do what I selected this time" and CFM will then respect your selection.<br/><br/>Now flash the controller in the CFM, and you should be good to go.<br/><br/>And if you go to a remote site or star party, it's a good idea to bring a laptop with CFM (and your cables), just in case you need to do this again.  I was 160 miles from home (beneath a rare Class-1 darksky!!!) when I had this problem. Fortunately it was only an hour before sunrise, so I didn't miss too much.</span>

Amazon.com   Amazon.com Review Celestron's Nexstar 8 SE telescope combines excellent optics and computerized "GoTo" tracking in a package that's light, portable and affordable. The legendary performance of Celestron's orange tube C8 telescope has been updated with high performance Starbright XLT coatings, and the single arm Nexstar mount now includes Celestron's easy to use "SkyAlign" technology.  The Nexstar 8 SE upholds Celestron's reputation for quality optics. When I use an 11mm Plossl eyepiece (almost 200x magnification) for example, I can easily see the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings. When I look at Jupiter, the pale orange color of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot is visible, and I've even been able to identify the polar caps and spot dust storms on the planet Mars. A 20mm Plossl eyepiece (about 100x magnification) is a good choice for viewing galaxies and star clusters. When I look at globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules the high contrast XLT optics show me a glowing snowflake made of hundreds of tiny pin-point stars! And a low power 32mm Plossl eyepiece is a good choice for views of larger deep space highlights like the Andromeda Galaxy and the Orion Nebula.  Celestron's patented "SkyAlign" system makes the Nexstar 8 SE very easy to use. I just pick the nearest town from the built-in list, enter the date and time, and point the telescope at three bright stars. I don't need a star chart because "SkyAlign" identifies the stars for me. When I just want a quick look at the moon or a planet, I like to use the "Solar System Align" option. After entering the date and time, I just point the telescope at the moon and press the "Align" key. That's all it takes, the computer takes over and the telescope begins tracking quietly and accurately. At star parties I often have my Nexstar up and running while older computerized telescopes are still waiting for their alignment stars to appear in the twilight.  The Nexstar 8 SE comes with a simple red-dot finder scope and a basic 25mm eyepiece. You'll want to add a few good eyepieces to take full advantage of the Nexstar 8 SE's excellent optics. At the very least get Celestron's bargain priced Accessory Kit which includes high and low power plossl eyepieces, or treat yourself to some top rated Tele Vue eyepieces. At twenty-four pounds total weight, the Nexstar 8 SE is unusually light and portable for an eight-inch telescope. The drawback of course is that some people will find it too light. Like other Schmidt Cassegrain (SCT) telescopes there are plenty of optional accessories to upgrade this telescope with, such as heavy duty tripods and an optical finder scope. If you want to try astro-photography, however, check out Celestron's CPC 800 Telescope which features a heavy duty mount and tripod and an 8x50 optical finder scope right out of the box. --Jeff PhillipsPros:Excellent optics Easy computerized GoTo tracking Light, portable and affordable Cons:Plastic accessories Short battery life Too light for astro-photography

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love this scope.  It deserves 5 stars, but I would knock one-half star off if I could for the following two reasons:<br/><br/>1.  No power supply. You have to buy 8 AA alkaline batteries to use it at all, and they don't last more than a few nights of viewing, depending on how much you move the scope around, and how long you have it powered up.  At this price, Celestron should include a power supply, whether it is a wall wart or something like a lithium power pack (good units that they do sell separately), even if doing so adds another $20-80 to the sale price.  The scope moves more slowly (but not terribly slow), and the hand control backlight is dimmer, when running on the internal batteries.  You'll likely be back on Amazon again soon after you take delivery, looking for something better than the internal battery setup.  My advice is to avoid buying a wall wart unless you have long extension cords or AC outlets very near your intended viewing spot. Instead, spend a few more dollars on a portable lithium battery supply from Celestron or a third party, and you'll have plenty of power and mobility, too.  The scope has an external power socket-- the common 5.5mm by 2.1mm bayonet, and it does not need exactly 12 volts DC.  It apparently tolerates 11-14.5 volts or maybe a bit more.  You can also buy a Celestron cigarette lighter plug, so it should be compatible with standard automotive battery power.  In my case,  I bought this compact lithium pack and I'm very happy with it:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YRZYLKV/<br/><br/>2.  The "Star Pointer" spotting device included with this telescope is OK-ish, but as time passes, you may want to consider an optical finder with some small level of magnification and possibly crosshairs.  I'm planning to do this in the near future after my credit card cools off.  I'm not a big fan of the Star Pointer.  Some people like it, others have said it's not aligning with the main scope for them.  I spent more time fumbling with mine than I did with the rest of the scope.  Some of the fumbles were my fault, though.  There are a few YouTube videos that show possible solutions if you can't get your Star Pointer and your telescope to agree with each other.  The idea is to add a small shim, like thin cardboard or even a US dime, under the back of the dovetail bracket.  Just loosen the two screws and slip the shim under the back, then re-tighten the screws that hold the finder dovetail in place.  It gives some extra tilt inward and downward towards the telescope body.  If you can't center the image and it feels like you need to move the red dot down and to the left of the end of travel, you might try this.<br/><br/>Celestron has made a very good, solid telescope with super optics.  I'm a big fan of the hand control and its built-in ability to help you find great stuff in the sky.  It's first-rate.  It's especially good for novice astronomers, in my opinion, and saves a lot of time that would otherwise be spent searching for things when you're new to the hobby.<br/><br/>If you don't mind some advice:  PLEASE, if this is your first telescope, don't buy a bunch of extra eyepieces, filters or Barlows just yet.  Enjoy the included 25mm eyepiece first.  It has plenty of magnification without being too much--and too much is what a lot of newbies (myself included) end up with.  If you buy eyepieces that give you greater magnification, you'll only be frustrated until you get to know your way around.  If anything, you'll get a lot of use out of an eyepiece that even widens your field of view more (lower magnification), like a 32-40mm eyepiece, or even a focal reducer.  I have the Celestron f6.3 focal reducer/corrector, and I couldn't be happier with it.<br/><br/>As a last thought, get one of Celestron's inexpensive, but surprisingly good 7 X 50 binoculars.  At 7 times magnification, they are great for viewing the constellations and helping you decide what part of the sky to point your telescope at next!  I'm happy I got both.  The telescope and the binoculars each add their own level of joy to the night's experience.<br/><br/>Even in a suburban environment with lights all around us, I'm still blown away by how many stars I can see with the binoculars compared to my unaided eyes.  And of course, the telescope just makes everything that much closer and brighter.</span>

<span>I have owned several scopes over the years:  a Meade ETX-90, an Orion 6" DOB, and a Zhumell 10" DOB (which I returned - read on).<br/><br/>When I recently renewed my passion for astronomy earlier this year (2010), I started pulling out my little ETX-90 on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, the aperture size and long focal length really limited my viewing to Saturn.  I decided it was time to go for something with a bit more power.  I bought the 10" DOB I mentioned above.  It wasn't passed than the third trip outside, precariously carrying the OTA (Optical Tube Assembly) while "butting" the door open and avoiding hitting my dining room table, that I decided I needed to return that monstrosity for something more portable (by the way, it was a wonderful scope!  If you can store it where moving it isn't a problem, it'll do the job!).<br/><br/>Enter the Celestron NexStar 6SE.<br/><br/>When the scope arrived, I opened the box and pulled out the parts.  Having watched the instructional video on how to assemble the item earlier in the day, I didn't even need to look at the directions to get it put together.  The tripod was solid and had little play.  The OTA was easy to "drop" onto the pins on the tripod, and then I only needed to lock down the three knobbed screws to mount the scope completely.  I did need to align the viewfinder, which was easy enough by lining up on Venus.<br/><br/>I had forgotten how much I liked the GOTO system (my old ETX-90's mount had long ago stopped functioning).  For the 6SE, I used the NexStar alignment method on my first attempt, which simply required 3 bright objects in the sky - I did not need to know what the objects were (you will, however, have to enter some other info like your latitude and longitude, time zone, date and time.  Your latitude and longitude is easily found online).  It was now time for the first viewing.  I selected my old standby, Saturn.  The scope slewed very quickly to the object, even going back and forth a bit to account for any play in the gears.  When I looked through the low powered eye piece (25mm), Saturn was just left of center (likely my fault on the initial alignment).  I then manually centered the planet and replaced my eye piece with a higher powered piece - a 9mm lens.  All I can say is wow.  I live a few miles from the Pittsburgh International Airport, so light pollution is a real problem for me.  But, Saturn came in as crisp as I have ever seen it, and 4 of her moons were very easily discernible.<br/><br/>However, planetary viewing isn't so difficult with even the most basic scope.  I decided to try a few more difficult targets.  I could see that The Big Dipper was out, so I typed in M51 - The Whirlpool Galaxy.  After a few quick moments of slewing, I took to the eyepiece again (back to the 25mm, btw), and there were two "eyes" looking at me (M51 is actually two galaxies).  Of course with bad seeing conditions and a 6" scope, I could not make out any of the "arms" of the galaxy, but I could easily see the telltale fuzzy eyes.  I was quite surprised I was able to resolve them that easily with the smaller aperture on this scope!  I don't remember my old 6" DOB having that easy of a time, but maybe that was due to the GOTO capability of this item.<br/><br/>Next, I turned my attention to M81 and M82, two other galaxies very close to The Dipper.  They came in great, with M82 showing off its profile nicely even with my (relatively) bad seeing conditions.<br/><br/>Finally, I hit M3, which is a brilliant globular star cluster.  The cluster was a wonderful view in this scope.  Switching to a higher power eye piece caused many stars to shimmer in and out of view - it was jaw dropping.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wanted to point out that, if you need a portable scope that is capable of showing you some wonderful astronomical sights, this scope fits the bill.  Although another reviewer is right in that the stock eye pieces aren't incredible (nor are any other stock pieces!), you would certainly be happy with this scope for the occasional "quick" viewing session.  Heck, put a few additional dollars (well, a few hundred!) down for some better eye pieces, and you'll be thrilled for years to come!<br/><br/>One final note: due to the design of the Schmidt Cassegrain scope, you are almost required to buy a dew shield, unless you live in Phoenix or some other really dry area.  Here in the northeast, my scope fogged up very quickly.  I was able to build a temporary dew shield with some black construction paper that worked fine, but that's no long term solution.  Astronomy is certainly not a cheap hobby!<br/><br/>Overall, I am very pleased with this scope.  And, unless you are more than casually into this hobby, I think you will be, too.</span>

<span>There are over four hundred reviews here for this telescope, so I won't cover all of the technical details already discussed; instead, I'll hit on some of the things I still had questions about before buying the Nexstar 8SE.<br/><br/>One of the hard things about choosing a telescope is knowing how you want to use it. Whether you want to look at planets (which are super bright) or deep space objects (which are super dim) affects your choice. A scope with tons of magnification from a long focal length may be great for Saturn but have too much zoom for things like the Andromeda Galaxy.<br/><br/>Portability is also a factor. Can you carry the entire assembled scope out on to the deck yourself each night, or do you  need to spend an hour lugging it out piecemeal, assembling, leveling, and aligning it? Once it's set up, how easy is it to find objects? If you want to look at Jupiter and the Moon - piece of cake...but what about objects too faint to see with your naked eye? Do you have the time and skill to read star charts under a red light, hunting-and-pecking across the night sky searching for dim fuzzies?<br/><br/>Lastly, do you want to take photos of your view? If you want exposures of more than a few seconds, does your mount have a way to compensate for the Earth's rotation to prevent your stars from blurring to streaks? If you're taking pictures of big things, like a nebula, will you have to make a mosaic because your scope has too much magnification to fit it all in frame?<br/><br/>I thought about all of these, and chose the Nexstar 8SE. It is a great scope and fairly easy to use (although not as easy as Celestron's "no knowledge of the night sky needed" slogan suggests). Here's how it fares for my selection criteria:<br/><br/>Portability:<br/>If hours of free time are needed between setup and gazing, the scope will be relegated to weekend use only. That may not seem bad, but consider that out of those weekends, it'll further be whittled down to ones with clear nights. So, if I don't want a scope I can use only once or twice a month, I need something portable. The 8SE weighs 33 lbs fully assembled (and can easily be separated into three lighter components). So, imagine picking up a 16 lb bowling bowl in each hand and walking out onto the deck. If you think you could do that, you can carry the 8SE out. I leave mine fully assembled and just carry it out myself whenever there are clear skies. It takes two minutes. If it's too heavy, there are three thumb-tightened knobs that quickly separate the tripod from the mount and tube, splitting the weight in half.<br/><br/>Type of Astronomy:<br/>The 8SE has a 2000 mm focal length and 8" aperture. 2000 mm is two meters (6.5 feet!) so you'd expect the tube to be at least 6.5 feet long unless it can bend space and time. Turns out, it does - well, not literally - but it's a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope so it uses both reflectors and refractors to double-up the light path, resulting in a very short, fat tube that is highly portable. It's a great "best of both worlds" solution. High focal length (which translates to magnification) for planetary and lunar views and wide aperture (which translates to brightness and detail) for views of dim objects like galaxies. For me, it's perfect. I can bounce around the night sky seeing all of the planets and everything in the Messier catalog (globular clusters, nebula, and galaxies). The 8SE comes with a diagonal and a single 1.25" 25mm Plossl eyepiece that is one of my favorite eyepieces for this scope. With it, you will clearly see a small Saturn with its rings and shadows, or the disc of Jupiter with small cloud bands and its four largest moons. Deep-sky objects will be faint, dim cotton balls. Of course, you can increase the magnification by buying additional eyepieces or increase the contrast of DSOs with filters. I have a small refractor scope that uses 1.25" eyepieces and filters, and all of them are interchangeable with the 8SE.<br/><br/>Astrophotography:<br/>I think it surprised me that most of those awesome astrophotography pics we've seen that look like Hubble telescope photos are taken with cameras or sensors attached to small refractor scopes. They're all taken on equatorial mounts that are polar aligned, rotating like clockwork to compensate for the Earth's rotation. The default 8SE cannot do this. It has an alt-az mount, not an EQ. Although it will track an object and keep it centered, it's just not able to rotate in the direction that the sky does. As a result, the object will spin in place over time, and all the neighboring stars will orbit it, leaving streaks. You can purchase an EQ wedge that tilts the entire mount onto a polar axis but to be honest for the price and added weight of the 15 lb wedge you could just get a Sky Watcher mount and tripod and plop a DSLR with a decent lens on it, taking some nice wide-field long-exposure photos. That being said, short-exposure photography works great on the 8SE. A cheap t-adapter lets me attach my DSLR directly to the back of the scope. I can manage fifteen-second exposures without star trails. I took the attached photo of the Hercules Cluster this way (by the way - for reference - the Hercules cluster does not look like this to your eye in the scope. In the scope, it is a milky cotton ball). So, can you throw a couple of thousand dollars to convert the 8SE into a long-exposure astrophotography scope? Sure - but I would suggest instead using that money to buy a separate, dedicated mount and tripod for DSLR photography.<br/><br/>Ease of Finding Objects:<br/>First, you can just use the keypad arrows to slew the scope wherever you want without bothering to align it. Line up a star or planet in the red dot finder and just have a look; however, if you want the telescope to find and track it, you'll have to align it. There are four ways to do this: 1) 3-object auto-align: center the scope on any three bright stars or planets and the controller will plate-solve to figure out what they are. You don't even need to know or tell it their names; however, every time I tried this, it failed. 2) 2-star auto-align: center the scope on one star and tell the controller what it is, then it picks the second star and you center it. Works sometimes, but the scope has no way of knowing if its chosen star is obstructed (by trees, neighbor's houses). 3) 2-star manual align: You pick two stars, tell the controller their names, and center them. Always works for me. 4) 1-star manual align: Same as two-star, but less accurate. 5) I know I said there were only four options, but a fifth option is to buy the somewhat-expensive Star Sense accessory, which is a camera that will do all of this for you.<br/><br/>I find that the two-star align is accurate for the part of the sky you chose when picking alignment stars, but quickly loses accuracy when you swing to distant parts of the sky. Fortunately, you can pick new alignment stars on-the-fly, so I typically align to the southern sky, see everything I want, then realign to the northern sky. When the alignment is accurate, it's really great for finding deep space objects. I can look at a dozen DSOs in thirty minutes, where I could look at only two or three if doing it manually. The single review-star I deducted is due to the somewhat endless frustration I have with the GoTo alignment process, and that in general I haven't been able to just align the scope to the sky, but have to realign to portions of the sky as I look in different areas. One other complaint is that the 8SE's controller has been upgraded over time (to have a mini-USB connection instead of RS-232), but the telescope's manual was not updated. The manual still has photos and instructions only for the old controller, including keypad buttons which are in different locations or have different names.<br/><br/>So, I think the 8SE hits the Venn-diagram sweet-spot intersection of portability, aperture, and focal length for me, and I'm happy with my purchase and recommend it to others searching for that same intersection.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>After six months of use, I'm very happy with this purchase. I've bought many accessories, including the Starsense camera (which you'll appreciate on January nights when the telescope sets itself up while you're inside drinking tea), a 2" Luminos eyepiece and diagonal, and a f/6.3 focal reducer. Out of those, the focal reducer was the cheapest but had the most impact. Believe it or not, it's possible to have too much magnification and being able to halve the scope's focal length with the twist of a lens is great. I've added a photo of the Orion Nebula and Hagrid's Dragon I took with the focal reducer. I highly recommend it as a first accessory.</span>

<span>Hello everyone!  I purchased a Celestron 8SE package through Amazon shortly before the Christmas holiday for me and my family (ok, mostly for me!).  I wanted to write this review because I probably made a mistake buying that package, which, of course, is only an opinion which benefits from hindsight.  I normally pride myself on doing adequate research before buying a product, but I guess I didn't realize how much I wanted to try astrophotography until shortly after I received the scope in the mail.  I was really drawn to the 'goto' capability, because I wanted my family to have an easy time getting the most out of the scope.  I did read some reviews and many people posted cool pictures of the moon, solar system objects, and even some deep space objects -- those seemed to be enough to convince me.<br/><br/>So, there are good parts of the package. The scope seems well built.  In my uninformed opinion, the optics are clear and the scope came perfectly collimated. The mount, while it has deficiencies, is actually pretty easy to use. It's also very easy to assemble and disassemble, very light, and again, in my opinion, is pretty sturdy.  It's very easy to do a three-star alignment.  My first attempt was spot on and a solution was found.  All of the various pieces that came with the package seemed well built, except for the spotting scope (more later) and perhaps the diagonal -- it's very cheap plastic and doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of the mirror.<br/><br/>The bad parts?  Well, they might not be bad for certain people, so I'll leave the judgement up to you whether these issues are a 'negative'.  First, the cheapo spotting scope never worked.  I did email celestron on the day after christmas and I had a new spotting scope -- the upgraded version -- before new years.  So kudos to Celestron for their quick work to fix the problem.  The package came with one single eyepiece, a 23mm plossl I think, and it's the least clear eyepiece I now own.  Now, on to the mount.  I read that the mount "isn't great" for astrophotography, and honestly, at that point, I didn't think I'd get 'the bug' for it.  After a couple weeks, I bought a T-adapter for my wife's Nikon D5100 and started to take some really cool pictures of the moon, venus, and even some quick exposures of deep sky objects.  Once I really learned about astrophotography -- at least, as much as you can in a few months -- I realized this mount is just simply inadequate.  Apparently there must be bicycle gears inside because it's not smooth, at all.  The higher the objective is from the horizon, the worse the mount performs.  When Sculptor was about 30 deg off the horizon, I was able to get 8-10s exposures.  That same night, andromeda was about 70-75 deg when I started, and I couldn't get more than 4s; not acceptable.  That was really the moment I decided to buy a new mount, and also the same time I somewhat regretted my purchase.<br/><br/>In terms of performance for visual astronomy, it seems to be ok enough.  I've tracked venus for a while and it generally stays close.  It does drift considerably over time, which is a natural effect of an motorized system trying to track anything without corrections, so this is expected. It's easy enough to set the slew speed slow and center the objective and it tracks just fine for a while.  Again, there is a direct relationship between tracking performance degradation and the elevation of the object in the sky.  I suspect there is a large amount of play in the gear system which causes backlash that is exacerbated when one axis of the mount approaches perpendicular from the earth.<br/><br/>The other part I wish Celestron would've improved is the focus knob.  I mean, that thing just sucks.  It has only one focus mechanism (no fine focus) and is pretty hard to accurately focus, but overally pretty easy to roughly focus.  For casual visual observation, it's not a big deal.  For astro, it's a pain in the royal butt to get focused right.  I just got the Bahtinov mask in a couple days ago, so I'm hoping that'll make things a little easier.  I'm not a fan of spending ANOTHER $350 on a fine focuser, so I'm going to create my own remote focus apparatus with a low RPM gearbox motor, belt, some type of attachment to fit over the focus knob, and a metal bracket.  I've seen some designs online and I think I can get that going pretty quick.  Eventually, I'm going to integrate the focus control to an image processing service to auto-focus the scope.  Just keep in mind this can be frustrating.<br/><br/>What I didn't realize when I purchased the scope was how much I enjoyed doing astrophotography.  I'm obviously a total newbie, but that type of hobby is right in line with my interests.  I'm a very technical person, current engineer on a very cool project integrating instrumentation hardware/software interfaces, so the nexus of electrical engineer and software is my real passion.  So, hooking up the scope, mount, camera to the mount, creating an effective workflow to automate the process is super interesting to me -- and it's really just lackluster with the mount.  I also didn't even think AT ALL about buying an APO refractor.  In fact, with the amount of money I've spent so far, I could've easily bought a decent APO and a good EQ mount, and probably a guidescope and camera.  But, such is life.  Live and learn.<br/><br/>I'll probably try to recoup a few hundred dollars by selling the Celestron goto mount, if possible.  It's probably great for a casual hobbyist, but I tend to take things to the exteme.<br/><br/>Anyways, I hope this review helps people understand the quality, performance, and limitations of the 8SE GoTo package.  I would give the setup a 4/5 stars -- because, it does exactly what you'd expect in terms of performance and quality.</span>

<span>I don't know why people are expecting the results of the Hubble Telescope in the reviews. It does exactly what it's designed to do. It takes the moon and makes it look like a large marble that's placed a few inches from your eye that's in pretty good focus. You can see some craters on the Moon, but you can't see Niel Armstrong's footprints.  You can see the rings of Saturn, but you can't count them like a tree that's been cut in half. I'm not sure why some individuals have ridiculous expectations for something that's less than $100...<br/><br/>There are better scopes out there, sure, but it's a great beginner scope for kids and amateurs. I got this for my 7 year old who has shown interest in the Cosmos. If he really gets into it, I'll invest more later and pass this to his younger siblings. For right now, it's perfect.<br/><br/>The frame is light, but the scope is light and doesn't need a heavy duty frame. It holds the scope, which is what it's designed to do.<br/><br/>All the pieces were accounted for, and it came with a backpack so it can be taken on trips so you don't need to buy a separate case to hold it when you're traveling in the car or walking somewhere.<br/><br/>It does what it was designed to do. Great for kids and amateurs at a modest price to see nature, take it to a long distance shooting range, see space a bit better, and anything else that is legal to do. If you want to see a nebula, and have a few thousand dollars to spare, go for it and buy that kind of scope.<br/><br/>For the normal people with real expectations, this is a great telescope for beginners and kids. Well worth the investment if you're unsure if you want to invest a large amount of money to see footprints on the Moon.<br/><br/>Take care!</span>

<span>Will you be discovering new planets or counting rings on Saturn with this telescope?  No. But will it elicit squeals of joy and increase your kids’ curiosity? Absolutely. I didn’t set up the aiming scope portion because it was too flimsy, as is the tripod. And don’t expect the screw-in clamps to be able to hold a cell-phone mount steady. Use some “Grown Up Ingenuity” to make it work and it will bring lots of joy to backyard evenings.<br/><br/>I swapped out the tripod for an old camera tripod that is a bit more steady. The telescope provides some great images of the moon. I’ll attach  one to this review.<br/><br/>I’d say it was a bit over priced for the amount of plastic, but for a couple of homeschooled kids, it has been perfect.</span>

<span>TL;DR Review: Great portable scope.  Get a separate tripod - tripod wobbles.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended for anyone who would like to take a scope with them on a trip, for someone who doesn't have the space for a permanently mounted scope, for a student whose interested in astronomy, or as a fun add-on to keep in the trunk on trips to anywhere.  It’s small, lightweight, and priced right.  It’s light enough that a five-year old could carry it for an entire trip without effort, giving them direct participation in the setup process.<br/><br/>This is an amazing little telescope which you can easily take anywhere you're going.  Looking at the moon, you'll be able to see the moon in fantastic detail, clearly seeing the ridges of the craters peaking above the moon's northern pole.  Aimed at any patch of the sky, stars will become visible when before you saw nothing but darkness.<br/><br/>As with all telescopes with this magnification, you will not see the individual rings of Saturn, but you will be able to make out the halo of the rings.  Jupiter's moons, though, will be easy to spot, but speaking of spots, you won't see Jupiter's red-spot.  Mars and Venus are indistinctive.<br/><br/>As for galaxies, if you know where to look, Andromeda can be seen.  As for using this scope for daytime viewing of birds and bees, it's perfect.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to pair this scope with a Gosky Cell Phone Adapter Mount (you can order one here on Amazon - see my review for photos and videos take with it) and use your phone's camera to capture some amazing shots.  Note positioning the Gosky is tricky, so prepared to be frustrated as you try to get the phone's camera and the telescope aligned.  It’s not a defect and it's not something you're doing wrong - it's just worth it, but difficult.  And if you want to get photos of objects you can't even see through the telescope with your phone, Google "android [or iphone] astronomy photo stacking", "NightCap Pro," or "iastrophotography".<br/><br/>What makes this scope a winner it how easy it is to carry around.  The included backpack has enough extra space that you can easily toss a laptop or Chromebook in it - I have.<br/><br/>It also comes with two high-quality eyepieces (20mm and 10mm) which allow you toquickly switch them up as needed.<br/><br/>Each lens also comes with a cap (a needed feature), though I wouldn't fret too much if I lost one. The side finderscope is well aligned and will make targeting much simpler.<br/><br/>But the tripod!  The tripod!  It's OK, but because it's tiny and lightweight, it's not stiff and suffers from touch-wobble.  You'll repeatedly find yourself aiming for an object and then when you let go of the telescope or tripod, sometimes it will move out of alignment.  You just need to be cognizant of this and use a light touch once you've locked it down to where you want to aim.<br/><br/>Since I’ve gotten it, my son and I have used it in City locations and in the country – obviously it works great in both locations.<br/><br/>So if the tripod is poor - why did you give it 5 stars instead of 4?  For the size, price, and weight of the tripod, it’s what you would expect.  A sturdier tripod will weigh a whole lot more and will be bigger, killing the portability aspects of what without the tripod would automatically make this a 5-star telescope.  So it’s neither the tripod’s fault nor the Celestron’s.  A better-built tripod would weigh more and cost a lot more.<br/><br/>As a person who doesn’t read manuals, do read the instruction manual.  Some parts aren’t obvious. I managed to figure out how to put it together but would have had a much easier time if I had taken two minutes to flip through the instruction manual.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>To provide context, I live in Houston city limits and purchased this for my mom last Christmas.<br/><br/>It's quite heavy, so I carry it out each time. She wouldn't be able to lift it in one piece. We keep it in a corner of the house so as to not break it down and set it up each time. We, for the most part, use it to take a peak at Venus and the moon. You can get some fantastic views of the moon as it goes through its phases.<br/><br/>A few weeks back we woke up at around 4 am to see Jupiter and her four moons with it. That was cool!<br/><br/>In the city, the telescope, with its stock eyepiece, is mainly useful for viewing the moon in good detail. You can also peer into the sky to view stars you hadn't noticed with the naked eye. You'll be able to observe shimmering stars both faint and bright. The wane and wax of bright Venus can also be observed over time, similar to the way the moon comes and goes, but at first it'll look like a very bright star until you pay attention to its change over time.<br/><br/>There isn't much detail in the observation of Venus, but the shadows and craters of our moon are fascinating. There will be plenty of oohs and ahhs from family and friends as they peer through the eyepiece.<br/><br/>You'll need to align the telescope each time you use it. If you don't know any stars in the sky, that's fine; you can use the moon as an alignment point.<br/><br/>You'll power on the scope and hit Enter. You can scroll through alignment options. I prefer to use Solar System Align in the options. You put in your time, date and location. You then choose what in the solar system you want to align to. If you recognize Venus, align the scope to Venus with the remote. If you recognize the moon, align to the center of the moon. Follow the prompts on the remote to align. Once you're aligned, the scope will know to follow the object in the sky without you having to do so manually -- objects in the sky aren't static!<br/><br/>Before you do all that, make sure you align the red dot pointer on top with what you see in the eyepiece. The calibrated red dot will be your friend as it provides a wider view. You can do this in the daytime with a point somewhere down the road or even in the sky at night. Turn it off when not in use, as it runs on a separate battery. You only have to align the red dot pointer once. Adjust in the future as needed.<br/><br/>There is a software package that comes with the scope. It's really just to help you learn about the sky. It's a nice tool to have when you look up and ask, "I wonder what that star is!?" You can open up the Starry Night software and pinpoint it. You'll learn its etymology and plenty of fun facts. You'll become a more educated observer. And they have good customer service if you run into issues obtaining the software. It's worth the download.<br/><br/>You'll need to purchase one more item: a powerbank. It's not an endorsement, but I purchased TalentCell's Rechargeable 12V Lithium ion battery. It's Chinese-made. I charged it once and have used it for months. There are other brands.<br/><br/>If you want to take images with your DSLR, you can do that. You'll need to hook that up to the camera jack that's available on the telescope. There's a camera icon on the side. You won't miss it.  I haven't hooked up a camera, but it's on my to-do list. I don't have the appropriate cord.<br/><br/>The images I am uploading were shot through the eyepiece on an iPhone. Some are hard to capture as slight movement takes it out of focus. You will be better served viewing through the eyepiece yourself.<br/><br/>Lastly, once you become familiar with this telescope and all its offerings, you'll want to upgrade the eyepiece to increase magnification. You'll be able to see our solar system's planets in greater detail and color. Spend some time exploring the scope's functions and the night sky then do some research on the appropriate eyepiece upgrade.<br/><br/>Images: This is approximately  what you'll see through the eyepiece.<br/><br/>Image 1-- first night using the scope to view the moon (no editing)<br/>Image 2 -- first week using the scope to vie the moon (no editing)<br/>Image 3 -- first full moon (no editing)<br/>Image 4 -- first image of Venus and surrounding stars (no editing)<br/>Image 5 --  Venus and surrounding stars (slight color adjustment)<br/><br/>It's worth the buy. If it had come with another quality eyepiece and power bank at this price point, I'd have given it five stars.</span>

<span> LIKED:<br/>1) Easy to assemble and get going.<br/>2) Not too heavy.<br/>3) Good for beginners<br/>4) Free software to learn about skies, and control the scope remotely from your computer.<br/>5) Scope is interchangeable with my Tracking mount (payload up to 11lbs). Likewise, I can use my current refractor on this GoTo mount base.<br/><br/>DISLIKED:<br/>1) The package arrived quite roughed up on the outside. It was cosmetic, though not a pleasant sight (See pics).<br/>2) The built-in wedge is not exactly suited for precise polar alignment. The claims don't exactly match up. This is a big deal for me. This wedge is just a plate with a latitude adjustment bar. What is LACKING is the AZIMUTH ADJUSTMENT SCREWS in the front to adjust it laterally. ODDLY, the stand-alone wedge sold by them (for higher-end scopes) does have them.<br/><br/>When you ask the TECHNICAL SUPPORT, they guide you to some DATED MANUAL and a KNOWLEDGEBASE that speaks about the OTHER WEDGE. It doesn't look to be in 8SE models too, something they promise long exposure astrophotography with. For someone using equatorial mounts, this 'promise' of a wedge, to correct for the field rotation, is kind of a DISAPPOINTMENT.<br/><br/>3) The seller is DIFFERENT from Celestron. As a result, price-match may not be there. The very next day after I received the package (outer damage) there was a $60 reduction in price. Tried contacting the seller but the request was not met. Bummer!<br/><br/>---------<br/>UPDATE:<br/>Got some clear skies and some clear views of Saturn (image enclosed).</span>

<span>Great telescope for a full year now. I brought the 5'' because it fits my budget and is much more portable than the 6" &amp; 8".<br/><br/> The telescope arrived in two boxes and was packaged well. It was quite easy to assemble and was straightforward.  But the first night when I tested it the red dot finder failed and would not turn on. I contacted product support and they refunded the price of the red dot finder to let me buy another. I think this is reasonable.<br/><br/>The telescope was of good quality and was fairly portable in two pieces. I also brought it with the Nex-yz adapter and eyepiece kit. In my opinion, I would not buy the phone adapter and eyepiece kit because I don't use the adapter and eyepiece often. You will pretty much only use the moon filter, 13, 17, and 32mm eyepieces. I also brought a generic LPR filter which helps somewhat in revealing dim objects and filtering out the light pollution<br/>.<br/>The goto function was really helpful in finding objects especially DSO's. I will use the auto 2 star alignment procedure and manual location settings.<br/><br/>This scope was fine for starting astrophotography but exposures can only be limited to 30 seconds maximum. Even though there was a polar alignment option, it was really hard to do since I am living quite close to the equator in Hong Kong and the mount twists into a really weird position when tracking.<br/><br/>In the first few months I viewed only from the city, which was a bortle 9 scale. The planets are easy to see, you can see the belts of Jupiter and its moons, and the rings of Saturn easily. If you want a telescope for ONLY the planets, I would recommend some of the scopes without go to like a dobsonian or maktusov because you will be able to see more detail with increased aperture. You don't need go-to because planets are really bright and sometimes the mount will go off track. The Orion Nebula can be seen though only the bright parts. The andromeda galaxy can NOT be seen at all in light polluted places.<br/><br/>Later I was able to go out to a better spot ( bortle 5 ) and it was excellent, and I was able to see the double cluster, Orion Nebula and andromeda galaxy a lot better.<br/><br/> I would recommend this scope to beginners and people starting astronomy. You can get good results in the middle of the city, but driving to a deep sky site really makes the view impressive. I will not recommend this for astrophotography but instead will recommend scopes with German equatorial mounts.<br/><br/>* images are taken with A6000 camera with remote control.</span>

<span>You have to realize this is an inexpensive telescope and therefore won't be as good as more expensive models. Still, at less than $200, it's a great deal.<br/><br/>First of all, I made the mistake of ordering an "in the box" telescope (advertised as "Used - Like New") for a nice discount. Shouldn't have done that! It was obviously a return. It came with missing and damaged parts that had just been thrown in the box with no padding by whoever returned it. As usual, though, Amazon accepted the return with no problem. So I then ordered a new telescope at the regular price  and everything arrived well-packed and with all parts present.<br/><br/>I like the scope and consider it to be a great value for the money, but there are some definite cons. So let's get those out of the way first:<br/><br/>1. Throw the finder scope away and get one of those red-dot finders. The finder scope that came with the scope is very poor quality and extremely difficult to align, particularly since it seems to want to slip around under the screws that hold it in place.<br/>2. The eyepieces are okay if you're a beginner or casual observer, but they seem to be cheaply made. I already had some eyepieces from a previously-owned telescope and they were much better than the ones that came with this scope. I later ordered a Celestron 8-24 mm zoom eyepiece and like it very much.<br/>3. The thumb-screws that hold the mount rigid so you can use the slow-motion cables don't seem to work very well. They loosen easily - no matter how much I tighten them - causing the telescope to suddenly move and taking whatever you're observing out of the field of view. I have to constantly tighten them and I wonder how long that's going to work before something strips or breaks.<br/><br/>Now for the pros:<br/>1. As I've said, a lot of scope for the money - five-inch aperture, 1000mm focal length, f/8, with equatorial mount, tripod, two eyepieces and 3x Barlow. Not bad for less than $200.<br/>2. With the exception of the finder scope and eyepieces, everything seems to be  of decent quality.<br/>3. I've read lots of reviews that mention how hard it is to collimate this telescope, so I ordered a Celestron collimating eyepiece in advance, thinking I would have to collimate it when it arrived. But I haven't had to use it yet. My scope came perfectly collimated right out of the box and I haven't had to correct the collimation yet!<br/>4.I have been pleased with the light-gathering power of the scope. For the most part I've been observing the moon so far, and the image is nice and crisp and bright, especially with the lower powered eyepieces. See the pic with this review.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Once again, lots of scope for the price. But I would say you're going to want to get a better finder scope and better eyepieces - I recommend the 8-24mm zoom eyepiece (try it, you'll like it!). I also bought the motor drive as an add-on (less than $50 and makes observing and  taking photos much easier and more enjoyable). You should also get a moon filter for better observing (and photographing) the moon.<br/><br/>Four out of five stars for me! Would have been five except for the cons listed above.<br/><br/>One final thought. I think this is considered a beginner's telescope for both adults and kids. Maybe so, but putting this together and getting familiar with the equatorial mount and how to align everything and just getting used to the telescope in general - including the possibility of needing to collimate periodically -  is maybe a stretch for many kids or casual observers, at least without a little help. Before you buy this for a kid or a casual observer, understand that there's a lot more involved with this scope than, say, one of those cheap refractors that you just move up and down and back and forth on a simple mount and point and observe.</span>

<span>I have no comparison for this other than the more simplistic Refractor Telescope my father got me as a kid...so now the circle continues, as I got this for my own son.  This is the type I always dreamed of getting as a kid, but back then these were in the $500 range and easily too much for my parents growing up.  The price point on this for what it offers is awesome, and I selected this after about 6-8 hours of reviewing specs, feedback, and much contemplation.  It was this or the 114mm longer tube version, and I opted for this in the end (I figured this had a little more power and it looked more portable than the longer tube of the 114, since we have to go somewhere to view the sky due to the forested yard we have).  We have taken it out twice now, &amp; I was NOT disappointed, HOWEVER, a few pointers will definitely help if you're thinking of getting this, to give you the best success chance possible:<br/><br/>1) What i read about was VERY true--buy a telecope for the tube itself, NOT the eyepieces it comes with.  After MUCH searching I decided upon a zoomable eyepiece to buy along with this:<br/>http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93230-24mm-1-25-Eyepiece/dp/B0007UQNV8<br/>I figured this would be a nice way to avoid having to replace eyepieces (it comes with a 20mm and 4mm, and comparing those to this zoomable one is night 7 day difference...the quality and the versatility of the zoomable blows the stock ones out of the water).  Its especially nice to start in the 24mm (24x) place, align everything, find your target &amp; focus, then zoom in on it (even with the barlow for additional zooming power), refocus slightly and then enjoy the sight!  We successfully located and watched both mars &amp; saturn on our first 2 attempts (using only the free google skymap app for Android to help us locate the planets).  What they say about the rings of saturn are so true...you will never forget the first time you see them.  It IS a bit small, but you can make them out if everything is in focus and you dont touch the the telescope once everything is in view (until the planet moves out of the field of view, in which case the fine-tune movements of the telescope really shines!).  All in all, buy this telescope NOT for the eyepieces, but for the tube itself, which is one of the bets values from everything I have seen.  If you pair it with any non-stock eyepiece you will not be disappointed!  If you choose not to go with this zoomable one I mention here (that the only additional thing I got for this when I first bought it), even though the price is very reasonable currently @ $51, I'd recommend the 9mm one from Celestron (currently about $20).  The stock 20mm eyepiece is "ok" but the stock 4mm I found utterly useless.  At least the 9mm aftermarket eyepiece gives you about a 2X zoom vs. the stock 20mm.  And then you have to decide if the stock 3X barlow (see next) is worth using at all either.<br/><br/>2) BARLOW.  Had no idea what this was before I bought this or started researching info about telescopes.  Basically its a zooming piece for your normal eyepieces.  The stock version that comes with this is "ok" but I dont have anything (yet) to compare it against.  Lets just say it "works" to some extent, but all the reviews I read about said this one sucked...to go after an aftermarket 2x or 3x.  From all the reviews and research I've gathered, and now using the stock version, I'd say I'd have to agree in all likelihood.  Due to this, and since my son seems to have really enjoyed our first 2 outings, I decided to take the next step &amp; get a combo 2x barlow that also serves as a T-adapter to allow for photography!  At only $45, that seems like a really good deal, especially since the 3X barlow I found from Celestron was around $80.  The 2x combo can be found here:<br/>http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-Adapter-Barlow-Universal-T-Ring/dp/B00009X3UV<br/>I can't say for sure how this will be, but I can tell you it certainly cant be worse than the stock 3x, which seemed very cheaply made (again you buy the telescope for the mirror &amp; tube).  Paired with the zoomable aftermarket 8-24mm eyepiece mentioned above and I think itll be a slam dunk.  Plus it allows for adapting for use with a digital camera (well possibly non-digital as well, but we have a sony DSLR that should work with the T-adapter for the model we have, which was only about $10...for $55 I get an aftermarket 2x barlow that adapts to allow a DSLR...pretty decent!).<br/><br/>3) Other accessories: I have not chosen to get any more than I have listed here, but there was 1 have to mention that I may have to invest in at a later time.  One of the concerns about the Newtonian scopes (this is one) was the possibility of having to correct/adjust the mirrors.  I chose not to buy the collimator (adjusting tool) out of the box, but was prepared to buy either the cheaper $20 one or possibly the more expensive but from all I can see, more worth it, laser-optics one for about $70.  Thankfully it seems my scope did not need it out of the box, but I suspect the lower star reviews that say it didnt work out of the box either had the rare scope that needed it from the get-go, or else the more likely scenario, is that the patience needed to align the finder mini-scope on top of the tube, with the eyepiece view (using the 20mm or in my case, the much better zoomable 8-24x eyepiece, which allows for a much wider field of view than even the 20mm stock) was probably the major factor in most of the low reviews.  Having done my research I knew it would require patience when using (see more on that below) and it paid off hugely when you have a 6 yr old and an 8yr old wildly ecstatic with waiting a half-hour to get Saturn's rings into view...see below for details).<br/><br/>3) With the accessories out of the way, lets talk about SETUP &amp; USE.  First, for setup, I was very meticulous about it and very careful, but from opening the box to final setup &amp; cleanup, I was done in an hour.  NO TOOLS were required.  Just a touch of patience and carefulness.  Seemed very reasonable to me.<br/><br/>4) USE: as I mentioned we have taken this out on 2 outings already (have had it less than a week) and both times were widly successful.  I have to say that its really useful to have google's free skymap with you when you use this, or even another product I got from Amazon, called Stellarium.  Both are good apps and do things a little differently. Together they made finding the planets a breeze and helped us find, focus, and enjoy the views VERY quickly.  Both mars &amp; Saturn were easily found using the apps, mars being the easier one to figure out even without the app, due to its orange-tinge color.<br/><br/>First, we aligned the mini-scope on top (finder scope) using a distant cell tower as a target (rem the images are UPSIDE DOWN, which when viewing stellar objects is not a big deal).  Once we had this aligned (took about 5-10 mins) we located mars, and due to the patience of doing the finder scope, we saw mars in the unzoomed 24x eyepiece ON THE FIRST TRY.  So do not skip this step if you can!<br/><br/>Now, when we first viewed mars it was a huge fuzzy, hazy blob, with the crosshairs intersected it (in the eyepiece, not the finder scope). I knew we had to focus.  So in less than 30 seconds we had it focused and viola!  The orange "star" (aka, mars) was seen!  The kids were ecstatic!  But i told them this was just the beginning :).  I zoomed in with the zoomable eyepiece and we could actually make out the slightly crescent shape of mars. But the real goal was saturn's rings!  One of the kids had to use the restroom but they said they'd hold it till we saw saturn.  I was up against the clock now.  but in my 30 mins of use thus far I knew we could do this!<br/><br/>In less than 5 minutes later I had saturn in view at low power with rings clearly visible!  Kids were in awe (as was i!) and we even tried the 3x barlow (stock).  For this, i found that zooming in past about halfway was not very useful. the image was a bit fuzzy.  the 3x barlow at 20-24x was good though.  I later discovered that this was probably the upper end of the scope's ability to magnify, roughly 250-300X maximum without image distortion/loss.  Thus, going back to the barlow section eariler, is why I think a 2X barlow will be great, using the maximum zoom of the eyepiece (8mm).<br/><br/>FURTHER THOUGHTS: I hope you have enjoyed my "journey" described here and maybe help someone else decide if this telescope or Astronomy endeavor is worth it and which one to go after.  The more expensive motorized ones are probably worth it if you are really into Astronomy, but I could nto afford them (they start around $300 for 114mm scopes, which is pretty reasonable), or the $250+ Dobsonians (non motorized but even more powerful than this one) are a good option too.  But i suspect with the low-cost additions I already have ordered noted above, this scope will do just find for now.  Plus they have an motorized addition for this thats only around $35, but it does not auto-track.  If you align everything properly reviews have said it does help a lot.  Thats something else I may invest in down the line.  All in all, for under $200 starting, I got this scope &amp; the aftermarket zoomable eyepiece which I almost call a must.  For around another $50 you can get an aftermarket barlow that even opens up some astrophotography (but I am sure thats going to take a lot of patience to be successful from what i have read).  Good luck and REACH FOR THE STARS! :)</span>

<span>It's a good scope, despite some negative reviews, but don't expect magic either.  It's not a true reflector.  It's a hybrid, but it does mean it's more compact. We took it to a night "school event" in a certified dark area near us to view.  Before I realized it, I was looking at jupiter and it's moons.  Jupiter though is the size of a large pin head, and the moons look like orbiting stars, but it was neat because I had never seen it before except in pictures.  Great moon viewing and it does allow you to see some details of some constellations you can't see with your naked eye.  Hard to keep in focus long though due to the earth's rotaion when you are trying to get a much more magnified view.</span>

<span>This scope catches a lot of flack in the forums and here. Let me demystify some of the bad reviews.<br/><br/>1) Collimation<br/>  This telescope can be collimated easily by eye, if you want to collimate with a laser, you'll have to remove the corrective lens in the focuser tube. If you love to tinker knock yourself out however, this isn't the most powerful scope you can buy so, eye collimation is more than enough to be happy.<br/><br/>2) The finder scope is unusable<br/>  While I agree, it's not the best finder scope out there and lining it up with the telescope can take a long time but, it is possible with time and patients. It's also replaceable so if you don't like it, get another one. (note: it is a scope and not a finder, the image is reversed in the finder)<br/><br/>3) I can't see anything out of this thing<br/>  You need to collimate the scope and line up the finder scope, the instructions are in the manual for eye collimation (tip: back the focuser tube all the way out when you collimate, doing this will let you see both the secondary mirror and the primary, also note, this went through shipping and if it arrived with all the mirrors aligned and ready to go, get a power ball ticket because you'd be the luckiest person on the planet<br/><br/>4) The Barlow is useless<br/>  Please google and youtube what a barlow is and how to use them, it's not a true lens and once you find out its true purpose, it'll make more sense<br/><br/>5) The 4mm lens is useless<br/>  See my comment on the barlow, using the barlow with the 4mm will tame things a bit, also, get a lens and filter kit with a 15mm and a 9mm lens.<br/><br/>6) The Telescope doesn't stay put on the tripod.<br/>  The counterweight on this telescope is not for looks, you need to use it to balance the telescope on the eq mount. when the counter weight is properly balanced, you can put the telescope in any position on the right ascension axis and it'll stay put. The Telescope itself also has to be balanced front to back in the mounting hoops (youtube it, there are a billion tutorials on how to do this.) One last comment on this issue is, do not try to push the telescope into position with the clutches locked, use the controls on the tripod to position the scope, if you need to make big adjustments, loosen the clutches (should be OK because your telescope is balanced) position the scope to the general area of viewing, lock the clutches and use the controls to fine tune. If you push the scope around with the clutches locked you're manhandling the gears that the controls are attached to and you can push them out of whack, don't do this.<br/><br/>Here's the deal, this is a marvelous telescope for UNDER 200 American green backs!!! When properly set up, balanced and overall ready to view, it's a great scope and it's a lot of fun. Buying upgrades for the scope will add to your viewing pleasure. Yes you can see our planetary neighbors, the moon looks fantastic, in a dark place, you can see some deeper space stuff.<br/><br/>Is this a good scope for beginners? Yes I think it is, backyard astronomy is not a plug and play out of the box and looking at Jupiter kind of deal. A telescope is a pretty sensitive thing that takes a little love. If you're just starting out and collimation, calibration and generic tinkering is not your thing, this may not be your hobby, heck aside from sitting on the couch, I don't know what hobby doesn't require a little hands on setup and tinkering.<br/><br/>Finding stuff in the sky is hard, small movements at the scope have a huge impact on where you're looking in the sky, youtube is your friend, so is google.</span>

The NexYZ DX Kit is a great way to step into the world of astroimaging and digiscoping. This universal adapter kit provides you everything you need to capture sharp, detailed images and video. NexYZ’s patented design fits any eyepiece from 35mm to 60mm in diameter, including telescopes with 1.25-inch and 2-inch eyepieces, spotting scopes, monoculars, and binoculars. NexYZ will also attach to microscopes with the addition of the included adapter ring, which takes the usable diameter down to 25mm, the size of a standard microscope eyepiece. A strong spring and a threaded twist lock provide a secure grip on the optical instrument’s eyepiece so you can image with confidence. The universal smartphone adapter is fully adjustable to fit any device—usually with the case still on. Even larger “Pro” devices work perfectly. The secure platform stands up to the weight of these heavier devices with ease. If multiple people want to capture a shot through your optic, NexYZ’s simple spring-loaded clamps make it easy to remove one device and replace it with another in seconds. The NexYZ DX Kit is the ideal solution for star parties and group bird walks where everyone wants their own shot of the action. What makes NexYZ different from other smartphone adapters? The three-axis adjustment. Most adapters rely on you placing your phone perfectly on the platform and only offer limited adjustment in two axes. But NexYZ gives you the power to place your phone on the platform, center it over the eyepiece with the X and Y knobs, and then move up or down over the eyepiece until you have the entire field of view in your shot. And even though this adjustment is ultra-precise, it’s still quicker and easier than with other adapters. From start to finish, the process only takes about 30 seconds. If you switch phones, eyepieces, or optical instruments, you will need only slight adjustments to re-center the camera over the new eyepiece. You can also switch your image from portrait to landscape simply by turning the padded eyepiece clamp and readjusting the knobs to realign your phone with the eyepiece. The NexYZ DX Kit comes with a Bluetooth shutter release remote to capture shake-free images without disturbing the placement of your phone and telescope by pressing the on-screen button. The remote works with any Android or iOS smartphone.

<span>I balked at the cost of this adapter when I started looking for one, but after purchasing a couple of the cheaper models, I can confirm in this case you truly get what you pay for. This is a sturdy, well-made adapter that adjusts easily on each axis. The adjustments are easy, in part, because you're able to establish a VERY SOLID grip to the eyepiece, which is a weak point on the cheaper versions. This is a great tool for capturing quick, through-the-eyepiece shots with your phone, though if you have multiple lenses you'll need to fiddle around a bit to find which alignment works best. If you have an Apple/Android watch that can trigger the camera, you won't need the more expensive version with the Bluetooth trigger.</span>

<span>This arrived quickly and works really well.  The directions were vague, but it is really simple in operation, so you don't really need them.  Having said that, my Iphone 13 is not exactly an astrophotography friendly device.  So, the picture I took of Jupiter through my telescope were less than amazing.  I think the main problem is the phone camera kept trying to focus on the surface of the lense and not infinity.  Also, the phone camera kept taking long exposures and trashing the picture out.  I'll try it again when the moon is out and see if the brighter object helps by shortening the exposure.  But the adapter works perfectly.</span>

<span>I like to do afocal astrophotography using a smartphone. Originally, I would hold the smartphone to the eyepiece, wiggle it around until I got the image in the camera app's viewscreen, try to focus the best I could, and snap the picture. My main telescope is usually a Dobsonian, and since they aren't guided, it is a fine balance of moving the scope to center the object, then moving the camera to get it in the view and take the photo before the object drifted out of the Dob's eyepiece again. Occasionally, I could get a good image, but most of them were blurry or showed nothing at all.<br/><br/>A few years ago, I purchased a GoSky universal smartphone adapter which held a smartphone up to the eyepiece and kept it steady. This removed one of the variables (aligning the phone to the eyepiece) and made taking photos much easier. The adapter I had worked for almost any smartphone, and held the phone to the eyepiece with 3 rubber-lined strips. The strips were narrow, however, and didn't really accomodate phones with curved backs very well. Unfortunately, my smartphone did have a bit of a curved back, so if the telescope were at certain angles, I had to be very careful that the phone didn't suddenly pop out of the adapter and crash to the ground.<br/><br/>The other downside to this particular adapter was its limitation to being used by 1.25" or smaller eyepieces. This meant that the only eyepieces I could use it with were those with smaller apparent fields of view. This wasn't a problem for imaging planets or even the Moon, but widefield sky shots were all but impossible.<br/><br/>A few months ago, I saw an ad for the Celestron NexYZ universal smartphone adapter. This one had better phone grips (the gripper bars were plastic instead of metal, but were taller and curved inward, making a better clamp onto the phone. It also would attach to both 1.25" and 2" eyepieces, meaning I could use it for any eyepiece in my collection.<br/><br/>Still, this wasn't enough to push me over the edge in getting one. The price was a hefty $60 for a mostly-plastic gadget that I already had. I felt I could wait awhile to get this one. That is, until one night last November...<br/><br/>I had set up the club's 20" Obsession in my driveway. I was still practicing getting it set up and taken down in the dark, so that whenever I took it to darker skies, I wouldn't struggle. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to get it all set up, and by the time I had finished collimating, clouds had started to roll in. The Moon was still uncovered, though, so I thought it would be cool to take some photos of it and compare them to those of my 12" Dob.<br/><br/>I slipped my smartphone into the GoSky adapter, popped in an eyepiece and aligned it to my camera lens and then popped the whole contraption into the telescope's focuser and tightened it down. I then swung the Obsession over towards the Moon and in the blink of an eye, my smartphone popped out of the adapter and went crashing to my driveway.<br/><br/>Horrified, my heart fell into my stomach and I turned on my flashlight and went to see what was left of my phone. The back of the phone had popped off, my phone battery lay several inches away, and my glass screen protector was shattered. After a careful look, there was thankfully no actual damage to the phone. However, if I ever wanted to try taking photos with the Obsession, I was going to need a better adapter.<br/><br/>I kept looking online and after a week or two, found a sale on the NexYZ on Amazon for $50. I pressed the Checkout button and the adapter was soon on its way.<br/><br/>Opening the well-packed box revealed the NexYZ. Compared to my previous smartphone adapter, this thing was huge. I immediately wondered whether its sheer size and bulk would cause balancing issues for my telescopes.<br/><br/>The design itself, however, was pretty clever. There were three adjustment knobs which moved the smartphone platform in relation to the eyepiece clamp. One knob for each of the X, Y and Z axes. This must be how Celestron came up with the name. There was a fourth thumbscrew which, when fully loosened, would allow the eyepiece clamp to open wider and then could be tightened again to ensure a snug fit to the eyepiece. This can be a bit hard to reach when the unit is attached to the telescope, but not impossible.<br/><br/>Also included in the box were a couple of rings that could be fitted over smaller eyepieces (such as microscopes, binoculars, or even the old-style 0.965" eyepieces).<br/><br/>Functionality: ★★★★☆<br/><br/>The NexYZ does exactly what it says it does. This adapter is great at holding any smartphone in place. I can put in my smartphone and literally turn the adapter to any angle and the smartphone doesn't budge.<br/><br/>The large size is a bit of a hindrance, however. You may have to put your camera at an odd viewing angle in order to keep the adjustment knobs from bumping into the telescope's focuser knobs. This brings up another possible problem: The torque from a heavy smartphone at an odd angle can cause the eyepiece to begin to unscrew from its barrel. It will only unscrew a little bit (well under half a turn, usually) until it reaches equilibrium with gravity, but it can be a bit disconcerting. In practice, the eyepiece is in no danger of coming completely unscrewed from its barrel (unless it's only barely hanging on to start with) and is merely a minor annoyance.<br/><br/>The X and Y axis knobs are located on the same shaft, one right above the other. The Z axis, which raises or lowers the smartphone above the eypiece, has its controls on a separate knob on another side of the adapter. If you don't have the eyepiece clamped low enough, as you lower the phone, you may find your smartphone bumping into the eyepiece clamp pivot, which changes its angle a bit.<br/><br/>Quality: ★★★★☆<br/><br/>At first, I was a bit disappointed to see so much plastic. Except for the screw mechanisms, the entire adapter is plastic. However, I soon learned that this served a purpose. The plastic helps to keep the adapter as light as possible, which is especially important due to its size. Clamping this on an eyepiece with a smartphone attached can easily shift the balance point of the telescope. The plastic minimizes this as much as possible.<br/><br/>All three axes use simple worm gears to position the phone. They work well enough most of the time, but at certain angles will slip a bit. At times, I've had to hold the gear knob with my hand when taking the photo in order to keep the eyepiece centered in the shot. There are small adjustment screws which will tighten the gears a bit, but then they become difficult to turn at all.<br/><br/>My particular smartphone, an LG V20, has two off-centered cameras. One of them is right at the edge of the adapter's left-right range, so it can be a bit of a problem. Luckily, for most angles, the gear doesn't slip and everything works perfectly.<br/><br/>Adaptability: ★★★★☆<br/><br/>While there are a few 2-inch eyepieces that are too big for the NexYZ to get its arms around, there aren't many. Also, it seems equally at home on a refractor or reflector (I didn't get the chance to try it on a catadipotric telescope, but I don't foresee any problems there. In fact, one of its advertising photos shows it attached to a catadioptric scope).<br/><br/>Cost: ★★★☆☆<br/><br/>The price is a bit on the expensive side, especially considering it is generally a bunch of plastic bits screwed together. However, if you're serious about taking astrophotos with your smartphone, this is the best adapter I've tried. I connect my smartphone to my telescope a lot at outreach events to allow multiple people to "see through the eyepiece" at the same time, so it is worth the cost to me.<br/><br/>Overall: ★★★★☆<br/><br/>In general, I'm quite pleased with the Celestron NexYZ. It has a few quirks, but it does its job effectively and I feel safe leaving the smartphone in the cradle while I slew to a new object.<br/><br/>It usually takes me a few minutes to get the phone properly centered over each eyepiece and ready to snap photos. For this reason, I try to limit eyepiece swapping as much as possible during the evening. For outreach events, this also makes it impractical to allow visitors to use the adapter to take photos with their own phone unless you have a short and patient line at your telescope.<br/><br/>To make sure everything is aligned properly in the dark, I will make the Moon my first target, if it's available. It's big and bright and easy to find and focus on. Failing that, I will shine a flashlight down the tube of the telescope. It will appear as a bright unfocused circle of light to the camera. Once you have that circle centered as well as possible, you know you are aligned and can then take aim at whatever target you wish.<br/><br/>In summary, if you are interested in doing some afocal astrophotography with your smartphone, you can save a lot of frustration and wasted time by getting an adapter. And if you're going to get an adapter, this is currently the best one I've seen.</span>

Even after adjusting all the tension screws, it still had a downward cant.  If you’re not taking pictures, the movement would not be a big deal.  I would have gladly paid more for it if it were made out of aluminum or partially aluminum to stiffen it up.  It is 99% plastic and that causes it to have very loose tolerances.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I don't have much to compare this product to as I am new to telescopes and just getting to know the basics.  What I can say is this kit seems like it brings out the best in an amateurs backyard space exploration.  I am absolutely positive that this is NOT the best set available on the market based off of product feedback and general knowledge but it will definitely be a nice finishing touch to those who are attempting to get the most out of their scope.  For those that are new to this and wondering what exactly everything does,  *You can probably stop reading by now if you have a general experience of how scopes/lenses/filters work*.<br/><br/>  General Information For Newbies like myself: (Don't trust me word for word this is only from my understanding)<br/><br/>The barlow lens attaches to the scope that you can then place any other lens into the barlow to get essentially a 2x magnification level.<br/><br/>The size in MM of the lens represents its magnification power.  The shorter the lens (Small MM) the more magnification.  a 13mm lens is more "powerful" than a 32mm lens.  (Don't let the physical size fool you).<br/><br/>The planetary filters alter the contrast of the image and help show "features" of objects that you otherwise wouldn't/couldn't see, they also do a good job at filtering out excess light so that you can actually see what you are looking at rather than having it seem to be looking at pretty much the same object no matter what planet or star you are on (for those that have weaker scopes).<br/><br/>The moon filter is very nice at reducing the light as described.  Makes things much more enjoyable and easy on the eye.  I noticed after viewing the moon for a while without the filter I couldn't see much of what was around me being so dark out. The filter really reduced that effect.<br/><br/>Tips:  Experiment around a little, don't be discouraged if you can't get it all figured out in one night and find your way to all of the planets and stars.  As helpful as the filters can be they can also hurt.  For faint objects through a low powered scope it can make some objects barely visible at best depending on visual magnitude. Remember the smaller the lens in size and MM the bigger the power.  That also happens to mean that you might get a much more distorted/fuzzy image and objects WILL be harder to locate.  I don't have a fancy "GOTO" scope (one that finds whatever you want it to for you).  I've learned through the small amount of experience that I have to start with a higher number MM lens and find what I'm looking for and then change out the lens carefully and slowly and fine tune as needed... The 8mm and especially 6mm lenses are virtually useless to me as I haven't been able to get them trained and tuned on anything.  (This might be due to my "cheaper" scope).<br/><br/>Final Thought: The eye relief has much room for improvement... Most of the time with the short lenses the only thing I saw was my own eyelashes... Another reason the short lenses haven't helped me out. (eye relief gets better with the longer lenses, and for those that don't know it's the amount of space between the actual lens and your eye).  Hence, if you have your eye pressed against the lens you might see your pretty little batty eyelashes instead of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Good luck and see you at Saturns rings! ;)</span>

<span>This is an amazing price for this many eyepieces and filters. These are high quality Plossl (4 elements) eyepieces. The selection of filters is about all you will ever need. I haven't used my telescope for a while and managed to lose the eyepieces so I bought this set. These are better quality eyepieces than I originally had so it was fortuitous.<br/><br/>Plossl eyepieces sell for around $40.00 each, and the Barlow costs about the same, so 5 eyepieces and a Barlow bought individually would cost about $240.00. Filter prices range all over the place depending on quality. The cheapest I found was a set of six filters from Orion for $120.00. Don't forget to add in the padded case for about $50.00 to arrive at $410.00. While this set offers great savings, the advertised claim that the value is over $700.00 is greatly exaggerated. However, a $280.00 saving is still a great deal.<br/><br/>For the novice. magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the Mirror (reflector) or Primary lens (refractor) by the focal length of the eyepiece. For example, my telescope has a focal length of 1,000 mm (1 inch = 25.4 mm), so the 32 mm eyepiece gives me 1,000/32 = 31x. Perfect for looking at nebulae like those found in Orion. At the other extreme, the 6 mm lens gives 167x, and the Barlow doubles that to 334, good for studying Mars (If the planetwide dust storm ever settles).<br/><br/>I recommend buying these other items to enhance your experience.<br/><br/>1)  I use a medium sized refractor for most of my observations so a diagonal prism for ease of viewing is almost essential. Reflectors don't really need diagonals because of the position of the eyepiece. The one I bought is "Meade Instruments #918A 1.25-Inch Diagonal Prism." for $29.99. Here is the link: https://amazon.com/gp/product/B0006NAS8K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>2) A light pollution filter if you live in an area with a lot of street lights. there are some very expensive ones, but, I bought the "Gosky 1.25 Inch Light Pollution Filter for Telescope" for $19.99. Here is the link: https://amazon.com/gp/product/B01LGZNMGG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>3) Optional, 4mm eyepiece for higher magnification. Most complete sets of eyepieces have the 4 mm eyepiece, so I was surprised it was not in this set. No matter, it is still a fantastic set. I bought the "Celestron Omni Series 1-1/4 4MM Eyepiece" for $23.00. Here is the link: https://amazon.com/gp/product/B00008Y0S5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>The case has a couple of slots cut out in the foam liner for the addition of extra pieces. Using the cutouts you can store the extra filter, eyepiece, and diagonal in the case. I removed the foam from the filter area to store the extra filter and as luck would have it, it was the perfect length to use as a spacer between the diagonal and the extra eyepiece (eyepiece hasn't arrived yet). You can always cut the foam that you remove from the large cutout area, it was just nice to have the perfect fit. As you can see from the photo (Amazon rotated it 90 degrees) it all fits nicely.<br/><br/>This is the perfect set for casual astronomy buffs who don't want to mortgage their houses to buy astronomy equipment. Since it's Celestron, you can count on it being good quality.</span>

<span>Pros: Easy to setup and use.  Bahtinov mask makes focus very easy.  Centers every selected object.  Great on galaxies, clusters and nebulae.  I have seen galaxies down to 14th magnitude.  I am seeing objects I never thought possible with a small scope.  All in bortle 7-8 skies (meaning very light polluted)<br/>Cons:  Very expensive.  App crashes or freezes an awful lot (but that may because of my oldish cellphone that I use to run the scope).  Photos are not great but acceptable.  Again a better phone or tablet may make a difference.  Not really useful in moderate winds because the enhanced vision drops when it feels vibration.<br/><br/>Conclusion:  I have been doing astronomy for 40 years.  I can no longer haul a heavy mount and scope and other gadgets to my viewing spot.  I can easily carry this setup and it literally takes a couple of minutes to get going.  And it is great not having to polar align every viewing session.  I have had great views of the Horsehead Nebula, Running Man Nebula, and many many galaxies, objects I could never see in my other scope.  This scope was the right choice for me.</span>

<span>1. First, there is no description of how to remove the foam pad that prevents the lowering of the telescope, only a red tape that says to remove before use.  Call me stupid but I spent an inordinate amount of time removing the tape and only discovered by accident that the entire foam piece was to be removed and only after much effort discovered that it just slides out.  For God's sake explain that in the Quick Setup guide, one sentence!<br/>2, The Quick Start and User Guide are useless since the app one downloads is now different.  I've followed the online instructions and finally got to an initial observation portion.  I adjusted the focus wheel as directed.  I selected Orion Nebula from the catalog and hit the GoTo button.The resulting screen on my phone is massively grainy and the stars(?) are just blurry blobs. The "Goto in progress" has been going on for hours with no discernible improvement in the image quality and certainly no Orion Nebula.  There are no instructions as to how to exit the observation so I can try another object.<br/>3. I can't use the Bathinov filter to improve the focus because of the useless User Guide.<br/>4. In order to terminate the "Goto in progress", I had to uninstall the app, redownload and reinstall it. Now I get the message that I need to Update to version 2.1 and I can go no further. But the version I have now loaded is 2.1.0.  YOUR APP DOESN"T EVEN KNOW WHAT VERSION IT ALREADY IS!!!!  Now the machine is utterly unusable.</span>
