<span>I purchased this paper to make decor for some products I have. It is AMAZING. The color is bright and it adheres to any surface very well. Would buy again!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Printing is fine with this paper. Ran through my printer with not jamming. (I ran it through the back tray). However, when I tried to cut using my 1" circle cutter, it will not cut. A scissors will work.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>went with Avery for proven quality.  Printed well, no problems, no smear, just let them dry for a bit before using.  Only 7 sheets per package.  The satin finish worked well on paper.  Bound another package.  In spite of price, these worked we3ll and met our needs.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I sell a lot these candles when I do vendor shows and these clear labels are perfect for them. I'm not sure of integrity over time or water resistance since I sell or give them faster than I can keep them, but the adhesion is easy and the sheerness works fine for my purposes.</span>

<span>Created a logo sticker for Party Pop Crowns on Etsy and Used HP laser jet to print. Colors came out vivid. Great size to say what you need to and get the point across to customers!<br/>Nice BUT,  never print in the circle perfectly and I don’t have this issue with other sizes</span>

<span>Kinda dumb that after I bought this the price doubled and it went on sale to keep the price about the same. I don't appreciate manipulative sales, but whatever. The labels are good, but don't pay $15 for them. Also the photoshop template they have for download needs the bottom two rows scooted down a little or they don't print right, and do not shrink the document to fit the page when you print, just do it at 100%.</span>

<span>After my destructive little chiweenie chewed up two of my new Aerogarden seed pod kits, I was looking for a way to replace them less expensively than buying all-new pod kits. I got the sponges in a 50-pack, but I read that you have to IRON on the labels—I don't even own an iron—and I wanted something that I could at least stick on those plastic pods that now (post-Bingo) have no ends to hold the sponges in so I can use them as spacers. There needs to be a cover on these pods so light doesn't get to the water and cause algae growth.<br/><br/>This 1-2/3" diameter label size is about as close as I could get to the Aerogarden labels—and I can print information on them! Planting and germination date, height and type of plant...there was room to code all of that information on the label. (I output a PDF of the 5293 template, then set up the labels in Affinity Designer.) I have three 7-pod Aerogardens and one 3-pod, so 3x7+3=24, exactly how many labels are on one sheet. I can print out a growing season's worth of labels without waste.<br/><br/>These labels are a tiny bit smaller in diameter than the Aerogarden labels, but they are still big enough to stick down on the outer edges of the pods. I bought an EZ Tools 3/8" circle punch (1/2" size would have been better) to punch holes in the center of the labels to allow me to cut slits like the labels should have to allow the widening trunk of the growing plant to push the opening wider. Now I just have to figure out the most efficient way of reducing the stickiness on the parts of the labels that face down toward the plant, exposed to air, so the seedlings don't stick to them. Seeds can be pretty aggressive little things, however, so this may be unnecessary. It may be I could just stick a 1" diameter label to the sticky side or use a 1" circle punch to cut out a stack of tissue paper rounds, then punch a center hole in those and place one on the sticky side of each of the labels. Or I could just give it a dusting of dirt through the open part of the pod.<br/><br/>So, anyway, now I'm set for growing my own seeds after the new seed pod kits I bought to fill in the destroyed ones are spent. I got four useable spacers out of those two kits, so I'll be able to plant three tomatoes without having to buy the tomato seed pod kit. I'll just have to be careful to keep the plastic part of the pods safe from the ****ed dog so I can use them over and over.</span>

<span>Avery labels are all amazing and this is no exception. If you run into issues with alignment you have to print to pdf and open in a PDF viewer like Adobe. Do not print directly from the Internet browser.  And then make sure your print settings are not shrinking to fit.  And you should have no problems.</span>
