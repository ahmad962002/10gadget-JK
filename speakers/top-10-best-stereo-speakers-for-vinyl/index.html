<span>It's great I love the vinyl sound. I've listened to vinyl records my whole life and this product met my expectations. Only downside is my speakers when trying to listen to the radio don't work well at all. It was great for about four months and then one day it no longer worked. Overall great product, definitely worth the money!</span>

<span>My daughter really likes her turntable, but she's mostly just happy because she loves the look of it.  And it does look sharp.  As far as the actual operation of it, I'm not happy.  She tried to play her iPod through it and it will not work.  There isn't much of a manual with it, so I really couldn't figure out anything to try to fix this problem.  But since she really wanted it mostly for playing vinyl records and it works for that, she's happy and she didn't want to return it.  I think it's a ripoff though, because I could have gotten other models at a cheaper price that probably would have worked better and been compatible with an iPod.</span>

<span>I got tired of reading endless forums about the "best budget desktop speakers" so I decided to purchase the following and compare them in real life against each other: Neumi BS5P | Micca PB42X | Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX | Edifier R1280T | Bose Companion 2 Series III | Edifier G2000.<br/><br/>I am not an audiophile, I am not technical. I have played instruments my whole life and run sound in some amateur settings, so I'm guessing I have a slightly more critical ear than the average listener, but definitely not of those truly dedicated to hi fidelity listening. I don't know proper terms. I took these notes kind of haphazardly, but they are listed in order of best to worst after personal testing. I intend to play games and listen to music with a slight preference towards gaming as I have another speaker system for music that I can use for music.<br/><br/>High level takeaway: the true battle is between the Neumi BS5P and the Micca PB42X. Between those 2 speakers, either would be the right choice of all these options depending on your intended use. I ended up choosing the Neumi because I am going to be playing games quite a bit, and they provided much better low end to fill out a lot of the sound effects. If I were choosing a speaker just for music listening, I would have gone with the Miccas as they have superior mid/high/vocal clarity. The Miccas have a good enough sub that I wouldn't be missing the low end on most music, but if I wanted to, I could just add a sub to fill out the lows on the Miccas (for edm type music).<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Neumi BS5P 75-Watt $139.99 - My personal winner<br/>Pro:<br/>- Sounds full and satisfying right away<br/>- Great bass (almost as good as the dedicated sub on the Klipsch, definitely better than all other options without a dedicated sub. I've got adjacent neighbors so I won't ever go sub heavy anyways, so don't need a dedicated sub with the power these pull)<br/>- Decently clear mids/highs, though this is less defined than the Miccas. These get better after doing the firmware update, and get it much closer to the Micca's clarity, but still not quite as good<br/>- Bluetooth pairing quality stays really high (doesn't make a difference for me)<br/>Cons<br/>- Mids/highs/vocals still just not as good/clear/crisp as the Micca<br/>- Much larger than the other options (might be a pro if you're looking to fill a room with more volume - I'm not looking for that)<br/>- Need to update the firmware to get better mids/highs than out of the box (minor inconvenience but might scare some away)<br/><br/>Micca PB42X $109.99<br/>Pro:<br/>- Really nice, crisp/clean mid/highs (better than everything else) The vocals are bright and shiny, unrivaled by any other of these options<br/>- Doesn't seem to add much coloration (but this also leads to it feeling slightly emptier than the 1280T, could be good or bad)<br/>- Pretty good bass for what it is (far better than the G2000 and Bose, worse than the others)<br/>- It comes with a 2 part dc cable that's longer than others, and a longer mp3 cable than others (doesn't really matter, but it's nice)<br/>- Fairly flat (might be a good or bad thing for usage)<br/>Con:<br/>- Getting really nit picky just to find differences, but the connection cable on the back is a twisty, rather than a poke as the Edifiers have. Twistys just seem less stable/more exposed<br/>- Mids/lows start to sound more tinny in comparison to the mids/lows of the neumi, leaving a somewhat less satisfying feeling<br/>- Ultimately this feels a bit emptier than others with better subs, but is also definitely crisper/clearer<br/><br/>Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified $144.99<br/>Pro:<br/>- Great sound out of the box<br/>- Great bass (only one with a dedicated sub, so that should be obvious)<br/>Con:<br/>- Decent mid/highs, but still not as crisp/clear as the Miccas<br/><br/>Edifier R1280T $129.32<br/>Pro:<br/>- Beautiful aesthetic<br/>- Good sound out of the box , there's not the obvious tinny sound of budget speaker<br/>- Volume, bass, and treble knobs<br/>- I'm satisfied with the sound immediately (I grew less satisfied with the sound the more I A/B compared to the Bose due to the coloration. I then adjusted the tilt of the speakers and it seemed to fix this coloration issue and bring more clarity to the mids/highs)<br/>- It's really minor, but the power plug is a plug and not a brick like all the others<br/>Con:<br/>- No sub out option<br/>- Definitely colors the sound to fill in the space more (which could be a pro for some people too). Ends up adding a layer of mud to the  overall sound<br/>- The mids/highs are really just muddy due to the coloration<br/><br/>Bose Companion 2 Series III $149.00<br/>Pro:<br/>- The mids/highs are nice and bright and clear<br/>- Really compact if you don't have a lot of desk space00<br/>- I'm satisfied with this sound out of the box<br/>- Seems not to color the sound (certainly not nearly like the R1280T), feels more accurate<br/>- Has an upward tilt so it seems to naturally position for the sweet spot<br/>Con:<br/>- Only a volume knob so no automatic control over bass/treble (I assume there's eq software that would fix this?)<br/>- Bass is a bit lacking (probably would be satisfied with the amount of bass if I weren't comparing against the others)<br/>- Something feels emptier about these speakers against the 1280T and Micca<br/><br/>Edifier G2000 $109.99<br/>Pro:<br/>- Decent bass and presence<br/>- The LED light is kind of nice<br/>Con:<br/>- Stupid startup car sound is absolutely childish and obnoxious<br/>- The LED light stays on (I think you can turn it off but who's going to go through the hassle of turning it off and on if you have to hear the stupid car sound at every startup)<br/>- Still clearly sounds like a budget speaker with a constant of tin/noise<br/>- Bass can wash out pretty easily at medium volumes<br/>- It crackles at other certain sounds like my incoming email ping<br/>- Not satisfied with this sound out of the box</span>

<span>I needed a set of speakers for our church so the pastor and choir could hear the music when we are doing hymns. Since the choir and pastor are behind the main speakers, it harder to hear the music. These speakers have kicked up the sound of the music another level. Precise clear bass, clear undistorted sound, even when the pastor or others are speaking these speakers allow us to hear them clearly. It is also nice to have the wireless remote so we can turn them up or down when needed. I would definitely recommend these for anyone needing some better sound.</span>

<span>These speakers are simply incredible for the price, literally if i never would have seen or known about them first after doing research and then did a proper demo of them playing mastertapes, i would think they would cost around 250-275 dollars for how they sound. The tweeter is certainly one of the highlights of these speakers, it appears to be a silk mylar type, for a speaker in this price range it shouldn't be anywhere close to as articulated or detaild as it is, it only uses a single 3.3uf bipolar electrolytic capacitor, i do wish they used a polypropylene capacitor to cross the tweeter over instead as that would be a decent improvement over the cap thats inside, but i understand they have to cut costs somewhere. I'd recommend if you do anything at all to these speakers, changing the 3.3uf cap out in each speaker with a 3.3uf 250v pmpc dayton audio polypropylene capacitor would be a good improvement, for a nice bit extra detail in the highend. When you switch it out make sure to attach the cap to the positive of the tweeter and to the positive amplfier wire going to the tweeter wire. Reguardless, the tweeter was a pleasant suprise indeed. The woofer is also fantastic featuring a decent rubber santoprene surround and finely pressed treated paper cone. The lower end extension is around 55 to 60hz plus or minus 10db, which is what id expect for a design such as this, everything from 55 to 60 and up is beautiful for the most part, the mids are fairly accurate as well, even the upper mids are pleasent. The can be a bit more forward sounding at times, but not over baringly so, i think it's a decent characteristic of the sound if you really wanted to go ham with these speakers, plugging in a mini dsp would make these already great speakers shine even further beyound their price tag they already do. Overall the woofers are great for what they are. The magnets and baskets on both drivers are well made. The amplifier section is a single full range class d unit, i believe it was a texas instrument's ic, one of their newer truepath hd chips, edifier implemented it perfectly in these speakers. Everything is driven by a smps power supply which appears to be good enough. The cabinets are made of excessively dense and thick mdf so there is little to no resonance inside the cabnet, the ports for each speaker are perfectly smooth on the insides and they are also flared to reduce port noise, that was a nice touch. The speakers look nice with the grills, they fit very snugly onto the fronts of the speakers, even they do not feel cheap. THE speakers look great with both the grills on or the grills off. The finish looks pleasing to the eye. The wire that comes with it to attach the other speaker appears to be 20 gauge which is enough for the length it is as well as the power it carries. The only 4 things i could see that would make these speakers better for mabey 5 to 15 bucks more "stuff gets cheaper when you buy parts in bulk" Would be for them to use all nichicon capacitors inside the powersupply and main board instead of the no name Chinese caps that are inside currently and also use a polypropylene 1 to 5% tolerance capacitor for the tweeter, and then also use 18 gauge ofc wire for the speakers internal wiring and also for the external speaker wire and its internal wire instead of that cca 20 gauge wire. The last thing would be to include better rca cables, as they do not fit very tightly around the connectors, if those 4 things would be improved, even if that would mean the speakers would be 10 to 15 bucks more, I'd buy it in 321. These edifier speakers still represent a great value for the cost, they won't get super loud, but they will sound really good, especially if you're using a decent source and not a terrible integrated computer soundcard.or a cheap cd player... these should be hooked up to a steinburg ur 12 daw or a mini dsp at the very least with music being streamed from foobar with the latest plug - ins, if you try to drive these with integrated sound or a phone, tablet, mp3 player playing lossy mp3's...That's exactly the sound you will get from them, you're really limiting what these can do if that's the case. If you use a terrible source with poorly mastered cd's or even a cd player with a terrible design, you won't hear what they can really do, go for a decent dac and lossless audio formats that are correctly mastered, you'll see for yourself. If not, and you think they sound terrible, i guarantee you're doing something wrong.</span>

<span>I bought these speakers because I like my music loud and the onboard speakers on my turntable were not cutting it. I’m primarily using this for vinyl but streaming via Bluetooth is a must too.<br/><br/>That said, the speakers were easy to set up and have really clean sound quality, even with vinyl (used with a Crosley turntable). I haven’t used Bluetooth much yet but it was easy to pair and initial test plays sound fine. The speakers are a great size and will fit on the shelf or in a cabinet. The speakers are clear when played at a loud volume. I’ve read comments about the lack of bass… I do agree that they’re not very deep, but that’s not important for me.<br/><br/>The one thing I don’t like is the volume knob. The knob itself is metal and feels strong, but the dial isn’t very tight so the control is weird.<br/><br/>All things considered, not bad for under $100! They get the job done for me.</span>

<span>They were delivered on a Friday, after waiting 2 weeks for them to ship. The box (that you are supposed to keep for returns) is destroyed. They were in decent shape but, they do not power on. Amazon will not return them, you have to go through Fluance. Trying to find how to start a return on their website is ridiculous, and to top it off they are closed on Saturday/Sunday’s.<br/><br/>Other reviews state that the customer has to pay for return shipping? I sent them a message, but I was too late as they were closed.<br/><br/>Will continue to up date this review with how Fluance will handle this.<br/><br/>Currently 1/5 stars<br/><br/>update 8/16:<br/>Was emailed a listed on how to trouble shoot them not powering on. Called them and was able to finally drive home that they were damaged and won’t work. I had to email photos of everything and In supposed to received a return label via email. They stated that once the item is returned and they received confirmation from UPS they will ship out replacements.<br/><br/>********UPDATE 9/14**********<br/>Fluance shipped me a brand new set free of charge. Return process wasn’t bad, they sent me a label to print. (Not sure why people are saying you have to pay to ship them back)<br/><br/>The new ones showed up in about 2 weeks. I’ve had them for awhile now, I’ve been listening to vinyl once a day, even using the Bluetooth function. They are great. They seem to effortless fill the room with sound. It’s crystal clear paired with the RT82.<br/><br/>During the break in they seemed to get louder and louder. They have quite a range of volume. I haven’t even needed to adjust the bass/treb. Not sure why everyone says they need more bass. I feel they are sufficient. They have sort of a hollow body guitar/acoustic guitar feel to their bass. Very much so enjoy them.<br/><br/>Paired with a subwoofer I can see these being a great option for a surround sound due to how they fill the room with sound.<br/><br/>New rating 5/5 stars.</span>

<span>Purchased two sets of speakers in hopes to use them in two rooms, Fluance Ai41/TV and Klipsch R-15PM/studio room. The Fluance Ai41 are an excellent set of speakers for bumping up your TV/movie watching experience.<br/><br/>They have a full well rounded sound for a large room and dialog comes through clear. They’re even better when listening to music. They were much clearer and up front than the Klipsch R-15PM.<br/><br/>The Klipsch R-15PMs were also excellent but had a hollow almost metallic sound quality  - but still excellent.  My household chose clearity over hollow. The Fluance also had a better, adjustable, base response. The Klipsch would probably shine in a larger speaker arrangement as middle speakers. They also came with better audio cabling; we returned them though.<br/><br/>The only con for the Fluance is the lowest audible volume setting is still a bit too loud to listen to while someone else is asleep next to you, so maybe not the best for a bedroom setup. Then again, maybe the adjustable treble could change that for some.<br/><br/>All said, they are an awesome purchase and really do increase our TV/Movie experience,l; we also listen to music more often, now.</span>

<span>For a set of $600 top brand name in speakers I was shocked and sorely unimpressed with these. I have a Fluance BT-82 turntable and bought these to match its quality as the frequency response was very close to a match as well as these have the built in pre-amp for a turntable.<br/>When I played my vinyl the lows were great and the mids were good too. But the highs were, quite frankly, horrible. You could barely hear even the cymbals. Same when I used it's Bluetooth mode. Now to be fair these are 2018 speakers so I'm sure Bluetooth is a version 4 something,  cant find what it actually is anywhere in the specs at all, and version 5 is much better at handling Hi Res and Lossless digital audio.<br/>So I bought the Fluance pre-amp to match my turntable and no improvement on the highs. At the same time I had purchased a set of Edifier 1280DBS's and Bestian SR1's for significantly less, $149 and $99 respectively, to put in other rooms. After listening to them with the Bluetooth mode, both have 5.0 BTW, I was greatly impressed with the audio balance of these "lesser" speakers. The Bestians have a little too much mids and sound a little tinny, but overall the sound of these systems was better than the Klipsch. So I took them both to the living room and did a side by side sound test between them and the Klipsch system using the turntable with the Fluance pre-amp. To me the sound difference was night and day. The "lesser" systems out performed the Klipsch system hands down.<br/>So if you want very low highs and just want bass and mids, spend the extra and get the Klipsch. But if you want a better balance of sound with crisp highs, good mids, and great lows save your money and get the Edifier or Bestians.</span>

<span>I’m a 15+ year DJ/producer and have owned almost every brand of speaker under the sun. Without getting too technical the best way to put it is “These speakers are amazing!”<br/><br/>If you’re looking for something that will sound great the second you plug it in this is the product. The DSP on these speakers is almost perfect, at any volume level. Input options are perfect for standard use and I personally love how I don’t have to touch a single button on the speaker itself because the remote does everything with good distance. They also come on automatically the second it detects an audio signal. Home theater guys, you will definitely want to purchase the matching subwoofer. The bass is solid for music but for that movie theater rumble you will need to add on. The LED on the right main speaker is not bright either, you even have the option to turn it off completely if you like that clean passive look.<br/><br/>Overall these speakers are worth their price tag and unless you have a very keen ear for high fidelity audio you won’t even notice their shortcomings, even then all of it can be corrected with very simple EQ’ing.</span>

<span>I am very experienced at listening to loudspeakers as I designed and manufactured the nOrh brand of loudspeakers a few years ago.  One of the speakers that we marketed was the nOrh 3.0 which sold for less than $100 a pair.  It had a full range driver and could produce sound above 80 Hz.  There is no end to the uses a small/low-cost loudspeaker can serve.  Whether it is for a low-cost system to put in a garage, rear speakers for an AV system or desktop speakers for a computer system, small, low-cost loudspeakers have many applications.<br/><br/>I wanted to do an experiment to produce a low-cost system that sounded good.  I bought a Mo-Gu 50W Class D amplifier for about $30.00.  I bought a larger power supply than what was furnished for another $12.00 or so.  I then found the Polk T15s on sale for $50.00.  I had not heard these speakers before but at $50.00, I knew they would be good enough for my experiment.<br/><br/>When the speakers came in, I wired up the pair of speakers and connected the system to the Amazon Dot that I bought on sale for $29.00.  I could have also used the Google Audiocaster but that would require me to always have my phone to control the system.<br/><br/>For less than $100.00, the Polk T15, Mo-Gu amplifier, and power supply could produce sound is quite respectable for less money than the many Bluetooth boxes that are sold for more than $200.00.  Combining the system with the Amazon dot, pushed to the total cost to just over $100.00 but greatly increased the functionality.  For less than I had paid for my Grace Internet Radio, I now had a voice-controlled music system capable of playing Internet Radio or streaming music from a variety of sources.  The Mo-Gu amplifier also features Bluetooth.<br/><br/>At first play, the Polk Audio T15 sounded a bit shrill and constrained.  I recognized this as meaning the speakers needed to be broken in.  After 100 hours of breaking in, the Polk Audio T15s have lost all their shrillness.<br/><br/>On the good side, the Pold Audio T15s play loud and confidently.  They are tonally balanced and don't have any bad characteristics.  I still find them a bit bright but not offensively so.  Obviously, there is no deep bass. I would suspect that the speakers roll off about 70Hz.  The bass that is produced is clean. The T15s don't suffer from trying to overdo what they are capable of.<br/><br/>The Polk T15s are capable of filling a room with pleasant sound from the modest Class D amplifier I was using.  I didn't push them very hard and the small amplifier was more than enough to fill my room.  I asked Alexia to play all sorts of music.  I listened to lots of jazz, folk and blues.  I spent over an hour listening to the Persuasions.<br/><br/>The Pok T15s never blew me away but they never offended me either.  The stereo effect was very good but there was no imaging what so ever.  The sounds were either coming from the right or the left.  While many audiophiles would not like this description, having left and right information clearly presented is much better than what many people listen to with so many sound systems jamming lots of speakers in a small box where there is no separation at all.<br/><br/>The little Polks tried to produce sound that comes outside the box but never managed to extend its sound field more than a foot or two from the box itself.  The Polk Audio T15s always sounded like a box speaker but got an E for effort trying.<br/><br/>The Polk T15s would be great for rear speakers. They are loud, clear and balanced.  The port is in the front making it easy to hang on the wall.  They look very good for their price.<br/><br/>For about $100 when the T15s are on sale, you can put together a system much cheaper than what it costs to buy a Sonus.  The Sony Play5 does have better bass but you could mate the T15s to a low-cost subwoofer and blow away the Sonus Play3s or Play5s.<br/><br/>The Polk Audio T15 is a very good choice for a low-cost over achiever.</span>

<span>These speakers are a complete and total mutiny of the senses. For the price they absolutely surpassed my expectations. They are not perfect, but they come close.<br/><br/>For both music and home theater use, they must be paired with a subwoofer (or multiple subwoofers) to get good sound. However if you're not that picky they sound quite good even without a sub. Their highs are bright, their mid-range is solid, and their lows have a surprising amount of power considering the size of the speakers. The very high treble is particularly emphasized with these, something I personally love, as it tends to give everything a very high quality sound. However keep in mind that these will only reproduce the quality of audio fed into them. If you send them a mediocre-quality signal, you will get very mediocre sound. If you send them a high quality signal (via HDMI, coaxial, etc.) you will get a very high quality output. Even video games that I play using an old fiber optic cable sound incredible with these speakers (especially Skyrim!)<br/><br/>For the best sound proper speaker placement is essential. The tweeter should be at ear level, or as close to ear level as possible. If this is not possible, the tweeter should at least be below ear level, never above (unless you are using them as surrounds, in which case it should always be above ear level). I have used these speakers extensively for my front speakers over the past month and a half, and I can confidently confirm that when the tweeter is at (or at least close to) ear level, the sound improves dramatically. I originally had them up too high, which did still sound fairly good but not great. The speakers must also be placed sufficiently apart (22 - 30 degrees to the left and right of the listening position for the left and right speaker, respectively).<br/><br/>While these sound great with their grills on, I eventually ended up taking the grills off and like the sound much better that way. Your preference might vary, however. The imaging capability of these speakers is magnificent, especially with the grills off.<br/><br/>But yes it is true, they do have some minor flaws, the main one being that every once in a while a certain type of sound will be sent to them that they struggle to play. This only seems to happen with lower-quality signals, however, such as playing music directly from my phone to my receiver, so it is not really an issue for me. When this happens though it results in some brief hiss / static. I have watched about a dozen movies with these and I believe it only happened once during one movie for a split second.<br/><br/>The other potential issue is that the mid-range / woofer driver on them can only handle so much, unless you don't need a lot of volume. This is another reason that I recommend pairing them with a subwoofer and setting the speaker size for them on your receiver to small. I have these in my bedroom and they can get very loud with no problem with the conditions just mentioned. However if the room you use them in is large and you need a lot of volume they may not be loud enough. 100 watts RMS per channel is substantial for a small room but only goes so far for anything bigger.<br/><br/>My experience using a graphic equalizer with them has had me not boosting the treble much at all because it is already nice and clear, lowering the mid-range slightly (perhaps a matter of personal taste), and boosting the bass somewhat significantly (again I advise only doing this when paired with a subwoofer).<br/><br/>Despite some of the minor imperfections, I still give these 5 stars because truthfully, I do love them. The sound quality is outstanding for the price, especially when they go on sale for $50. In fact they sound so good with the rest of my setup that for weeks it was hard to tear myself away from listening to them. I went from smaller satellite speakers to these as my fronts and they definitely have more "oomph" to them, and movies sound so much more theatrical than they did before. The sound is improved so much that I plan on getting the T30 center channel that goes with them, as well as another pair of these for my surrounds in the near future.<br/><br/>Overall these speakers are somewhat sensitive while simultaneously being robust. As long as you take the time to set them up correctly, "protect" them with a subwoofer and the right settings on your AVR, they are capable of producing sound that is loud and powerful when needed, as well as soft and gentle when quieter moments arise, all the while having a deliciously high quality sound to them. Set them up correctly, and they really, really shine.</span>

<span>These speakers are great. Nice crisp sound. Decent bass. The only downside is if you are on the sides of the speaker, you lose a lot of bass. Standing or sitting in front of them, they sound great. It is not a big deal cuz they are in the front of the room so I rarely move to the sides of the speakers, but they do sound far less impressive front the sides. Again, just a very minor observation, but I thought maybe someone might find it useful. Overall, I am blown away from the full sound these little guys pump out.</span>

<span>I purchased a Fluance TR83 Turntable along with a set of Fluance Ai61 powered speakers. The system is fabulous. Initially, I also purchased the Fluance PA10 Hi-Fi Phono Preamp. However, I could not listen to my vinyl records occasionally through headphones. The Dynasty Proaudio UA2D Preamp is a perfect choice. The Dynasty has a monitor level/volume control and headphone jack. I highly recommend it if you want to listen to your music through the speakers, headphones, and control the input gain, mix and volume. It adds powered volume to my Fluance Ai61 speakers.  One important note:  If you want more bass, I highly recommend getting the sub woofer. After buying the Ai61 speakers, I added the Fluance sub woofer and the difference is ideal.  This system is in my den, which is the size of an average bedroom.  I connect the speakers to my laptop via USB Type-C cable.  So whether I’m spinning my 50-year old vinyl or MP3 via my iPhone or laptop, the sound is fantastic.  Ships quickly and packaged to protect the product.</span>

<span>After my negative experience with two different pairs of Edifier speakers (quality control issues-great sound)<br/>I read a very positive review of these Fluance speakes in Sound and Vision magazine and decided to give them a try. This is a company that knows what it's doing. Packaged beautifully quality construction well written manual and  most importantly great sound after break in. I have owned a pair of AudioEngine A2+ connected to a martin Logan Subwoofer and there is no comparison the A2+ are great for their size, but size does matter. Lastly unlike the Edifiers everything works beautifully right out of box including bluetooth. If you are used to smaller speakers you will notice that you have to set the volume on your computer a bit higher than your used to. Highly recommended</span>

<span>10/4/22: update three. I still haven't hooked these up to a different TV's optical out, but the speakers haven't failed yet and I don't think they will....  The signal issue is still exactly the same, which isn't ideal, but it honestly doesn't bother me enough to take the speakers into the other room lol. I did end up fixing my AT-LP-120-USB that I yanked the terrible integrated preamp out of (never grounded it, oops.) and hooked it up via RCA. Absolutely no problems with RCA into the ai61s. No problems with Bluetooth either. I need to check to see if the USB-C has the same issue. toslink is garbage technology anyways.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, my new firestick 4k's remote has power and volume buttons and *do* control these speakers volume and power which is awesome. Power button turns off the TV and the speakers. Volume buttons control the speakers only, no TV volume control which is perfect.<br/><br/>3/12/22: update number two. I love the quality, however I have a feeling they are beginning to fail. Every 45 minutes or so the audio cuts out for about a half second. I need to do some troubleshooting to make sure it is in fact the amp failing or the dac itself. I'm running optical input from the tv when this issue arises. When I get the chance, I'll see if audio drops out when using RCA input. If I don't get the issue on RCA, I'm going to hook them up to a different tv to see if a different optical input gives the same result. Dropped one star temporarily until I figure out what's going on. If it's the TV, I'll add the star back, but if it's the speakers, I'm dropped additional stars.<br/><br/>9/5/21: This is the second set of fluance speakers I own. The last pair were passive speakers and the quality from them was also excellent. I was looking for an active pair of speakers that had multiple inputs and these fit my needs perfectly. I haven't used the USB input, but the Bluetooth, optical, and RCA inputs work great. Glad they included BT5.0.<br/><br/>I'm not used to having DSP built in, but from what I can tell, the DSP really enhaces the speakers. The DSP filters almost all of the bass out when you plug in a sub. Somewhere around 110hz. Also, the sub out only sends 110hz and below. Definitely a plus. They do sound great even the sub unplugged, just don't expect them to add more bass if you have a sub that's lacking in performance. Big rooms need big subwoofers.<br/><br/>***Edit: I just watched a movie and the surround sound system hooked up to it had some of those like 4" full range speakers that mount on the ceiling.... Let me tell you.... They just don't cut it compared to these fluance bookshelf speakers. You won't believe how awful everything sounds with generic speakers, sound bars, and TV integrated speakers. If you enjoy good audio whether from a movie or from music, buy fluance. Either passive or active. Get a subwoofer too. You'll be amazed how much better everything sounds when you let the subwoofer handle the sub frequencies, the midwoofer handle the mids, and the tweeter handle the highs.***</span>

<span>The quality of the box the speaker comes in is great. For the most part the unit for the money plays fine for what you pay. The quality inside the unit bothers me. I received the A61 and the volume is fine for the unit the quality of the box is great. The dac, well fluance goes over board with there algorithms so if your cranking these you will notice slight drop offs even at lower volume. They say to protect speaker. I call bull crap! I feel this is because the speaker can’t take it. I understand internal dacs waveforms rms etc. but you have a unit that has preprogrammed algorithms in there to just flip back n forth while the music is playing at different volumes but it also limits the speaker. It’s overkill. My sub has DSP guess what they have switch to shut it off. Fluance where is the off button. I even said to the speaker why are you doing this. It answered I’m sorry Dave I can’t open the pid doors !!!</span>
