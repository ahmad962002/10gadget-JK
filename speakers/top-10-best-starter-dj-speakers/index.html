<span>I ordered this system to use for mic-ing keyboards and vocals for small practices, and ideally shows. Fact of the matter is, it is designed more for a backyard party or bingo hall. There is however no similar product at this price point that will provide the flexibility this with EQ, full channel controls, AND bluetooth.<br/>The mic is poor quality, but included free. The 4 main inputs are XLR only, so if you want to use them for keyboard/anything DI you’ll need a 1/4” to xlr converter. The bluetooth is functional even at range. The sound is passable for non-professional use. There is no other full PA system within even $200 of this though, so if you’re tight on cash and need something to get by, this will serve your purposes. Once i can upgrade to Alto or Mackie, this will probably still remain in use as a party speaker system.</span>

<span>Before trying these very accurate and professional near-field monitors, I was running my computer through an HK amp driving a pair of SPENDOR SP2 British loudspeakers. Now that I'm mixing and editing an elaborate stereo Podcast /Radio drama, I wanted to try a more accurate and intimate near-field monitor(s). I came for the PreSonus reputation and footprint--and am now sold on these remarkably affordable and self-contained active monitors. I couldn't ask for anything more in an uncannily accurate, high-performance system.<br/><br/>The E3.5 series can be had with a compact sub-woofer at additional cost, but I think that defeats the purpose. Not only is the human voice flawlessly reproduced--I found the capacity to present strings,  woodwinds and small jazz ensembles to be downright thrilling.  Frank Zappa would love these musical reproduction instruments. Mind you, Heavy Metal is not my thing--but I'm pretty certain that the E3.5's  larger siblings would do the trick.<br/><br/>The PreSonus family of audio instruments are "NEAR-FIELD" reproducers--and not designed to fill a room. I sit no more than three feet away from the classic 'triangle' stereo placement. The dome tweeters do their job without untoward 'sizzle'--and the hefty construction of the high compliance, ported 'woofers' are immensely satisfying. All switches, pots and and connectors leave nothing to be desired--and the 25w/channel amplification is clean and more than adequate for the job.<br/><br/>If you are a professional recordist/editor, I have no doubt but that you will be ever bit as enthusiastic as myself. Buy with confidence--and without hesitation.</span>

<span>(this is a review of the PreSonus Eris E3.5 model)<br/><br/>Good:<br/>- Sound is neutral<br/>- Very accurate sound stage<br/>- The 'acoustic tuning' it's called allows you to adjust for environment<br/>- aux in on front<br/>- professional look that isn't flashy and full of leds trying to call attention to itself.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Cables you get are pretty mediocre<br/>- Cabinet build quality feels cheap<br/><br/>A quick background.  While I'm no audio engineer and I wouldn't classify myself as an audiophile I do have several headphones in the $100-$300 range and a headphone amp and dac.  I was looking to upgrade my 15 year old set of pc speakers that work but I knew I could get better.<br/><br/>Sound wise these are called "Multimedia Studio Monitors" and by that definition these are really accurate.  I also primarily have headphones with a flat response curve so these very much sound like headphones in that regard.  They do have bass but it's not going to rock the place.  I'm going to skip getting in to details on audio since other reviewers have done a great job already and I agree with all of them.  But if you are looking for accurate speakers for a computer just get these and you’ll be happy.  I would not recommend them for a television or something where you are trying to fill an entire room with sound.<br/><br/>The rest of this review is for people that do buy them and it’s their first pair of “studio monitors”.<br/><br/>First off while they seemed to use excellent components for the monitors the cables they give you are pretty mediocre.  I included a picture of what's included (power cable is already plugged in and not pictured).  The speaker wire that goes between the two speakers is about 6 feet and almost look like 18 AWG wire.  I ended up buying 14 AWG wire but knowing what I know now I'd have just got 16 AWG and it would be a little easier to work with.  I then connected them to pc using an 1/8" to RCA jacks.  The cable they give you is around 5 feet and my computer was further away so had to buy a new cable for that.  Any of the 1/8" to RCA should work fine.  The power cable is a standard IEC7 non polarized connector and was maybe around 6 feet.<br/><br/>Some setup tips.  First off the full manual is not included but can be obtained from presonus.com and searching for eris e3.5 and going to downloads.  This explains far more about placement and adjustment than the quick start that's included or even what I say here.  The manual explains the details but the volume on the monitor should be around the 11 o'clock to 12 o'clock position in most situations.  Once you set that don't touch the volume control on monitor, adjust the audio from the source.  With the monitors set to 11 o’clock the signal coming from the computer was too hot (too loud).  I would have only been able to turn the volume up to 10% and it was really loud.  RCA attentuators will reduce the volume by a certain amount just before entering monitors.  Oddly amazon doesn't have them, or they were really overpriced.  Search online for "Harrison Labs 12 dB RCA Line Level Attenuator" and it should be in the $30-$40 range as of March 2018.  This allowed me to have a greater working range on volume.  I now typically listen at around 40% level on computer but occasionally turn it up or lower it.  One last thing I bought were </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Wellcn-26-Pcs-Ferrite-Cores-EMI-RFI-Noise-Filter-Clip-for-3mm-5mm-7mm-9mm-13mm-Diameter-Black/dp/B01KLVUQ38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wellcn 26 Pcs Ferrite Cores - EMI RFI Noise Filter Clip for 3mm/ 5mm/ 7mm/ 9mm/ 13mm Diameter-Black</a>
<span>.  Place those on the power and RCA cables a couple inches before they connect to monitor.  I got some occasional crackling sounds and those removed it.  I also put one on the aux cable I use to connect my work laptop to these when working from home.  It's not needed on the speaker cable going between the monitors but also won't really hurt anything.  **See update below on how I've changed this**<br/><br/>From where you are normally positioned there should be an equilateral triangle between you, the two monitors, and the space between the monitors.  Meaning if you're head is 3 feet from front of monitor they should also be 3 feet apart and then be turned to face you.  If done right you won't see the sides of monitors.  You want your ear to be lined up with the small tweeters.  Because mine are mounted on a wall a little high I have them tilted down and also on their side, which these monitors support.  If you do this make sure to mirror the monitors.  Meaning have the tweeters on the outside to get a larger sound stage.  Once this is all setup don't touch the equalizer or "acoustic tuning" as they call it.  Just listen to music for a few days to get used to them.  There also may be a little bit of break in needed.  Only after a few days should you make small adjustments to the acoustic tuning options.  It's preferable to turn down a setting than boost it.  If you’ve edited photos you may have noticed trying to boost the brightness on a dark image looks worse than darkening a bright image.  Same idea here.  So if it sounds to tinny or harsh you want to turn down the highs slightly.  This reduces the highs and thus the lows will be more prominent.  Initially it sounded tinny but after a couple days it either went away or I got used to it I haven't had to touch mine.<br/><br/>One last thing I'd recommend. Since these are fairly portable, but all my wires are routed around desk I don't want to undo them if I decide to take monitors with me somewhere.  I bought me an extra power cable and then use the 1/8" to rca cable and speaker cable they give you and put in a small ziplock bag.  Now all I have to do is disconnect everything from monitors, grab my ziplock bag of stuff and I'm ready to go.<br/><br/>I know that was a lot of information but I hope you found this information helpful and enjoy these.<br/><br/>(update: December 2018)<br/>So far these have been holding up well and have had no issues.  In fact considering buying a second pair to have over by my workbench.  Since writing above I changed my setup so now I have a Maker Hart Loop Mixer &lt; https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M68UK38 &gt; that I connect my computers and to and then audio goes from there to PreSonus.  It lets me adjust levels and I still have some inputs open so I've done things like be on a conference call but also have music playing while I'm waiting for them to start.  I also got rid of the RCA Line Level Attentuators.  May buy more but only -3 or -6db as the loop mixer doesn't get as loud.</span>

<span>Had high hopes for these affordable and fashionable outdoor speakers. Toting a built in amp and a 2000w rating, I figured these should perform well in small indoor places, sadly however I was mistaken. Perhaps I botched the setup which is relatively straight forward, however after playing with all connections, settings, and blue tooth I cannot seem to get anywhere close to a decent volume without the speakers sounding like they are on the verge of blowing up. The LED lights although a nice touch visually also appear to be causing a hum. All in all I'm underwhelmed and disappointed in what i could best summarize as oversized portable bluetooth speakers. I would return them however the box got throw away before i could finish troubleshooting my volume issue. For what it's my small yamah hs5 studio monitors can 4x the sound output of these without even a strain. I sincerely hope anyone can offer advice and assistance to me in trying to solve this issue.</span>

<span> The systems mounting brackets were easy to set up. One line array speaker mounting  screw was very difficult  to align and tighten, the screw stripped.  Amazon placed the speaker.  The sound quality is very clear and punchy.  With the additional subwoofers the system sound quality is awesome and looks great.  This is definitely for smaller venues and house parties. This system would do great.  For larger venues you will need a strong system with more output.  I am definitely satisfied, system delivers for my needs.  I have used the system for a gathering of 75 people, no problem.  see the video, hope this helps.</span>

<span>THE EARTHQUAKE sub puts out the pounding bass. Worth the extra money. Bass you can hear and feel. Hooked it up for first time last nite, sounded amazing. True oldschool car thumping bass. I use subwoofer with vinyl records and no feedback or humming. Powerful and really isn't heavy or bulky, should transport nicely. Ps sorry I have no comment on the USB/Bluetooth features, looks cool but I won't be using them for the most part. Nice option though.</span>

<span>Giving 3 stars. I know enough about audio equipment to know setup and function, but a new user with limited experience will find no useful info enclosed as to setup and how to get the most out of the unit. Also, the latch of the cabinet that holds all cables broke the first time I tried to open it. Cheap plastic component. I now have to carry all loose parts in a separate container, so I haul three pieces instead of two. Bluetooth feature is fantastic, and volume is good without distortion. Pleased with the audio quality, but the materials used to make the shells are poor, and so is the manual (not comprehensive, and very small print).</span>

<span>I have been purchasing items from Amazon for years but never purchased a used item. The purchase price was much lower than new and listed as used-very good condition,  repackaged, that was an understatement.  The item arrived in an unmarked box, upon opening the item was sealed in the original product box seemingly never opened. The original box had minimal damage possibly from a previous shipment.  When unpacking the individual pieces each in it's own undamaged box was factory sealed and in brand new condition. Once assembled the system worked perfectly. This 8" system has great sound and is pretty loud. For my purposes (outdoor movie and get togethers) it would be perfect at half volume.  As others have stated the microphone is weak and if you are planning on routinely using it, I would suggest a amplified/powered mic. Additionally the 8" bass is adequate for the size, especially when using one of the nine preset eq setting, but if you want thundering bass you may think about one of the larger systems. Overall for my needs, I am very pleased with this system.</span>

<span>Unless you need a BIG PA system the Bose S1 Pro will serve you well. It’s more than sufficient for modest sized rooms/audiences and the sound quality is superb. Bose quality is without rival and incredibly easy to setup and use. I can’t recommend it enough!</span>

<span>Very rich, accurate full range sound reproduction. Connections allow for some serious flexibility. Bought a second for stereo sound, which honestly rivals my home HiFi system, which is impressive for a portable unit. No LED’s, but that’s not what I was looking for in a speaker this time around. I did also grab a Sub2, and let me tell you, when connected properly, WOW, instant, permanent hearing damage!!! Highly recommend.</span>

<span>If your looking for killer bass this isn’t for you.  Listening to Gary Clark Jr playing the guitar through this is absolutely amazing.  The clarity and amount of volume you get is insane.  I live in the center of 5 acres and I was worried about pissing off the neighbors playing it outside.  I just ordered a second one and the f1 subwoofer.  Can’t wait to take it for a test drive.</span>
