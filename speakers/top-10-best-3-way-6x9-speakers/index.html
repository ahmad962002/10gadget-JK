      There is a lot of debate when it comes to finding the best 3 way 6x9 speakers. Some people believe that component speakers are the best option, while others think that coaxial speakers provide the best sound. However, when it comes to 6x9 speakers, there is no clear-cut answer. Some people believe that 3 way 6x9 speakers provide the best sound quality, while others think that 2 way 6x9 speakers are the way to go. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. Some people prefer the sound quality of 3 way 6x9 speakers, while others find that 2 way 6x9 speakers provide a more balanced sound. It really depends on what you are looking for in a set of speakers.<table>

<span>The install of these as rear speakers in my regular cab Ram (2013) was a little involved. Removal of the storage bin behind the seats was required. They fit into the factory speaker cavity no problem however I did insulate behind where the magnet sits for both better sound quality and to keep the magnets from wanting to 'stick' to the body inside the cavity. I would highly suggest getting the following wiring harness (I believe this should work for all 4th gen Rams - Metra 72-6514) plug and play - I think Amazon will show that it wont fit a 4th gen Ram but that is incorrect.</span>

<span>These speakers rock! Purchased the 6x9 for the rear and 6.5 for the front of my 2019 RAM Classic.  I already had an Amp installed previously running infinity speakers. No need for a sub with these once the Amp is tuned, superb sound for the price.</span>

<span>I am very picky about sound. My family and friends would probably use stronger terms. Anyway, I love these. I installed these in the rear (and the 6.5" version in the front) before replacing the stereo or installing the amp. I was blown away by how good they sounded with the stock stereo. It's even better now with a Pioneer deck and US Acoustics amp (both of which I highly recommend you consider).<br/>You'll want to use AngleKai 6.5" Foam Speaker Fast Rings with the front speakers and 050380 Boom Mat Speaker Baffles with the rear speakers. Another tip is to use Smartmat Favorite 90 Mil Car Sound Deadener Material under the carpet while you are at it, if you can.</span>

<span>I am gutting the 18 year old audio system in my 2001 Honda Accord DX Value Package sedan. I am using a lot of components I bought over the last four years that, for whatever reason, ended up not getting used in my other cars. However, this vehicle has 6x9s in the rear deck. I hate oval speakers, which never really work as well as a really good round speaker, In my experience. But, after inspecting the deck with the carpeting off I decided that opening up the oles would be a Herculean effort that I don't want to have to make. So I needed to learn about 6x9s.<br/><br/>I want to introduce the new head and the amps and sub over time, so initially I need the stock head to be able to drive the speakers. But I also want to use a very low power mini amp by Alpine with an Alpine head, so the speakers need to be able to accept 45W RMS, which really is not very much, but that little Alpine 'power pack" is *really* clean and crisp, so its 45W RMS is just fine for this car.<br/><br/>I searched the WWW looking for reviews of 6x9 sets that can run well off a stock head and also an aftermarket one that is moderately amped. After a lot of looking (lots of info like this for 5.25s and 6.5s, but just about nothing for the ovals) I found an article that had these listed as very good for my purposes and very moderately priced.<br/><br/>Today I installed them and immediately there were problems with the holes, as reported frequently with this speaker. I had to use my Dremel with an appropriately sized/shaped grinding stone to eat at the speaker baskets and move the holes. If you imagine looking at the speaker head on, with it shaped like an eye (meaning wider, not taller) I had to grind the top holes in toward each other about a full eighth of an inch, with the holes also having to move away from the center by the same amount. So the 'eye" shape they define needs to be a good bit more closed, and wider from side to side.<br/><br/>It is absurd for Kicker to release these with the holes that far off from the pattern used by such a dead common car. We are talking about a freaking Honda Accord and not some arcane Jay Leno collectible. Even at this age point this is still ubiquitous on the roads all over the US and Canada. And the age group that drives these older Accords these days are mostly high schoolers and college undergrads, which is Kicker's primary demographic.<br/><br/>It was easy but very time wasting to have to adjust all eight holes and clean up the metal fragments — don't be a gimp and suggest I chop up my car for a pair of $50 speakers; that is not an option.<br/><br/>Now, regarding fit and finish of the assembled units: Kicker always does a nice job in this regard. Their budget speakers are usually built quite well, with the feeling being that you get a lot for your money with them. I would agree with that in all cases of my buying their products, and this one is the same.<br/><br/>The sound is always an issue for me with Kickers, though. This is a very personal thing, so I will describe what I did not like and what I did, because these might be exactly what someone else wants (or wants to avoid).<br/><br/>To my ears Kickers, out of the box, ALL sound harsh, with the tweeters being over-balanced to the other parts of a multi-axial system. They are probably just too set with too small of a frequency band for the tweeters. Perhaps with a dedicated EQ in my system I can fix this. Using the Alpine phone app is dangerous when you are driving, and I like to alter the EQ regularly depending on what I am listening to. So a physical EQ with easy to use knobs that don't require you to look at them as you make adjustments would probably make these sound just like what I want. The tweeters are just harsh and loud, and can frequently drown out the other cones. My personal experience. Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>Now, comparing these to the 18 year old stock speakers is a no brainer; these are a massive step up.<br/><br/>You can run these on a stock head, add an amp, use an aftermarket head, use an amp with that, so long as you do not exceed the RMS ratings these should sound very decent.<br/><br/>Bass Response<br/><br/>To read the comments you would think that the "sub-heads" and the "non-sub-heads" do not speak the same language, so let me say this clearly:<br/><br/>These are not subwoofers. They are not intended to handle those frequencies. They cannot reproduce them at all in many cases. I think they only respond down to like 30Hz or so. Just because they "respond" way down there does not mean they respond in any sort of meaningful way, with any sort of power or projection or clarity. If you want that then spend the bucks and get an actual sub. Period.<br/><br/>That being said, the bass response in the normal range for such a speaker is tight and crisp, if not overwhelmingly loud. It is there, down to the lowest notes of tuba or electric bass. For synth sounds below the subcontra octave there is no joy with these OR ANY OTHER 6x9 MADE TODAY. If you read claims like this they are lies or statements by those who do not understand what they are talking about. I *like* these for this range. As a kid, a 6x9 was called a midrange, not a woofer. You don't see real woofers much these days because the form factor for an old school midrange speaker now comes filled with magical tech that allows such small speakers to have a deep, rich sound. Just don't be fooled into thinking that you will *ever* find a subwoofer sound unless the basked and magnet and cone are for reproducing these very low sounds.<br/><br/>Whew! Glad to have that finished. Now, as to the midrange and high range response I liked the tweeters in this more than in the last set of Kicker 5.25s I bought. These are harsh, but I was able to use the crappy stock TONE knobs and the fader to make things sound really nice.<br/><br/>I have heard that some of these blow very quickly, even on a low-wattage stock system. I do not know what these people did to their speakers, but I am imagining someone who thinks that since the system wattage is so low that the speakers can be run at eleven every day, all day. Complain all you like, you get no sympathy from me if you blow your speakers. I have owned a lot of Kicker speakers over the years and not one has ever had an electrical or physical fault, and I have never blown one. (Yes, I have blown some speakers, just not any made by this company.)<br/><br/>I like the sound well enough for this low buck build, the price was right for me @ $54.99 (or so) and they just work. I was pissed off about the very poorly positioned holes that made me have to endanger my nice, new speakers by exposing them to thousands upon thousands of steel shavings so I could force them to fit in my absolutely average, common car. Come on, Kicker. That was really disappointing. it took me over an hour to grind and test fit the speakers until I could install them. This was a 30 minute job that took me 90 minutes to do because of this. Read the comments and FIX THIS on the next generation of these speakers.<br/><br/>I would recommend these to anyone on a budget, who happens to understand that they are not supposed to reproduce tones in the subwoofer range, and who has the type of tools needed to make them fit, because if the holes don't fit a Honda Accord they probably won't line up correctly in a lot of other vehicles.<br/><br/>Oh, and a last bit about the hole alignment issue: The covers (which I did not need to use, thankfully) cannot be used if this happens, since Kicker made the screw holes in them round and deeply inset into the plastic. if you have to move all the screws more than .175" over and up (or whatever) there is NO WAY you will ever get that cover installed without a lot of hacking. Again, come on, Kicker. Please fix this. If you cannot figure it out you probably do not need to be making stuff like this. Sell the company and make money doing work that does not require research and precision. And no, I do not want to ship them back. They fit now, and they work. (So far...) I do not want a credit or a refund. I want to buy speakers that fit correctly out of the box.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>These speakers are pretty inexpensive from a famous brand and have good volume and decent, if a bit underwhelming compared to stock, sound quality. While these produce treble well, the bass doesn't kick as well as the stock speakers. It has plenty of mid bass (the constant underlying bass that vibrates the car when you turn the bass knob all the way up - I think I'm using that term correctly), but it fails to produce "punchy" bass. You have to crank up the bass knob which may get you a little punch, but it also adds that mid bass which tends to hurt your ears. I am not expecting subwoofer quality, but I am expecting it to match my OEM speakers, which it does not. I think the main reason is the speakers are underpowered by the stock head unit, but if that is the case they have the wrong marketing. They are marketed as "factory replacement speakers", but they require too much power to be labeled as that, because the OEM head unit in my vehicle does not have enough power to produce full bass from these speakers whereas it could with the factory speakers. A disappointment because I purchased these specifically for the reason of not needing to install an amp or more powerful head unit. I'm sure they would sound great otherwise, but until I replace the head unit, they are going to sound underwhelming. Also, the warranty is very short. 1 year does not inspire confidence.</span>

<span>I replaced the front speakers in my 2019 F150 STX with these and the sound quality is much better than the factory speakers. I also at the same time replaced the rear with the 165X3 6.5 inch.

<span>2007 Jeep patriot, stock radio , added these speakers to replace old crackling speakers.  Decent sound. but not the best. I am happy with them because they were better than what I had and I was still using the stock radio.<br/>I needed/used Metra 72-6514 Speaker Harness.  The harness recepticals ends were a tight fit and need to be firmly but gently inserted in to the speaker connection.  I used my existing screws though scew alighnment was slightly off and you'll need to finess the screws in or widen the speaker screw hole. For this model vehical there was no room to install the grills so order the ones without the grills. I used power tools to remove and install these speaker.

<span>I installed these in my 2011 Ram 1500. With the metra wiring adapters, this was a crazy fast and easy swap. The sound quality is way better than factory, even using the factory radio. I was worried I would lose some low end based on other reviews, but they actually sound great. These show a lot more detail in songs, to the point I realized in one of my favorites - the drummer is actually hitting a double note on the kick drum very quickly - whereas before, it just sounded like a loose single kick.<br/><br/>For less than $20 each, these are a stupidly good deal. I initially tried kickers from the local big W store, but returned them since they required spacers and were twice the cost.<br/><br/>If you have a Ram truck, or any of the Dodge family of vehicles that use this speaker, don't even think twice.

<span>I purchased these speakers because they were Marine Grade and they are mounted on the outside of my RV.  I thought I would have to give up sound for durability but, I was wrong.  They sound great! It was a good purchase and installation was easy.  My RV is a mobile night club now.  Thanks Polk Audio!!</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Die Mädels und Jungs der Harman Kardon Tochter wissen ganz einfach, wie man gute (Auto) Lautsprecher baut, ich kaufe seit Jahren nur JBL Lautsprecher und auch diese hier sind anstandslos zu empfehlen!<br/>Ich habe die GTO 939 (und die GTO 529) als Ersatz für die im direkten Vergleich scheußlich klingenden OEM Lautsprecher für meinen Dodge Caravan gekauft, da sie Woofer in den Türen vorne durch waren.<br/><br/>Die Erwartungen waren natürlich hoch, bin ich den super Klang der Grand Touring Reihe ja durch vorangehende Autos gewöhnt und was soll ich sagen - ich wurde nicht enttäuscht, ganz im Gegenteil!<br/>Die 6x9 3-Wege Lautsprecher haben in den werkseitig zum Glück schon gut gedämmten und abgeklebten Türen einen solchen Druck und sind dabei auch bei höherer Lautstärke so sauber, es ist kein gesonderter Woofer mehr nötig, um ordentlich Tiefe zu bekommen. Vor allem, weil im Caravan gleich 4 von den 6x9 verbaut sind (vordere Türen und in der seitlichen Verkleidung hinten). Zusammen mit den zwei 13cm Mittel-Hochtönern oben im Armaturenbrett gibt das eine wirklich volle und vor allem kristallklare Klangkulisse, auch mit dem werkseitig verbauten Radio, der einen extra Sub-Woofer vollkommen überflüssig macht. Selbst das vordere Paar in den Türen für sich genommen reicht aus!<br/><br/>Natürlich kann man mit den Lautsprechern nicht Omma Erna aus ihrem Bett vibrieren, wenn man auf der Straße vorbei fährt, dafür ist (mindestens) ein guter Woofer im Kofferraum unerlässlich. Aber ich spreche ja auch nicht von scheibenzerstörendem DB-Dragrace, sondern von tollem, druckvollen Klang zum aktiven Musik hören ;)<br/><br/>Ich würde, nein ich werde jederzeit wieder die GTO Lautsprecher von JBL kaufen. Sie liefern einen überragenden Klang und haben dadurch ein überdurchschnittlich gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Wer wert auf WIRKLICH guten Sound legt und sich keine Toplevel Lautsprecher im 4-stelligen Bereich kaufen möchte, ist mit der GTO Reihe bestens bedient. High End Klang zu moderatem Preis, was will man mehr?</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I have these hooked up to a jl 400w 4 channel amp along with the Rockford Fosgate T2652-S Power 6.50. My stereo sounds great. I had to actually fade the 6x9s out some even though they were dialed in perfectly with the amplifier. It is seriously like having a couple full range load speakers going in the back of my car. Especially with running two  12's on a ported box and a 1500w rms kicker amp these do NOT get overpowered by the subs. They are definitely a good buy. I have had these for over a year now with NO issues what so ever!</span>

<span>You aren't shopping for component speakers, which means you probably aren't going for some high end state of the art system, but you care enough about your music to want something better than factory.<br/><br/>I'm here to tell you to do it. Replace your factory speakers. Modern stereo systems are getting more and more complex, but replacing door speakers isn't that hard for the average Joe. A lot of vehicles have adapter wiring now too - a plug for the factory speaker connector that goes to this speaker all plug and play, no cutting or soldering.<br/><br/>Two of my factory speakers had actual holes in them, so of course these were better. Honestly, I kind of expected an even bigger improvement. I mean, the build looks good, the magnets are huge, but I don't have a factory amp. I plan on changing my head unit out for one of the Sony's that has a built in amp that puts out around 50watts per channel. I'm confident that it will make these speakers really come to life.<br/><br/>I can't say it's a bargain at this price if your head unit doesn't put out more power than factory, BUT it's better than stock speakers in most cars. If you don't care about getting an open box item, I got both pairs of mine for about $30 below normal list, which made it a little better of a value.</span>

<span>I am *NOT* an audiophile.  But I built my own enclosure and put these behind my seats and I have to admit...they sound DAMN GOOD!!  Even the bass has some good low boom to it.<br/><br/> I'm sure some nit-picker out there might grumble about some technical shortcoming blah blah blah....but if you're like me and just need an inexpensive pair of speakers that sound really good...pick these up.  You won't regret it.</span>
