<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this because it fits inside my hang gliding helmet. I wanted to use both my iPhone and my UHF radio as two Bluetooth sources connected to one helmet. Instead one source permanently overrides the other and I am only able to use one. I will continue to use this product until I find another that allows me to either switch back and forth on the go, or has automated override so that when radio transmissions come on, it mutes the phone. I realize this may be a specialty product, so if anyone has any suggestions, I am open.<br/><br/>Music wise, the sound quality is ok. It's not the best, but not terrible either.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I just need something to listen to music take the occasional call this is perfect very small not some huge thing on the side of your helmet I love that you can tuck the charging port away in the back and just plug in your helmet when you need to charge it sound quality is on point definitely a good buy</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I only needed bluetooth for listening to my cell phones music and navigation. I don't use biker-to-biker comms and am not interested in talking on the phone while riding. I first tried a cheaper bluetooth helmet speaker but it's auto message volume was way too loud and I couldn't turn it down. So I returned it and paid 3x as much for this sena 3s. But this actually works, the control buttons are more user friendly and the build quality is better. You get what you pay for. I just use it without the mic (didn't even plug in it) and it works great for what I needed.</span>

<span>I really like this unit, but after riding several hours with it I realized a few things.  One, it is music or intercom, not both.  Phone calls are clear.  Music is ok but it sounds like an old school alarm clock.  GET THE JBL SPEAKERS!!!  Once you add the Cardo JBL speakers this sounds amazing.  It is too loud, and super clear.  It is amazing!!!  Cheaper to to buy this unit plus the speakers rather than a set up that includes the speakers.  What ever cardo unit you get, make sure you get the jbl speakers.</span>

<span>The speakers aren’t the best quality but they sure are loud. Don’t expect to hear much other than your music even at highway speeds honestly! The calls work great too. Very please, just need to upgrade the speakers and we are in there!</span>

<span>The actual Cardo system works great, very easy to use and helpful on the road. But the speakers that come with it are quite awful. they are quiet, scratchy and don’t have any bass at all making it extremely sharp. So the only way to hear it is to crank it which will give you a headache quick so I recommend getting different speakers.</span>

<span>Purchased these before a 2800 mile trip on my bike.<br/>Bluetooth connected easily to my IPhone, enabling me to hear text messages and take phone calls.<br/>Met up with a friend halfway through the trip that also purchased this unit just for the trip.  Bike to bike intercom worked excellent!!  We had a great time riding and shooting the bull.  Easily connected bike to bike every morning before we headed out to see the sights.  As long as we were within a 1/4 mile of each other or line of sight they worked perfectly.  Clear conversations without a lot of background noise.  Charged them every night and never got below 35% battery.  No button to push, just talk into the mic.  These made the trip as far as I’m concerned.  We could point out wildlife and unique objects in route.  Road hazards like gravel in the curves and debris in the roadway.  Excellent quality for the price.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace my 20S.  A big selling point for me was the mesh technology and the fact that it fit on the same base unit as the 20S.  I have two helmets that I go between, so I put the newer base unit on the helmet I use more often and the base unit from the 20S on the other.<br/><br/>I can't give an opinion on the HD speakers because I use earbuds with mine.  That way I think I get better sound, and I get the benefit of noise reduction.  The speakers on the 20S were crap.<br/><br/>I gave the Sena 50S 3 stars overall mostly because of the "bugginess"...<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The mesh intercom sound quality is great.  The bluetooth intercom is pretty good, too.<br/><br/>The iPhone app has a cool setting called "Smart Intercom Pairing" that allows you to quickly pair to another 50S or 20S.<br/><br/>The iPhone app overall is better than the app for the 20S because it is more intuitive, though I would prefer that Sena create a single app that works for both.  I would recommend using the app to set up the configuration of the 50S; you can do it on the device itself, but it's more difficult.  For sure don't try to change the configuration while you're riding.<br/><br/>The battery life in bluetooth intercom mode is said to be 24 hours.  I've had mine powered on and connected for over 12 hours before with no problem.<br/><br/>The flexible mic that comes installed on the base unit has pretty good noise reduction, but I thought the mic on the 20S base unit was good as well.  However, it can only do so much noise reduction when someone is riding with an open face helmet with no windscreen at 75 mph.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>In mesh mode when you're trying to listen to your own music, the mic sensitivity is too high even when it's set to the lowest sensitivity.  I was riding with two other people who have the 50S and I couldn't hear more that about 20 seconds of music before someone breathed too heavy and muted the music.  There is a setting that you can turn on that will prevent the music from muting, but then you end up having a hard time hearing what someone is saying over the intercom when your music is playing.<br/><br/>Setting up group mesh is a little confusing so read the instructions thoroughly.  I would recommend setting up your group in advance of your ride.  It’s more difficult trying to figure it out while you and your buddies are sitting on your bikes and yelling back and forth under your full-face helmets.<br/><br/>The button on the 50S that turns mesh intercom on/off (press and release) is also the button that mutes the mic (press and hold for 1 sec) and it's on top of the 50S right next to the antenna.  It is almost impossible to find and manipulate the button when you're riding and wearing thicker gloves.  I think it mesh mode, especially in group mesh, it would be MUCH easier to press and release the jog dial to mute/unmute the mic, similar to how you start an bluetooth intercom conversation.<br/><br/>The battery life is cut by a 2/3 when you're in mesh intercom mode, so after 8 hours, it’s time for a recharge.<br/><br/>The music-sharing function when in mesh mode is a cool idea, but in reality I found the sound quality subpar and it kept cutting in and out.<br/><br/>The firmware is still fairly buggy.  I always have the most recent Sena configuration program on my iMac as well as the most recent app on my iPhone and I have the latest firmware on the 50S.  And I always have my iPhone OS up-to-date.  Sometimes I will randomly lose the bluetooth connection to my phone.  When I checked my OS bluetooth settings, it says it’s disconnected and it the Sena app also says I’m disconnected.  It's a pain in the @$$ when it happens while riding.  Some people may point to the iPhone as the root cause, but I have a number of bluetooth devices connected to my iPhone and the Sena 50S is the only one that gives me problems.<br/><br/>Overall my recommendation would be this…if you and your riding buddies have Sena 20S’s and 10S’s, and you find that everything works to your liking, stay with what you got.  I had no issues connecting my 50S to 20S’s and 10S’s via bluetooth.<br/><br/>Update - 05/19/2021:<br/>I’ve been using the Sena 50S now for a few months.  I stand by my original review with a few updates…<br/>1)  When you’re in Mesh mode and listening to music, the mic is always on.  Even at the lowest sensitivity, wind noise or heavy breathing will still trigger the muting of my music.  The setting that prevents the music from muting is nice,  but you then you constantly hear wind noise, etc. while listening to music.  It is a bit difficult to have a conversation with people while music is playing at the same time.<br/><br/>2)  Connecting to the other people in my group in Mesh mode is easy.  Just turn on Mesh mode, and within a matter of seconds everyone is connected to each other.  That’s very convenient.<br/><br/>3)  The speakers…my bike is loud, so combined with wind noise while riding, I need to wear hearing protection.  If I wear the cheap foam earplugs, then I have to crank the volume to 11 to hear my music and the intercom.  I found a company that makes special foam tips from my earbuds that does a pretty good job with lessening the noise when riding, but then I have to contend with cords, earbuds falling out when putting on my helmet, etc.<br/><br/>4)  Battery Life:  In Mesh mode, you have 8 hours, period.  In regular bluetooth intercom, you have 24 hours…unless you’re listening to music, then you’re down to 12 hours.<br/><br/>5)  Bluetooth Intercom VS Mesh Intercom:  If you’re in a group of more than 2 people, then I think Mesh intercom is the way to go, even with the drawbacks I mentioned earlier.  If it’s just you and a buddy, bluetooth intercom is fine.  You don’t have to worry about “single-clicking” to talk to person A, “double-clicking” to talk to person B, “triple-clicking” to talk to person C.  (Read the directions if you don’t know what I’m talking about).<br/><br/>6)  The firmware seems to be better.  I’ve updated mine a couple times since my original review, and I haven’t had the issue with my Sena disconnecting suddenly while riding.<br/><br/>7)  If you are new to Sena intercom devices, I recommend practicing how to use it while riding.  In the safety of your home, put on your helmet and riding gloves (if you wear them) and get a sense of how to use your Sena.</span>

<span>It’s loud, so works great for loud bikes. My r1 is straight piped and when I’m full throttle I can still hear my music which is great. But when phone calls come in the quality isn’t the greatest and for some reason the max volume goes from 100 to like 3,000 during phone calls lol</span>

<span>I’ve been wanting to get this headset for almost a year now and I finally got it. Was it worth the wait? Yes! The speakers are so much better and they don’t poke your ears. You have to use the SenaMotorcycle app to pair headsets but it also has an equalizer and some other features. You can also set it to get louder when you’re moving faster so you can hear your music. Now getting the cord to connect to my wifi took me forever. It was confusing. But once you have the cord (yes, the cord) connected it will check for updates every time you charge it. I had to update my kid’s Sena 10s to the new Mesh 2.0 firmware to connect to them but no biggie. All non mesh headsets have to have the new update in order to connect to the 50. Overall, I love this headset.</span>

<span>I'm using this in a Schuberth S2 Sport helmet.  I used the included stick-on mount to mount to the side of the helmet as the helmet has a wide lip at the bottom which precludes using the clamp-mounted installation approach.<br/><br/>At first I installed the speakers in the existing indents in my helmet.  I was quite disappointed with the low volume and poor sound quality -- that is when I realize that my hears do not line up with the existing speaker indents.  To find the right spot, I put the helmet on and gently slid a cable tie up into the helmet until I could feel it on my ear.  I carefully pulled the helmet off and used the cable tie tip as an indication of where to position the speakers.  This made a HUGE difference.  Instead of quiet muffled audio, I was now getting high quality, loud audio.<br/><br/>The headset integrates well with my BMW 750gs and I can control things with the dial wheel on the bike.<br/><br/>The Sena Android app is not very good; I was unable to configure the helmet using the Android app as it could never find the headset.  In the end I used the USB cable with my computer to configure the helmet.<br/><br/>Some of the controls are a bit un-intuitive.  Activating the FM radio, for example, requires a long press on the jog dial.  I tried recalling stations I had programmed using the windows app, but ended up just re-programming static into those slots.</span>

<span>Tried to use this with a Smith Vantage MIPS helmet and the thickness of these headphones is too thick. Uncomfortably thick. TBF, Smith did change up the shape of their drop-in space to work with the Aleck 006, so that may have caused part of the issue. I was unable to get them positioned to where it didn't hurt my ears after a few minutes.<br/><br/>The sound was meh. The description states big bass, but these sounded more akin to a couple of small Bluetooth speakers placed up against your ears. For $40 or $50 USD it's tolerable, but don't expect massive sound quality.<br/><br/>The description also states "Headphone can be charged directly without pulling off from helmet". There is *no way* this is possible, at least not in the Smith helmet I tried.<br/><br/>They did pair easily and were simple to use. If they work with your helmet and are looking for something cheap to provide noise while you ride, these will do the trick. Otherwise, spend the money and get something a bit nicer.</span>

It was only after I started packing my equipment away for next season that I discovered Giro ear pads have foam inserts with a pre-cut disc you can remove to fit drop in speakers. I think it would be disingenuous for me to give less than 4stars without giving them another try, but that won’t happen until next ski season.</span>

And even if your companions don't have Sena gear, the SMH10 uses the Universal Intercom protocol, which allows your gear to work with theirs, regardless of brand.   Amazon.com   The SMH10-11 is a Bluetooth v3.0 + EDR Class 1 Stereo Headset with long-range Bluetooth Intercom designed specifically for motorcycles.

<span>I would like to first bring up the fact that I am a long distance rider, and I am also kind of an audiophile, so my review is somewhat skewed to those facts.  That being said, I have had my Sena SMH10-11 headset for about a month, and for the most part it has been great!  I like the overall function of the device, and it fits my helmet fine, (HJC IS MAX BT).<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>* You can call someone from the road and they do not know you are on a bike.  Tried this doing 80MPH on a Harley on a windy day.<br/>* The speakers tuck away nicely in the side of my helmet, and or the most part they are comfortable.<br/>* The speakers are very loud.  They are so loud in fact, that I can wear earplugs and still turn them up loud enough to hear.  This is a huge benefit when riding for 12 hours on a Harley with loud pipes.<br/>* Battery life is pretty good.  When listening to music loudly (see earplug comment above) the battery will last in the area of 8 hours.  Listening to audio-books, it will last for over 14.<br/>*  I took it through a nasty thunderstorm where it got pelted with sideways rain, and it never even hiccuped.  Stands up to bad weather pretty nicely.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>* Sound could be better.  Like I said, I am an audiophile and sound is a big deal for me.  The high and mids are good, and come across clear even with earplugs.  Just don't expect a lot of bass.  It's not a big deal when actually riding, because the bass doesn't really come across anyways, but it just kind of bugs me when I am stopped, etc.<br/>* Occasional hiccups connecting via bluetooth to my Galaxy Note 5.  It will connect, say it's connected, but the audio still goes through my phone speaker.  When this happens, the controls still work, just not the audio.  I will sometimes have to turn bluetooth off and back on within my phone to correct this.<br/>*  On my helmet, the best position for the speakers to be right next to my ears is partway over the helmet straps.  It's not a big deal, and the velcro pads supplied with the speakers still stick fine.  Its just sometimes kind of awkward to get them centered right without being uncomfortable.  But keep in mind, this is me and my helmet.  Every head is different!<br/>*  USB charging is kind of cumbersome, especially if you don't bring the cable that came with the device.  The USB plug is a micro-usb, the same as most phones these days, but the plug is recessed into the device to allow for the rubber cover.  The problem is that a lot of Micro USB chargers won't fit down into the recessed plug, so it can be kind of difficult to charge sometimes.<br/>*  There doesn't appear to be a mute function on the headset itself.  I sometimes join conference calls while riding, and I would like to be able to mute when not talking without having to muddle around with my phone.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great device, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good bluetooth headset.  Sena could stand to make a few improvements, but overall I really like it.  If it came down to it, I would definitely buy another one!</span>

<span>This is my first motorcycle communications system. I wear an Arai Signet-Q, XL, with upgraded thicker cheek pads.<br/><br/>WHY I BOUGHT THIS<br/><br/>* Wanted Bluetooth communication w/ iPhone 5<br/>* Wanted<br/>* Easier on/off removal from helmet vs. SMH5-XX models<br/>* Wanted flexibility with mounting of the mic<br/>* Sena had the best reviews and price vs. other brands<br/><br/>I've ridden with this communications system for about 2-3 months (before the weather got cold).<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/>* Easy on / off between rides - It's really easy to un-snap the unit and stash it in a tank bag or pocket when you're not wanting it on the helmet. Takes 0.5 second and is relatively easy to do IF you have the helmet off.<br/><br/>* Easy iPhone pairing - I've not had any issues with the pairing. I stash my iPhone in my Tourmaster jacket with Bluetooth enabled, hop on the bike, turn on the Sena, and I get a voice confirmation that the phone is paired.<br/><br/>* Top / bottom volume range tones - If you turn the unit all the way up or down, you get a tone to indicate that you've reached the end of the adjustment spectrum.<br/><br/>* Mic flexibility - I used the bud mic because I didn't want to be limited with a full face helmet and a boom mic. There IS a boom mic included, but it requires you to velcro attach it to the inside of the helmet shell. I MAY eventually set this up to have options -- the boom mic MAY be better for voice quality, but for compactness, the bud mic can't be beat.<br/><br/>* Battery life - The battery life is awesome. I've had it charged for almost 2 weeks and listened to it to / from work (25 mile round trip) for podcasts and music before it needed charging.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>* Placement of speakers - You need more velcro options for sticking the speakers in the helmet. The back of the speakers isn't velcro-y (???) enough by default to just stick to the liner padding outright. I stuck the included velcro pads too high and behind the ears because that was the closest place I could find that was just styrofoam shell w/o the clothe liner. I eventually moved the speakers into the ear pads themselves -- not sure if this is safe, but I couldn't get them to sit close enough to my ears to hear them.<br/><br/>* Volume of speakers for Bluetooth audio (music, podcasts, etc.) - There is a software issue -- in my opinion -- that makes all Bluetooth audio like music, podcasts, etc. too soft. Note -- these speakers are the larger units included with Sena products. There are many complaints about this unit and this type of audio. I often have to boost audio for music and podcasts while, sadly, blowing out the speakers with phone calls and other activities. Firmware updates have not helped with this issue.<br/><br/>* Bud mic quality - I opted for the multiple mic model because I didn't like the fixed boom mic model (slightly cheaper). The bud mic that I mounded just under the chin vent is unobtrusive, but I get complaints that I cannot be heard very well. Additionally, Siri on the iPhone has a lot of trouble distinguishing commands.<br/><br/>* Firmware update process - You have to register the unit to get firmware updated. This is annoying -- it's done to discourage unauthorized Sena dealers and their buyers, but it feels more like having to use a social media login to get to a service that really shouldn't require a login. I've updated the firmware once and, once you're registered, it's fine, but it's still annoying to have to register the unit.<br/><br/>* Battery warning is untimely - I like the battery life, but the voice notification for the battery is abrupt -- you get one warning that the battery is low and the unit shuts off, completely dead. Definitely NOT a "You have 10% battery left" style system like on an iPhone.</span>

With a standard 3. 5mm jack, these speakers fit practically any communicator on the market, no matter what brand. Owners of Cardo FREECOM and PACKTALK series will enjoy extra boost with new JBL sound processor and firmware. Not a FREECOM or PACKTALK owner? No worries: this powerful hardware will still drive your headset audio performance to new heights.

<span>This was an upgrade to a Cardo Spirit HD system that came with 40mm speakers. if you are upgrading the cardo system make sure you update the software, then you have the choice of more volume or more bass, the bass can get distorted at times. This is not a day or night difference from the 40mm speakers, if you have smaller speakers it should make a bigger difference. I had to enlarge the speaker pockets in my helmet also.</span>

<span>First I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of this upgrade in theory.  The licensing is a NIGHTMARE, and customer service at Cardo is kind of like waiting to see the dentist, on a hot summer day, standing on pavement with bare feet as far as how quickly your call will be answered.  You can email, but better be extremely patient.  If you ever think you may upgrade your packtalk or freecom, then beware.  The licensing for the JBL upgrade is good for ONE device only.  If like me, something happens to that one device, getting Cardo to give you a new QR code is PAINFUL.  Get every serial number you can find.  Write them down and then take photos of them.  Also get your receipt for buying the unit.  Then open a ticket with them and wait a day or two for them to email you back asking you for all these codes.  Submit the email with the codes, a detailed description of what each of them are, and attach photos.  At this point I called and was told they had received them, it would take a couple of minutes to review and I would get an email.  That was 3 hours ago.  I called back after getting an email , asking for everything I had already sent.  Seriously?<br/><br/>I explained to that person I needed a new QR code, that's it.  They said I would hear back in a few minutes.  I told them I was going riding and really wanted to get his resolved as the ticket had been open for days.  I'ts now 4:40pm eastern time zone  (I called at 4:00 as they said they were closing at 5:00 central time)  The hold music is from an album I can only assume is called "Jazz to irritate the crap out of people waiting on hold so they hang up".<br/><br/>Who ever the product manager is for the 45mm JBL headphones should be terminated.  To tie the software to such a lengthy and painful process is a nightmare, want to know the easy choice?  Buy ANOTHER 45mm JBL kit - even tho you don't need the hardware, just the QR code.  I swear - if you need great sound, it might be easier to go to another brand, Cardo doesn't seem to staff their customer service appropriately or understand that a difficult process LOSES loyal customer, not keeps them.<br/><br/>I've been with Cardo since the G4 was new.  This is my first time using customer service, and I'd rather get a root canal.  Seriously making me consider a SENA for the next headset.  After 45 minutes on hold I finally got someone to answer the phone.  I won't be able to get a new QR code until Tuesday now.  The ticket was opened Thursday this week...</span>

<span>I bought this product to replace the current Cardo Freecom 1 that I was using (There was actually nothing wrong with that one). As far as this new Cardo Freecom 4 Plus, I'm not overly impressed. You are supposed to be able to verbalize to Cardo for making hands free calls and listening to music. The first time I used it while riding my motorcycle it was working just fine. I could make commands and it was working. Yesterday, 10/11/2022, I used it and nothing would work for verbalization. Listening to music on the other hand has been great. Sound quality is just as my previous one but until this other issue is mitigated I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.</span>

<span>Installation wasn’t bad, really depends on the internal padding in your helmet.<br/>Sound quality is good, not great, especially at high volume.<br/>Voice commands work well with Siri. Occasionally, it doesn’t respond.  Even with the engine off, it’s like it stops listening. Powering it off and back on resolves it. Most annoying issue is probably more where I have it installed on the helmet. If I turn my head to look over my shoulder I hit the volume wheel with my shoulder and turn it all the way up. Other than that, very pleased.</span>

It connects to my BMW f900XR’s computer and my phone seamlessly. I’m able to turn music up, skip songs, and respond to text messages/answer calls with my voice, WHICH IS HUGE. Not to mention, GPS navigation is just as amazing with voice control because I don’t have to stop to type in addresses.<br/>It is kind of annoying though, that when you say “hey Siri” the headset actually also says “hey Siri” and you have to wait for this pause every-time you want to use hey Siri for a voice control.</span>

<span>These are the third BT helmet intercoms I have bought. The first was a Beetee (?spelling?) model I got 3 years ago and would still be using except both units broke internally after being dropped (like.. dropped ONCE). Next, I bought a set of mid-priced, seemingly good units. But once we received those, they had a range of mayb 200 ft. No dice. So we opted for Sena. No more f--in around. I'll say that they Sena has better sound quality than the others, but not a ton better than the first. Honestly, when riding a motorcycle, you're not looking for hi fidelity. I will also say the Senas break up a bit at a shorter distance than the first. So... knowing what I know now, I MIGHT buy those original Chinese ones again. The Senas are NOT a world better... or at least not at first glance. But you DO get advanced features like simple phone pairing and some audible prompts (such as "good bye" when turning off, instead of listening to some friggin Morse code wanna be and trying to decide when the units are really off). So... OK... glad I got Sene. Here are a few thoughts so far:<br/><br/>Love:<br/>-Sound quality<br/>-Ease of buttons<br/>-Small size<br/>-separate battery -- to add an extra battery or to replace if it goes bad<br/>-charge while riding<br/>-simple to pair with phone. I mean SIMPLE!<br/><br/>Don't Love:<br/>-counting blinks to know battery charge: Even some cheapo models have audio read-outs. How is one supposed to see the side of their helmets when turning on? (OK, I know, but still...)<br/>-have to download manual. OK... not the worst thing and saves the trees...<br/>-does not seem to remember settings (volume level resets every time I use)<br/>-if using boom mic, you get plenty of foam there to block wind noise, etc., BUT the "wired" mic has very little foam. Wind noise carries through vents on partner's helmet constantly.<br/><br/>Needs improvement:<br/>-range is NOT spectacular: may start breaking up even at a few hundred feet (esp. with wind... high traffic...). However, overall range is good, just surprising that it may have static at such small distances</span>

<span>After years of quietly riding a motorcycle without my wife talking my ear off and after getting a new motorcycle recently, she convinced me that having a way of hearing commands from my phone's GPS and possibly listening to music and  not necessarily to her, it might be time to get a new communication device for our helmets.<br/>So I got input from other riders and our dealer and read the reviews here on Amazon and purchased the Sena SMH10R for the two of us Ordered on Thursday and took possession on Friday, gotta love Amazon Prime.<br/>I will say that after riding 250 miles yesterday, I was able to hear her and gratefully she kept quiet most of the time. Be careful when you sneeze...holy bless you that was loud!<br/>  And although I was able to "pair" the device to my Apple iPhone 6 plus I did not hear the GPS instructions but possibly because I had the volume on my phone too low and possibly the volume on my headset.<br/>I WAS able to hear music my wife was playing through Pandora on her phone but not during the ride, she could hear the music, but again I think it was because I had my volume on my headset turned down,  If you knew my wife, you would understand why after 34 years of marriage (happy 34th dear!).<br/> We are still trying to sort that out.  The volume thing, not 34 years of marriage....but I digress<br/>Meanwhile as to the set up and use of the devices:<br/>First, the instruction/user manual is not as clear as one would hope. Examples: under the section of "charging" its says the charging LED beside the charging port turns red while charging and turns to blue when fully charged.  Well sort of.  It does not say if you are to charge the headset separately or while attached to the additional battery pack.  So I did both.<br/>And noted the following. When you plug in the charging cable to the headset unit, yes a little LED does turn red but then shuts off.  Hmm, does that mean it is charging or not?  So I left both units plugged in overnight and although they turned on and I got the "hello" command and was able to complete the phone pairing and intercom communication set up I was not sure the units were charged.<br/>So I plugged the headset into the battery pack and then to a charger and yes now the LED turned red and then blue indicating a full charge ( I hope.)  Which brings me to the battery pack itself, the manual does not indicate whether you need it for the thing to work or not, so I went on the assumption you do.<br/>On page 11 of the manual it says you can use the 2 pin connector to Micro USB adaptor for charging the SMH10R WITH the battery pack, ok fine but why does the photo on page 11 show the battery pack connected to the charging cable?<br/>Confusing to be sure and an indication that the manual was not edited properly after its writing.<br/>  And then it goes on to say the battery pack is sold separately as an optional accessory, which would lead one to believe you do NOT need the battery pack to operate the headset.  BUT the battery pack (2 of them in this case ) are included when you buy the dual kit. Again a bit confusing.<br/>As far as the configuration menu and voice menu.  I got as far as phone pairing and intercom connection.  Have not had time to try making a call or receiving a call, not that I would anyway while riding a motorcycle on twisty mountain roads. too much distraction....<br/>But the music part intrigues me and I will sort that out and amend this review later. So, based on just getting this set up on Saturday morning prior to our ride and having it work mostly without issue, we did have one instance of loud static that scared the bejeebers out of us while on the highway, thankfully that lasted just a few seconds and then stopped and all was ok, I would say it was/is money well spent.  Now if I can get my phone GPS to talk back to me, I know, I know another woman's voice telling me what to do, but what the hey.  Happy riding and be safe and enjoy listening to your significant other or another rider or not!<br/>After week of trying to get this to work not only with my iPhone 6plus, but with my bike's bluetooth, I surrender. The manual is overly complicated in my view and recently while riding we both heard the most awful static noise we wish we could have ripped our helmets off the noise was so loud and so horrible.  Thankfully it stopped after I was able to pull over and we got our helmets off and we shut off the units. Never did figure out what happened or why.<br/>I wish I could return this for a refund but I missed the window.  We are both now looking for helmets with built in communication capabilities.</span>

<span>I bought the two pack and gave the second headset to my riding buddy. They are awesome. They are easy to set up. All we had to do for intercom was tap the center button and our headsets synced up. For the phone I had to hold down the center button for about 10 seconds to go into the menu options and then select the option to sync to phone. Once synced to my phone I didn't have to do any additional setup to make it play MP3s, answer calls, or any other functions. It just worked.<br/><br/>I was concerned that the speakers would be inadequate. I like really loud music. These speakers are really loud. They are so loud that if you max out the volume when listening to music your ears will be ringing for about 30 minutes afterward. They are loud enough to cause hearing loss. The latest 5.0 update seems to have lowered the sound output by a decent amount. I'm a little ticked off about this and may try to find a way to go back to the previous firmware.<br/><br/>I have this installed in a Shoe X-12 helmet with a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone. Works great with no special setup required. Helmet installation took me a couple of hours. I was a little meticulous because I didn't want to be able to feel the wires in the helmet, and I didn't want them hanging anywhere. I was able to cram most of the wires in between the inner and outer shell of the helmet.<br/><br/>I really like this headset and so does my riding buddy. Several coworkers that ride are looking at getting the headset as well after hearing about it. Price is the biggest reason everyone doesn't have this headset. $150 is a lot of money to drop on an item.</span>

We rode though rain, dust, mud and these headsets worked flawlessly. these are now the best accessories we have ever bought for our razer. I was concerned that since these were seemingly designed for road bikes, that they wouldn't be able to "hold up" to the extra demands of off road ATV riding. I was SOOO wrong, I made sure each day to have the cover over the usb port completely closed (have to work at it, it doesn't like to close all the way, but a little attention and it's perfect). Being able to hold a conversation while riding without having to yell and constantly saying "WHAT?" was worth more than these cost. We used the wired mics in full face helmets and never had any issues. I updated the firmware as recommended as soon as I got them, installation was easy and fast. Both units linked via bluetooth to our phones (both iPhones) and reconnected perfectly every time we powered them on. There isn't a lot of bass, but that's ok with me, more treble = more vocal (these are intercoms for us first and foremost) And finally, I can't comment on the phone voice call aspect of these, since where we were riding there is no cell service (that's 80% of the point), but if it sounds half as good as the helmet to helmet does then it should be acceptable.</span>

<span>This has been one of the best purchases I've made for my motorcycle riding.  The unit was pretty simple to install once I figured out how to take apart my helmet.  All the parts you would need are included in the box and the instructions are clear and well written.  There is a YouTube channel from CARDO, that covers all the basics of the install and using the units.  I'd highly recommend watching the videos before you start installing the units.  Once installed and setup on my helmet, I downloaded the app frrom CARDO (CARDO CONNECT) and installed it on my phone.  This really simplifies using the headset and configuring the units for a ride.  I also connected the PACKTALK Bold units to my computer to update the firmware to the latest version.  The process was super simple and can be done by anyone with basic computer skills.  The update is done via a download of a program to check for updates and then using the CARDO community website to install the new firmware.  On the CARDO community site, you can customize your headsets and prepare them for use.  I was able to set all of my FM radio stations, configure the audio settings (voice control, auto volume, etc.) and name the device for easy identification during bluetooth paring with my phone.  After the easy setup, it was time to hook the unit to my helmet.  The unit just clicks in and fits nice and secure on the side of your helmet.  I powered the unit on and put the helmet on.  The unit communicates to you via voice and lets you know it's powered up.  This is where the fun begins.  If you pull out the quick guide from the box, you can learn all the voice commands in just a couple minutes.  Other than setting up a DMC or Bluetooth intercom, most everything can be done via voice.  You can turn on the FM radio, turn on the media player, turn up/down the volume and communicate with your cell phone assistant.  The voice commands, in my mind make this thing worth every penny you pay for it.  I like the idea that you can keep your hands on the motorcycle and still operate the headset with ease.  Once you finally get on the bike and head out for a ride, communicating with a passenger or group of riders is simple and works very clearly.  The noise cancelling and auto volume work great and react fairly quickly.  I haven't ridden yet with another rider, so I can't really comment on how easy it is to pair with others using a non CARDO unit.  I will update the reveiw once I get a chance to try this.  I have however ridden with a passenger on my bike using the same PACKTALK BOLD units.  WOW!! IT was super nice to be able to talk to my wife while we were riding.  So much easier to communicate with each other.  I can say that talking with a rider is as simple as talking to the other person.  There is a small delay from when you talk and when the rider hears you, but it was not bad at all.  If you want the real benefit of having good communications with your rider, it's safety.  On our ride, my wife was able to spot some deer near the road well before I saw them.  She also was another set of eyes for me when we were turning into traffic from a dead stop on a blind hill.  I looked up hill and didn't see a car and started to roll out when my wife told me to stop as a car was coming over the hill.  There are so many reasons why this may be the best addition I've made to my riding gear and I encourage you to seriously consider buying this unit.  I love being able to answer my cell phone and hear navigation instructions without ever lifiting my hand off the bike.  The overall experience has been excellent and I would not heistate to recommend this to all my riding buddies.  BUY ONE NOW!!  You won't be sorry.</span>

<span>2-month update on my experience with this helmet communicator.  This unit is perfect, just get it and be done.<br/><br/>After 2 months and 2,000 miles of riding with the Cardo Packtalk Special Edition, I have nothing but HIGH PRAISE for this unit when used with 3M PELTOR E-A-R buds Noise Isolating Headphones EARbud2600N (also on Amazon) .  When I bought this Cardo unit, I felt it was wickedly expensive for what it was, but now I'm so glad to have chosen it.  In my view, the expense was completely worth it - having natural voice control of the unit (and my phone) is amazing and works very well for me.  Audio quality on both ends of phone calls is very good.  I have also been able to pair and communicate with other bluetooth helmet units, and have not had any opportunity yet to try pairing with DMC units.<br/><br/>Hot Tip:  When used with an iPhone, using Siri and constructing smart Shortcuts, it is possible to control your device by voice in ways that would otherwise be difficult to do while riding with protective gear on, such as to simply switch from your ride tracking app to the Cardo app.  With this Cardo unit and the iPhone Shortcut app, there is no need to pull over and remove gear just to do that super-simple action.<br/><br/>Original Review Content: Tons of utility in this product - easy to install, configure and use.  Great app, excellent and very easy to use voice control.  Kind of cool that it also receives FM radio stations.  Where it fails for me is due only to the protective gear that I use when I ride, which is with a full-face helmet and hearing protectors, which makes it very hard for me to hear streamed music using the helmet speakers.  A giant selling point for this particular product are the included 45mm “JBL speakers”…and they’re completely and utterly useless to me.  HOWEVER, those fancy helmet speakers connect to the unit using a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, so removing the helmet speakers and plugging in a pair of 3M Peltor E-A-R headphones (20-30dB NRR) makes the system work perfectly for me.  The base mount is very solid and holds the unit securely in place on the helmet.  It is easy for me to recommend this unit, with the one caveat that if you are also wearing hearing protection, you likely will need to separately purchase some wired hearing protection earbuds to connect to the unit in order to hear the audio while driving.  Ride for the slide, wear your gear!</span>

<span>I installed the unit today and then took a ride on the expressway. I easily installed the unit in my new helmet and then paired it to my phone. I've tried several helmet speaker methods such as having regular phone earbuds in my ear. That works OK but the problem is keeping earbuds in my ear when I put the helmet on and the mic positioned near my mouth. At highway speeds the wind noise makes it difficult or impossible for the other party to hear. I tried a dedicated wired motorcycle helmet headset but the volume was too low to hear clearly at highway speeds and it was a hassle connecting the dangling wire from the helmet each time I got on and off the bike. Thus my purchase of the Sena bluetooth unit. I read many reviews of other units. Most had volume complaints or were double the price.<br/><br/>The volume on this unit is simply amazing!!! At 70 MPH on a phone call I can hear the other party very clear and loud. Believe it or not it actually hurt my ears and I had to turn the unit down. The same is true of music. How is the music quality? Good enough. It's not five star orchestra quality and there's not much bass but it sounds good and most importantly LOUD rolling along on a bike. The amp in the bluetooth unit actually drives the speakers to the edge of distortion but that's a good thing.<br/><br/>I believe one key is to make absolutely sure that you use the included pads to position the speakers where they press right up against your ear when you put the helmet on. Proximity probably makes a huge difference in sound volume. 1/4 to 1/2 inch away would probably reduce the volume in half which would make the system much less effective.<br/><br/>I have a Motorola Razr Maxx phone and the volume button on the unit does not affect the phone volume. Most bluetooth units work in conjunction with the phone volume. If you lower or raise the volume on the bluetooth unit, it correspondingly raises or lowers it on the phone. With this unit, volume controls seem to operate independently of each other therefore you need to turn the phone volume to max and adjust volume from the bluetooth unit. The unit is firmware upgradeable so perhaps that will be corrected in a future release but I am so thrilled with the performance of the unit that such a minor detail is insignificant.<br/><br/>There is a plus to this arrangement in that music playback and phone conversation volumes are independently maintained. In other words, if you set the volume on a phone conversation and then switch to music and set a different volume the unit will remember the phone and music volume independently. So I guess it's designed to work independently of your phone volume and as I thought about it, that's probably a better arrangement. Your helmet system would always be set to motorcycle preferences regardless of what level you set your phone.<br/><br/>I haven't tested the intercom features and performance. My wife is terrified of my motorcycle therefore I usually ride alone so I don't need the intercom feature but it's there if I ever do need it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Volume is FANTASTIC and you can hear phone conversations or music clearly at 80% volume at 70mph.<br/><br/>2. The person on the other end hears virtually no mic wind noise at 70mph. They couldn't believe that I was on a motorcycle at 70mph. They heard NO wind noise which was hard for me to believe but I was talking to my mother so I knew she was telling me the truth. Of course I had on a full face helmet with the visor down.<br/><br/>3. Unit can operate while charging. The battery life talk time is rated at 12 hours with a standby time of 10 days. I haven't tested that yet but if it truly lasts 12 hours and you do happen to talk longer than 12 hours at a stretch you can plug up the unit and talk while charging. I've never ridden more than a few hours in a day so a 12 hour talk time before recharging is NOT going to be problem for me. I'm going to poop out long before the bluetooth battery. Talking while charging is something that most bluetooth units can't do.<br/><br/>4. Volume control button is big. On a motorcycle with gloves the button is easy to find, turn or push.<br/><br/>5. It looks cool on your helmet with the blue blinking light.<br/><br/>6. Good price. I bought the H10 instead of the H5 since the price difference was not that much and it appears the H10 comes with better speakers. I'm not sure about that as I couldn't fully tell from the descriptions but it read like the H10 had better speakers than the H5. The upgrade speakers cost the difference between the two units but the H10 does more. It's about a $25 street price difference between the H10 and the H5.<br/><br/>7. Uses a standard micro USB port for charging.<br/><br/>8. Has a standard 1/8" port to plug a wired music player.<br/><br/>9. Ports covered by rubber plugs for weatherproofing.<br/><br/>10. Easy to remove from the helmet if necessary.<br/><br/>Cons: NONE that I've found so far.<br/><br/>I installed it in this helmet:</span>

<span><br/>I am just as impressed by the helmet as I am the bluetooth unit. I can't believe the quality of this helmet for the price. I've got five helmets. This is the cheapest one and it seems to rank right up there with the quality of the very expensive helmets if not better. It has perforations in the helmet liner for the speakers so it works perfectly with the Sena bluetooth unit.</span>
