<span>These are not bad for the price. Its been years since i messed around with sound systems, But my brother loves too hear his tunes. I grabbed a Ekat touchscren 2din, along with these too replace the oem blown 4"?door speakers on a REG' cab longbed 2003 GM 1500.. (THEY FIT PERFECT IN DOOR)<br/><br/> I always remeber seeing and hearing the name of these years ago. And it says there made in germany?  Either way, there pretty goof looking speakers. well made. the oem gm door speakers are only 4"?..<br/>But the 6.5 fit perfect if you dont mind running a cpl self tappers in the door.. The screws and clips came with them, but i usde 1/4" zip ins. worked fine. The wire they give is junk. I just cut and crimped female flat blade terminals on the oem harness -then rite onto the speakers.<br/>The frills if you plan too use mite be tricky, youll need longer self tappers, or somthin too grab the door metal.. Or dont worry about it, since the oem door panels cover them fine.<br/><br/>-btw- for he GM door panels there are 7mm screws holding the door panel on. and then itll lift rite up strait easily.. 1X behind lock, 1x below hand grab/arm rest, and 1x down at very bottom of door front/middle area. I marked them in the pics w/ red were the 2x 7mm are abouts on 2003 style GM truck.<br/><br/>-Its been about a month, daily driving with these speakers. There still working. They havent cracked.. At first, I was like wth, hte OEM speakers sound better. But, depending how you listen too you music, and your head unit, etc.<br/>These are prob beter for someone who just wants something that works, They like trebble.. OK MID, No bass. Which is fine for me. Since Im puttin a amp and sub in behind seat for the bass. So I keep the bass at 1, or 0 in my speakers, let the sub take care of bass. W/ treble maxed or 1 less in my speakers. And w/ the cheaper touchscreen ekat head unit, wich is prob putting out 40-50 watts too each corner they do the job, and not bad after a month and still goin clear.... I grabbed some cheapo tweeters, for 8$.. reall junk, but actually work good too hear all the symbols and hi pitch sounds of rock, metal, hardcore music.. or vocals of other music.. combined sounds great. plus the sub for bass in back..<br/><br/>These speakers would probaly be awesome, connected to a amp, and or a good head unit w/ equilizer.  It sounds like they could give so much more with the rite setup.. But there still not bad hooked too just the head unit. And i can see them lasting a while..<br/>At first, I wasnt real happy with them, but my hearing is shot from all my years working w/ equipment,chainsaws etc.. But as days went by, I kinda likem the way they are, clear crisp, an a mild HI..<br/>So i can still hear the music good enuff.. AND when my brother cranks it too 35, max out, I dont haveta worry about them blowing.. Good work truck or commuter, beater  speakers..</span>

<span>These were too much of a deal to pass. My 2002 4Runner factory speakers had long-been replaced years ago, but was due for an upgrade after living in extreme temperatures of the Deep South. I was interested most in quality mid-range levels, rather than a lot of bass, so I elected to give these 3-ways a go, rather than the "punch" models of equal value and quality. Certainly, in my case, new speakers of any sort were going to be an improvement, but I'm hearing tambourines and high-hat taps that I've never heard with previous sets of car audio speakers. Very impressive! Would recommend for any true audiophile. They offer plenty of bass for my taste, yet folks who want extreme levels of heavy might want look at the 'punch' models.

<span>These aren’t all that bass heavy but they’re pretty clear for what you’re buying. The A-Series Pioneer speakers are a great buy since you can now get them at end of life pricing and get speakers that are at the top of the budget spectrum. The components are noticeably better in terms of clarity and low end handling so if you have the ability to install components always do that. I used these for rear speakers in my F-150. The brackets that came with adapted just fine so I didn’t need additional adapters which is a nice bonus. The 4-way speaker setup should cut down on poor high range and high-mids that might cause ear fatigue which is a big deal when you play your music at higher levels. For $50-$60 these are a tough deal to beat when they were around $100 originally before Pioneer started to phase out all of their speakers from this era. They must be releasing new equipment late in 2020 to be cutting back on inventory but that means you can get a great deal. I recommend Pioneer for their durability and the more you spend the better returns you get. I also have a set of D-series 6x9 components and they’re amazing and cost 1/2 what other comparable speakers cost. I may eventually swap out the A series for D series but it’s not essential with the rear speakers not doing a lot for front seat riders so spending but doesn’t make much sense, unless you intend to put mud-bass drivers back there for better bass response but that’s another story. Good buy.</span>

<span> Bought these to fit them into a JB74 Suzuki Jimny, both for the originally empty rear area and as a replacement for the 10cm front speakers. The speakers come with speaker wire (with ends), screws, and clips for some car mount spaces.  It also includes a template if cutting or fabrication is necessary. I purchased speaker foam tape separately for the installation. I am EXTREMELY happy with the sound quality and build quality, ESPECIALLY  for the value. For a small vehicle and a DIY job, I saw no need for a coaxial speaker with a separate tweeter. these 3-ways gave me all the sound I needed. I doubt I will even both with an under-seat subwoofer at this point. These are giving me the sound I was looking for.</span>

<span>I had a factory speaker that quit working and these speakers have better sound quality than the factory speaker. They were a perfect match for my 1994 Chevy C1500. Took longer to unlock the door than it did to install them, it was super easy.</span>

<span>Use these to replace the stock, and a blown out, speakers in my '99 TJ. The sound quality is good, not great, but significantly better than what I had. Installation was that as simple as you can get, nothing not to love!</span>

<span>The product was just as described. Great price and a great speaker for the value.  Th sound is crisp and clear as long as they are powered correctly by a matched amp.  These are to heavy to be run off a headunit alone. I using a rockford fosgate 600x4 to match the needed rms power.  The shipping was horrible . I ordered these as prime and was to get them on the weekend. First response recieved from shipping was delivery not available as the bussiness was closed.  Dont understand that as it was my personal house and no signature was required. Any how these arrived 4 days late and i couldnt install before road trip so the kids didnt have anything to listen too on vacation.</span>

<span>They deliver big sound even off my Pioneer deck alone. Clear range of sound, but don't expect major bass. They are perfect mids and highs.</span>

<span>If you’re looking for overall sound and good bass, these are for you! Pairs really nicely with my pioneer head unit and sounds great in my 03 wrangler.<br/><br/>This is the second review for these speakers. For my fellow Jeep TJ owners, these DO fit in the dash as long as you get the adapter plates ($12) which you can also buy on Amazon. If you decide on changing out your dash speakers, follow the picture I posted with the positive and negative wires for both sides.</span>

<span>So for reference I have a 1995 Honda accord I used the old stock bracket to keep it in place but had to buy a separate connector cause it didn’t fit can’t say anything on the sound but when I get a new radio I will give a update on sound 🤝</span>
