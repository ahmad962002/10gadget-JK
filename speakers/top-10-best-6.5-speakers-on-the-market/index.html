<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I installed these in my car, the front door speakers have been out since I have had the car so anything would be an improvement over only having sound coming from the back speakers...so take that into account. The installation was simple and the sound quality is great. There is occasionally a tinny vibration from the driver's side speaker but I think that is due to me possibly not having secured the speaker tight enough and not the speaker itself. Overall, I do recommend these.</span>

<span>Definitely an upgrade from stock sound quality is decent</span>

<span>These aren't bad little speakers.. I bought them to replace the stock speaker's in my 01 crv... if you are looking for a "step up" from stock these will do. If you want something more premium spend more money...<br/><br/>Also if u get the metra connectors, install takes literally 5 mins..easy</span>

<span>The sound is amazing and hands down with the price and the some what struggle to put them in, they actually do not fit the front door speakers (or rear door speakers obviously) so we had to trim the top of the bracket back about half a inch to get it to be flush in its spot but after that they do fit perfectly and sounds once again AMAZING !!

<span>These were too much of a deal to pass. My 2002 4Runner factory speakers had long-been replaced years ago, but was due for an upgrade after living in extreme temperatures of the Deep South. I was interested most in quality mid-range levels, rather than a lot of bass, so I elected to give these 3-ways a go, rather than the "punch" models of equal value and quality. Certainly, in my case, new speakers of any sort were going to be an improvement, but I'm hearing tambourines and high-hat taps that I've never heard with previous sets of car audio speakers. Very impressive! Would recommend for any true audiophile. They offer plenty of bass for my taste, yet folks who want extreme levels of heavy might want look at the 'punch' models.

<span>So I've run this same component set in a couple of cars the past 4 years. They used to be $95 back in 2019. I ran them for a couple years with 50 watts rms on a kenwood amp and sounded amazing. Then I removed them and put them in another car with a different kenwood amp now pushing 125watts rms and wow. These speakers needed the power. 80watts is a conservative power rating. At 125 watts with the gains properly set by voltage matching.....these speakers and tweeters sing like never before. They really come to life with the extra power. Dazzling highs and ultra clear and realistic midrange. Great speakers but not something you should invest in if you're just going to run them on a low power head unit. You should buy a speaker that has the power handling close to what you're going to be feeding them. If you only have 20 watts to give your speakers, find something rated lower otherwise you're not getting the full sound from your speakers.<br/>I have these in both cars now and giving them more power makes them sound amazing at low volume and high.</span>

The old ones were light as a feather, these are heavy and of great quality.  The sound is amazing.  For bass lovers, you're going to have to add a sub somehow (good luck with that).

<span>I recently restored a Fiat convertible.  Being the car is so small I was limited on the size of speaker I could fit.  I figured I wouldn't have much bass and that was the trade off of driving a 50 year old convertible.  I was also able to run only 25 WPC because of the car's older electrical system.  I originally bought the Alpine and no matter how much I EQd them the sound was flat with no bottom end.  I then got the RF.  I didn't expect that much bottom end from such a small speaker.  I would recommend paying a little more to anyone to get these speakers.</span>

<span>Mounted in 1961 Cadillac convertible in original rear center seat location (using original grill).  6" size fits on back side of mounting plate with plenty of clearance.  6.5" size might fit as well, but I went with the 6" to be safe.  Very pleased.  This is mounted as a single rear channel speaker, as that's the way it was originally rigged in this car.  Paired with a Hertz-Dieci dual-voice dash speaker up front (also excellent).  Fader set to favor rear speaker (4 out of 10), the systems sounds great with new head unit and no external amplifier.  This Rockford-Fosgate pumps a decent amount of bass and rounds out the system with no installation fuss.  Well built and great sounding speaker all around. Only thing that could be better is option to buy just one speaker instead of a pair.  Now I have an extra, which I'll hopefully never need to use.</span>

They are loud in my 2008 Silverado, louder than I will ever play them. Now, if you want thumping bass, need to look somewhere else. But they have great bass for normal speakers. I also used my original speaker mounts, which of course had to be modified, the ones that came with the speakers were flimsy at best.</span>

<span>So, I am one that relies pretty heavily on what reviews say about a product. However,  I also know that not everyone has the same experience or expectations when diving into car stereo. The reviews from Amazon and other websites on these 2 way Pyle component speakers were rather pleasing. I initially thought that there was no way these speakers would be any good because they are priced so low. I do realize that there are a multitude of other manufacturers that make component speakers that would absolutely abliterate these speakers.... at a much higher cost!!!<br/>My 19 year old son wanted stereo equipment for his vehicle for Christmas. With what he acquired in gift cards and Santa Dad going a bit overboard we were able to replace all the factory stereo components. These speakers have a nice crisp high end from the tweeter and a pretty impressive mid bass from the woofer. We opted NOT to use an external amp to power these speakers and instead are relying on the output of the new stereo we purchased. If he chooses to amplify these speakers later, I know they will probably exceed my expectations even further. However, the amount of power coming from these things just off the stereo alone definitely gets your attention!!<br/>I would buy these speakers again, NO QUESTION! If I can save some money on my mids and highs and still get that clean crisp sound that I'm looking for,I'll do it and pass the savings on to my choice of subwoofers and amplifier to really get the truck booming!!</span>

<span>Got here quickly, kudos to Amazon and fed ex for the super fast delivery I ordered it last Friday evening and received it today, only 2 business days!! Amazon even sent my phone a text message once they confirmed that it had been delivered. These speakers are not the easiest thing to install so if you do not have any experience installing stereo equipment I would push you towards a standard set of 3 or 4 way speakers.. if you know what your doing these speakers are pretty straight forward if you have any knowledge of stereo systems or even common sense. the difficult part is getting it to look good and hide the crossovers (assuming you want to hide them)... now to the product itself.<br/><br/>When I opened the box it smelled of Chinese plastic.. these are made in china like everything else. but their build quality is fair/good speakers feel pretty rigid and I see no problems with them holding up for years under normal use.. but on those hot summer days I would be careful not to crank it up too much the plastic seems to be the type that could warp under high heat and movement... unfortunately there is no room in my garage so my install was stuck to the outdoors and being April in Oregon my install was cut to a halt after the first speaker due to me getting soaked in the rain (I have a small car.. not much room to install door speakers with the doors closed)<br/><br/>Anyway the side I did looks clean and professionally done and has the sound of a more expensive set these speakers perform at the same level of a 70-80$ pair of speakers from brands like sony, pioneer or kenwood.. keep in mind they are no infinity or kicker but do sound very good and are just about the best bang for the buck you can get!!!<br/><br/>Ohh and to the people complaining about the wire that comes with the speakers... the wire that comes with it is thicker than 90% of cars stock audio wiring.. so unless you plan on replacing ALL the audio wire putting larger gauge wire to the speakers is a complete and total waste not to mention these are only ~50 watt RMS speakers you don't need 8 gauge subwoofer wiring to make them work the smaller wire works just fine and they give you more than enough to suffice.<br/><br/>I'm very impressed with the improvement of the overall sound quality of my system with only one speaker.. the tweeters are loud and have a good range and can get very loud if you set them up for it and the woofers make a good deal of bass it wont replace a sub but for someone who listens to less bassy music it will do well.... I'm excited to install the other speaker and am anxiously awaiting my pyle audio 4 way speakers for the rear!!!! kudos pyle you guys have come a long way in the past years.<br/><br/>So far I'd recommend them to anyone.<br/><br/>*UPDATE*<br/>Got them both installed and took out my old rotted out rear speakers and these things sound awesome... excellent bass.. far more than expected. At half volume they can vibrate my rear view mirrors to the point they distort and the tweeters hit every high you throw at them... this set is a very good buy!!!</span>

<span>I just replaced a pair of JBL's that I blew out because I didn't think about it when I bought them that they were car speakers only and I really needed motorcycle/ATV speakers.<br/>I have speaker adapters because the factory speakers were smaller. I think 5 1/4" were the factory size speakers.<br/>I have a Kicker PX?-300.4 amp for these only and wow. I thought the JBL'S were really good but when I installed these, what a difference. A ton clearer and with the factory radio it really woke it up big time. As with all stereo systems,,, the radio part of it never, ever will sound good. Now connect Bluetooth or even a CD and all heck breaks loose. Look guys,,, I looked at the $400 Rockford's,, and yes they sound good but I'm telling you that for this price,, with my amp it stands right up to them. Even if these blow in 4 years,, that's ok,, for the price I'll just replace them.<br/>Heck the JBL'S lasted 4 1/2 years and there car speakers.</span>

<span>These mm1 series sound alot better than the polk db series did that I replaced. Mm1 actually has some mid bass and alot better highs also. Build quality appears to be way better too.
