<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love JBL. I went from a flip4 to a flip5. The flip6 didn't seem worth it to me. Connect 2 speakers to a device, yes. Connect 2 devices to 1 speaker? No. The sound quality is far better than anything else I have tried. My old one lasted 9 years and then it didn't want to stay powered or connected. This one out of the box will glitch if moved and stop the connection for a moment. These should be able to go on a bike ride with you or go anywhere without cutting out. The box is cheap. It is then put in a styrofoam canister. They want you to spend more money on a case. The last one, I used the box. It was it's own case that fit it perfectly and was very sturdy and high quality. Not this one. You spend more and less quality it seems comes out of the whole thing in cost savings for the company. I am tired of cutting costs by manufacturers to make higher profits. They already have high prices. Can't they just genuinely want to make something solid for the customer?</span>

<span>I use this in my semi tractor because the radio doesn't work. It has enough volume to hear with the windows down on the freeway, because guess what.....my air conditioning quit working too! It charges very fast and holds a charge for a long time. My average day is 12 hours and it lasts that long. You can charge it while using it too. You can lay it on the dash under the windshield and it projects sound nicely, or you can put it vertically in a cup holder which will slightly amplify the sound and give it a little more bass. I put mine in a nook on top of the steering column and under the dash, fits perfectly and is right in front of me. The only drawback is you can't use it as a blue tooth phone speaker. Needs to be updated for that feature. For the money, it delivers the goods.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>pros -<br/>- good build quality<br/>- decent sound<br/>- good battery, I use this around 30min to a hour everyday and I only have to charge it once every week or two depending on usage<br/>- reliable Bluetooth, generally connects immediately with my last used device. Don't often have to tinker with Bluetooth connecting unless connecting a new device.<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>- sound is more directional than expected. Thought it would be more omnidirectional given the cylindrical shape, but you will have to tweak and move the speaker around the room to get the right sound<br/>- bass is a little heavy for my taste<br/>- only bluetooth, no aux in<br/>- JBL app has little to no settings available for the device. I wish there was a way to tweak the audio settings, maybe have time options for a sleep/shut down after inactivity.<br/>- the start up/shut down noise is always loud, it doesn't adjust with the devices volume level. This can be jarring if you are turning it on or off in a quiet situation.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is the 2nd one I have bought as I use the first one for work and the 2nd one I take camping.  Good sound quality throughout the range of tones and I play it on the softer side because of my music and space.  Easy connectivity and never have run out of juice running it for 6-8 hours at work.  Also don't have to worry if some liquids get on it.</span>

<span>I am a big fan of Bose products for over 20 years – they are reliable and high quality but pricey. When the Soundlink dropped below $80 in Amazon, I snagged one just for fun. The unit is decent but not spectacular. It’s portable, durable and easy to connect. The sound is decent with good treble and midrange but bass is lacking especially if you take the unit outdoors. With regards to charging and connectivity, here is what you should consider. Charging – the manual says to attach the unit to the usb cord to a POWER charger (like the Anker Powerport). If you simply attached the Soundlink to a usb cable or a non-powered charger, the unit will NOT charge. Connectivity – minimize the number of devices connected to Soundlink; otherwise you can expect intermittent disconnects as the Soundlink is trying to filter notification (like text, email) coming in from various connected devices.<br/><br/>In short, here is my assessment - you get what you pay for. The Soundlink is a good buy for under $100 but you won’t get the richness/fullness and range that you would with higher priced units (like the Soundlink Mini or Soundlink Revolve).</span>

<span>I am a fan of Bose products. This is the first Bluetooth speaker that I have purchased. I didn't really have a need for one but this was on sale at Amazon so I bought one. I use this thing all the time. The sound is great and the battery life is too. I am not sure what else I can say about it other than I really like the speaker.</span>

<span>The fact that I am reviewing this positively, is saying something. I rarely spend time with positive reviews, but this is too good to NOT tell others about. I have previously owned the Anker speaker sold here on amazon for between $20 and $30 and the sound is actually not that bad and the battery life on that unit was impressive, but I accidently left that behind at a hotel and decided to get the Bose as my replacement.<br/><br/>This thing is awesome! From, the deepest 30hz bass to the highest tweets and everything in-between, this Bose speaker, like every other Bose product I have owned in the past, produces the most RICH, CLEAN, high quality sounds of any sound producing devices out there, in my opinion. It's almost like a magic trick as most people that hear it can't believe the rich sound is coming from the little 5x5 speaker.<br/><br/>The device is encased in a thick dense carbon/plastic type case that feels and sounds like hard wood, when you knock or thump on it, then the entire unit is wrapped in a thick ruggedized layer of silicon rubber coating to making it not only waterproof, but easier to grip and allows you to toss it around like and old tool in your toolbox without damaging or causing any blemishes that would normally occur over time with normal day-to-day use. and if it gets dirty, you7 can just wash it, since it is waterproof.<br/><br/>The buttons have a nice soft rubberized textile click when pressed. I would, however, have liked them to be raised up a bit rather than flush for the occasional "no look" adjustments.  The volume has 100 steps rather than the typical 10 which is nice for fine tuning the volume. Also, there is an integrated microphone that makes for a superior quality handsfree experience when connected to your phone via Bluetooth for phone calls.<br/><br/>Power Supply is NOT included, like all major phone and speaker brands, they have gotten away from including the adapter. I have seen the reviews of people saying the unit wouldn't charge, but I want to assure you that the issue isn't with the Bose device, it is the charger, cord, or user error that is the issue. And to be fair, I still think Bose and other manufactures should include the charger and cord. (especially when it has a minimum power requirement in order to charge effectively.)  If you ever have any issues with charging, you probably don't have a high enough watt/amp power block. You need a  minimum of 1.8AMP - 2AMP and above is even better to get it to a full charge quickly.<br/><br/>I see a lot of reviews of people complaining that it won't charge. It will charge, just needs enough juice to do so. Charging adapters are cheap enough, just go buy a 2 AMP+ chargers. (and don't cheap out on the charging cord, those cheap cords that came with your made-in-china product you ordered off Wish or Alibaba isn't going to cut it.)<br/><br/>I do wish the charging adapter type was USB-C and not MicroUSB. Most of my devices now use the USB C type charger. This really isn't a bad thing so much as a convenience factor as it would be nice to have only one type of wire/tip for everything rather than have 100 different types of charging wires  laying around.<br/><br/>The battery life in testing is about 11 hours at medium-high volume. on a typical day I turn it on in the morning when I wake up and then continue to listen to it at my desk at low volume which takes me through a typical 10 hour work day without needing to be charged.<br/><br/>It has voice prompts when you turn it on. but this feature can be disabled through the phone app. It also has multi-device sync giving the ability to sync with my laptop and phone at the same time, which is nice because my windows sounds and my music can live together in harmony.<br/><br/>It is waterproof! I use this thing in the shower. nothing better than having rich quality music while showering.<br/><br/>This is an EASY 5 out of 5 stars. I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone for a wide diversity of applications! you will not regret the purchase.</span>

<span>Unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun, I used it for work. As a FedEx Express courier, not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls, arm rests, cruise control, or insulation from the elements, we don't have speakers! Imagine hours on the road in a loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress!<br/><br/>So one night I decided, no more of that. This speaker fit right into the passengers "seat", and I would strap the seatbelt just incase (the trucks had world class terrible suspension, the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying).<br/><br/>With that, at full volume in the truck that battery might last around 4 or 5 hours. But man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise, tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body, everything. It made my driving experience so much better. That being said, I would only need full volume on the highway (did you know Express trucks are governed to 65mph? Well, assuming our trucks could even easily reach that. At least in my station they all had check engine lights and I once timed that it took 27 seconds to go from 40mph to 65mph. Fun!) and when I was driving from 30-50mph having the speaker at ~70% was fine. At that rate I could make it last about 8 hours before needing a recharge.<br/><br/>I thank JBL for creating such a great speaker and frankly I am sure their other products have that battery capacity I needed, but I got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack. For the situation I was in, it was a total game changer. I went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs. On the off-chance another courier reads this, making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery. I will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind.<br/><br/>Luckily I do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use, but when I needed it, my life was much better for it. It sat next to an open door in an Isuzu Reach and never moved a centimeter, providing me with amazing sound all the while. I know now anything and everything I might throw at it will never take it down. If battery life is your concern, it is valid. If you want the best sound for the size of the speaker, this is hard to beat, and it has my "doing deliveries in a tin can with an open door on a road at 45mph still sounding good" seal of approval!</span>

<span>I was debating between the JBL charge 4 and a different version of the JBL and I’m so glad I went with this one! The sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely. JBL speakers on Amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop! The quality is amazing and it’s so load for how small it is. This one doesn’t come with a case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality I haven’t had any issues or scratches and I’ve just been throwing it in a tote bag! The charging port for your phone is so nice too, and chargers relatively fast. If you’re debating between this one and a pricier one I would go with the Charge 4!</span>

<span>If you plan on taking a speaker with you and want it to fit in your pocket, this is the one to get.

<span>The Bose SoundLink Micro is far and away the best small speaker I've used yet. I've used countless no-name brand speakers and other brand name speakers (and countless ~20-30 dollar 'waterproof' speakers on Amazon) and this one absolutely blows those away.<br/><br/>I already had expectations as to what this would sound like, however, I was still surprised by the amount of bass the speaker was able to put out. And I don't mean loud, droning bass, but bass that makes a song sound like it's coming from a bigger speaker - everything sounds authentic. Drum kicks and other instruments come out convincingly with a nice punch. The Micro is a very musical speaker with nice presence. The treble is very smooth - so you can listen to it for long periods of time without it tiring your ears out at high volume, but it's also never dull - everything has a nice sparkle to it when called for.<br/><br/>Everything but the Girl's 'Missing' (2013 remaster) immediately shows off the Bose's advantage in bass compared to other speakers of its size (particularly against the JBL Clip 3, and JBL GO). The song starts off with a constant bass line and adds another on top that matches the rhythm of the music. The Bose reproduces the two distinct bass lines with confidence without sounding muddled. Tracey Thorn's vocals come through excellent and aren't drowned out by the bass - and neither are the other instruments in the midrange.<br/><br/>Madonna's Music titletrack has a very deep bassline. The Revolve+ renders the song with a little too much upperbase - while it sounds fine at normal volume levels, at high levels the Revolve+ sounds boxy and smaller than it should. Due to the Micro's smaller size, and even though it is bass-boosted like the Revolve+, it actually ends up sounding more natural than the Revolve+. Volume pumping is minimal in this track. The Micro can occasionally volume pump at levels greater than 2/3 when the music stops as an artist continues singing or during the start of a song before the music starts. While not ideal, it doesn't volume pump as much as I expected it to.<br/><br/>Rush's YYZ has great treble presence at the beginning with cymbals and other instrumentation. It comes through very crisp and cuts through the midrange and bass without issue. Geddy Lee's bass solo near the middle really comes through.<br/><br/>Classical music, and really most music in general, from pop, rock, country, electronic/dance sound very decent as the Bose maintains a flat sound signature in the midrange with a small boost in bass. The treble is somewhat rolled off, but this prevents the speaker from sounding harsh - which I prefer.<br/><br/>It's able to maintain most of its composure up until around 75%. You may notice compression at this level under certain circumstances. It'll sound decent up until around 85% - at this point basslines may disappear, depending on the song, however, it music still sounds full and it won't sound tinny. For the most part, it still sounds like a bigger speaker at this level. Above 85% up and up til 100% can be dicey. Most music actually sounds fine with the speaker pointed toward you head-on. Off-axis, it may sound strained, but not bad. It gets surprisingly loud. Older music, such as from the Beach Boys' actually sound very decent at these high levels (likely due to the fact that the songs have little bass), and the basslines they do have, typically remain while most newer music is compressed more at these higher volumes. You can fool the speaker into playing louder if you don't mind reducing bass with an equalizer app (e.g. reduce the left-hand side of the equalizer adjustments).<br/><br/>Some reviews have complained about the treble or are trying to compare it to the Soundlink Mini (which I also have). It is different - the Micro is a 'flatter' and more accurate speaker than the Mini - which has a noticeable treble boost which some people say gives the old Mini 'clarity' over the Micro - even though the Micro is technically the more correct speaker. This isn't in the Mini's favor at high volumes as the compression can make the Mini sound sharp, while the Micro doesn't end up hurting your ears. And you don't lose anything with the Micro being a mono speaker compared to the Mini being stereo - while it's possible to tell the difference between the two from that perspective, it just isn't practical as you lose stereo separation if you are more than a few feet or otherwise are not facing the mini directly. The Micro sounds the same from most directions as audio fires up instead of from the front of the speaker.<br/><br/>The Micro's battery lasts for quite a while. At volumes above a little above half, I get around 6-7 hours easily, and get 8-12 at even lower volumes. The speaker sounds great even at low volumes. Bass is dynamically boosted at lower levels - keeping the sound full, which is a problem for many of these small speakers. In general, I find most smaller speakers don't sound any better than your phone's built-in speakers at low volumes. The Bose definitely has a nice presence at low volume - it makes it easy to fall asleep to if you use it before you go to bed.<br/><br/>I also have the SoundLink Revolve+, and until you reach the top volume of the Micro, the two speakers sound remarkably similar when paired in party or stereo mode. They only differ in certain tracks with very deep bass or when you push the Revolve+'s volume past the Micro's max volume - but listening to them in stereo is a surprisingly pleasant experience. It seems like the speakers volume match when they pair - so it sounds fairly balanced, you can however make one louder / quieter than the other by pushing the volume buttons separately on each speaker.<br/><br/>The Bose app is not required to use the speaker. However, you can adjust the auto-off time in specific increments and remove previously paired devices through the app, otherwise, most things within the app, like turning voice prompts off or shutting the auto-off timer entirely, can be done with button presses on the speaker. You can easily find the manual by going to Bose.com -&gt; Speakers -&gt; SoundLink Micro and the manual is under their Support section.<br/><br/>As for its closest competition, the B&amp;O P2, the Bose is fully waterproof while the former doesn't have any weather proofing (I didn't think B&amp;O advertised any water resistance but apparently some reviews state the speaker is splash proof). The battery on the Bose lasts much longer on maximum than the P2 (2-ish hours compared to a 5-ish for the Bose), even though the P2 isn't much louder than the Bose. And most importantly, the Bose is way cheaper and has a flatter frequency response than the P2. However, I actually like the flatter form factor of the P2 - you'll notice in B&amp;O's advertising that they show the P2 can fit in some jean pockets - while the Micro fits more in larger cargo pants/shorts or coat pockets. The P2 and the Anker's I have above have a large treble boost which, superficially, may sound nice for a few minutes, but quickly becomes tiring when the speaker is within a few feet from you since things become bright and shrill easily.  In my opinion, the Anker Soundcore Sport is the next closest competition. It is pretty much the same size as the Micro, they're both IPX7 waterproof, and they both feature ~1.5 inch drivers with a passive radiator. It's also only 40 dollars compared to the Bose. However, the Sport is covered in a hard rubber and the buttons on that speaker have practically zero feedback - so no 'click' or noticeable indent when pushed - which can make the speaker hard to use, especially when wet. Sound-wise, the Bose definitely wins - but the Anker puts up a good fight for being only $40. Primarily, it lacks the bass the Micro offers. As a plus, the Sport doesn't have the trouble boost it's smaller and non-waterproof brother, the Soundcore Mini and the B&amp;O does - it sounds pretty flat across the midrange and treble - but just doesn't sound as full as the Micro. If you can afford it, the Bose is an easy choice over either Anker.<br/><br/>The newest competition in this speaker size is probably the Minirig Mini. Reviewer Oluv (as noted in his own review of the speaker on this Amazon listing) has done an extensive review of the Minirig Mini on his YouTube channel. I have not heard it in person but it does appear to have an advantage in sound quality if you're willing to forego the smaller size of the Bose, along with waterproofing (the Minirig Mini is supposedly water resistant, like the Revolve+ - so it can handle splashes, but I wouldn't trust getting water on a paper-cone speaker that the Revolve+ and Minirig Mini have). Minirig's parent company specializes in underwater audio, however, so it seems odd to produce a speaker that isn't actually water proof. I used to scoff at speakers that introduced water resistance or 360 degree sound - but now that I have them, I don't think I'd give them up. Keeping all that in mind, the Minirig Mini's can automatically pair in stereo mode, without needing an app or complicated button pushes on every use, once you've set them up previously, which I'm jealous of.<br/><br/>If something were to happen with my Micro, I would easily buy it again (even though it being the cheapest Bose speaker, it still isn't cheap and cost ~5x as much as the Anker speakers) because simply: it sounds better, the battery lasts much longer than many others in it's class (much longer than the Anker's max), and I don't doubt its durability.<br/><br/>Edit: I added some more about the Anker Soundcore products I have since those are the closest in competition next to the B&amp;O P2, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Edit 2: 04/2018 - 6-ish months later. I've used this speaker every day since I got it back in October of 2017 (I listen to music a lot). It's probably my favorite bluetooth speaker that I have ever purchased (even including the original Soundlink Mini and newer and larger Revolve+, both of which I still have) not necessarily because it sounds better than the two - but it can definitely compete at lower volumes, but because of its small factor and waterproofing. This is the first expensive speaker that I have that actually feels durable - I don't worry about babying it like I do with the Mini and Revolve+. Along with the Revolve+, as I noted above - they both work surprisingly well when paired together in party/stereo mode - so if you need something louder than the Micro (and can afford it) I would definitely recommend getting the Revolve+ and pairing the two together so you can have something small for regularly every day use and something for a party on the weekends!<br/><br/>Edit 3: 07/2018 - 9-ish months later: I've added more comparison speakers and updated how the speaker sounds with certain test tracks. Micro is still going strong (and still use it everyday).<br/><br/>Edit 4: 10/2018 - A little after the 1 year mark. Still use it every day since I've gotten it - battery shows no sign of decline. I wanted to point out a few things I missed and noticed haven't been mentioned in other reviews:<br/>1) Even at low volumes, you can really feel the bass when holding the speaker. The speaker won't vibrate due to its soft silicone covered body - but there's something fun about not just listening - but literally feeling the music.<br/>2) A lot of people are complaining about a *very neat* feature that most other non-Bose bluetooth speakers do not have in that you can turn on the Micro (and other Bose Revolve speakers) remotely from your device e.g. selecting the Micro in your Bluetooth list automatically turns it on without needing to push the power button on the speaker. This is particularly helpful on their larger speakers, like when the Revolve+ is mounted on a tripod somewhere. This only works if your device has previously paired with the speaker (as evidenced in the Bose Connect App device history list) - so only you can turn the device on remotely. But some are complaining because they decided to connect it to a smart device i.e. an Echo, Fire stick, etc. - with the problem being that when those devices update overnight, for example, they'll reconnect upon completion which makes the speaker wake up in the middle of the night. You can simply disable the pairing in the Bose app for the problem smart device and this fixes the issue. I would be very disappointed if Bose removed this functionality due to a small few who can't use the speaker correctly.<br/>3) I will note a flaw with connecting the speaker to a PC (or a Mac) which also effects the larger Revolve speakers. PCs don't support linked volume control like our phones do - i.e. when you change the volume on your phone, it immediately changes on the Bose, and vice-versa, but instead you have independent volume control (e.g. the PC has it's own volume level and the Bose has it's own volume level set by the volume buttons on the speaker itself). However, when connected to a PC, the Bose's volume buttons are locked (when you push -/+ the status light on the speaker blinks on/off to like that action is unavailable). This would be fine if the internal volume on the Bose was set to 100% - where then you can simply use the PC volume to control the speaker volume - this would mimic absolute volume control. However, the Bose's internal volume fixed at a low volume - meaning even if the PC volume is set to 100%, the volume may still be quite low on the speaker. Bose should allow the physical volume buttons to be used in this case to increase the volume on the speaker's end or simply max out the internal volume while we control the volume from the PC.<br/><br/>None of this changes the 5 star rating. On a future gen Micro, though, I would like to see, at a minimum, a type-C USB port with USB audio like the larger Revolve line which has micro-USB with USB audio. It would be nice to see an increase in either battery life or fidelity at higher volumes (not necessarily louder but I definitely wouldn't complain).</span>

Deep. Loud. And immersive, too. SoundLink Revolve II is a portable wireless speaker from Bose that’s engineered to deliver true 360° sound for consistent, uniform coverage. Place it in the center of the room to give everyone the same experience. Or set it near a wall and sound will radiate and reflect around the room, immersing you in that same feeling you felt at your favorite show. The tapered cylindrical shape makes this Bluetooth speaker easy to grab and go. Its durable aluminum body provides worry-free protection, and its water- and dust-resistant design (IP55 rating) lets you keep the party going, even if it gets splashed by the pool. The rechargeable, lithium-ion battery plays up to 13 hours — for full-day listening. Voice prompts talk you through wireless Bluetooth pairing, and you can easily take calls with the built-in speakerphone. You can even access your device’s default voice assistant right from your speaker. Connect the speaker to an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, like the Echo Dot, for even more control. Pair two SoundLink Revolve speakers in Party Mode for more performance. Try Stereo Mode where instruments and vocals will naturally separate and spread across an immersive soundstage — making your music sound and feel as you know it should. Bose SimpleSync technology lets you pair the Bluetooth speaker with a member of the Bose Smart Family to play in sync. The Bose Connect app helps you manage your devices, unlock features, and access future updates. You can easily charge the speaker via Micro-B USB port. And the auxiliary input allows you to connect to other audio sources. This mobile speaker is available in Triple Black or Luxe Silver. Included: SoundLink Revolve II Bluetooth speaker; USB cable; wall charger.

<span>After all of the hype about Bose products, I thought I'd take a chance and spend the more than 200 dollars on this item, so I could have it at work, and use it in the workout facility at our work.  The sound is decent, crisp, battery life seems good, but there's a major issue with this product.<br/><br/>At this price point, it should absolutely blow away lower cost competition.  I have a Sony SRSXB2 that I purchased 5+ years ago, and it is every bit as good as far as sound, as this Bose is.  It isn't that the Bose sounds bad, the sound is good, but as I stated, at that price point the sound should be WAY louder and just blow away that cheaper Sony speaker, it flat out doesn't.  For that reason I can't rate this higher than 3 stars, the price is too high for that.<br/><br/>The only area it exceeds the Sony SRSXB2 is with the quick bluetooth compatibility, and that it tells you how much battery is left every time you connect.  Aside from that, nothing else makes it NEAR worth the money, even if it were 110 dollars at half price, there are better alternatives.<br/><br/>I even took apart the box and studied the speaker online just to make sure I didn't somehow order a cheap knockoff.  Nope, it's the real thing.  I'm honestly disappointed to have spent this kind of money and I'm giving serious consideration to returning the speaker and just purchasing a comparable quality for half the price or less.<br/><br/>Don't fall for the hype, test out a cheaper brand locally, again, this thing is Bose in name only, not performance.</span>

<span>I just picked this up to replace a Klipsch BT speaker I’ve used for over 10 years.<br/><br/>Why do I own a BT speaker and how do I use it? I’m a photographer and knowing the model’s music preferences, and having a service like Apple Music or Spotify, allows me to play music during the shoot to help put them at ease and bring out a bit of rhythm to help with posing, especially flow posing. Carefully adjusting the playlist can help bring about desired body language and facial expressions.<br/><br/>The sound isn’t great but it’s very, very good, with a prominent midrange and inoffensive treble with sufficient baritone and bass notes. It’s been tuned well for its size and should work well with most any genre of music. Despite being designed and advertised as “360 degree sound,” the tweeter is clearly front-biased while either a port or passive radiator is rear-biased.<br/><br/>Listening to Duffy “Rockferry” and Caro Emerald “Deleted Scenes From the Cutting Room Floor” both sound great. I’m not ashamed to break this out for a studio portrait or conceptual art shoot.<br/><br/>The buttons could be better labeled with the industry standard rather than proprietary choices, but once you figure it out, it’s fine. I don’t need the water resistance but it’s nice knowing it’s durable. The exterior of my Triple Black unit is delightfully understated. Battery life is serviceable… I’d expect a unit of this size to have at least double the advertised runtime, so a charging base is already in the shopping cart. The lack of USB-C quick charging, especially in this latest, version II release is a huge letdown.<br/><br/>The inclusion of a 1/4”-20 thread in the base, the standard thread for photography, is a huge boon, especially for photographers and using while outdoors as it can easily be mounted on a tripod or light stand for better sound performance.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it all comes back to sound. It’s far better balanced than the Beats Pill and is able to be played at full volume, unlike the Beats, of which the bass heavy tuning causes the full range drivers to rattle and flutter at full blast. While the Revolve II is clearly directionally biased, it’s not as bad as unidirectional speakers like the Beats Pill. I’m able to set this up on a tripod in the studio, connect Apple Music, set volume to half and never have to touch it again as the sound is delivered in all directions.<br/><br/>For the price, it’s one of the better portable BT speakers available. If you need more volume and higher fidelity, I’d recommend the Plus version, as it is large enough to accept Bose’s signature tuning and does sound better overall. However, for my purposes, the non-Plus version fits perfectly in my camera bag, alongside my lenses, making it perfect for studio and on-location use.<br/><br/>It’s the best collection of compromises for the price point and sounds almost as good as it looks. The sound is actually so mid-focused and clean, I’m considering buying a second one to use in stereo with my iMac, just plucking one off it’s charging base whenever I head out to the studio or location.<br/><br/>If you want a $200 portable BT speaker, you’d be crazy to buy anything besides this, unless you’re an uncompromising bass head. If that’s the case, buy a Sony and avoid the Beats Pill.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace an Emeet Luna that did not live up to my expectations, and this Jabra is exactly what I was looking for.  I needed one of these devices--Emeet Luna or Jabra Speak 710--to do three things: (1) connect to my computer for use with Webex, (2) connect to my mobile phone for higher quality phone conversations, and (3) transition between these uses seamlessly. Though Emeet Luna is one-third the cost of Jabra Speak 710, the lower price of the Emeet is irrelevant to me because it did not accomplish the three things I was looking for. Jabra Speak 710 did.<br/><br/>The biggest short fall on the Emeet was with number 3. Even when I had it connected to computer through the USB, connecting it to my phone would disconnect it from the computer, and vice versa. So I had to keep the Emeet connected to my computer, and if I wanted to use it for a phone call, I had to go into my phone settings and connect it to the phone manually. Besides being a pain to do this every time I needed to make a call, I simply couldn't get it connected to the phone fast enough before answering when people called me. Additionally, the Emeet would shut off when I put my computer to sleep and would not turn back on automatically when I woke the computer up.  So every day, I had to turn the speaker on by holding down the button on the speaker. That's all to say that the Emeet did not give me the experience I expected and simply didn't work for what I needed it.<br/><br/>I also had an issue with number 1, because the Emeet would cut out and have static and interference during video calls (something I’ve never had an issue with using other speakers, including the now the 710).<br/><br/>Jabra Speak 710, on the other hand, stays connected to my computer (through the USB) and my phone (through Bluetooth) at the same time. When I turn off my computer (or put it to sleep), Jabra Speak 710 automatically shuts off and disconnects from my phone. This is perfect because when I shut off my computer, I’m done working and don’t need the speaker phone anymore. The next day when I turn on my computer, Jabra Speak 710 automatically turns on, connects to the computer, AND connects to my phone. So I can use it for a video conference, and as soon as I get off the video conference, if someone calls me, I can hit the answer-phone button on the Jabra Speak 710, and boom, it’s like I’m talking on my speaker phone back in the office.<br/><br/>A few other small distinguishing characteristics that also help explain the difference in price. Jabra Speak 710 is much higher quality. It looks better and feels better to use. The Speak 710 has a nice stand so that the speaker can face you. The speaker on the 710 also seems ten times better than the Luna; I actually enjoy listening to music on it, whereas the Luna did not sound good for music.<br/><br/>In short, make sure you’re getting something that will actually meet your needs.<br/><br/>Another caution about the Luna: I got a card with it offering a $10 gift card for writing a review. Whatever the intent of these types of things are, people tend to write five-star reviews when trying to get the gift cards, sometimes even when the product doesn’t deserve it. So I bet the Luna is overrated, and it certainly seemed that way to me.</span>

<span>I have a reputation among friends, associates, family for doing a deep dive and researching the field when choosing new products. I like to understand the differences between products, state of the art, etc., and generally be an informed buyer. I've also been in "tech" for more than 35 years, with roles from hands on through CIO and CTO, so I've got a lot of experience researching and choosing products, whether for one person or thousands.  In short: I tend to be a picky shopper. I researched the field here, and think I've found a winner.<br/><br/>At this point in my career, I'm traveling weekly, and I'm meeting -- either in person or remote -- with numerous people each week. Conference calls are the norm, and may involve dozens of people, conference rooms with poor equipment, offices with dreadful 15 year old "speakerphones", hotel rooms, working from my home office, etc. One of the most frustrating experiences is trying to participate in a mission critical conference call when 1) I can barely hear or understand the folks at the other end, and 2) they can't hear and understand me unless I lean over a mic and raise my voice. Cell phone "speakerphones" may be acceptable in an emergency, but haven't proven adequate for routine use.<br/><br/>I had recently research Bluetooth speakers for use primarily as audio / music listening speakers (for use, e.g., with Google Play Music from my phone). I researched and auditioned many: Bose, Cambridge, JBL, Shark, Amazon, Phillips, Anker, Jambox, etc. I narrowed it down to those with speakerphone capability, thinking I'd satisfy that need along with the media speaker requirement. After a LOT of research and live auditions, I settled on Nyne Bass, and couldn't be happier with it -- as a media speaker - truly amazing in all respects: sound is stunningly good - even outdoors, and both battery life and bluetooth handling are excellent. Unfortunately, it's only mediocre when turning a phone into a speakerphone, and often quite disappointing -- and I've tried out colleague's products like Jambox for the same purpose, and also found them disappointing. So -- I went on the hunt for a "real" business quality Bluetooth speakerphone.<br/><br/>After much research, I homed in on Jabra, and the 510+ looked most promising after reading a LOT of reviews. Buying via Amazon Prime, I knew I had no risk, so I place the order -- and had the package on my desk about 36 hours later. Once again -- kudos to Amazon Prime and the vendors that work with Amazon in this program.<br/><br/>The product is perfectly packaged, and beautifully made. It appears to be about 4.5" in diameter, and about 1.25" high when sitting flat on a desk or table. It is a gorgeous, professional grade piece of tech with excellent fit and finish and features. It comes with a neoprene zipper case, the USB cord wraps around the body and tucks into a groove that also holds the cable end in place. Incredibly well thought out and executed.<br/><br/>This model can be connected to a phone or laptop via bluetooth, and to a laptop via USB cable. It doesn't come with its own charging brick, but the USB cable can charge from any standard 1A or higher brick. It takes a while for a full charge, but once charged, I can use it all day and into the night, and the charge is only partially depleted.<br/><br/>Sound quality is absolutely spectacular for the purpose. I can place this on a table or desk in a room with a dozen people at distances from 3 ft to 15 ft or more, and they are all picked up and easily understand by people at the other end of the call. What comes out of the speaker is superb as well: I'm often on the receiving end of a conference call with two dozen people, all different sound environments and volume levels, and half a dozen international accents -- and this speaker yields clear audio rivaling $400 or $500 Polycom and Cisco equipment (no exaggeration). This is so good, in fact, that I've taken to turning it on when sitting in my office at my current client's site, and using it in favor of the brand new Cisco equipment installed there. It's a better experience.<br/><br/>The controls around the perimeter are all touch controls -- no physical buttons to degrade, and they work perfectly. Power, answer / hang up, volume up/down, bluetooth (on/off/pair), mute, battery (to check battery charge level). There are a serious of LEDs around the perimeter of the speaker that are almost invisible when off, but light up as needed to indicate function, e.g., Bluetooth connected, power on, volume level and battery life (number of lights on out of ten around the perimeter), etc. Audio prompts walk you through pairing, connection status, etc -- and these can be turned on and off via preferences.<br/><br/>The firmware is easily upgradeable via the USB cable and downloadable PC application. I haven't had need to use the app yet, but it provides deeper control over options and connection to services like Lync. This also provides support for soft phones: this "510+ MS edition" is optimized for Microsoft products like Lync -- the other 510+ is, I believe, aimed more at other soft phone products like Cisco.<br/><br/>All in all: a beautifully designed, engineered and implemented product. Every now and then you trip across a gem that defines state of the art in its category - and I believe this qualifies. As you might guess, I'm delighted with this product.</span>

<span>I started searching for a wireless bluetooth speakers to use for conference calls/video calls which occupy. most of my day during our current work-from-home status. While my office uses Skype for Business and is migrating to Microsoft Teams, we also have videoconferences on GoToMeeting, Webex, Zoom and others. Based on those needs and not wanting to spend a tremendous amount of money, I decided to buy the Jabra Speak 510 especially after a colleague told me he had been using it with good results.<br/><br/>Delivery was swift and I excitedly connected the speaker via Bluetooth to Dell 7290. Unfortunately, my colleagues complained that my voice was hard to hear and somewhat garbled. Thus began my interactions with the Jabra Support team. The details follow below but the bottom line is that I was extremely pleased with both the Jabra telephone support and email responsiveness. After following the steps outlined below, I have now used the device without any issues for the past week and I am very satisfied with the product.<br/><br/>First steps suggested by Jabra Support:<br/>1. Make sure  install the latest firmware through Jabra Direct software before using the device.<br/>2. Jabra does NOT recommend using Bluetooth to connect to a computer; they strongly recommended to connect the Jabra device via USB only.<br/>3. While speaking to Jabra Support via phone, we also reviewed my audio settings on the Dell laptop including sensitivity of the microphone.<br/><br/>**These first three steps suggested by Jabra Support did improve the sound of my voice and colleagues no longer complained. However, I started hearing some periodic crackling and interruption of audio for about 2 seconds very intermittently. It sounded like interference so I moved all of my other devices and cell phone away from the Jabra but the audio problems persisted.<br/><br/>So, I called Jabra Support again after an exchange of emails to make sure I was not using a USB hub because they recommend against that, too. During the phone call, we reviewed several options including trying a different USB port and trying a different computer. And, if that didn't work, Jabra Support agreed that they would replace the device.<br/><br/>Next steps:<br/>4. I tried a different USB port on the Dell. Same problem.<br/>5. My personal computer is a MacBook Pro 2017 (15") which only has USB-C ports. So, contrary to Jabra's advice, I used the Jabra with my MacBook (Zoom) using a USB hub not expecting it to work. However, the device worked flawlessly - good sound on my end; no issues with my voice on the other end.<br/>6. Therefore, I decided to try the USB-C hub with the Dell (which also has a USB-C connection). And...the microphone and speaker are working very well; I've had no complaints from my colleagues and there have been no audio issues.<br/>7. I've also used the USB option with my iPhone and that works well - no issues. To be clear, you can't stand 5 feet away from the device and expect people to hear you. However, if it's on your desk and you are sitting, it works fine.<br/><br/>Using this set up for the past 3-4 days, I've had multiple calls and videoconferences using Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, GoToMeetings, Zoom and Webex. The integration with the mute button only seems to work for Skype and Microsoft Teams (i.e., setting mute on the Jabra device turns the appropriate icon on the screen to "mute"). However, it's pretty easy to know when you're on mute with the Jabra device (red LEDs around the speaker) so even if the icon on the screen isn't showing mute, when the Jabra is muted, you should be "safe."<br/><br/>I haven't tested the battery life fully but it seems to be good. Volume is definitely sufficient. It's not intended to be used for music but for a quick interlude between meetings, it's adequate. I have used the smart button the device with Siri on my iPhone 11 Pro and it works well. The device can be connected to your computer via USB and via your phone via Bluetooth at the same time and it seems the range for the Bluetooth connection is surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Bottom line - I was very close to returning the Jabra 510. However, the excellent support from Jabra and a little experimentation paid off. The Jabra 510 is now a very welcome and comfortable option to the various Bluetooth headsets and other wired headsets I have tried.</span>

<span>Speakers are obviously subjective. JBL Extreme and similar JBL smaller speakers are outlandishly overpriced, the Extreme 3 almost $400 retail and still usually above or around $300 as I write this review. The Extreme 2 is comparable in price to this speaker, I own the E2, like it don't love it, and was torn between getting a second Extreme 2 to use 2 at once, or the Sony. The Sony has newer Bluetooth, lights, adjustable EQ, USB-C charging, etc. Can't ignore that value proposition. But the main reason I got the Sony is sound was supposedly better. It is. Voices and non-guttural music are noticeably clearer than on JBL right out of box. This includes classical music, Enya, and voices on TV shows. JBLs are certainly better for loud rap, but I'll take the modest hit in loudness for superior and more balanced sound and the far better feature set--especially ability to tweak sound via EQ.</span>

<span>I was in the market for a new speaker since the one I had seems to drop out when there is silence for any amount of time, makes audio books really hard to listen to. I work somewhere that i am locked up in a car for my whole shift and we don't have access to the audio system of the car as the software on the cars has been heavily modified and that audio system is used for system prompts and such. We are allowed to use Bluetooth speakers though.<br/><br/>I have heard some who have speakers that can get louder than this one, but not without very apparent distortion. Most people seem to be of the mindset that louder = better and I am here to tell you that is objectively false. I was first looking at the JBL brand as they came highly recommended only to find out they are almost all MONO now. Like they literally made their whole line up worse!!! You may be someone who says that it shouldn't matter since these speakers aren't separated much anyway. Well, I am here to say this is false, it makes a HUGE difference. This SONY offering has surprisingly wide stereo separation and clean clear delineation between sides. I was actually quite blown away by this.<br/><br/>Yes this speaker is kinda big and pretty heavy. If I had known I may not have ordered this model just for portability reasons, but I will tell you here that I don't regret my purchase one bit!<br/><br/>The app, well, I can take it or leave it. It doesn't really do anything for you over that what you can do on the speaker itself but it is a convenient way to change settings where the button for it is behind the charging door and a little out of the way to get to. You also do get equalization. If you are like me, I prefer a flat frequency response so I don't use it but it is a nice to have when say, a podcast isn't very well mixed.<br/><br/>If I HAD to come up with a cons list for this guy it would probably be that it could use a bigger battery. You can use the speaker as a battery bank which is sweet but not really useful with the run time you get out of a full charge. This having been said it is still longer than most of the very large BT speakers in the same class out there. You can also give it way better longevity by not using the bass boosting mode. Audio books and podcasts also use way less power overall.<br/><br/>Anyways, just buy it. Yes it isn't cheap but you won't be disappointed!</span>
