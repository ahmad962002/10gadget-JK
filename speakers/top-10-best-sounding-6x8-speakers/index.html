<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm no audiophile, but I love good tunes. I wanted to get the best bang for my buck when I upgraded my truck stereo. Many hours were spent reviewing speakers and amps. I was torn between the Rockford Fosgate P1683 and these Kappa speakers. A buddy has the RF P1683s and I like them. The deciding factor was the majority of the reviews used words like clean and clear music. The Kappas were a bit more expensive but in my ears, well worth it.  They are the top end of the "entry level upgrade" speakers. The next level is getting int Hertz and Focal type speakers. I didn't have the funds for those. I need to drop a compliment for the amp I went with. I had never heard of the brand Zapco.  While researching amps ( I was torn between  Alpine and Rockford Fosgate, leaning towards Alpine) I stumbled upon a review that talked highly of the Zapco ST-4X SQ amp. So I did some research on it. Turns out Zapco is a leading name int eh high end amp market. They realized there is a market in the entry level upgrades and created some amps in that area.  Bottom line is this turned out to be a bomb combo! I highly recommend both!</span>

<span>These speakers are amazing! They replaced my stock speakers of 20+ years and sound way better than stock. Hooked an amp up to them and they came to life!! The sound is incredible. Highly recommend!</span>

<span>I put these in a Ford Ranger, that already had a Kicker 12 and a set of 5 1/4 Infinity reference components in the back. I replaced a set of Reference 6x8 with these. Kappa series. I started with my original, 50x4 rms Amp. It was louder and clearer than the reference model speakers.  However, when I changed the Amp, and doubled the power to 100 watts rms, WOW! These actually put out some BASS! I couldn't believe how loud they got. They pound the bass! The drums! I used to really push my sub to fill in the bass. Not now. These HIT! I paid about $100 for them. Quite a bit off msrp. Best $100 I ever spent!</span>

<span>What can I say, I've been using Rockford Fosgate stuff since somewhere around 1988-89. They've always made great speakers and amplifiers and these are no different. It's been quite a while since I purchased any kind of upgrade for a factory stereo and these did exactly what I needed them to do. I've had my 2003 Toyota Tundra Access Cab for 3 years and have always just run the factory speakers because they sounded decent enough. I decided to upgrade just the rear to see how good it would sound with the idea of maybe adding more in the future. These seemed like a good basis of a fairly modest system where I just fill all the factory locations with decent speakers and run every thing off the factory amp. Nothing too complicated and I'm not entering in to any audio competitions anytime soon, so I don't need to go all in. I decided on the 3-way coaxial 6.5" over the 2-way because I wanted the extra mid-range coming from the rear of the truck.<br/><br/>As far as what Amazon recommends for a 2003 Tundra in the rear door locations, get the 6.75" and not the 6.5" like I did. I'm okay with my decision to have gone with the 6.5" but three scree holes match up with the factory locations and one has to be screwed in on the exterior of the speaker's metal rim. It's okay for me, I managed to deal with it accordingly. The 6.75" is the same speaker just in a little bit larger circular mounting ring to give you a few more options. This should have been my choice, but, again, I am perfectly happy with the 3-Way over the 2-Way. I also used fiber fill to take up space inside the door panel. Specs call for .46 cubic feet of VAS. There must be at least a solid 2+ cubic feet in a Tundra rear door. They're cavernous with no real obstructions, just an internal support/structure rail. I filled the void and it definitely helped keep those cones under control at higher volumes.<br/><br/>These are also 4 Ohm compared to the factory 6 Ohm speakers. That means they're seeing a little more power than what the others were. I had discovered that the left rear factory speaker was blown and I had hoped it wasn't an amp channel. Turns out it *was* a blown factory speaker and the difference is incredible. I was thinking of getting sub for under the seat but I'm seriously considering not doing that now. Sound dampening in the doors along with two fresh poly 6.5 cones provides more than enough low end in a truck cab for an aging car audio enthusiast like me. It makes me want to invest in the two way component system for the doors, swap those out and call it good. Nice job, Rockford, for providing an affordable, quality upgrade option. Highly recommended and would buy again!</span>

<span>The bad news? I have a 21-year-old Lexus. The good news? It's only got 100,000 miles and is in incredible condition! BUT - my old speakers needed replacing. So, I researched speakers, specs, prices, (Crutchfield) and customer reviews - And I found these R169s and combined them with new 6.5 Pioneers in my doors up front. Happy? Yer darned tootin' I'm happy! I grew up with hi-fidelity music around my home. My dad was an opera singer and my brother played in bands from the time I was 3-years-old -- we had music playing around the house 18 hours a day. So, I was definitely missing the formerly decent sound from my car's factory installed premium sound system and speakers. Enter Rockford! I purchased these recently and had them professionally installed. When I first drove away, I was a little saddened that they didn't quite bring the sound I'd hoped for - BUT - I realized that though I had a premium (and well-balanced) sound system for its time - my old-ass system didn't really bring the Uuumpf needed to support and bring out the best in these speakers. I thought of replacing my stereo system, but it's an old car, with only a cassette deck and radio, premium though they may be. THEN - I remembered the new portable earbud amp (Fiio's E12A) I gave myself for Christmas - OMG!!! I connected it to my iPhone and ran it through an old cassette adapter to my deck. The Fiio boosted my signal and PRESTO - it brought the speakers to life! These Rockford Fosgates are everything I'd hoped they would be! Combined with the Pioneers up front - and my iPhone library recorded in Apple Lossless files - DANG! Magnificent! Do I get the full sound spectrum I'd get with an added subwoofer? No. But with these great speakers, Apple Lossless files, and the richly amazing sound-field reproduction from my Fiio E12A portable amp - I've got everything I'd hoped for when buying these speakers for my old Lexus. And when I turn off the car, I carry that great sound with me in my pocket as I browse the aisles at Costco listening to my Monster Diesel earbuds, which were great to begin with - astonishing with the addition of my Fiio portable power amp. Sooooo, I've actually just reviewed two, no three, items here -- the Fiio E12A, Monster Diesels, and the Rockford R169s - but bottom line -- these speakers sound fantastic! Steely Dan AJA remastered? Like you're in the studio surrounded by the musicians. U2's Bad from Wide Awake in America? Like you're perfectly placed in the crowd. Radiohead's Everything In Its Right Place wraps you in its lush sound field. I could blab on, but I think you get the message. So great to have my music sounding great again while driving around town! Hope this helps you in your decision making process. If my review helps you decide at all - please give me a CLICK and a LIKE. Thanks!</span>

<span>Good speaker. Not audiophile level, but good enough to replace an OEM speaker in a car or truck.  I have a 95 Ford E-350 Chassis RV and the OEM speakers got old and blew.  I replaced them with this set and they more than adequately replicated the original sound quality.  Overall, I'm happy and would buy again.  I'm not giving 5 stars, but only because they do not come with OEM adapters for the wiring. I would have liked a direct fit, but for the price I didn't mind doing a bit of solder work to properly adapt them.</span>

<span>I seldom write reviews unless something is either really bad or really good.  I needed affordable yet "decent" sound quality replacement speakers for a Lincoln Town Car (non-amplified, no sub-woofer, with 4x55W head unit power).  These speakers have more than satisfied my needs, and they have surprisingly smooth/flat-response sound with "tasteful" and accurate highs (because of the silk dome tweeters).  NOTE, if you are a "rap/hip hop/house" or whatever "shake-the rust-off-the-bottom-of-your-pimpmobile with bass" type listener (or if you ever find yourself setting up your graphic EQ's with a default "smiley face" on the sliders because you don't know any better) YOU DON'T WANT THESE... but if you are an "enjoy smooth/accurate sound at up to medium-loud volumes"  listener of regular pop/rock music, orchestral, jazz, talk radio or even more rambunctious music at controlled volume levels, then these are a GREAT affordable option.  Keep in mind these speakers are spec'd to only respond well down to 56hz, so DON'T try to put rap/house/drum &amp; bass THUMP'in music through them or you'll blow them out.  By the way, 60W RMS / 180W max on these $50 speakers?  IMPRESSIVE.  My new Sony DSX-700B head (55W per channel) unit has a cool menu where you can apply "HPF" (high pass filter) at a couple different frequency points (and leave the super-low frequencies to a specialized subwoofer if you have one.)  I applied the 80hz cut-off point (at my moderate volume listing levels these speakers easily handle 80hz) to limit any stray "sub-woofer" type bass notes in the music from getting to the speakers and maybe abusing them or splattering the sound out.  I really gives them a NICE tight/smooth/realistic/controlled/focused low-end that is right for my kind of music.  If you then have a separate sub woofer system in your car (I don't) they would be able to play heavier-bass type music at reasonable volume levels.  I've paid more for speakers in the past that didn't have the smooth/flat response quality of sound these have.  The silk dome tweeters in these speakers are REALLY smooth and tasteful sounding.  These speakers come with a pair of cables with spade/sleeve slip on connectors for the speaker terminals that you can splice onto your car's speaker wires with wire nuts or crimp connectors (but soldering is best)  If your car has proprietary speaker connectors and don't want to cut them off, search up some adapter cables that will be plug-n-play with your car and maybe solder the ends directly to the terminals of the speaker.  A brief note about small full range speakers... (I did 20 years in commercial sound system installation in auditoriums/theaters etc.)... Don't always assume that "more is better" in the sense that "triaxial" or "quad axial" car speakers are going to sound better than coaxials like these (2-way with woofer &amp; tweeter).  Typically those tri/quad axial speakers (especially those with metal foil tweeter domes) are HARSH, metallic and unnaturally loud in the highs (in my opinion giving the auditory equivalent of pouring rubbing alcohol on an open wound) and typically the high frequencies are unnaturally boosted way above the mid-range frequencies and it's not possible to tone them down with your treble knob or graphic EQ.  A tri or quad axial setup is fine in a large PA speaker with an 18" &amp; 10" speakers, a horn driver and some piezo tweeters for the crispies, but putting 2 or 3 different tweeters above a small car speaker is just a sales gimmick and will lead to more phase cancellation in the sound.  A good set of 2-way/coaxials (woofer and tweeter) will typically give you a smoother, flatter-response sound that you won't have to have a 15 band EQ to tone down.  OH AND ANOTHER THING...because these do have an impressive POWER HANDLING spec (60W/180W), this translates to them being a little less "efficient" (more power handling generally means the speakers have a heavier, more powerful magnet for the voice-coil, and the speaker cone is thicker and heavier, so the same amount of electrical energy won't throw the speaker back and forth as aggressively as a lighter magnet/coil/speaker cone would.  Therefor these speakers may not seem quite as loud as your original speakers (if they were lighter more "efficient" ones), however you will likely have BETTER AND SMOOTHER sound and better speaker durability due to that small step down in efficiency.  In my car these speakers were about 20% less loud than the original cheap factory speakers, but the sound is WAY WAY WAY better quality and the system will still go louder than I'd ever use it anyway.  VERY GOOD AFFORDABLE SPEAKERS for the right application and right listener.  RECOMMENDED.</span>

<span> Upgraded the front two speakers in my Accord and the difference is night and day. The magnets on these are huge compared to the magnets the size of a quarter on the stock speakers. The full range is crystal clear and deep. My accord already had stock tweeters on the doors but adding a full range speaker with the tweeters made everything come together so nicely. The bass is deep and clean, I’m sure you could get more bass with an amp. But with just running these on the stock system, they perform extremely well. So happy with the front speakers that I’ll probably but another set to replace my rear speaker. Overall amazing clean speakers you won’t regret installing</span>

The woofer cone is made of Carbon and Mica reinforced polypropylene for rigidity, low-frequency responsiveness, and weather resistance. There is a midrange cone to achieve sound otherwise hidden when listening. The two dome tweeters add in the high-frequency details to provide music enjoyment.

<span>Tossed two sets of these in my Ranger to replace the stock units, highs are noticeably clearer and bass seems to get a little lower. I am not running them through an amp, just straight off the output of my deh-s5100bt head unit through factory wiring. I am sure if I spent a little time to add some more insulation and play with the equalizer settings I could get a good bit more out of them, but for now I am happy with where I am at.

<span>These speakers are a wonderful choice to up grade from the factory speakers for a cheaper price! They put out way more power than factory and can handle louder music with no issues! For me i was not too worried about the bass quality because i have a 12in sun in my truck already. So i really cant tell a difference in the bass but the mids and built in tweeters are amazing!! Highly recommended.</span>

<span>Oh Lord do these things hit. Installed all 4 in my 2004 lincoln ls today and they are sweet.  I had a upgraded stereo installed and the factory speaker sounded like crap with it so i decided to upgrade it all. Super happy with purchase,  even though i know my girlfriend won't be happy. I don't know what will happen first,  me go deaf or police give me a ticket. I was thinking about getting a sub to before I installed these but I now know that I don't need one. I can finally listen to my music with the volume all the way up. Try get low by do snake or gentleman by psy, they go hard</span>

<span>They sound is as good as  more expensive kickers with a new Kenwood head unit in an F 150 with subwoofers and amp, and I put these Rockford Fosgate  Punch in a 2013 mustang with stock head unit ( which is junk). When I change the head unit , they will sound excellent. Anyhow, speakers sound great , but must solder adapters and trim plastic speaker mount. Thinking I should have gotten the same speakers but they have only 4 small mounting holes instead of all the plastic. but, just can't beat the sound. very happy with them.</span>

The ideal balance of a high end car audio system requires the ideal mix of speaker tone, deep bass impact and clean undistorted power.

Formula Series 2-Way Coaxial Speakers have aluminum dome tweeters with polypropylene cone speakers. Peak handling power on these 6 in. x 9 in. car speakers is 150 watts; RMS is 75 watts.

<span>I got the 6x9 MB Quarts for the front doors and 6.5 speakers for the back panels.  First impression after install - Great value for the price with good overall sound quality.  Net, these are not high end speakers and I decided to try out the MB Quart brand for the first time.  I was fairly impressed but not blown away.  My goal was to replace the OEM speakers in my convertible but I did not want to replace the factory head unit or add an amp. I am super happy with my decision to go with MB Quarts.  For reference, I had JBL, Infinity, JVC, Sony, Pioneer in other cars which I owned. I would rate MB Quarts on par with JVC, Pioneer &amp; Sony and below JBL and Infinity. Again, if you are looking for a value priced speaker set, this is a wonderful choice.  No regrets.  I would buy again.</span>

<span>Mb Quart has certainly changed,  once was an audio files choice for high end equipment has now made no name electronics seem like a better choice,  I was very disappointed when I heard these speakers paired with an Mb Quart 400 Watt 4 channel amp, the sound quality was not there,  Tinniness of the tweeter was heart stopping because I was expecting to hear very crisp, full sounding mid's and deep bass but there was none, in fact my factory speakers sounded better,  I would not recommend these speakers to anyone who wants concert sound.</span>
