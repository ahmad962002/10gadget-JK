<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This suitcase player let my son decide if collecting vinyl was something he wanted to do. Turns out, it was. He quickly out grew this record player. I upgraded him to a Fluance turntable for his birthday. Now, my youngest has taken over this suitcase player and bought her first vinyl record.<br/><br/>Works great, looks good, sounds decent enough to make for a fun experience. Using external powered speakers works and sounds better. Uses ceramic needles, comes with two, changed them out after every 100 hours of use. Had one album that skipped with this player but does not with the Fluance.<br/><br/>If you are not chasing audiophile sound, and just want to enjoy some vinyls, this turntable is a great starting point.</span>

<span>So so happy with the record player! My daughters and I recently went on a vacation where there was a record player and they fell in love. They're 9 and 10, so it was a bit foreign to them! Unboxed tonight and completely enjoying it. Sound quality is fantastic! One thing to note...it comes with a replacement needle and I needed to change the needle immediately. I tried to records and both started skipping after the first song. It occurred to me that it may be the needle, and it was! Phew. Super happy and excited about this purchase.</span>

<span>Let's get the important perspective part out of the way. So, y'know, you know where this is coming from. First, I'm not a vinyl fan (junkie, snob, nut) in that I do like digital music better. To me, just better. Not arguing. Just sayin'.<br/><br/>I also do not know anything about modern turntables, or sound systems, or what-not.  Complete noob and enjoy my ignorance in this case because my brain is already full. Thus, I need music constantly to maintain sanity. Life should have a soundtrack.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>There is something wonderful (and, okay granted, a bit magical) about listening to a record that's been mastered for that purpose on a turntable like the Victrola Vintage. A lot of indie/alt bands do it, and this Victora brings back those childhood memories of listening to "records" over and over until you wore grooves in them because you couldn't afford a new needle. Yeah, we're talking the 80s, a paper route for income, and I'm dating myself.<br/><br/>The sound quality is quite good for the tiny speakers included. It's not great, mind you. It's not even wicked good. It is good, though, and totally radical dude. It surpassed my expectations, and I was surprised that the little speakers could handle loud. Not blow your face off loud, but loud enough to tick off the neighbors, so it's sufficient (if you don't like your neighbors, that is... ahem...) or play well in a room full of people at a small party as background music.  It pops up a notch or ten when you add a tube amp and a good set of studio monitors. But let's face it, that defeats the purpose.<br/><br/>I didn't test the Bluetooth feature. Why would you need Bluetooth on a record player? Um, because everything is better with Bluetooth, of course. You don't need it, you won't use it, but there it is. So, good.<br/><br/>(Okay, this unit is supposed to be portable, but I prefer to think of it as storable. But let's pretend you're out and about in the wild and all you have is your cell, a power source(?), and your Victrola. You want to play some tunes but phones suck at that. There ya go: Bluetooth.)<br/><br/>It plays 33s, 45s, and 78s. It's easy to store and carry around. The needle cartridges are easy to get. It has a headphone jack and RCA jacks out. It sounds good as is. Everything you need to enjoy music old-school style.<br/><br/>Mainly, though, the Victrola Vintage Portable Suitcase Record Player is perfect for putting on a nice chunk of vinyl in the background and letting the nostalgia wash over you as you work or just relax with a nice glass of wine.<br/><br/>In short, I love it. If you just want something to play vinyl on occasionally and want your own personal way-back machine, I don't see how you can go wrong here.<br/><br/>Two enthusiastic thumbs up. Fine nostalgic fun!</span>

<span>Been looking for an extremely easy record player to play some records with my kids and we found the perfect one! The. Re-Spin is the perfect straight-out-of-the-box turntable.  We love it!

<span>Update 3/20/21: It's been a few months and no problems. Works just like the day I got it.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Update: Nice! I got some really quick answers, including from the seller, about the one thing that I was unsure about. Short version-- the turntable itself will be a little loose when all set up; this is normal/ideal. I'm really pleased with this unit and the fast response I got. Thanks much!<br/><br/>I got this along with the three-year warranty, since reviews are indicating this product is fragile/prone to some issues. I only had one issue, which I'll detail toward the end of this review. I've asked a question relevant to that point, and will update my review to reflect what I hear back.<br/><br/>So first of all, the unit I received appeared intact/undamaged from what I can tell and looking at the packaging. The whole thing is wrapped in plastic and ships in a box that says what it is on the outside. It comes with RCA cables. The instruction manual says it ALSO includes a 3mm aux out cable, but I didn't see that inside-- just the RCA cables. I don't see anything else that confirms that the cable should be in there, so, I'm guessing it's just a mistake with the manual print rather than a missing item.<br/><br/>It probably doesn't need saying, but just in case, the lid does not open fully, but if you push the joint forward (toward you), it will lock open in place. You can close the lid without problems. It is open in the back to allow more space for records, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>I checked the FM, phono (vinyl), CD, and bluetooth functions. All of these worked perfectly. Note that the turntable will not spin until and unless you move the needle arm over to the record. Also don't throw out the needle protector! The instructions mention to keep these, but if I hadn't read it and hadn't been thinking, I would've tossed it.<br/><br/>The CD has some limited programmability-- basically you can choose what order to play tracks in, on a disc. Nothing else really to mention on that function.<br/><br/>The bluetooth worked perfect. I've had some devices be annoying and finicky whether they want to be recognized, and this wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>Sound quality is all right-- if you're looking for something super loud with heavy bass, you'll want to plug in other speakers. I can't stand the "blow the dust off the speakers!" appeal, so this is fine for me. It does sound better when the unit is at least 8-10 feet away, sounds more balanced. For its size and for being an all-in-one, this is both acceptable and perfectly decent, no complaints. I'm used to listening from a pair of computer speakers when I don't have headphones on, so this is fine.<br/><br/>My one issue-- (Reminder: Got an answer and this is fine apparently!)<br/>The turntable comes with a screw which is unscrewed to help keep the unit safe during transportation. The instructions say to TIGHTEN this screw before playing. I've seen some reviewers who I am guessing are confused, since they've loosened it instead. I was able to tighten this screw pretty easily, but the issue I have is that the turntable itself is not REALLY secure from doing this. You can still move it maybe 8mm/a third of an inch or so, just... around. This includes the turntable AND the arm, which I would expect to be, you know, screwed and fixed in place, immobile. It is not either of these things-- and it moves if I need to adjust the speed or anything like that. Now, when the record's playing, it seems totally fine, and it does play the records fine, but I was taken aback by this. I'm waiting on an answer to find out how problematic this is. For now, it seems to be working fine, but it definitely gives me pause, so to speak.<br/><br/>So, that aside, I haven't had any OTHER problems, and I'm happy with it. If it turns out that's just normal, I can't say it seems like a sensible part of the design to me, but as long as it works, that's fine. Overall this is a very attractive, pleasant-sounding, versatile player. We'll see if it lasts-- I'll update this review periodically to reflect any problems that arise, or lack thereof.</span>

<span>I was a little leery buying this because of the numerous bad reviews but I haven’t had many problems with it so far, now 2 months in. However, I had to knock off 1 star because of its seeming inability to play 45 RPM records. It may just be a setting I need to adjust but they will play almost to the end and then just stop. 33 RPM records play fine so I assume it has something to do with the fact there is less dead time at the end of 45’s and that is why it stops before the end. Anyway, it’s just a minor annoyance and I can always play my 45’s on my old record player if I want to.  Other than that, I have no problem with this unit at all.</span>

<span>It does play like a standard old record player and the built-in speakers are ok for audio quality.  But if you wish to record your LP's to digital it gets dicey.  It's computer connection is a simple USB-A and newer computers, especially Mac's, are using USB-C connections.  External speakers can be connected with old school single prong audio cables.  My Bose speaker has an input jack but the input was inconsistent.<br/><br/>There is NO Bluetooth or WiFi capability on this turntable.  This is probably best used by someone who just wants a basic turntable and has a set of speakers from the 90's lying around.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>As others have noted, the belt is on the wrong part of the pulley. Well, technically the belt is on the pulley, but it should be running on the motor shaft behind the pulley; I have no idea why it's designed this way, but it's easy to flick the belt off the pulley and that fixes the turntable going too fast.  I recommend doing this with a disposable chopstick; something long and straight and non-marring.  You can also pop open the case to figure the whole thing out like I did, but there is little advantage except easier (somewhat) access to the belt and motor.  While I was in there, the wiring prevents easy disassembly, so I clipped the wires to the internal speakers, wires that are soldered at both ends and glued to some kind of sonic bass-response tubes (LOL)... good riddance.  The USB and bluetooth and line-level outputs still work with the internal speakers disabled, and now I don't have to worry about the little baby speakers getting in the way of my stereo playing the same sound.  Overall a good turntable for the money, and while it's not made of the best materials, it's a good beginner turntable.<br/><br/>Also note that the black colored model has an Ash wood style finish on it that isn't clear from the photos.  This is a nice bonus if you have Ash or Hickory, especially black-stained, in the rest of your system.</span>

<span>I needed a compact all-in-one sound system for my living room to put atop a new bookcase. This Victrola 8-in-1 delivered just fine. It contains a record player, CD player, cassette player, FM radio (no AM in mine though some models come with it), Bluetooth connectivity and the capability to record off your Cd's or USB. At only 13 pounds it stands on my bookcase without any fear of damaging it and it looks beautiful - the woodwork is outstanding in my opinion. This is what a retro sound system should look like.<br/><br/>But the real factor is the sound and functionality. First the sound. The sound from all sources is great overall, but I would have hoped for for bass or at least a treble-bass knob to customize the sound so what what you hear is what you get. The bass is not bad by any means but if onw wants more in this area perhaps get external speakers to boost the sound. For my purposes in the room it's in I am satisfied. Note however that the unit comes with a wire antenna and not a metal telescoping one. You will have to adjust the placement to get the best sound.<br/><br/>Now to the remote. it is a bit quirky and here's why. For starters there is no On/Off button on it - you must turn the unit on manually with the power button on the front left. Then after you turn the system on, you must wait a second or two for it to power on before you select what mode you want to listen to. This also applies even when the unit is turned on and you want to switch from one mode to the other. You just have to let the unit breathe so to speak before each function is enabled. Not a big deal to me but you should all know this. Please note that the buttons on the remote are duplicated on the front of the system so you have a choice of how to make it work The remote also has the usual controls for volume and CD function ( FF, reverse, track, pause, mute).<br/><br/>The record player functions just fine - just read the directions first. There is a grip to hold the tonearm in place when not in use - please use this. Also, the tonearm is manual and not automatic so be aware of when the side ends to lift the arm and put it back in the cradle. The stylus seems OK and does not to damage to the records as some have said but I will keep an eye out for this.<br/><br/>The CD player has a tray for the CD which works fine and seems sturdy but if using the remote to get the tray out you must point it directly in front of the tray for it to come out. There is also an eject button in the right front of the unit for this purpose. CDs sound fine.<br/><br/>The radio also sounds great - just know that when you turn it on it will sound at the highest volume level so be prepared. Depending on your reception you may need to adjust the placement of the wire antenna. You decide whether you just move it curled up or whether to unravel it. You should know that you cannot change stations with the remote. You must use the dial in front of the unit for this. Some may not mind this but others may. I just listen to one FM station most of the time so no big deal for me. Again there is no AM on my model.<br/><br/>Bluetooth connectivity is quick and easy with excellent sound quality. The manual says the Bluetooth operates a 30 foot distance from the unit but I have not tried this so I cannot say for sure. As for the cassette player I have not tried it so cannot comment on its functionality. I did not buy this system because of the cassette player so that was not am issue for me.<br/><br/>So to sum up the Victrola 8-in-1 is great unit for the price. The remote will take a little getting used to but should not be a deal breaker. The sound and functionality are just fine for an average size apartment - I can hear it playing clearly from the back of the apartment. So I would say go for it - you should be fine with this unit. And it looks great too.</span>

<span>The finish is brighter than shown in the item pictures, yet a little darker than the "matching" stand sold separately.  I will review that on that item page next.  When I opened the box, the white needle protector was laying on top and when I went to set it up I found the retaining screw unlocked, so this clearly had been opened prior and re-sold.  I wanted a turntable because I held onto the vinyl from my youth as well as having recently acquired some more.  As far as sound quality goes, tinny isn't quite the word.  Sound is sharp.  Bass is nearly non-existent.  I've had $50 Bluetooth speakers with better sound quality, so I'm going to have to do re-arrange some furniture and setup the RCA audio out to my receiver.  This is the only pleasant surprise because other reviewers and the Q&amp;A section only referenced the 3.5mm audio out jack, but there are two RCA connectors on the back.  I wasn't expecting high quality audio, but this is on par with the old suitcase record players back in the day.  I'm not sure if it is a problem with the tone arm or the needle (only have the 1), but on a new and freshly opened LP it randomly skipped.  On the first LP I put on, it didn't skip at all.  I then tried the cassette function and it works.  I don't need the tuner or CD functions and I haven't yet tried the LP to MP3 function yet, but will update this review once I do.</span>

<span> I wanted to get back to playing Vinyl, but the two Record players I have, are no longer working. I thought about getting something more expensive, but truth be told, I'm not willing to dive deep in my wallet at this time for something I'm not going to play a lot.  I prefer to keep it simple and inexpensive. When I came across the black Victrola 8-in-1 unit, I compared it to many other options I was considering. In the end, I opted for the nostalgic style and simplicity of it.  It's a nice added furniture piece as well. Down the road, I'll probably re-invest in a better record player, but for now this works.<br/><br/>My opinion... If you're an audiophile and looking for superior sound, this isn't for you.  You're probably looking for something more expensive. Anyone who is very picky and heavily into sound, will not be satisfy with this, and most likely laugh at this unit.  However, an average listener who isn't looking for bells and whistles, this should be fine. Also, I think those who love the nostalgic look and the simplistic of it, will enjoy it!<br/><br/>I ordered this on a Thursday, and it was shipped to me by Sunday.  (By the way, the expected delivery date was Monday.  What a pleasant surprise to hear a knock at my door on Sunday morning and it was the USPS at the door with the unit!)  I unpacked it, and had it up and running within 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I tried out all formats.  Everything worked just fine with the exception of the record player.  Unfortunately, the needle randomly skates (skips) through songs. I was quite disappointed, and at first I wanted to immediately return it.  Though, I recall when I was a kid, I had similar issues with older record players skipping through songs,, and I remembered that the arm needed an adjustment or to be weighed down slightly.  I recalled, placing a penny on the arm would help keep the needle from skipping. Possibly there might be an adjustment I can make with the arm that I'm not aware of yet, but meanwhile the penny did the trick.  I just taped a penny on the arm, keeping it from falling off.  Records no longer skip!<br/><br/>Bluetooth immediately synced.  CDs and cassettes played smoothly.  As for the speaker/sound, I wasn't expecting anything superior.  Now don't mistake me, I like to experience great sound, but for something as inexpensive as this, I would be fooling myself to think it would deliver superior sound.  Still, the internal speakers fill the room nicely.  I prefer to have more bass mixed in. Even better, something to balance the treble and bass would make this unit sound even better.  That being said, you are able to add external speakers. I had an old pair of Aiwa book speakers wih a SUB-WOOFER that I bought back in early 90's. Sounds terrific with the AIWA external speakers!  (Note: plug external speakers in the back using RCA jacks.  I first tried my external speakers through the head phone jack, and while that worked, the sound is much lower using the head phone jack than the RCA jacks in the back).<br/><br/>I'm giving this unit 4 stars! Granted, I've only had it for a few hours now. The reason I am only giving 4 stars rather 5 is the fact that the needle skips through records. To me, it's not a huge issue since I use the penny hack. However, I've read previous reviews and this was a common complaint among those who bought this unit or similar.  Also, I bought this specifically to play my Vinyl records.  It should just do that without scrambling for a fix.  Still, I know that the penny hack is far less of a hassle than exchanging the unit when I suspect the next unit will probably have the same issue.  I definitely plan to come back and give a review a year later to see if I'm just as content as I am now.<br/><br/>Again, if you're looking for a non-expensive, nostalgic piece of furniture which gives you the option to play various types of audio formats, this may be for you. External speakers definitely enhances the sound experience. I've included a 28 second video that shares the sound with external speakers. Certainly, video doesn't compare being in person, but you get the idea.</span>

<span>So far so good. Only thing is the stylus alignment. It's almost perfect - according to the protractor provided with the instructions book. Can't do better. But for a basic turntable, the sound is pretty good. Upgrading the stylus or the cartridge would not be big difference for me since my vinyls are old - some are from the early 1950's. One bought in the 1980's is a Manitas de Plata' guitar vinyl. Today I hear sounds I never heard before on any of my turntables (last one a great Akai).  Now I hope this Fluance RT81 is always the good turntable I am singing the praise of.</span>

<span>Very nice turntable.<br/>Looks fantastic, has lots of nice features like a switch to lower and raise the needle arm to eliminate scratching.<br/>The internal speakers have a nice, clean sound but they don't have a huge sound.<br/>I've found that connecting to external speakers through the bluetooth is a bit tricky.<br/>If I push the bluetooth out button it searches and doesn't seem to find it the first time regardless of how close the wireless speakers are or the order they are turned on to discovery mode.<br/>If it push the button...wait a second, push it again which turns the searching off (it will begin to then play through the speakers on the turntable), and then push it to search a second time, THEN it will connect.<br/>So a total of 3 pushes of the bluetooth button: One to search and connect, one to stop searching, once more to search and actually connect.<br/>It's a minor thing, takes a second...maybe I'm doing something wrong but I've tried several methods and this is the only way I've been able to get it to connect externally via bluetooth.<br/>Just something to keep in mind.<br/>Otherwise, it's really a fantastic turntable!!<br/>I would definitely buy it again, even with the tricky bluetooth.<br/>It sounds incredible connected to my soundbar!!<br/>The Audio Technica needle cartridge is top notch.</span>

<span>I was looking to replace my old Crosley that I use to bring some vinyl to my log cabin.  I tried a newer model ($69), but the sound was terrible.  Very tinny, no base, awful.  I figured something closer to $100 might be better, so I tried this unit and found it was noticeably better, good enough.  Of course, it sounds better connected to my Bose mini speaker.  It took me a while to figure out how to pair the turntable out to bluetooth.  The trick was to make sure no other bluetooth devices could be found by my speaker, so I shut off bluetooth on my phone and iPad, then paired my speaker to the Victrola.  Worked great.</span>

<span>In order to connect this to a Bluetooth speaker you need a Bluetooth transmitter. I was not aware of that. The speakers aren't terrible so I will manage for the time being. But I wish I had known that so I could have just gotten them both at the same time.</span>

<span>Set up in less than 5 minutes. The sound of the internal speaker is pretty fair. I like it. When I connect it to powered speakers it sounds great! Sending Bluetooth from my phone sounded great, although the range is not huge. I have not experimented with sending audio to Bluetooth headphones yet.<br/>The dust cover has some flaws on it and I wish it was a three-speed player rather than only two, but I am happy.</span>

<span>Perfect as a traveling university student. It's not practical for me to own a hi-fi setup with plenty of bookshelf speakers and surround sound, so I was interested in this record player since I already had my hands on a few high quality bluetooth speakers (namely the JBL Charge 4 &amp; Klipch kmc1). Extremely easy to set up, and the quality of the sound does not feel hindered by using a bluetooth speaker on the other side of my room. The Auto-start and Auto-stop functions are also just the icing on a beautiful cake.<br/>If you are planning on traveling with it like I have been, I have kept a majority of the packing material besides the cardboard box that it actually came in, and that has sufficed nicely.</span>

<span>Great machine for people that want plug and play. Easy to use, the thing has just four buttons, three that make a loud clack when pressed hence, the four stars. (Seriously tho!)<br/><br/>But I still love this player, yes, I have tried to command it to play next before I remember that I’m supposed to be in old-school mode.<br/><br/>But the record player keeps me in the moment, makes me listen to, and start to love all the songs on the album because other than turning it off you have to get to the end of the side. Lol.<br/><br/>Forgot I was reviewing the product, not the record playing experience in general.<br/><br/>Set up was easy. Bluetooth, once set up, you never have to think of it. There’s no lag time at all.<br/><br/>It comes with a gadget for smaller records but, I don’t own any of those so I’m happy.<br/><br/>Yes, you will have to surgically put a few parts together, but that’s the only nerve racking part. I used a YouTube video or one of the reviews on Amazon to put mine together.<br/><br/>The lid does help reduce dust but get yourself a dusting kit.<br/><br/>The felt pad does stick to the record and comes off when I pull the record out but with time I’m learning to gently separate them on removal.<br/><br/>This player will help you start a list of must-have features for your upgrade.<br/><br/>But it sound great, I got everything I expected and more.  I  am glad I am enjoying my record player moments.</span>

<span>I upgraded to this Sony from the ATLP60X that worked very well but just looked a little too basic for me. The Sony is much more sleek and doesn't look nearly as cheap. It works beautifully and the stock cartridge sounds AMAZING with some decent speakers.</span>

<span> This player sounds worlds better than that other thing I had (Victrola portable turntable from Wally World) so I am very happy. When paired with the Sony receiver, you can adjust the phono offset to make it sound so so good. Alone it sounds nice I’m sure but with the receiver though… amazing. So why the 4 stars? Never have I bought a Sony product, and opened it up to find cheap feeling plastic buttons. The buttons feel fake, like this whole thing is a prop or something. The buttons are cheap feeling, the whole thing is so light it will move when you press one of them, so you have to kindof grip the top while pressing any of them. I know it’s probably to keep it affordable. The good thing is visually, the turntable looks really classy to say the least. It looks very very expensive!! Feels cheap, looks expensive. Sounds expensive. I recommend this player, especially with the bells and whistles. I have the receiver and the Sony bookshelf speakers (and the subwoofer is on the way because I need them lows) and yes, I put it on top of the receiver even though it hangs off the back, I made it work. Invest, it’s worth it. The affordability is unbeatable for the quality.<br/>Note: when hooking this up, make sure you have the input switch in the correct position in the back (line or phono) at first I had it hooked up to my receiver under phono but the switch was set to line, so the sound being sent to the speakers was awful, I thought I had a defective unit. I thought my speaker wire was bad maybe? I was almost crushed, then I saw that switch. Whew! It works like a charm. Also, out of the box the needle is covered up with a clear protector, and it was a bear to pull off, but Im sure the manual has tips for it I didn’t see.  The whole cartridge came off with it and I had to tinker with that to get it back on, but no sweat. You will need the instructions for set up, you have to put the turn table on the thing and loop the belt around the other thing, it’s super easy, but it takes some focus while handling the thin, delicate belt, careful not to twist or damage it. It’s easy though. The hinges for the lid is taped to the bottom of the styrofoam (very well hidden) and anyone could easily throw them away by accident, so be aware of that.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, yea it’s worth it. Just may want to invest in good output options to help this shine. I’m overall proud of my purchase and recommend it to anyone who doesn’t mind the cheap feel but classy look.</span>
