<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I don't write too many reviews esp for the likes of Sony and the other mega-corporations; they appear to be doing fine without any help from me. But I came on Amazon looking for a pair of passive floor-standing speakers and i searched on 3-way speakers first, just to see what was available, before i settled for a pair of Klipsch 2-ways or whatever I could afford for &lt;1200.00 for the pair. I was not expecting to find any 3-ways for that money. When these Sonys came up i was dismissive at first. Sony is a producer of fine audio and video equipment to be sure--I am a fan of their mirrorless cameras and I've had more video equipment from them than any other company. But speakers? No. Definitely not. For some reason Sony never cracked the speaker market. They seem to have been making money mass-producing mediocre speakers for the department store market; packaged stereo "systems" for convenience and lower cost. In a word, they sucked.<br/>But these were so cheap and the reviews were so good....I started reading about how in 2014 Sony produced a pair of 40k speakers that rocked the super-high end of the spectrum. Shortly after, seemingly a result of their renewed to audio, they came out with these.<br/>I wasn't after a pair of "OK" speakers for under 500, I was after a pair of good ones for under 1200. So i was reluctant at first. but I ordered them, and hooked them up to my 140w/ch Marantz 2 channel power amp, through a vacuum tube preamp.<br/>These are excellent speakers. They go all the way up with my fat black Marantz, clear and warm and LOUD. I hear parts of the mix that i never heard before, on albums I know by heart. the mid-range components provide a clean layer of sound and unequivocally, these speakers  sound excellent.  As good or better than speakers for more than double the price.<br/>Bravo, Sony, you did it again. Doesn't seem like anyone knows it, but you broke out of the department store mediocrity with your CS3 3 way Speakers, and they are the best deal I've gotten on new equipment in a while.</span>

<span> Sony has always made great speakers.  I bought a pair about 15 years ago that were 8" woofer 3 way speakers that were really good and crisp and handed those down to my daughter, which she loves.  I have a pair of small bookshelf ones for my new apartment but my Samsung soundbar was lacking extremely when playing my external hard drive thru my Blu Ray.  I decided to upgrade and was torn between these and similar Polk speakers.  While I bought the Polk center channel, I bought these because they are slim and would fit nicely in my place and not bring the house down.  These are crisp with great little punches of bass but nothing to brag about.  They have excellent sound for my music and the highs are very crisp and clean. Movies sounds ridiculously good.  I have nothing bad to say about these speakers and would recommend them to audiophiles.  I'm very particular with my sounds for my music and these really bring out my mp3's that I have converted at the highest quality 320 mbps.  Rock on 🤘😎</span>

<span>These floor speakers have great frequency response. When listening to keyboard music they are crystal clear. The high frequencies are outstanding. The base is a little weak but when paired with a powered sub woofer thay perform extremely well for the price.</span>

<span>I bought the bundle, 2 front towers and a center speaker.  I end up using the tower speakers as back sorround and the center channel for the front heights which I have to buy another center channel to pair with it.  I almost return them because they are too small for my living room, but I found it cheaper than buying the klipsch dolby atmos and back sorround speakers.  The sounds are amazing for smaller room and I rated them 5 for the price. The sounds are crisp and clean.  I found that they sound way better with multichannel speakers with a separate active subwoofer set to a low volume to help with the bass. But for the price, these bundle sony speakers are big bang for the buck.</span>

<span>15 Years after ditching my old surround sound system for a sound bar setup, I decided it was time to go back to BIG sound. So many options out there from cheap satellites to next level Audiophile level stuff. After weeks of research I thought I had settled on Klipsch and Polk as they were priced well and were well respected by most people. Then I went down a crazy YouTube rabbit hole and happened upon a crazy amount of reviews for Jamo speakers.<br/><br/>I am no Audiophile and I don't really want to be but I want good sound when I watch movies and spin some Vinyl. These S809's DO NOT DISSAPOINT! I plugged these in to my YAMAHA RX-V385 with no special configuration, and they produced some fantastic sound. Don't expect a killer amount of Bass but that's to be expected with these size of speakers. Once I plugged in a 20 year old powered Sony 10" sub, I was in heaven.<br/><br/>If you aren't looking to break the bank on speakers, and want something to make you smile when watching the latest Star Wars release, I highly recommend you look at these Towers paired with the S83 Center and a sub of your choosing.<br/><br/>Klipsch bought the Jamo brand for a reason...must have been something they liked right?</span>

<span>I've been a vintage guy for many years but the last few months I've noticed that my 70's era equipment just isn't able to handle the level of usage I expect from my system.  So I've leapt into modern equipment. These are replacements for a set of Allisons (not able to handle the use and blew a recently refoamed speaker), Cerwin Vegas (started sounding tinny a few weeks into use) and some Advent book shelfs (nice sound but meant for a much lower powered system).<br/><br/>When I ordered these I really didnt catch that whole Atmos feature.  I'm not doing home theater with this as I drive them with a (also modern) Yamaha AS701SL integrated 2.1 amp.  When I first got them I hooked up just the top firing speakers.  Sounded great.  Shortly afterwards my 1978 Onkyo TX 4500 MKII receiver dropped a channel (hence the new amp).  While I was waiting for the new amp to arrive I dug a little deeper into these speakers.  I was going to bi-wire it but then realized I only had 2 channels to work with.<br/> When the new amp arrived i wired the A channel to the front firing channel and the B to the Atmos top firing channel....WOW! what a difference.  Where I had been utilizing the Advent bookshelf speakers to get a little height in my sound these speakers provided it all in one package.  And the sound is absolutely awesome.  Klipsch has an excellent reputation for a reason.  This is the first pair I've ever had and it was worth the wait.  I have a large open floor plan and this setup really fills the space with music.  The only drawback was the (IMO) mediocre bass response.  So I got a  Klipsch K100SW to add in and now the music can be felt as well as heard.  I have a Panasonic DB-UB820 blu-ray with analog sound output connected and the CD sound is very clean and precise.  When I watch a concert video the sound which fills the room via the reflective top firing channel makes it seem almost like being there.  This clarity carries over to my vintage tuner, turntable and the modern Echo Link I use for streaming.<br/><br/>I can't really say enough good about this speaker.  Unfortunately its now discontinued, Klipsch has a newer similar model so I expect the sound to be just as good as these.  These are good solid pieces of equipment weighing in at around 46 lbs each.  TIP:  open the box at the bottom and turn it over, these are too heavy to lift the speaker, just slide the box off.  They look as awesome as they sound with a narrow face, the profile is a bit deeper in order to accommodate the Atmos speakers in the top.<br/><br/>The only real con I can say is the top firing Atmos speakers are only rated for 75 WPC while the front channel is 100WPC. But since I seldom if ever turn the amp beyond 5.5 volume (more than loud enough to piss off the neighbors if the windows are open) I don't think it will be much of an issue.<br/><br/>In short, I highly recommend these speakers though Klipsch's reputation far exceeds my meager opinion.  And if you watch, you may find them for a really good price like I did.</span>

<span>B200.  First pair of Klipsch I ever purchased.  Liked them so much, I bought 5 more pairs, 2 more pairs of just of this b200, plus another same size, better pair of 5.5 inch bookshelf with the titanium tweeters(RB51bll,) plus a 10 inch sub and also a tower set of their Reference Premier line with the dual 8 inch woofers and titanium tweeters.<br/>So far, in the past 4 months, I spent about 3k on Klipsch speakers.<br/>The pair of reference premier dual 8 inch woofers had a bad crossover out of the box.  The seller I purchased from here on Amazon, immediately sent a replacement, which is still working, thank you.<br/>I noticed one day a on my original b200 pair, a woofer was not moving, like the other channel.  I put my ear to it and it was dead.  Tried other speakers on that channel ruling out the pioneer elite receiver, no problems.<br/>I contacted Klipsch tech support, only an automated response a week later saying they had high volume and apologize for my delayed response.  Then a month or so later, after I ordered 2 more pairs directly from Klipsch, I get another automated response, "Can you please review your recent purchase?"<br/>Nothing from my dead woofer.  No reply for me asking for help.<br/>Finally about 2 months later, an actual human replies in an email, apologizing for the very late response.  He asks for my address, email and phone number and copies of my reciept.<br/>I have a Homeland security clearance and regulations to follow, including not carrying personal electronics in the field.<br/>So I send 2 screenshots of my Amazon prime reciept with all my contact info, except my phone number.<br/>My response, from Klipsch, yesterday, going on 3 months of not having a working speaker was, "can you please provide you phone number? "<br/>They may sound good.  The b200 speaker that had the woofer stop working, never sounded distorted or unclear.  In fact, it always sounded great.  But it failed.<br/>Bottom line, they sound great when working, but if you buy anything from Klipsch, have backups. Out of the 6 pairs I've purchased in the past few months, 2 speakers had bad crossovers.  I would have been okay with that, had they replaced them in a timely manner.<br/>Update 1/27/2022<br/>I was frustrated and gave up on recieving help with my speaker and ordered a different brand pair.<br/>I get another box in the mail a couple weeks ago and it's a brand new crossover from Klipsch!  They sent it to me after I already wrote them off and stopped checking my email.  I installed it and my little b200 is sounding great again!<br/>It took a while to get my speaker back up and running but am a happy customer again.<br/>When a person or company does me wrong, I write them off for good.  I'm glad Klipsch made good on the warranty because I love their speakers.  Not only does this little speaker sound fantastic, especially at this price range but the copper woofers are beautiful.  I push them to the limit and only back off when I notice even the slightest distortion.  They don't seem to fatigue and I'm pushing my 90 wpc receiver to 75%... sometimes more with a few drinks!  Anyway these b200 take almost everything I throw at them, unlike the new pair from a different USA brand, rated 175w continuous, 300w peak.  Without ever distorting, the other brands each blew within a couple months of each other.<br/>I  appreciate Klipsch correcting my issue and my faith has been renewed in their company.<br/>I'm in the market for a few new higher end pairs and at least 2 more subs and they earned back my business.<br/>Good save Klipsch</span>

<span>These are entry level speakers according to Klipsch but my goodness do they have power and crystal clear sound.  Match them with a good receiver and you will not be disappointed.  I also purchased a Black Label Center speaker and a 12" Subwoofer to match and complete the system. I am happy :)</span>

<span>I watched the "Cheap audio man" on YT rave about these on sale for under a C note.  Waited and when they went on sale I got a pair.  I've been in audio for a long time, and these speakers are amazing!  They sparkle and sound really balanced.  Voices are clear and the soundstage has presence and wide.  I've had some Andrew Jones speakers, Pioneer &amp; Elac; these Sony's exceed them in all ways.  I've got them hooked to a low dollar Yamaha receiver, running a CD player thru a Modi3 DAC.  Unbelievable. When we get into the new house, I'm going to hook them up to the Emotiva system.  Can't wait.  Find them for under $150 try them. Recommended highly!!</span>

<span>Great speakers, but remember there 6 ohms, might need more power to sound good. I started by using as rear speakers with 95 watt rms, couldn't hear them, moved to front land r at 120 wpc ,lot better.then recently after one fell of my emotiva speaker I was down to one. Am currently using as center channel speaker with emotiva xpa2 connected at 250 rms @8 ohms. I run my bass thru subs but got to say I'm very impressed with these speakers when have real power put to them. I wouldn't recommend to use these speakers with the typical AVR that doesn't push out at least at least hundred to 150 watts minimum unless your running full bandwidth. 8 ohm speakers sounds better unless you can drive these. Thats my opinion. I have watched baby driver in atmos with this speaker cranked, very impressed. When running on lower amp levels not impressed.</span>

<span>I want to start off by saying that I have quite a bit of experience with speakers in all ranges and have quite a lot of knowledge about speakers and how audio works. And in most speakers, even 300 dollar+ sets, there's a few common issues that usually puts me off as a listener which these speakers have done a great job at avoiding.<br/><br/>Typically speakers under $500 have the following issues:<br/>Tweeters don't mix well with the loudspeaker in the cabinet and sound like another miss-matched speaker placed ontop of your much better mid/low range speakers.<br/>Tweeters are overbearing and sound "washey" or metalic.<br/>Sound quality, especially in high frequencies, is greatly reduced when keeping the dust protection panel on.<br/>Bass is strong but lacks proper tone.<br/>Bass is weak but has gratuitous excursion.<br/>Bass has good tone, but relies too much on the addition of a subwoofer or passive resonance speakers resulting in overall lower quality lows/mids.<br/>3-way crossover makes it difficult for your amplifier to get a proper read resulting in underwhelming volumes<br/>Audio suffers greatly when not placed in the absolute most optimal position which restricts placement or quality.<br/><br/>That's a lot of common problems and, even with the good reviews and lots of research, I expected to hear at least one of them.<br/>However I can happily say that I am blown away at how well these speakers handle all of these issues. Up close, far away, with a sub, without, placed properly or improperly, used with other speakers or alone these two mini-monsters absolutely crush all of these issues and sound dang good while doing it.<br/><br/>I'm very critical when it comes to audio and I'd easily say that I'd have to be ready to dump 600 dollars into anything to consider an upgrade being a big enough jump to be worth it.<br/><br/>I have these connected to an Integra Pre-Amp and are powering them with a Crown 1000 amplifier in a very large room (probably 35x30ft) . Off the rip I think 6 Ohms is perfect for this size speaker in a home theater, especially for fronts, but these go above and beyond just making a few right decisions. These clearly had ALL the good design choices... So if your amplifier can do 6 Ohms, then I'd highly recommend these.<br/><br/>I'd also like to add that the volume and atmospheric resonance in these are comparable to 8 Ohm 350 watt speakers, so 100 watts is something my power bill is happy to adopt.<br/>These barely break a sweat producing loud, high quality, detailed sound and for once I'm not worried about heavy excursion ripping them apart.<br/><br/>I will be using these for music at house parties as well as for movies and gaming and so far I've tested them for all three and have yet to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Personally I would not recommend these as side speakers as they're a little TOO in your face. I think side and rear are a whole different ball game. That being said, you could definitely order 6 of these and use them as front, surround, and rear surround speakers; you'd just need to calibrate their volumes and equalize them properly.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm proud to say I own these and even more proud to tell people what I spent on them. These aren't just great for how much they are, they're great in general. Unless you're willing to spend a lot of money, there's little-to-no audible difference between these and other very high end speakers and I personally recommend getting these speakers if your setup requires bookshelf sized speakers.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:<br/>8.5/10 for audio quality if we completely ignore price and consider 10 the best sound imaginable.<br/>9.7/10 if I factor in price and give in to my bass-head type personality (secretly wishing these had subwoofer level bass).<br/>10/10 for anyone who isn't the pickiest SOB in the world and simply wants what 98% of the world would consider to be perfect audio.<br/>(ps: When I say the bass on these are very good I am talking about what you would expect for tone and strength coming from a Home Theater speaker. Unless you want to get those huge cabinet speakers you see in actual theaters, you are never going to get subwoofer level bass out of a front channel speaker. You simply aren't meant to, and for good reason. You do not need a sub to hear sub-frequencies with these as they handle bass incredibly well... but please do not think these can replace a woofer. They're called sub-"woofers" because they push air so hard you can feel it. That's not bass, that's an artificial effect)<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>It's been 2 years and still going strong. Now of course I know a lot about the best ways to configure setups and get the most out of my speakers, but everyone who hears how good this system sounds is blown away. Almost everyone is encouraged to get a setup of their own after hearing how good it sounds. These definitely compliment my center channel and other speakers so well. It almost doesn't matter what speakers I mix with these, it just works. I've tried a few different configurations and have been pushing these hard on a weekly basis. Seems like no matter what I throw at these they just work. I also have a particularly dust-happy room; I am pleased to say that these do not have a tendency to pick up dust as I haven't had to clean them even once. Reliability, functionality, audio balance, build quality are all there. I wish I could give these more stars as I don't think people understand just how rare it is to find a speaker like this in this price range. Not usually a Sony fan, but hats off to the engineers in Japan that designed this - you guys deserve a pay raise.</span>

When paired with the Tractrix horn-loaded lets tweeter, it provides speaker efficiency highest in its class. Exposed fasteners and low profile magnetic grilles give the speakers a polished, modern appearance. Stylish aesthetic with absolute durability that results in a seamless integration into any decor. Reinforced MDF construction reduces cabinet vibration for less audible coloration and improved sonic accuracy.

<span>I've built my home theater piece by piece over a 20 year period. Got my Denon ( its my 3rd; I'm hooked on Denon, having had Marantz, Sony, &amp; Yamahas) 7.2 Dolby atmos receiver. Bought those Onkyos atmos speakers cheap, but Onkyo isn't A low end brand. I just wasn't getting those overhead sound effects many are raving about. Hence, I did some extensive research on how to set them up, crossover, height measurement etc. After 2 months FINALLY I achieved the desired effect but felt my system was still lacking. I bought a pair of these and My God, the difference is astounding! I am very much pleased. Worth the $. 400 to 98.00. Now I feel I'm inside that bubble of sound I so desperately desired. I highly recommend! Note, I researched Dolby atmos set-up on YouTube. Very helpful, as were reviews like this. Keep tweaking and you'll achieve that height effect atmosphere you keep hearing and reading about. One of the most informative things one our reviewers said was THESE ARE NOT ANOTHER CHANNEL! Not a surround speaker even though they can be used as such. They are engineered specifically for object placement!</span>

<span>You have to spend a good deal more to get 8" woven copper woofers and titanium tweeters with LTS and all the accompanying Klipsch tech.  After a while of using them lightly as front speakers in the surround system, I started upping the ante with music and found much to my delight that they've got awesome sound of course, and it's what you don't hear that seems to start to set them apart.  I'm in the beginning of setting up a 13.2 system, and I wanted the Klipsch RF-7 iii 10" towers but decided to get these at under $450 the pair to work my way into the line and make sure it's really all that before jumping the gun.  After all, I need to buy the receiver, a Denon AVR-X6700H which really has 13.2 channel outputs, and I also ordered a pair of Cerwin-Vega XLS-215s with dual 15" woofers each because I just couldn't resist.  I'm not looking for loud, just a highly delineated and immersing sound experience.  Plus experimentation is just fun!  With overhead speakers, I'll be able to pull off a lot of sound fields as well as a two channel layout that may not make the Beatles sound their best, but I can do that in another room or turn off some speakers.  In any case, these Synergy floor speakers seem to me to be a great deal unless you're looking for the built-in height channels which they do not have, in which case there are other good Klipsch examples.  Happy acoustic engineering!</span>

<span>Upgrading audio gear has always been a spiral climb for me, like a raptor using heat and currents to gain altitude gradually. Finding what gear meshes well and provides the type of synergy that creates music that sounds better than it should for the price point of the gear is key.<br/><br/>I do a limited audio budget, and after getting over a period of years a Hegel integrated amplifier, then an Audiolab CD transport, I began stalking speakers. My Totem Rainmakers sounded fine---they still do---but I missed the fuller experience of sitting between a pair of floor-standing speakers. I was questing for speakers to use in a 11' by 15' space and needed some that were efficient, would not call undue attention to themselves, and were within my fairly modest budget.<br/><br/>I settled on a pair of Triangle Borea BR08 speakers in walnut as they suited my room, but the white and black finishes also look fine.  They come with wooden plinths and spikes for an extra measure of stability and are equipped with magnetic grills, a nice feature. The cabinets are manufactured wood and the dark finish looks nice with my gear (which is black). I will not delve into the technical description Triangle provides except to say that I think the sound that these speakers creates is quite crisp and nuanced.<br/><br/>I generally listen to a fair amount of jazz, some electronic music, plenty of rock, and some Americana folk. In other words, anything from old Fleetwood Mac (before Buckingham-Nicks) and Family, to the Gourds or Woods, to Gil-Scott Heron or Flying Lotus, to King Crimson, E.S.T, Joe Henry, Mathias Eick, or Dan Weiss. If your read between the lines, I guess the point is that I am not listening to much blunt force rock. I enjoy complex and subtle and unusual elements in music.<br/><br/>And that is why I think the Triangle Borea BR08 speakers suit me. They excel at reproducing percussion and have clear mid-range and high-range sound. Bass is fine for me but these speakers are not going to render gut-bucket bass with the punch that some may be seeking. I would argue that Triangle is pitching these speakers for perhaps  listeners who wants to sit and listen, taking time to deconstruct the music and letting the sound wash over them like a rain shower. The BRO8 speakers have a lush, but crisp presentation. They reproduce music clearly and precisely and with energy.  They are not super finicky as far as placement, but I do give my space some room to breath.<br/><br/>I do wish the speaker connectors allowed direct insertion of banana plugs on cables as you have to twist the connectors, insert the plugs, then tighten them. Not a big deal, but this is a feature I have always preferred. Not a bit more about those connectors.<br/><br/>When my speakers arrived last September, they were both damaged by the shipper. Most serious was that the speaker plate containing the connectors was shattered, creating both the potential for wires to contact each other and leaving the cabinets open. (The seller was very gracious and worked with me.)  I needed to replace the damaged part and also found that I was missing several of the spikes. I contacted Triangle USA which is affiliated with Antal Audio Group, and they very promptly found a replacement part and another set of spikes and sent them to me at no costs. Kudos to Triangle for such services.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that there are several excellent tower speakers at this price point, and how one bests the others is often a subjective matter. I recommend auditioning the Triangle Borea BR08 if possible and see what you think. The imaging, clarity, and decent but not overbearing looks were just what I wanted in this loop of my audio upgrade spiral.</span>

<span>I have the ELAC debut and I think those sound better, but they are OK, a little bass light</span>

<span>After 3 days I am still breaking them in. So far I am very happy. I have read a lot of reviews before I decided on the BR03s. It will be weeks before they get the full test done. A bit pricey today, but I would recommend to a friend.  You Tube has a lot of great reviews.  I have now had these speakers for several weeks and I am still happy with them. It should take at least 100 hours to completely break them in.</span>
