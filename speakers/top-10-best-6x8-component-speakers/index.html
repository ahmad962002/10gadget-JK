<span>These will handle the most power of any speaker I have tested in this size . These speaker do not produce a ton of base , need subwoofer for best results .  If you do not have an amp , I would go with infinity Kappa instead . If you need POWER these are the best your going to get in this size .</span>

<span>Best car speakers i could ever buy for my Newedge mustang. Perfect sound quality, crisp, and gets loud. Lacks a bit of bass, but just buy a 8 inch type r sub, and a shallow box and you're set. I'm running it on my soundstream headunit, which i got with my car, and it works, but wants a bit more power for it to get actually loud. You'll want more than 300w peak to run these awesome speakers.</span>

<span>I placed these speakers in the front doors of my 2000 Ford F-350.  It has the loud diesel engine, so the speakers had to be capable of high volumes.  They were replacing some pretty nice Infinity Kappa speakers from ~8 years ago.  The Infinity speakers had aluminum dome tweeters and very large magnets.  The sound was pretty good, but they fatigued my ears after listening for a while.  I could never quite get them set right to play loud without being kind of harsh.  These Alpine R-types have the ring type soft dome tweeters, so they are not harsh at all.  You can really hear the difference on the crash symbols and "S" sounds from vocals.  The snare has a really nice pop to it as well, which I love.  You can feel the impact of the snare and toms just like a real drum set.  I'm actually getting some pretty good bass from them too, even with the high pass set at 60hz.  Installation was very easy since these have the small, light weight magnets.  I think it's like any good speaker - you have to put in the work on the installation.  I have a wood mounting surface and closed cell foam between my speaker and the door panel with dynamat all over everything. If you plan on doing a good installation, amping them, and running a subwoofer, then you should not be disappointed with the smooth, accurate sound of these.</span>

<span>After installing these 50W RMS speakers I noticed a PUNCHY high-mid bass I'd never heard before in car audio! The highs are crystal clear and bright but may cause listening fatigue quick. The one con is these 6x8 TX speakers struggle to get powerful mid bass and if you're looking for alot of power you may want to go with kickers instead. If you're looking for bright highs I'd definitely recommend these or any size in the TX series!</span>

<span>Installed these in my 2011 Ranger, rear of cab, replacing factory speakers.  I did this soon after replacing the factory cd stereo with an aftermarket 200w Sony unit. While the factory speakers were not blown or damaged these speakers made a significant difference in the overall audio quality.  I'm not a sophisticated audio geek but these speakers handle the new power very easily and sound just great without spending a small fortune.  I took a chance based on researching reviews from several sources and I am quite impressed.</span>

<span>Upgraded my 2005 F150 with these Skar 6x8s. Had the premium Ford system stock with component speakers and at first when I saw this thought these might not be much of an upgrade. I was wrong... HUGE upgrade. Better bas, WAY better mid range, WAY better top end. Then I upgraded my head unit and WOW, big difference. Loving the sound of these and as they break in seem to be getting even better. I bought these for like $60, Then I went bigger and install some $120 infinities in the rear doors (also 6x8's) and honestly I think the Skars might sound better. So I have these Skars doing a majority of the sound I hear as they are the front door speakers and combined with the Infinity rears and factory powered sub the sound is WAY better than it should sound for the money I have into this system.<br/><br/>If you install these and are underwhelmed you need a better head unit. The stock head unit was OK, the aftermarket one made these sing like a bird. Good stuff.</span>

<span>First I'd like to say I'm a real person who has real experience in the car audio world and this is an honest review. Personally I'm not entirely impressed with there sound. That being said they are better than kicker es 6x8s for certain. Also I would say if I had a truly decent head unit installed I think they'd be perfect for my needs. I have them running off a factory stereo in my 2012 fusion and they absolutely do not have a flat response.

<span>Not a direct factory fit to a 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 (front door speaker location). The factory Infinity 6x9 (front door speaker location) has a narrower frame, and the door opening is rolled to fit that Infinity frame. These are too large, physically, to fit in the opening, even though the screw holes line up well (but the factory screw heads are a bit too large for these speakers, and the screws provided with these speakers are a different pitch and slightly narrower than the factory speakers, but work OK anyway; they do provide new clips, but I didn't change them out). I used a ball-peen hammer to "reshape" the factory door locations, and still it wasn't quite enough, and the speakers sit spaced 1/4-1/2" out from the door frame (also, the hammering removed the factory paint, leaving the bare steel exposed; I could have covered that with something, but I didn't bother, since it's a 14-year-old truck). Sound quality is adequate, better than the 14-year-old, blown-out factory speakers for sure. Watch the wiring, too, to make sure it's tight to the speaker and the window won't clip it on the way down (broke one of the factory jacks off the plastic on my first install, but the wire to the voice coil itself was still intact, so I carefully maneuvered it out of the way of both the speaker and the lowering window).</span>

<span>If you've replaced your car stereo, you have to upgrade your speakers to get the full effect. I was impressed by these right out of the box and even more when i turned them on. See comparison rear view pictures. I visited a few and these are Highly recommended at many audio shops. I'm using a Kenwood Excelon radio (50w) and these speakers handled it superbly. Extremely clear at low, mid and higher volume. Why did i wait so long. Buy the wire adapter connectors and install in no time. Use online videos for your vehicle door panels. Each vehicle is different,  but the speakers are very install is easy.  Speakers come with adapter plates, wire and screws. DIY and enjoy. Test each speaker before reinstalling the fit panel. Shipping was also great. Received in 2 days without paying expedited shipping.</span>

<span>These sound great and better than I thought they would. No instructions included but it's pretty much common sense to install these. I replaced the clip-on nuts with more heavy duty ones to get a more durable grab for the screws provided. I recommend installing rear side baffles for much improved sound, you can buy these online or make your own. All in all these are an excellent buy for the price and not many 4x6 speakers come with covers like these do.</span>
