<span>For its price you can not ask for more, but it has profit, it has good brightness and its extended bass is not much, this speaker works better with double or triple equalizer, you must actuate the sound adjustment of your Samsung or other smart phone, and go down two applications a call 10 band poweEQ and if you want mp3 VLC which has a very efficient equalizer .. so you can take advantage of this speaker.

<span>BOTTOM LINE: Decent, clean sound from a compact sized speaker. However... beware of teeny-tiny control buttons / user interface area; fumble-fingered folks and those with large hands could find using this thing a challenge. Another minus is that when you turn it on the volume is automatically set at max. Worst offense: internal rechargeable battery died in less than 6 months. In the end, if I had it to do over again I would've kept looking and spent a few more bucks and bought something a little more user-friendly, without some of the poor built-in choices this Pyle PBMSQG9 speaker is saddled with. So... 1 STARS.<br/><br/>THOUGHTS: I've been doing some remodel work in my basement and enjoy listening to music while I'm down there. I have an ancient Sony boombox but was sick of the seemingly endless commercials on the radio and sadly my old cassette tapes are on their last legs. I knew I wanted something that could play tunes off of a USB stick and I didn't want to pay an arm &amp; a leg; something compact with decent sound. I looked at a LOT of various units from several manufacturers. This one from Pyle *seemed* like a solid overall choice.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: It checked off all the boxes on my 'must-have' list and the large rubbery wraparound bands/feet at each end keep the speaker in place and take a fair amount of bumping and punishment. The ability to recharge the battery from a USB port is a nice touch.<br/><br/>THE NOT SO GOOD: You can't leave this thing plugged in or you risk cooking the rechargeable internal battery. I don't know if it's replaceable and even if it is, it's probably not cheap so you have to unplug it as soon as it's done charging or...  very annoying. Entry-level pricing means simplicity... to a fault: the tiny controls are jammed into a space literally smaller than a matchbook cover. 2 buttons (&lt;&lt;/&gt;&gt;) do most of the selection work; you have to toggle or doubletap them to change song selection &amp; volume. That's a major pain, but whatta ya expect for $30?<br/><br/>THE BAD:  When you turn this thing on the volume is automatically set at the MAX level. Whichever engineer or marketing genius thought that this would be a good idea should be repeatedly kicked in the nuts. I haven't tried any of the wireless/Bluetooth features yet, so I cannot comment on those. Others who have can give you the straight poop on those.<br/><br/>THE UGLY: After less than 6 months of infrequent use totaling less than a dozen recharges, the internal battery has DIED!  I am not about to spend the $$$ money to replace it (if it can be), so this cheap junk speaker has regrettably been pitched in the garbage. Why ANY company would not set it up to have a choice of either running off a 110v plug-in outlet OR using the internal battery is beyond me. With a full-charge runtime of only 8 hrs, it's ridiculous to force the user to have to turn it off and fully re-charge before using it again, instead of just plugging it in. And it should be able to play *while re-charging* too! Other portable/rechargeable speakers out there do, so there is absolutely zero excuse from Pyle. Very serious design flaws, IMHO, regardless of whether it's an entry-level unit or a top-of-the-line model. I might as well have driven down the road and thrown my $30 out the window. Very, very disappointed! This was my first Pyle purchase and I can guarantee you that it was my LAST. As for as I am concerned, "Pyle" stands for "pile of sh_t." Potential buyers BEWARE!!! Just pony up a little more cash and buy yourself something with more intelligent options and better user flexibility for your hard-earned $$$. :-(</span>

<span>SO i got this thing for my wife who does massages, her old stero was a cd player that would only inspire comfort and relaxation in people if you beat them over the head with it. Got the package in charged it up and wanted to test out the battery life and sound quality. Turned it on placed it in the room at about medium volume the sound was clean, crisp, and clear. Went down stairs to fold some laundry and maybe play some ESO had some people to shank. Went back into the room to check on it only to find the dogs, cats, and wife all passed out taking a nap. ( lazy bums). Took it outside and turned it up and could hear it clearly without distortion. Instructions could be a little better though.</span>

<span>The first time I used this device and powered it on, the volume came on super loud. I was able to figure out how to turn the volume down (press and hold the "Previous" button) and comfortably listen to the device. Next time I turned it on, same thing: the volume was max'd out. I thought jeez, I must have been partying or listening to a song that had really low volume and turned it up a lot. Wrong: I found out today from the company that this is the way the device was designed! So this means your speaker and battery are going to have a shorter life than they otherwise would have.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a possible work-around would have been to power-up the device without the USB thumb drive plugged in, but apparently you cannot even turn the volume down without the USB drive plugged in! Ears blown out again (I still have a headache from the experience).<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is a very flawed design and I am amazing Pyle has not fixed such a serious problem.</span>

<span>I love these amazon reviews where everything is either "5-star" and awesome, or "1-star" and worst ever.<br/>The truth is, it is a good, cheap bluetooth speaker.  Not great, and not really as advertised. But adequate.<br/><br/>I'll bring bluetooth speakers to worksites, and they tend to get damaged, so I don't want to spend $100-200. The cheap ones you usually see at $10-20 are usually only 2-5 watts. Barely louder then the phone pairing it. This seemed like a good comprimise.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>It is light, and pairs a far distance, and does not auto-shutoff for a while.  It is louder then the cheap ones you see everywhere, though clearly not 200watts. Maybe 50, but I'd guess 20rms.  Its still cheap enough that I don't care if its damaged. Perfect for a work-site<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/>The "master volume control".  Every time you turn the unit on, it resets that master volume control to 50%, and you can not adjust that with your phone.  This is why everyone complains that it is not loud.  The unit has a "-" and "+" but those are not volume controls. Those are prev and next buttons.  To adjust the master volume, you need to press the "+" and hold it down for a few seconds, then it switches from "next" mode, to volume mode.<br/><br/>This is annoying, and you have to do it every time you turn it on.  But once you do, it gets much louder.<br/>That said, not 200watts loud.  But loud enough for me.  Also, it only has one speaker, not 2.  One of them is fake. Again, work-site quality.  Not something I would use for a performance.</span>

<span>The speaker is NOT 300W, but it still delivers a nice sound.  It was easy to connect my phone to the speaker and play my music, and the strap that comes with it makes it easy to carry or move the speaker around.  It is a great buy for the price.</span>

<span>It works. That's the best thing going for it. The set up is not good as the control panel covers one of the speakers. The volume is easily drowned out by ambient noise and the range is reminiscent of a 70s transistor radio. Spend more for a better product.</span>

<span>Overall for the price-point this is a great bluetooth speaker. But where it makes up for in price, it lacks in sound quality.  Specifically the sound is seemingly driven by two small speakers that lack bass depth and top-end volume in comparison to other &lt;$100 products.</span>

<span>UPDATE: I got a chance to really observe this Speaker.<br/>1. I have such a hard time pairing the Bluetooth Speaker to my Phone(A Very Hard Time)None of my other Speakers have this kind of Problem.<br/>2. Down Below: I stated, that the so-called putting out 500 Watts is Questionable. I also stated that the so-called RMS Output putting out 250 Watts is Questionable. Well, it is no longer Questionable at All. This Speaker definitely doesn't put out neither amount of Watts( NO, NOT AT ALL)It isn't loud at all.<br/>I never Understood: Why these Companies claim such an Exaggerated lie and stick to it. RIDICULOUS<br/>In truth, it isn't loud at all when playing certain genres of Music.<br/>3. Down Below: In my previous Review. I stated, that it is really worth more than it is priced at. NO,<br/>It isn't at all.<br/>Yes, it does have a lot of functions that many of the high end priced speakers don't at all have.<br/>Sound Quality: It is just an average sounding One.<br/>4. Whenever the bluetooth finally decides to Pair. It Distorts my MP3 Music "BIGTIME" Along with makes the tracks Skip.<br/><br/>FIRST REVIEW: BEFORE THE UPDATE ABOVE: As far as it being able to sound up to 500 Watts Peak Power(I would say, that is very Questionable.) As far as it being able to produce in sound up to 250 in RMS Output( This Watt is also very Questionable)<br/>It all depends on the Context.<br/>Example: Because of some speakers having a PA System(Various things in the context of sound gets considered in the companies sound quality and measurements. All Bluetooth Speakers have advantages and disadvantages across the Board. PERIOD<br/>EXAMPLE: Some are better in Low Range Sounds, Other In Mids, While yet certain ones in Highs, Etc...<br/>Some, have a combination of Lows, Mids and Highs. However, many can lack in certain 3D, 360 or All around Surround. Some have much better battery quality than others, some are built better, Etc...<br/>There are many Variables Involved. However, they all have something to Offer. This is the reality of Companies always having to produce something on their product Different. In order to Compete with other Competitors.<br/><br/>Anyway back to this particular Pyle Model(PBMWP185)<br/>I don't understand: Why both this Company, as well as the Customers: Both are totally uninformed about the RGB(DJ LIGHTS) They claim you can't turn the lights off on the Unit. That, is misinformation being spread to Customers. That info: Prevents many customers from getting the Product.<br/>When all people have to do is simply go back in the instruction manual. It clearly states, (Press and hold Mode button to turn the RGB on/off.)It's that Simple! (It Is In Plain Sight!!!)The RGB is directly related to the Lights. ON PAGE 4 REMARKS: NUMBER 5<br/><br/>Customers are going to extremes just to get the lights to turn Off. Such As: Cutting certain Wires, Opening up The Speaker, Etc...<br/>When they don't have to go through all of that. You just risk damaging such a great Speaker.(Don't do that)<br/><br/>This Speaker itself is nice in its Appearance. It is well worth the Money. It really could have easily sold for More.( Update Here: "Not True"<br/>It is an overall Great Quality Sounding Speaker.(Update Here:The Sound of the Speaker Part(NOT TRUE) Yes, it does have lots of great Functions: USB DRIVE/FLASH Music Playing Option, TF CARD Playing Option, FM Playing Option, Etc....<br/><br/>Though the battery doesn't allow many hours of playtime. Afterall, it's only 3000 mah.<br/>On the other Hand: The battery is better than some other Speakers.<br/><br/>NOTE UPDATE: The only reason I will keep this Speaker is Because. I can play my Pre-Recorded Music through the USB Compartment. With my USB DISK/TRANS FLASH OPTION.<br/>Otherwise, I would send this back in a heartbeat.</span>

The sound quality is much better than other speakers  I've owned in this price range. Also, although I originally found the battery to be short lived, it has been lasting all day. About 11hours of music today. That was at about 50-75 percent volume. I would give it five stars if it was stereo. Thank you Pyle for making quality sound affordable.</span>

<span>I love this speaker. I wanted it for our pool area and it is plenty loud. I've seen reviews where people say it isn't loud at all but you have to hold down the volume up button for like 5 seconds to get the complete volume.<br/>I had purchased this and read the bad reviews and went to cancel my purchase but it was sent anyway and I'm so glad it was because I'm very pleased with.<br/>The lights make it fun as well!!!</span>

<span>Disappointing, for several reasons:<br/><br/>1. Vocals are kind of muddy; sounds like the speaker is playing from inside of a cardboard box (as if the speaker was put in a box &amp; then put on play...weird-sounding like that, like it's a bit boxed in).<br/><br/>2. Nearly zero bass.  I'm really surprised at how little bass there is; I've built Sonosubs before (subwoofers in tubes) &amp; would have thought it would have had at least SOME bass or mid-bass in this.  Nope.  Stuff that's a bit more acoustic like George Ezra's "Budapest" sounds pretty good, but throwing on something like Soulja Boy is pretty disappointing.  All that volume &amp; no thump :(<br/><br/>3. Doesn't get nearly as loud as I'd like.  I was hoping to use this for outdoor movies with a mini LED Android projector, but the volume combined with the lack of bass is just disappointing.  My little palm-sized Bluetooth speakers are nearly as loud as this is.  I think part of the problem is that there's a speaker on each end, so you don't really get the full effect of a left &amp; right speaker if you place it horizontally (the manual shows it in both horizontal &amp; vertical configurations, with the vertical pointing the control button side up).  I've found it actually sounds better standing up vertical in kind of an omni-speaker setup - not to compare it to a high-end Linkwitz, but kind of the same idea where it can at least disperse the sound a bit better.  Oddly enough, it sounds best with the control button side down - gives it a throatier sound (especially for male voices, like Hozier's "Take me to church"), which actually points the drivers down &amp; the "sub" up.<br/><br/>On the plus side...it does work, it's a cool design (feels fairly durable!), and the price is pretty decent.  However, I prefer my other Bluetooth speakers.  In all honesty, I like my Soundbot better than this (at less than half the price, plus you can use it in the shower or pool!), if you're not concerned with bass...the treble is clearer in the Soundbot.  I was hoping this would be like a portable Bazooka-style speaker, lots of fun with some bass hits.  The thing is, for ten bucks cheaper, you can get an Mpow Boombag...which is the size of your hand rather than the size of a roll of paper towels but sounds WAY better and actually has some BASS thump!  I'm surprised at how much I didn't care for this given the 4-star rating out of 180 reviews...so many better options (audibly better!) out there for less money.<br/><br/>I included a picture of it next to a half-used roll of paper towels.  It's a bit shorter, but about the same size around as a full roll of paper towels, for size reference.</span>

<span>I will start with the PROS:<br/><br/>The Bluetooth connection, 5 stars.  Connected very easily, plays clear I carried it a lot more than 30 feet and had a few walls between me and still had a clear connection.<br/><br/>Even though it's larger than my usual "portable" speaker (normally get the little square "shower speakers") but blew the speaker out of the last 2 (I like loud music as I get away from it at times) so I thought I'd try something larger... so far, so good.<br/><br/>I haven't tried the SD card reader yet so I can't comment.  But I'm guessing it will be fine<br/><br/>The cord (male to male 3.5mm jack) is great for connecting my phone (or other items) "hardwired" and plays the music (a bit less volume) and my phone will play FM radio so it helps on the con of the FM review below.<br/><br/>The carry strap is nice and you have two options, carry it horizontal or vertical.<br/>I don't see me carrying this much but I might when I go fishing or camping.<br/><br/>Semi-Pro/Con<br/>The on-off switch would be better if it was a toggle switch or a bit bigger.<br/>Not as loud as I had hoped but still pretty loud.<br/><br/>CON:<br/>I read in the "questions answered" section and it was said many times that a microphone would work so it would be like having a small loudspeaker to use to address small gatherings like a family reunion and that's one of the major reasons I got this.<br/><br/>It is "supposed" to play FM radio.  Yeah... right.  If you're not too far from a station, maybe.  I get a load of static and barely pull in a station and hey, guess what?? No digital or other readout showing what station you are on.<br/>You'd need another radio so you can determine wich one you are on or wait for radio identification.<br/><br/>But for me the biggest con is the no microphone use as I would like to use it to amplify my voice at meetings.  Primary reason I chose this one.</span>
