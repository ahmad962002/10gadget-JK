<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Bought for a 1999 Dodge Durango. Speakers are fine, but the instructions were abysmal, practically useless,  and the components were a haphazard mess. I had to jury rig some of the wiring since they didn't think to include the wiring for anything but the optional tweeters, meaning I had to steal some wiring off of those just to hook the woofers up to the car. The mounting bracket also doesn't have any girth, so I had to join the old with the new to work. Perhaps these weren't meant for my vehicle, but all the sources I looked up pointed to these as the suitable replacement since the factory speakers went bad.</span>

<span>I use these with a little  alpine power pack amp and sound great. I also use a under seat alpine powered sub for the lows..<br/>For the value these can't be beat. Tweets are nice and clean not over powering. I would buy them again.</span>

<span>Had to replace my blown 6.5 door component speakers... These were a good choice... Have to say they sound better than the Infinity speakers they replaced... They can handle all the power that my 400 watt amp can pump through them... These are more of a mid bass speaker than a true woofer... Didn't need to use the tweeters, so I can't say how they sound... Easy to install, with all the hardware included... Only drawback, I wish they came with speaker rings/spacers to make a cleaner install...</span>

<span>These sound pretty good and took all the power I threw at it perfectly. But I don’t recommend these as a replacement for 6x9s. Installed these in a ram front doors but had to upgrade the woofer to a 6x9 to fix the lack of bass, too much airspace for a 6.5.</span>

<span>It’s certainly an upgrade over almost any factory speaker but I’ve heard much cleaner sounding component speakers. Just installed them a couple days ago so they aren’t through the break in period yet but I’m running them off a 70x4 watt amp. I have had it all the way up briefly to see if the speakers would handle that power without bottoming out and it does. As long as they hold up for a year or two I’ll be more than happy with them. Great for a budget build for sure! Can’t wait to see how they hold up to a good 20-30 minute drive at 60-70 watts since that’s gonna be the true test. If I don’t update this post it’s because the speakers held up and its perfectly fine to pump 70 watts to each side of the component set.</span>

<span>Installed in a 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid<br/><br/>I bought these to replace some other aftermarket speakers in my front doors that had too much distortion at high volumes. I am super happy with the overall sound and ease of installation of these speakers. Having the built-in crossover makes the install much easier than the external crossover that I was able to take out of my doors. The parts that are supplied for the dome tweeters are well designed. I was able to install the tweeters without having to do any cutting or resorting to glue.<br/><br/>Note that I have a subwoofer in my car. Without the added sub, I think these speakers might be a little low on bass response, but they are great for midrange. Definitely a good value.</span>

Surround (Patent Pending) Multi-Layer Hybrid Fiber Cone Large Square Wire Dual-Layer Voice Coil High-performance Linear Drive Motor Type-R speakers have been known for their dependability and sound performance at a mid-line price. Chances are, you’ve heard the Type-R speakers and appreciated the loud & fun listening experience. Using the highly successful Type-R speakers as a foundation, we applied various performance and hardware improvements to the design, essentially transforming them into the new R-Series speakers – The Next Evolution of Proven Performance. BUILDING ON AN ICONIC SPEAKER The Type-R speaker has been an iconic part of the car audio industry for many years but it was time for a modernization of the brand. Type-R speaker performance was certainly top notch but there is always room for improvement. Rather than redesigning the speakers from scratch, we kept the fundamental Type-R sound & style characteristics and updated them. MORE REALISTIC HIGHS The R-Series speakers use a new ring-type tweeter voice coil for increased efficiency and better tonal balance across the entire sound band, for improved overall sound quality. A MORE BALANCED TRANSITION As with many high-end speakers, the Type-R components incorporate Wave Guide technology in the form of a phase plug in the center of the woofer cone. The Wave Guide enhances in-car sound dispersion and helps eliminate phase distortion. Alpine’s unique Dynamic eXpander ring stiffens the cone around the Wave Guide, eliminating a big source of distortion in typical designs caused by cone flexing.

<span>Incredible range. Rocks my doors like a sub on the lows and the tweeters(with proper db adjustment) deliver crisp, clean and clear highs. Cant say a bad thing about these speakers. Naturally, to get the most (or even close to most) out of these killer components, you'll need an amplifier suited to feed them.</span>

<span>I’ve always bought alpine products for my trucks, but to be honest I prefer the old type r’s to these r series speakers. It may just be the Stock speaker location in my new truck but the tweeters sound more harsh than the older models silk dome tweeters.(and this is the first set of the r-series) Don’t get me wrong it’s still a great product and sounds awesome. I just prefer the old ones. I currently have an alpine Ilx-207 paired with the new bigger power pack amp.</span>

<span>Great for medium budget sound, not premium. But it is only a 6.5” so not a lot of bass. But the midrange and high are fantastic at this price. I added the Walmart 10” sub and these CV’s make the total system fantastic. Would def buy again</span>

<span>When I decided to start building a system in my car I remembered that Cerwin Vega always had the most powerful sound with low power systems.  After installing these speakers I've actually considered not even adding a subwoofer. Strong, clear sound for all genres of music with my oem head unit.

<span>Replaced factory speakers with these. Took me 30 minutes total. Huge sound improvement over factory. Nice highs and mids and surprisingly good bass. It’s not a sub so you have to be realistic what you are going to get from a 6.5 inch speaker. Excellent value for the sound you get!! Would buy again.</span>

<span> Bought these to fit them into a JB74 Suzuki Jimny, both for the originally empty rear area and as a replacement for the 10cm front speakers. The speakers come with speaker wire (with ends), screws, and clips for some car mount spaces.  It also includes a template if cutting or fabrication is necessary. I purchased speaker foam tape separately for the installation. I am EXTREMELY happy with the sound quality and build quality, ESPECIALLY  for the value. For a small vehicle and a DIY job, I saw no need for a coaxial speaker with a separate tweeter. these 3-ways gave me all the sound I needed. I doubt I will even both with an under-seat subwoofer at this point. These are giving me the sound I was looking for.</span>

<span>Pretty decent-sounding speakers for a very low price. Note that no speaker wires are included (the back of the box says "Wires" as "What's in the Box," nope that's wrong. They do include grilles though. The butyl rubber surrounds will hold up long-term better than a foam surround in any dash-mounted application where the speakers will be exposed to sunlight/UV rays (like in my '05 Scion xB).</span>
