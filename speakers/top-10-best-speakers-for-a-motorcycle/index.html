<span>This speaker is fantastic! It’s almost too loud on the high end but it’s perfect. Only thing I don’t like is it it’s metal to metal. A small rubber bushing would really make this item 100%.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Having a Road King, the options for speakers are limited unless you want to spend a good deal of money. For the price of this speaker, it’s impressive.  Easy to install &amp; sounds great.  At almost full volume it can still be heard at 70 on the highway with no windshield.  The only thing I’d like more is it is had a little more bass.  To note, the bike has full Rinehart pipes on it with 4.5 in the back.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Put it on yesterday and immediately got on the highway. I have a windshield on a 07 Yamaha roadstar with an aftermarket exhaust. Anything over 80mph and you’ve got to try really hard to hear what song is playing. 80 and below is golden. If you want bass this ain’t it chief. It screams but doesn’t boom. Worth it in my opinion. (Will update if things go awry with actual quality)</span>

<span>Mounted these on my 2014 Honda Valkyrie after my JBL Cruise speakers stopped working.<br/>Pros:  Much louder than the JBL, 400 watt waterproof amp, pre-wired plug and play connectors, includes wired volume control<br/>Cons: Terrible handlebar mounts, makes very loud full volume beeps when powering on and connecting to phone - volume control has no effect on these loud beeps.<br/>The Valkyrie has 1" diameter handle bars, which is very common in the motorcycle world.  The brackets that come with the speakers utilize rubber strips to adjust for bar diameter.  Two different thickness strips are included, 1/16 and 1/4.  With the thin strips, the clamps would not hold the speakers in position.  The thick strips were too thick and would not allow the mounting stud to stick out far enough to get the nut on.  I was lucky that I had some 1/8 rubber sheet and made it work.  The wires coming from the speakers have plugs mounted to the ends, so you cannot use aftermarket clamps unless you want to cut the plugs off to pass the wires thru the clamps, and them replace the plugs.  I mounted the amp underneath my seat.  The speaker leads (approx. 4 ft) were not long enough to reach the amp after routing them where they needed to go.  The leads from the amp made up the difference tho, as they are approx. 2 ft long.  This resulted in the plug-in connectors being under my tank instead of under my seat where I would have preferred.  The lead for the volume control is long enough to allow mounting it virtually anywhere you want.  The volume control does not come with any type of bracket, so you have to find a way to mount it.  It does have a threaded shaft with two nuts, so fabricating a mount is fairly simple.<br/>Been raining here for two days now.  Have not been able to ride yet and really try them out.  My JBL's could be heard well at 60 mph, OK at 70, and not hardly at all above 75.  These are so much louder that I feel they will be fine for my purposes.  Cutting the wind noise out by using ear plugs will help you hear the stereo better at higher speeds.</span>

<span>Great sound for the cost. Bass is not the best but overall sound is good. Can hear you to 70-80 mph with full face helmet on. The quality is best below 55mph though.</span>

<span>Let me begin by saying I am not a handy person.  I am lucky to put gas in the tank.  So I had been looking at these speakers for over a year and was just intimidated by the electrical work.  I had read several reviews about using kill switches and watched various videos about how to properly wire this.  I bit the bullet and bought it a few weeks ago.<br/><br/>I continued to watch videos and even asked my father-in-law about the wiring.  I am quite proud it took me only 2 trips to the auto parts store.  I basically got everything hooked up and then set about attaching it to my motorcycle.  Honestly, the biggest challenge was attaching the speakers to the handlebars.  It would have gone much quicker if I were an octopus with fingers on each tentacle.  But I got it done.  When I hooked up the wiring and turned on the switch, I heard the beeps!  I was ecstatic!  It works!!<br/><br/>I am still working on the excess wiring and keeping it safely tucked away.  I have a few ideas though.  I just want to make sure it does not fall out, especially if I'm out riding.<br/><br/>As far as quality, the volume is not the issue.  I have yet to go above 45-50 mph with it on.  It is plenty loud for kicking around town.  Bear in mind while it does have an amp, it is just two speakers.  This is not like going to the movies or having surround sound in a man cave.  Nonetheless, it works great for just listening to your choice of music (and having other people hear it, too!).<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with these speakers.  I am so glad, too, I installed it myself.</span>

<span>Do your homework before attempting this install. A shop manual will go a long way. You will need to learn how to access your battery and which wire to splice into for 12V control power. You may also need to loosen up your tank to run the cable to the battery depending on what kind of bike you have. I installed this on a 2022 HD softail and it took some effort to get everything connected and secured.<br/>Having said all that, it is a great speaker setup and works well. Once installed, it is very easy to use and operates reliably. Sound is acceptable even at higher speeds (behind a windscreen) and just what I hoped for.</span>

<span>Mounted on my 2015 Suzuki V-Strom DL650 with GIVI Airflow windscreen and stock pipe. The bike is very quite. I do not wear a helmet.<br/><br/>Bass... They're 3" speakers. Don't expect much. You want bass? Tow a trailer behind you with a subwoofer and large amp.<br/><br/>Although they are good speakers, one thing that bugs me is that they are advertised as metal speakers. The housings are definitely plastic and the mounts are junk (most brands come with junk for mounts).  Spend another $9 or so, and get some Lamphus 3/4" to 1-1/2"mounts. The spacers are really tight on the Lamphus mounts, so be prepared to have a second pair of hands and maybe a channel lock plier to compress the spacers enough for the screws to engage. Wrap the jaws with electrical tape so you don't scratch the mounts.<br/><br/>On to the sound quality. I'd say very good in most cases. Definately not for bass booming tunes, but for most cases you can crank them all the way up. If they distort, I back off about 3 clicks. I listen to blues, rock, pop, country, classical. No rap. Rap is... well I could rhyme here... nevermind.<br/><br/>Clarity at speed? Forget it above 65-70mph unless wind conditions are ideal. This is the case with most bike mounted speakers.  I also ride a HD Street Glide with 240 watts and 2 6" speakers mounted in the batwing fairing. This is even hard to hear at speeds over 70mph. The bigger and wider the windscreen/ fairing, the better the sound. Get the wind decibels down if you want to hear more from ANY speakers.<br/><br/>The best thing about these compared to others is the fact that there is no external amp to take up space. The seperate controller is also nice to have. Much easier than fiddling with your phone at speed, and it's lighted.<br/><br/>Could use an external antenna for fm. I can only receive 2-3 clear stations in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, and there is no station memory other than your original scan. You then proceed forward and back with the corresponding buttons. Unfortunately on the original scan, it picks up many weak stations with nothing but static. Not an issue.  I wouldn't even use this feature unless my phone was dead.<br/><br/>I do wish they came with mirror stem mounts. Installation would be much more convenient for many applications. I can just peek over them to see an unobstructed intrument panel with them mounted as close to me as the clamps and brackets will allow.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that I'm satisfied. They are what they are, and they did meet my expectations. I would recommend them over others I have researched, and believe me, I've researched extensively.<br/><br/>One little sidenote, I don't have to haul my large Alpatronix bluetooth spreaker to bonfires anymore. I just pull the bike somewhere close and let it blast. Saves spaces in my Givi topcase for beverages and such. Not much draw from the battery,  but I do carry a jumper just in case. They get much louder and sound beter than my bulky portable.<br/><br/>That's it for now. Hope it was helpful.  I will follow up later if I run into any issues.</span>

<span>Mounted these on my Harley and they are loud enough to hear over my Pipes + Wind at 50mph.<br/>Sound quality is decent for a little 3" speaker.<br/><br/>Pros: Easy to install, bluetooth pairs quick and simple, and there is a decent choice of accessory "ports" for hooking up music; Usb, Phono Jack, Bluetooth.<br/><br/>Cons: Wiring harness is chunky so it can be difficult to route the wires.  Some wires are *insanely* long while others are a tad too short.  Be prepared to get creative.<br/><br/>This is the third of this style audio system ive put on 3 different bikes... Overall though This was the loudest and second easiest install.<br/><br/>I wish it had been availible in chrome.</span>

<span>*update* forgot to cover my bike and it rained all weekend on them. Still working great just had to clean the water droplets off then. After 8 months I still 100% recommend these. 👌<br/><br/>First off the finish in theses look great. Sound quality is clear and at 80mph behind my shield I can here it clearly. The volume control is awesome mounted it Right under my horn. Haven't tested the weatherproof part yet.<br/><br/>You do not need an extra switch for these.  If you don't know how to wire these into your accessories switch find someone that can.<br/><br/>For the mounts, the rubber pieces that came with it did not fit my bike with 1in bars. The thin ones were too small and the thick ones were too big. Went to Ave and got a sheet of rubber that was double the size of the thin one and it worked great.<br/><br/>I love these and for reference I have a vulcan VN2000. 2000cc bike with cobra pipes with no baffles and I can here them At highway speeds. Use an equalizer to take out the bass though these weren't made for bass. I have my Spotify on the "rock" setting and it works great.<br/><br/>Hope this helps</span>

<span>Sound Quality: I am loving the speakers. I own a HD Breakout with open pipes, no windshield and up to 70mph I can still hear the music. Of course that the sound quality decreases due to wind noise and when I throttle up but it is expected.<br/>Con: The installation brackets cannot be removed unless you detach the connection plug and it can damage the product. The kit should come with at least 3 different bracket sizes and they should be easily released from the wiring.<br/>Waterproof: So far no issues with that. Works perfectly.<br/>Volume toggle: not the best. Boss should develop a wireless control for the system. I went online and bought one for my phone. Fixed it on the handlebar and it works flawlessly.<br/>Installation: they’re fairly easy to install. I’ve managed to fit the amp Underneath the seat and it worked great. You’ll have to check the screw nuts once in a while for they become lose as you ride due to bike vibration. Only the brackets that were a little bit short for the handlebar so the nuts barely touched the screws forcing me to bend the brackets a little bit and I couldn’t use any of the rubber protectors, used a black duct tape.<br/>Price: Great speaker for the price. I had a GoHawk Halo before and there’s no comparison between those two. Strongly recommend the poduct.<br/>Hope it helps.</span>

<span>First of all I want to say I am very pleased with this system. The system works well. And is plenty loud enough to hear on the highway. Bass is satisfactory but given that there is no subwoofer there is a limit to the bass. The mounting the speakers is very simple and straightforward. Mounting the amp is trickier since you have to find a safe spot on your bike but then it’s easy too. As far as wiring the system with some basic know how you can do this yourself because paying a shop to do it will get expensive. Think double to triple what the system cost to buy the system.<br/>If you are going to install yourself some things to know:<br/><br/>First if you want to wire it directly into the battery you will need a rocker on off switch if not you’ll need to know where you can find a wire that is only love when the key is on. I personally wired mine to my headlight wiring at the battery.<br/><br/>Second you may need to extend the wires depending on your vehicle’s size I personally added a foot to give me some slack on the wires. This means you may need to buy wiring and tools to link the wires.<br/><br/>Third you will want some kind of zip or cable ties to keep the wires running neatly.<br/><br/>Fourth you will want to be familiar with your vehicle. I have a Honda Shadow 750 I mounted this on and the best way to wire a bike is following other cables on the bike which means going under the tank. Typically this is simple and it sounds a lot harder than it is.<br/><br/>Fifth this is not a tool free install you need a wrench to tighten the speaker nuts and any tools you need to get to your battery and wherever you want run the wires.<br/><br/>Last don’t get discouraged. This is not a hard install just don’t expect to just plug in and go this will probably take you a couple hours to do right. But it’s worth it. Also there is a video on YouTube where a guy installs this exact system that may give you an idea</span>

<span>Speakers worked great for 3 years. They started to go bad this year. They were out in the elements most of the 3 years. If properly taken care of might have lasted longer. Only part that went bad was the sound quality dropped and it started to be more fuzzy sounding.</span>

<span>Theses have been awesome, put them on my fourwheeler they have gotten wet so many time can’t even count it on 2 hands I have sprayed water on the front of it to get mud out of the speaker still worked perfectly fine only complaint I have is that my Bluetooth is a little iffy has to be close to amp to really even work good but to me they sound fine. And will 100 percent but Agian for another fourwheeler or something. And for a 100 dollars it’s a steal if you ask me. Beats having headphones in your ears where you can’t hear over wind 😂</span>

<span>I have had other similar speakers on bikes before with mixed results. Nothing will ever be as satisfying as a full factory installed sound system however, you pay dearly for that as well.<br/><br/>I have had these on the bike about 2 weeks now and spent one full day riding and another short ride running errands. I didn't install right away because I was trying to decide where/how to locate the amp.  I wanted to put inside a waterproof plastic box and mount under the rack on back of sissy bar however I decided not to go that way because I was afraid of overheating. I tested a day with it up front under the steering neck area attached to frame however the supplied silicone cover for ports was gone within the first mile and since it is not rated as waterproof and this cover was now gone I decided for a temporary location inside saddlebag.  The bag it is in is basically empty so it had a lot of room and air around the AMP however after an 90 minutes of riding I went to turn it off and it was super hot to touch. I turned it off, went to lunch and an hour later came out turned on and had to pair it to my phone again to be able to stream music :-(<br/><br/>The first ride after install I had to jump start bike but I thought it was because I had things on for extended period of time when installing and tweaking. Later throughout the day no issue bike started right up but each time I had to pair phone to the AMP again. It would show in list but would not connect and I had to delete device and pair again. Then it was fine until I turned the power off again :-(<br/><br/>about 10 days after last ride I went to start bike to run a few errands and it was dead. I didn't have time to jump so I took car. 3 days later I went out to jump and ride to work and it is so dead it wont even take a jump start. Took battery to be tested and it was at 4 volts. Charging overnight tonight to try and test tomorrow and see if battery is toast or not.<br/><br/>The sound was ok from the speakers. I mean I didn't expect super high end just wanted to be able to hear without distortion and when I would keep phone volume no higher then 3/4 I could get AMP up loud enough to hear at 75 MPH and not have distorted sound. That said having to pair the device every time I turn on bike is not going to work for me.  I can not speak to lifespan pf speakers I see many had single speakers die but I have only been able to ride one day with them so not enough time to say if they will last.<br/><br/>Between running battery down in just a few days even when off, not being able to stay paired properly after a power down and how hot the unit runs I am overall not happy with these and I am going to look into return/exchange and see if I can have better luck with another brand.</span>

<span>I installed this stereo on my 1997 Honda Shadow ACE 1100, and it works very well.<br/><br/>Install: I had to improvise a little mounting the speakers on the handlebars - the brackets were too big to clamp down on the handlebars, and the rubber-spacing strips included were too thin, and too thick. So I cut some strips from an orange rubber mat I just happened to have, that were just the right thickness. I ran the speaker cables under the gas tank, and under the seat. The included wires were just barely long enough, with the connectors ending up under the seat (beside the air filter, which is centered under the seat on this bike). I mounted the main box of the stereo in my saddle bag so it's out of the way and protected (I'll control it with the wireless remote). I had read some reviews that the unit still draws a little power even when it's turned off, which drains the motorcycle battery - therefore I installed an extra switch that totally disconnects it from the battery (I installed this in the corner of my saddlebag, so I can snake my finger in and turn it on/off without opening the saddlebag.<br/><br/>Use: The main feature I liked on this stereo is that it will play mp3 files on an SD card (you could also put them on a USB stick, but that sticks out farther, and prevents the protective waterproof rubber cover from fitting). It's also cool that it has an FM stereo in case I get tired of my songs (be sure to read the directions on scanning/pre-programming the local FM channels!) I just use an old flip-phone so I haven't tried playing music via bluetooth yet, so I can't say how easy/good that is. One thing I was pleased to find is that when I turn it off/on via my power kill switch, it still remembers what song I was playing on the SD card, and resumes where I left off. The wireless remote is a nice touch - right now I've got it hanging from the handlebar, but I might put it in a more secure place later.<br/><br/>Seems to be a pretty cool little stereo - I recommend it!</span>

<span>The system is easy to install and had really good sound quality even when turned up.  Radio, SD card slot and Bluetooth work great.  However, the primary way to control the system is the remote and it is poor quality and does not operate consistently out of the box.  Buttons do not always work,  have to press hard.  For this reason I have downgraded the number of stars.</span>
