Get everything you need for a great sounding home theater speaker setup in a single box! You get four satellite speakers and a center channel speaker for the mid- and high-range audio signals, plus an 8-Inch powered subwoofer to handle the low frequencies. All the speakers come with an attractive black finish and convenient spring-loaded signal connectors. The center speakers use two 3-Inch shielded mid-range cones, while the satellites employ one 3-Inch cone and a 1/2-Inch dome tweeter. However, don't let the small size fool you! These 8 ohm speakers will handle up to 125 watts of power from your home theater receiver at frequencies from 150 Hz to 20 kHz. The subwoofer is powered by a 60 watt (RMS) amplifier, driving a downward firing 8-Inch cone. It can take either line or speaker-level inputs, so can be used with any amplifier, even older amps without dedicated subwoofer outputs. The subwoofer handles frequencies between 50 Hz to 250 Hz and includes adjustable crossover frequency and volume balance controls. Also included in the box are four C brackets for mounting the satellite speakers to the wall and the necessary hardware for mounting the speakers to the brackets. A pair of plastic feet to properly orient the face of the center speaker is also included. Note that you will need to provide your own hardware for mounting the C brackets to the wall or other vertical surface. Don't let the low price fool you! This speaker system sounds great and will fill your room with high-quality, full-spectrum sound! Note: The speaker wire connectors on each unit comfortably accept a maximum 16 gauge speaker wire. For best results use pin-type speaker plugs to make the speaker connections and banana or pin-type plugs to connect the wires to your amplifier.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got this set for a secondary surround sound system in a project/hobby room. It's not my primary home theater, and of course doesn't really compare to it.  However it works very well for a budget setup.<br/><br/>It's very compact, and includes "C" brackets for each of the four primary speakers. There are also stick on foam spacer pads for each speaker so when they are mounted in the brackets, the eliminate vibration from the mounts and scratches as well.<br/><br/>The center channel speaker gets a couple of optional rubber feet. The are small and may be accidentally thrown out, so be on the lookout for them.  Due to the shape of the center channel speaker, the feet help keep it from pointing up too far, towards the ceiling.<br/><br/>The subwoofer is powered, down firing, and has basic frequency and volume adjust knobs.  The inputs are line level RCA, or speaker level spring clips.  The biggest concern is getting the subwoofer out of the shipping box.  The speaker is exposed and it's very easy to grab it in a way that let's you poke you fingers through it.  So watch out for that.<br/><br/>The the terminals on the center and primary speakers use more unique type of spring clips.  They will accept bare wire or pin plugs.  They will not accept banana plugs.<br/><br/>The overall sound is clear and gets to a decent volume level without distortion. Music is just ok sounding, but these are meant for surround sound.<br/><br/>I added a pair of monoprice mp-t65rt tower speakers as the front speakers.  This turned it into a 7.1 surround system.  The towers added a fair amount of mids and helped open up the lows so music sounded much better.<br/><br/>The only things you will need to get to make this work with most home theater setups are a reciever,  some wood screws or drywall screws, speaker cable and an RCA "Y" cable.<br/><br/>Overall the 5.1 package is a good, budget surround setup, that can be made great with the addition of the tower speakers.  It's almost a perfect match.  If ypur looking for a basic surround setup, for a small to mid sized room and at budget price, you will be happy with this package.  I would suggest the t65rt towers be added or replace the two front speakers to really make it shine.</span>

<span>I'll start this by destroying my credibility.  I am not an audiophile, and this is my first surround sound system worth the name.  I did, however, do a massive amount of research before buying these.  This is going to be long, so the TLDR on this is:<br/><br/>These are great speakers for the price, and will probably be more than adequate for the needs of anyone who is not an audiophile. They are also better than many $600-$800 sets in terms of frequency response curve and general sound reproduction. They will not have the same build quality or design aesthetic as these premium sets, but look fine, and are made well. You won't regret buying these unless you have much more exacting standards than the average person, and even an audiophile would be satisfied with these as a second room/vacation home setup.<br/><br/>So, the rest:<br/><br/>I was originally settled on the Energy Take Classic 5.1 set. (which has become the long standing gold standard of affordable 5.1 speaker sets)<br/></span>

<span><br/> But, a price bump on those right when I decided on them led me to do some re-shopping.  After reading and watching the CNET review on these, I started looking in to them seriously.  I suggest you check out that review.<br/><br/>These speakers are actually the replacements to the Monoprice 9774 5.1 system.  The reason those were replaced was due to a patent lawsuit because they were exact clones of the Energy Take Classic 5.1 speakers.  Nearly identical form factor, Identical internal components, and most interestingly, identical performance and frequency response curve.  But over $100 cheaper than the average price of the Energy speakers.  So that wasn't going to last, and it didn't. For a while there, they were hands down the best speaker per dollar that could be purchased.  These Monoprice speakers are just enough different to dodge another lawsuit. The surprise is that in some respects, they are better than the speakers they replaced.  The consensus seems to be that they provide a more satisfying over-all sound than the Energy Take Classic. I can't speak to this because I'm not in a position to directly compare them.  But everybody that has seems to agree that these are either equivalent or better. The fact that they're cheaper doesn't hurt one bit.<br/><br/>Another advantage is that if you want to add two speakers and make this a 7.1, Monoprice actually sells you two more matching speakers for about $80.<br/><br/></span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Monoprice-Premium-Home-Theater-Satellite-Speaker-Black-110800/dp/B00IACEN3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Monoprice Premium Home Theater Satellite Speaker - Black (110800)</a>
<span><br/><br/> Energy only sells the satellite speakers for their set as a package.  And though exactly matched speakers in a 7.1 isn't mandatory, it certainly makes it easier for your receiver to blend.<br/><br/>These are a recent purchase, so I can't speak to how long they will last. I can say they sounded great to me right out of the box, and the spring connectors were super easy to use.<br/><br/>Important notes:<br/><br/>Break in Period:  Don't blast these things full volume until you've been using them for quite a good little while.  A couple of weeks of regular TV watching should do it.  This type of speaker needs time to loosen up and mellow out.  Skipping this step is a really good way to permanently damage your sound quality.  They're actually supposed to sound even better after being broken in, as well.<br/><br/>Subwoofer Cable:  if you order these, you need to get a shielded RCA splitter subwoofer cable. (one male connection that splits to two male connections)  It will actually run ok off of a single RCA into the white input, but spend the extra $6 and do it right.  They're all over amazon.  I almost took off a star for them not including this, but I just couldn't make myself do it. The speakers themselves are just too solid.<br/><br/>Speaker stands:  A lot of people make the obvious (and incorrect) assumption that the Monoprice speaker stands will fit these Monoprice speakers perfectly. (go figure!)  They don't.  They work, but only if you mount the speakers upside down. I ordered some that are on the way. If those work out, I will edit this review.<br/>Edit:  They didn't really work out.  I'm using them, but they aren't ideal.<br/><br/>Anyway, you should just go on and buy these unless the Energy Take Classic set is at one of the periodic low dips to $250 range. At that point they become a serious contender because of a 3 year warranty vs the 1 year that Monoprice offers. (or if you have a fascination with gloss black finishes)  But that's about the only things that distinguish them from these. AND they might actually not sound as good.<br/><br/>FYI - there are some known problems with the dust covers tending to have the little plastic bits break off inside the speaker when you try to remove them.  So, if you want to use these without the dust covers, slow and steady wins the race.  I intend to leave mine on, but it is something to be aware of.</span>

<span>A lengthy review follows so for the TL;DR version:<br/><br/>Great budget speakers for a small living room or bedroom once burned in and are vastly superior to HDTV speakers or a soundbar. Highly recommend if you don't have the money for a $300 range set of speakers or just want to get your toe wet in surround sound setups.<br/><br/>Updated February 25, 2017:<br/>Still a good bargain.<br/><br/>Having since upgraded the living room surround sound speakers, I've moved these to my PC along with a cheap used 5.1 receiver but with a different subwoofer. They work very well in a "near field" environment of desktop and three feet away especially in gaming. More details at the end of the review.<br/><br/>Updated 1/29/2016 Long version:<br/><br/>When it finally became unavoidable that I'd have to retire my lashed up 5.1 system consisting of a Creative Labs Dolby and DTS decoder and Gateway BA-7900 speakers, I had to get some surround speakers fast and cheap. Reviews of the 108427 were good enough, the price was right, Prime shipping was fast, so I pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>First it is important to relay what kind of taste I have in speakers. Long a fan of Boston Acoustics line of musically neutral products, I value detail and fidelity over shaking the foundation of the house. Yamaha and Polk follow, while I despise Bose and Klipsch for distorting audio. More like torturing it, but that's my personal opinion and audio preferences are very personal. Genres of music listened to are rock, classical, jazz, Sinatra, Dino, electronica, soundtracks, outlaw... pretty much everything other than rap and country. Constantly shifting between music types is why I prefer neutral speakers over "warm" sounding ones.<br/><br/>The good news is these cheap Monoprice speakers are very neutral and well detailed for their price point. Better speakers can be had for 2-3 times the price including their own line. After 35 hours of burn in (a must with small speakers), the high frequencies are good, mid-range are good for movies (music is another matter), lows are shockingly good thanks to a subwoofer designed to carry a lot of the load the satellites normally would. If you are going to play a lot of music over these, you will want to either replace the fronts with bookshelf speakers or matrix everything with Dolby ProLogic II or DTS: Neo 6. While not faithful in those modes, they cover up the weaknesses that show in stereo mode.<br/><br/>A drawback is the fussy connectors on the speakers. In fact I was sure one of the satellites was defective out of the box. Further examination revealed that some of the strands in the speaker wire had not made it through the hole in the spring loaded connector. It only took five or six strands splayed out to cause the speaker to hiss. Ten minutes of fiddling and muttering under my breath produced clean sound once all the strands were in.<br/><br/>Connecting the active subwoofer to a receiver that has a single RCA line out does not require an adaptor. Just take the stereo RCA cord included and plug in only the white jack to to the line out and the white line in jack. Works just fine since it is a mono signal in the first places, though I found on my set that more bass was delivered through the white line in than the red. It may be designed that way like more expensive subs.<br/><br/>8/19/2017<br/>I was wrong about the subwoofer only needing one RCA jack to work effectively. Taking a peek into the enclosure, it became obvious from the wiring that the 8" driver is a dual voice coil at 8 ohms each. This means you NEED a mono to stereo adaptor to get the full sound if you go off a receiver's subwoofer out jack. Otherwise the driver only moves half the air it should!<br/><br/>Another review complained the speakers are very directional and I found this to be true. The design of the cabinets is that the drivers sit behind a shallow horn for both the tweeters and midwoofers which limits their off axis performance. While terrible for music, this is an actual plus for movies that have dedicated surround sound mixes or for gaming.<br/><br/>Blu-rays of were used to test different surround mixes: TRON: Legacy was used to test DTS-HD 5.1, The Hunt for Red October for Dolby TrueHD, and The Conversation in DTS-HD 5.1. The first two I played to gauge the effectiveness of surround cues with the last movie used to hear how a dialogue heavy movie would fare. Directional cues are excellent making it a joy to listen to modern movies. The torpedoes in Red October zoomed around nicely with the tweeters really adding to the ambiance inside the submarines. The center seems a trifle weak, but it isn't a dramatic imbalance and can be adjusted at the receiver level. The sub is ridiculously good for a cheap 8", managing to be detailed and still able to make your ribcage vibrate when LFE is used in a scene like the dance club in TRON: Legacy. Just don't expect much lower than 40 Hz<br/><br/>Though small, the Monoprice 108247 speakers need some oomph to push them. They really don't perform until they start getting loud. For reference, the speakers are hooked up to my Sony STR-DN1010 receiver that is rated to 110 watts per channel. Music doesn't fill out until above 40 volume, while movies and TV require at least 35. Yes, they can get loud as long as you have a decent enough receiver to drive them. Remember to calibrate the speakers with your receiver if you can and make sure the crossover is set to 160 Hz.<br/><br/>Part of my putting together the new surround setup involved assistance from two three month old kittens. As a result, I can report that the speakers are fairly tough units able to survive a 3 foot drop with only the grill popping off. Of course, I don't advise trying this at home, kids.<br/><br/>Love the movie performance, but playing music over them left much to be desired. Consequently, a pair of Insignia NS-SP213 bookshelf speakers have replaced the fronts. Currently they are burning in and I forgot to get the banana jacks to turn the setup from 5.1 to 7.1, so I'll update this review later with the results of that.<br/><br/>1/29/2016: While I still haven't gotten the 7.1 up and running, the NS-SP213 speakers up front blended in much better than expected with the 8427 set. Stereo music is very enjoyable now with the subwoofer perfectly overcoming the low end weakness of the new fronts. Though auto calibrated by the Sony receiver again, the center volume had to be manually bumped up a couple of decibels to overcome it being drowned out in the mix. In fact, I'm wondering if the calibration is what made the center seem weaker in the first place.<br/><br/>To anyone interested in playing music over these speakers, I highly recommend adding a pair of bookshelf speakers to the mix.<br/><br/>Also did some testing with and without the metal grills and found little discernible difference with the 80247 satellites, unlike the Insignia pair which need to have the grills off.<br/><br/>February 25, 2017<br/>Two of the satellites and the center now are being used with my PC via an old Sony 5.1 receiver. The directionality mentioned earlier is terrific for playing video games that use proper surround cues -- there's no sneaking up on me now!<br/><br/>The subwoofer is also in service, but in the home gym/hobby room filling in the void for some deep bass deficient stereo speakers. Being able to wire the hot stereo outs to the speakers is a nice plus on such a bargain unit.<br/><br/>I've also taken apart the remaining unused satellites to get a look at construction and was surprised at what I found. Though finding a capacitor bridging the woofer to tweeter wasn't a shock (it prevents lower sound frequencies from frying the tweeter), the polyfill mat to dampen sound was. The back of the plastic cabinet also seems to have been designed with the option to put a full crossover in! Build quality is better than expected for something this low priced leading to some mad scientist experiments on the spares.</span>

Product Description   The versatile, easy-to-place ProMonitor 800 delivers clear, high-definition sound and spacious imaging in a compact design. The speaker features Definitive’s proprietary BDSS driver coupled with a pressure-driven low-frequency radiator, a pure aluminum dome tweeter and a non-resonant PolyStone speaker cabinet that together produce rich, warm lifelike audio with smooth high-frequency reproduction. The speaker offers a range of placement options – securely positioned on a stand or shelf or mounted on the wall or ceiling. A mainstay in the acclaimed Pro Series, pair the ProMonitor 800 with a ProCenter 2000 and any Definitive Technology powered subwoofer for a complete home theater sound system.   From the Manufacturer   The ProMonitor 800 is Definitive's mid-sized satellite speaker in the acclaimed Pro Series. Four ProMonitor 800s along with a ProCenter 1000 and ProSub 800 makes a complete ProCinema 800 system. All the components of the system are packed and sold separately allowing you to mix and match Pro Series components to build the system that best suits your needs. Small size speaker has remarkable sophistication and huge sound Easy to place with the built-in keyhole mount. View larger Bass radiators enhance low frequency performance for more true-to-life sound Rubber-tipped tripod stand ensures slip and mark-free shelf mounting Don't let the ProMonitor 800's small size and affordable price fool you -- it is a remarkably sophisticated product with huge sound. The 800 incorporates many of the same technologies as Definitive's top-of-the-line models including BDSS drivers, pure aluminum dome tweeters, and planar pressure coupled mid/bass radiators for home theater sound quality that will shock your friends and family when they hear your system for the first time.The Secret to Their Big SoundCompeting satellite speakers of this size usually have weak lower-midrange response; that part of the audio range that contains the "warmth" and "body" of voices and musical instruments. Listen to a male vocal on typical small satellite speakers and you will instantly hear the weakness in the lower midrange. The ProMonitor satellites avoid this critical problem by pressure-coupling exclusive BDSS technology driver to an equal-sized mid/bass radiator cleverly placed on the top of the satellite. This technique doubles the lower-midrange radiating area of the speaker without increasing the size of the enclosure. You'll enjoy the kind of rich, warm and life-like sound quality that you thought was only possible with big, hard to place speakers.Easy to Place, Easy to UseSmall enough to disappear in a room but beautiful when in plain view the 800 satellites can be shelf-mounted with their unique tri-lobed base, wall-mounted using the built-in keyhole mount or optional ProMount 80 articulating pivot mounts, or stand mounted with their optional ProStand 600/800 floor stands (sold separately). The SoundSonically, the ProMonitor 800 satellite is a revelation in terms of achieving incredible sound at an affordable price. Their imaging is absolutely boxless, spacious and three dimensional while delivering pinpoint specificity and localization when called for. They are velvety smooth with you-are-there presence which is hard to find at any price and unheard of in this price range. The 800 is dynamic but capable of great subtlety so it excels equally with music or movies.

<span>I bought two for a small room and I do have some other small speakers to compare to. That said, I thought these were clear and the blend between the mid-driver and tweeter was one of the better sounding combinations that I have heard, but I did not care for the lower end of the mid-bass reproduction. I felt like the woofer was "chuffing" as though it was working way too hard to try to make bass that it shouldn't. I took out any EQ functions and it was still there--- strange part is that it did not track evenly with volume--- was there at normal levels and higher levels. No distortion at any point, but definitely you can hear it.<br/><br/>So that said, I am returning them. These may work best in a home theatre for movies, TV, etc and not as much for music. If I ever complete a larger home theatre setup, I would definitely consider these for the ancillary channels as they would blend well.</span>

<span>I recently sold my house and included my Bose Acoustimass 10 speaker system with the media room.  I researched for many days and even considered buying another Bose set.  After looking at CNET reviews (Bose was not listed in the top 10), I decided to buy the Pro Cinema 800 set.  But instead of the 8" subwoofer I bought the 10" subwoofer.  I bought all the speakers seperately (no cost savings buying the package) including my 10" Definitive subwoofer.  The satellites are a lot bigger than the Bose satellites and this helps them reproduce a fuller spectrum of sound.  The sound coming from the Pro 800 are more rich and full.  On the top is a passive radiator that works in tandem with the woofer to help radiate lower frequencies (these speakers are acoustically suspended).  The stand on the bottom is removable and there is an included plug to cover the mounting hole if you are mounting them on wall mounts (each speaker weighs about 4 pounds). The back has binding post connectors with banana conntor receptacle (female).  These speakers definitely out perform my old Bose Acoustimass 10 speaker set and cost about the same. For the money, you can't go wrong with this set.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- High gloss finish<br/>- Quality construction<br/>- Passive radiator<br/>- Rich crisp sound<br/>- Included stand<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Would be nice in documentation to add recommend cross over frequency with sub woofer</span>

<span>These speakers did not perform as I had hoped for my particular application. In this case, that means placed in a near-field set up about 6 feet apart at ear level. In this setting, I could not place the speakers either very far from walls or from corners created by furniture. In short: a pretty typical near-field set up.<br/><br/>These are beautiful to behold. The finish is really slick, and the enclosure has a nice solid feel.<br/><br/>I listened for many hours to different types of music ranging from classical, to rock, jazz, instrumental, and singer/songwriter. I ran a number of my 96k/24bit tracks through them.<br/><br/>In general I found they offer god detail in the upper ranges, but I just could not get vocals to sound right. What I found is that no matter what angle I used, or how far apart I placed the speakers, the midrange just sounded flabby and "boxy" if I sat at my desk.  If I stepped back about six or seven feet, that mostly went away, and they sounded like a typical set of small monitors that REALLY wanted a subwoofer. But, I have to work at my disk, not six feet from it. Go figure.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is an off-axis phasing issue, or interaction between the pasive radiators and my walls etc. Whatever. The issue was noticeable enough to persistently bug me in listening.<br/><br/>I was motivated by this result to go research the tweeters that had mysteriously died a couple of years ago on my old M&amp;K b1600's (not a small effort, and the replacements I found were not identical). However, after screwing in the replacements, I swapped the B1600's in where the PM 800's had been and that was that. The PM 800's went right back in the box and straight back to Amazon.  Every aspect of the audio sounded better from my actual listening position with the B1600's.<br/><br/>I acknowledge this was an unfair contest. In their day, the b1600's retailed for close to $1000/pr., and their woofers are considerably bigger (as are the enclosures). It was a relevant comparison for me due to the equipment I happened to have. But, the B1600's were basically developed as a studio monitor, and thus for situations not unlike mine. You have to consider, too, that once you work in the price of a decent subwoofer (not just a big boom-boomer), you pretty quickly find yourself dropping the same kind of money in aggregate as you would for a very able pair of bookshelf speakers that don't necessarily scream out for a subwoofer. And, yes, these speakers are wonderfully small, but a decent subwoofer is not small and is pretty much a requirement with these.<br/><br/>So, it all boils down to application. In my particular space these just didn't work particularly well. At least they got me to finally figure out the repair on my old speakers and to free up some space in the attic. Given all the positive reviews, I have no doubts that with a good sub and better placement options, these would be an excellent option. I did not test that application.<br/><br/>Three stars - not necessarily good for all applications where small monitors might be considered useful.</span>

<span>So bi-pole/di-pole haven't been popular for years and slowly seem to be fading. I believe it was something to do with they were awesome with Dolby Pro-Logic processing which was replaced with dolby digital and blah blah but these seemed to be harder for people to place due to the shape so maybe they didn't sell well?<br/><br/>I love them personally. I'm an audio enthusiast. I love good sound and if I could have the money back i've spent on audio gear over the years I'd have enough as a down payment on a house lol.<br/><br/>So these are paired up with my Yamaha receiver and Polk Audio RTI8 speakers and Csi5 center channel. They image REALLY well. I had some nice Audioengine bookshelf speakers as surrounds but I never really cared for it because I could hear the source of the audio, knew there was a speaker feeding the source and they never really just blended into the sound like a properly setup subwoofer should.<br/><br/>So figured i'd give these a try. After some research and reading, a few forums recommended I put them on the back wall since the speakers were angled already and would be like a direct speaker on a side wall pointing in the same direction.<br/><br/>War movies are easily the best to test surround with. Explosions and gunfire etc. Lord of the Rings with the huge fights and so forth and all the ambiance from being in a forest.<br/><br/>These speakers disappear. It's a really weird but satisfying experience. It sounds like there's no wall behind me. Just sound coming from behind/side of me, but you don't hear the speaker, you just hear sound. They BLEND in. Exactly what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>So the minus 1 star is for a couple reason combined.<br/><br/>1) They include poles to use banana plugs with. With the way you mount these on a wall, you'd have to have some REALLY short and small banana plugs which damn near no one makes. Maybe some nice Mediabridge ones? I didn't have any of those on hand. Amazon just started making those too but I wasn't going to order special ones for it. So prepare to buy short stubby plugs or just wire them in directly.<br/><br/>2) The keyholes they put on the hanger are tiny. You'll need screw heads that are smaller than 1/4". None of which I had on hand, ended up having to go to the hardware store. Not that big an issue as it's a couple blocks down and 12 cents a screw but there's no reason to make the holes that small.<br/><br/>3) Back to the keyhole design, they put the horizontal instead of vertical. I don't know how houses are anything are built in Canada but studs are NOT that wide. While you should always try to hang stuff like this on studs, these speakers will end up with 1 screw in a stud and another screw in the drywall, so you'll want to go get drywall anchors now too.<br/><br/>4) And this is my biggest peeve, as it is with any company. Their Canadian pride. Just like Trek here in the states. They plaster Canadian pride all over the product, the boxes etc. Like HELL YA CANADA. Which is fine. I LOVE a company that has pride in their products, except they ARE MADE IN CHINA. You're going to slap a mini cloth Canadian flag on the back of the speaker but your stuff is made in China? That's false pride. Oh goody, it's designed in Canada. Big whoop. Focal does that too but guess what, they actually hand make their own stuff and refuse to let the Chinese do it. Even on their cheaper entry level stuff, still hand made in France.<br/><br/>Trek does this same crap. Oh it's Designed in WI!! WI PRIDE YA!!!.....bikes are made in Taiwan.<br/><br/>I already knew these were made in China, they're 100 dollar speakers. That's pretty obvious, but I wasn't peeved till I got all this pro hell ya Canada pride all over the product as if they have something to be proud of with their products being outsourced to a company that isn't putting their own people to work.</span>

<span>We recently moved and I sold my old entertainment system to transfer with our old house (for a good bit more than it was worth). So I took the opportunity to upgrade the speakers in my new system even though I didn't really feel like I would get much out of it. I was using what probably amounts to a entry level polk "all in one" bundle. I rarely ever heard anything out of the surround speakers and I thought it was supposed to be like that, but these made everything much different. First of all they are pretty huge. They are nearly as big as the Klipsch bookshelf speakers I have for FL and FR. Along with that they are relatively heavy. But man. As soon as I got going with my new setup I had to turn down the rear levels from the previous setting because it was distracting. I could hear everything. We were watching Spider Man: No Way Home and paused it like 6 times during a scene with dripping water because we thought something was happening in the house. Finally realized it was just the new speakers. They sound great! They're going to stick out a bit so that's the sacrifice. I liked my old satellite speakers because they were much smaller so I was a bit disappointed when these arrived, but that immediately turned around when I realized the old ones were just paperweights plugged in to speaker wire in comparison.</span>

<span>I had originally bought these speakers for my rear-channel speakers, to complete a 7.1 surround sound set-up. After a great deal of testing, I realized the rear-channel speakers aren't that significant, so I am just using a cheap pair of Dual indoor/outdoor speakers to cover the rear.<br/><br/>Before these speakers arrived, I was using a pair of Sony SS-B1000 bookshelfs for my surround sound speakers. They did an OK job because they are decent and powerful speakers. Still, the sound was loud and harsh and subtle surround sound details were often lost in translation, against the backdrop of my subwoofer and main speakers.<br/><br/>After reading all the rave reviews on Amazon, I decided to use my Fluance AVBP2s for my surround speakers in the home theater I have set up in my family room. I have just purchased a brand new and more powerful receiver, a set of new main speakers, a new center channel speaker, and a new subwoofer.  I have since moved the Sony SS-B1000 bookshelf speakers, my old Pioneer receiver, and my old Sony subwoofer into my garage, where I have recently set up a sound system.<br/><br/>I instantly noticed a huge difference in sound engagement. For example, when I turned my system up at full blast during a movie, the sound delivery was suddenly much cleaner and the surround effects were significantly brighter and clearer, like they were intended to be. Instead of sounding like a stereo system trying to play movies like it had before, now my system sounds like a THX setup in a movie theater.<br/><br/>These speakers not only have great range, but also surprisingly, subtle timbre. The tonal quality is both unexpected and superb... at least in my opinion anyway.<br/><br/>The most outstanding feature is that they play so well with my new main speakers (Sony SSF-5000s), my new center-channel speaker (Cerwin Vegas XLS-6C), and my powerful new subwoofer (Klipsch Sub 12HG).<br/><br/>They tend to move out of the way and let my main speakers and sub drive the deep and pounding base, but still manage to play in complete harmony with my center channel speaker, in order to deliver crisp dialogue and finely detailed sound effects.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I highly recommend these speakers.<br/><br/>Note:<br/><br/>I would also recommend that you specifically use them as surround speakers, as these Fluance speakers are well made, they sound great, and the bi-directional capabilities could not be a better way to derive great sound from your 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound setup.</span>

<span>KEF knocked it out of the park with these bad boys!<br/><br/>First let me say that I am a very serious audiophile. I have worked in pro audio (both studio and live performance), and I can tell you the bitrate of an MP3 by ear. I also take my music and movies very VERY seriously. However, the wife didn't want big huge speakers on the floor of the family room or stuck on the walls, and the construction of our house prevented me from doing in-wall speakers. Flat panel speakers were the only real option other than just using the TV speakers (her idea) which is completely unacceptable, right? So, when building out my "designer" home entertainment system, I was expecting to have to make some sacrifices in the quality of my soundstage. KEF had other plans though...<br/><br/>To be fair, these simply are not full range speakers, nor are most home theater speakers on the market. They NEED a subwoofer and a good one at that. The only weakness (as is to be expected) is in the lows and low-mids. However, when paired with an appropriate subwoofer (one that is comfortable up to 100Hz) and a decent receiver/amp, the sound out of these speakers is simply AMAZING. They perform flawlessly up to reference levels on both music and movies. Their sound is flat, balanced, and very accurate. The soundstage they throw feels massive. Their power handling is great and can accurately reproduce all 90 watts of discreet amplification that my Denon puts out. I have yet to hear them clip or distort on anything that I've thrown at them from EDM to acoustic to cinema. I think they really shine brightest when watching a live music blueray. The bank escape scene in "Heat" also reached a new level of awesomeness when heard on these speakers. They simply blow me away.<br/><br/>I have a hard time believing that anyone would be disappointed with these speakers. Oh and did I mention that they're flatter than a pancake and look really sexy? Yeah, that too.<br/><br/>For reference:<br/>Denon AVR-1712<br/>KEF T301, T301C, and CI160SR<br/>SVS SB12-NSD</span>

<span>Had to replace my Kef i90's as my 1 year old was getting too close.<br/><br/>Using them with my Onkyo NR709.<br/><br/>So i stayed with kef and installed these on my wall besides my TV.  Installation was easy.  But i'm not getting that full sound you I was looking for.  They do the job.  I guesss thats what you expect from low profile.  But they look great.  I'm just scared to turn them up too loud. I feel like they might damage.</span>

Ive owned a lot of set ups but for the aesthetics and ultimately the sound once dialed in this is literally a 15k set up that sounds like 500k. Wow. Now i just installed the sonos arc in my bedroom but my honest to go text to my friend who got me it was arc is good for passive listening but is absolutely no substitute for a full hd theater setup.

<span>I hooked it up through aux in bass box with RG cables directly to our TV in our living room.  We also purchased 50 feet of additional speaker wire.

<span>I had to purchase due to my other surround system going out and needed a relativity inexpensive replacement. I'm happy with the sound quality so far. The only draw back I had was the length of the wiring that came with the speakers and audio hookups.

<span>The sound is good, but the only issue I have with this is the connections available.  All connections is rca only, speakers and to television.  I have a new television which doesn't have rca connections available for audio.  And knowing that the wires for the rear speakers are NEVER long enough, I have had to always make them longer.  But with this being rca cables, I am unable to do that, so I am going to have to see if there is a such thing as a "rca extension".<br/><br/>The rca connections is the only issue I have with this audio system.</span>

Accurate Convincing High-End Sound From the moment you feel the weight of the Prime Satellite Speaker it becomes clear that no other satellite speaker has ever offered this level of audiophile design high-end components and precise build quality. Jets thunder through the sky. Bullets graze your ears. Prime Satellite Speakers simply outclass the tiny and tinny surround speakers designed to be more form than performer. These speakers revolutionize the concept of sound speakers - in fact they employ many of the same components as their bigger brothers in the Prime and Ultra lines. Strategically placed Prime Satellite Speakers create awe-inspiring realism and seamless sonic transitions from front-to-back and side-to-side. When the lights dim and the score fades in they flood your room with dynamic audio realism and action. Painstakingly voiced and sonically matched Prime Satellite Speakers are designed to blend with SVS towers bookshelves or in a system all their own for endless listening possibilities. SVS Drivers Extreme Performance and Uncompromised Fidelity Leveraging design and technology from the SVS Ultra family the Prime Satellite Speakers feature high-quality drivers and crossover components simply not found anywhere else in this segment. 1 Aluminum Dome Tweeter The 1" aluminum dome tweeter which is light efficient and rigid provides high SPL (Sound Pressure Level) with minimal distortion and the sense of utter transparency. It deploys a Finite-Element-Analysis (FEA) optimized diffuser to ensure the tweeter only has the perfect on-axis and off-axis frequency response. That way everyone in your listening room gets the best performance. Likewise since SVS shares these design traits with both the Prime and Ultra speakers both product lines can blend well with one another while offering that SVS hallmark 'airy' presentation and incredibly unveiled highs. 4.5 Woofer SVS built their groundbreaking new 4.5 bass woofer on an all-new cast A

<span>I am not sure how these speakers got such a high rating. Either they are deaf, never listened to anything better or may be fanboyism.<br/>SVS does make good subwoofers, may be have some good speakers too in Ultra series. But this Prime Satellite is not in that category.<br/><br/>These speakers indeed sounds like tin-can speakers, at higher volume they are huffing and puffing with too much port noise. The sound like voices are coming thru a pipe.<br/><br/>I got these to replace Definitive Procinema 800 for bedroom audio. Aesthetic reasons I went with small speakers and no sub and I am not expecting great base from these speakers. I was expecting these would provide something similar base like Definitive Promonitor 800 which has similar size drivers but even smaller cabinet. Having used various KEF, Definitive, Energy I was expecting the SVS sound quality to be in the same league at this price.<br/><br/>Despite less efficient, output level is not a problem for bedroom speakers and build quality is pretty good too. Problem is with how tinny and harsh these sounded.  DIrect Pure Audio mode, these sounded crap, so ran Audyssey Multi-EQ XT 32 calibration which cleaned sound a bit after few hours.<br/><br/>There are rated as 68Hz+- 3db as per SVS, but Sound and vision Test put these at 98Hz+_ 3db(Check Sound and Vision Prime Sattelite 5.1 review, test bench results). That explains one of the reasons why these sounds so horrible, these could not reproduce vocal low-registers properly. Forget about male voices.<br/><br/>I do not know how/where SVS got 68Hz+- 3Db, may be on Mars. Definitive Promonitor 800 are much smoother, cleaner, and open unlike these.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I ran these at pretty decent volume for 30+ hours to burn in. After the 30+ burn in, staging seems little bit improved, lower registers gotten tiny bit better. But that did not fix the sound signature of voices coming thru a pipe. There are hundreds of speakers that sound 10x better than these prime satellites at much better prices. May be $100, these are ok, not great speakers.<br/><br/>Build quality and sound quality are not same. As I said above, build quality excellent, but I can not believe how could SVS release such a horrible speakers. May be SVS turning into another Bose where people pay for the name not actual sound quality.<br/><br/>I do appreciate any feedback if folks thinks I need to do something special to hear the quality from these speakers. BTW, AMPs are not a problem, these are driven by pretty beefy receivers in only 2 channel mode.</span>

<span>I purchased a pair of Prime satellite speakers for my desktop audio system, which includes a 10 inch subwoofer, a Rotel amp rated at 50 wpc, and an Emotiva DAC. Source material includes music videos (classical, jazz and classic rock) and streaming movies.<br/><br/>I am very impressed by the design and the 'fit 'n' finish' of speaker; tapered (chamfered) edges and separate compartments for tweeter and mid/woofer are very uncommon at this price point (but those features are common among far pricier speakers). My speakers have the "black ash" finish; it's a vinyl wrap but is visually appealing. They're even finished on the back which again is more the exception rather than the rule for a box speaker at this price point.<br/><br/>Most important, of course, is the sound -- and these speakers do not disappoint. With proper setup (primarily to ensure that the tweeters are at ear level and that the speakers are equidistant from the listener's ears and from each other), they produce very satisfying results. They are especially good at reproducing female vocals (my favorites include Alison Krauss, Sylvia McNair and Rebecca Pidgeon)-- again, if set up properly.<br/><br/>My five star rating of the Prime satellite speakers is not intended to suggest that they're the best sounding speakers for a desktop audio system. If you're willing to spend more (a lot more), chances are you can find something that to your ears will sound even better.  I'll add that I have other speakers-- in my home theater system and in my home audio system-- that are better speakers.  (They also are MUCH larger and several times more expensive.)  But for me, for this application (desktop audio), I don't know of another speaker that represents a better combination of value, design, construction and sound quality. Highly recommended.</span>

<span>These are excellent front satellite speakers. I upgraded from an old pair of Bose Acoustimass speakers I won a long time ago. The Bose sounded similar to a pair of entry-level Polk Audio towers I also own, but the SVS speakers blew them both away. I am also using an SVS powered sub (also recommended), but the treble, mids, and staging are much, much, better than what I've tried before. Off-topic, but using the self-calibration feature on my Onkyo receiver made a further noticeable difference (and was something I ignored before; getting the cross-over frequencies and speaker distances manually is not my forte, apparently).  These sound bright without fatiguing the ears or sounding shrill, and are making old music come back to life with new details my prior speakers just weren't able to reproduce.<br/><br/> I will probably buy a second set to use as home theater surrounds, or perhaps will throw these to the back and buy larger SVS bookshelfs for the front/stereo audio use for even fuller range and musicality.</span>
