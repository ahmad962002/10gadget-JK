Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.
                   
                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Version 3 of this Wyze indoor/outdoor cam is a bargain.  The high resolution and low-light color sensitivity of the new Sony Starlight imaging chip, which it uses, is amazing.  It is significantly more sensitive than my own vision at dusk and dawn.  The camera nevertheless also has infrared imaging capability, which I do not need for my applications.  These features coupled with a multitude of other features, too many to list, and overall care to design details make this a superb choice at its current price.  There are, however, things to consider that might depend on intended application.  1. The short focal-length lens provides a 130-degree field of view.  This is great for surveillance applications, but it introduces significant barrel distortion.  Although the camera has digital zoom capability, this is at the expense of otherwise great resolution.  A version with a longer focal length lens (narrower field of view) would suit my needs better.  2. The camera is suitable for some outdoor applications but can also shoot through windows (IR imaging off).  The camera has a white body that makes the black window mount, sold separately as an accessory, a must.  It would be nice if Wyze introduces a black version to limit window reflections, as it did for the earlier Version 2 of the camera.  3. You must buy a subscription to the Wyze Cam Plus cloud service, currently as low as $15 per year per camera, to make full use of the many surveillance detection and recording features.  The annual cost is likely to go up and be significant with multiple camera installations.  4. Wyze is developing a web-based browser application, which is currently in beta.  For now it has limited functionality compared to the Android and Apple smartphone applications.  Sadly, you must subscribe to Cam Plus to access even the beta version.  Wyze should definitely make browser access free.  Time will tell how much of a long-term bargain this camera will be.</span>

<span>I installed several v3's  7 months ago. They worked well. However, Wyze was constantly requiring me to install endless updates. It seemed like every week or two. Well, the last update bricked all of my camera's.<br/><br/>Power cycling did nothing. So I took a couple of the camera's down and reset them. All of them went back on line without a problem. However, as soon as I unplugged them to reinstall them, guess what! Dead again. I reset them again--three times same result. Each time they were power cycled they went into the install mode and wouldn't come out of it so they could reconnect.<br/><br/>I called Wyze tech support and they made me repeat all the steps I had already done multiple times. Why? Because the support person doesn't know much about the cameras. They're simply reading from a help desk script, and they have to check off the boxes, or they get in trouble.<br/><br/>They tried to convince me it was my fault. The network router wasn't good enough. Too many things were connected to it. On and on. I'm an engineer so I know BS when I hear it. All the cameras worked fine including the previous updates until this last one. Then bricked. That's not a coincidence, and they know it. They've had the brick problem happen numerous times, so tech support has heard it all before. Any little info packet problem, minor power spiking, wifi signal wavering or any other type of interference can cause the flash update to go wrong. All of these things are normal and should be expected with any wifi connected equipment.<br/><br/>Wyze finally agreed to replace all of the cameras, but it took about three hours going in circles with them. I've already spent close to six hours taking cameras down, testing them, talking to tech support twice, and now I've got to reinstall all the cameras again. These are good, inexpensive cameras--when they work. Tech support is available, but watch out because every problem is caused by something on your end. They really love to blame the router.<br/><br/>Bottom line--they just don't want to replace the cameras if they can convince you everything is your fault. This time they did replace them, which I appreciate. They asked me to return the failed cameras, which I don't mind, but it's just more of my time. Of course, their engineers want to look at them. Really! They'll be sitting in a box somewhere with the other few thousand failures. They'll get to mine around 2026 when someone throws them in the trash bin. They want the cameras back to insure I'm not trying to get over on them, and get free cameras.<br/><br/>When the time I've spent is taken into consideration, these cameras aren't very cost effective. My time isn't free, even though Wyze acts like it is. We'll see how long the new ones last. If their "technical team" keeps updating every few weeks like they're doing now, they'll brick some more cameras. It's the risk of e-prom updates. I would skip the updates, but they pop up a nag screen every time I open a camera. It's annoying. Clicking "don't show again" is just another waste of time. Customers aren't sitting around waiting for every minor change in the software. One or two updates a year would be adequate. Let me decide if I want the updates. Oh, that won't work because some of the updates are about taking away stuff like the 12 second videos that originally came with the cameras. What a crock!<br/><br/>It takes at least an hour to set up a half dozen cameras. Each camera has to be updated from 1 to 4 times during the setup process, depending on when it was manufactured. That takes a lot of time. Then it will take me another hour plus to reinstall them. In total, this brick update will cost me 9 to 10 hours of my time, at least.<br/><br/>Wyze has better tech support than most security camera companies. It's just slow having to go through the help screen over and over no matter how many times something has already been done.  One tech support person was willing to sit on hold while I uninstalled one camera from the roof. Ok, let me whip out the ladder, climb on the roof and do that for you. I guess they wanted their lunch break.<br/><br/> At least they replaced the cameras, THEY ruined.<br/><br/>I took one of the old bricked cameras that I didn't have to send back, and I re-flashed it with a clean update. That failed also, so whatever happened during the update is permanent. That's another design flaw. There's no way to reverse an update and fix a problem. That's also a problem that should be addressed.<br/><br/>Tech Support  3 or 4 stars--depending on who happens to answer the phone.<br/>Cam V3  (when it works)  4 stars<br/>Constant Updates  1 star<br/>Camera Software  3 stars<br/>Wasting my time  1 star<br/>Wifi issues 2 stars<br/><br/>I'll use them without EVER updating them again--at least until they force an update which they do from time to time. Maybe they have a hardware problem that needs fixing! When lots of people are reporting their cameras have bricked after updates, or after a power recycle, it's not a random glitch.  When I was buying the camera's, Wyze didn't mention anywhere in their advertisements or product descriptions that I needed to have them within 10 feet of my router, or whatever they think the maximum distance should be, for them to update properly. They didn't say I had to have less than X devices connected to my wifi. Smart home devices (especially switches) show as connected even though they don't degrade the wifi signal strength except for the split second when one is activated, and the loss of signal strength is marginal.<br/><br/>The problem with their wifi strength argument is if my cameras are in a location where  they have a constant, stable wifi connection 24/7 with no problems recording video to the micro SD card, then that should be adequate wifi connectivity for an update. The previous  10 updates completed with no problems. Again, they should be asking a lot of questions about why some updates and a few random power cycling events are bricking v3 cameras. There's a solution to this problem, if they want to find it.</span>

<span>I bought this as a test against the blink can. And this one is 100 times better. The unfortunate thing is that the detection is very sensitive so things such as lightning bolts, Moths/bugs, And the suns rays can set off the motion detection. Sounds like thunder, and doors opening and closing also get Detected and send you with notifications frequently. The good thing is you can change the sensitivity of the detections and it helps a lot. The bad thing is you do need a subscription for this device if you want it to record videos or small clips.  If the notification goes off and you miss the person in the cam it doesn’t save so you will have to be super quick about it if you’re not going to buy a subscription it is worth it though. The night vision is also very bright and better than the other cameras I’ve tested. All in all worth it.</span>

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>This camera is a great starter camera. I used it as my starter and it is amazing. The focus, 4K shots, nightime view, quality, and zoom is amazing if you're starting out. It produces great photos for a long time. The battery life could be longer but that doesn't take away from how amazing this camera has been for me. 5 Stars. 100% reccomend to starters and/or sports photographers</span>

<span>I am not a fan of this camera. First and worst, in 360 mode, the output files are in a proprietary format that requires an app to post process the video into a format that can be edited on a PC. This app will only run on a computer running windows 10 or 11. So in 360 mode it's a lot of work to get a usable video.<br/>UPDATED:<br/><br/>After upgrading my PC to win 10, I find that the GoPro player is unable to export a video. I have spent many hours with customer support but at this time, several reps have admitted to me that many users are unable to export videos and it is a big problem. Customer support can only elevate the issue to the engineering team. They have stated many times that they will get back to me with a solution but never do. Therefore,  I am forced to return this camera in favor of the install. This has been nothing short of maddening dealing with GoPro!<br/><br/>The app for a phone or tablet is very buggy and after you get your video edited, you still cannot convert it to MP4 so it can only be viewed on the tablet.<br/><br/>Customer support is non existent and the manual is not very helpful. Instructions for the app don't exist.<br/><br/>In hero mode, this camera will make a pretty good video but the 360 mode is very hard to get a good video.<br/><br/>This thing eats battery at an alarming rate even when off. If you charge up to 100% and leave it sitting on a table turned off, the next day it will be down to 30%. If you are using it, taking video's, you will be lucky to get 30 minutes before it shuts down due to low battery.<br/><br/>It runs hot, it will get very hot when you are taking video's and sometimes, shut down due to overheating if it gets over 96 degrees F.<br/><br/>Overall, this camera is not very user friendly in 360 mode but will take a decent video as a normal camera. For the price, there are better options out there.</span>

<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>Update: the video quality is so much better than the original Mevo.  Some helpful hints if you have a large auditorium and you want to zoom in this is not the camera for you.  We stream to FB and YouTube live.  We only have 22 YouTube subscribers for our channel.  So in order to go live on multiple platforms you need another software to do that.  We use Vimeo.  To go live on YouTube you must use the RTMP button on Mevo.  Set up your stream on YouTube Studio and get your URL and streaming key to paste into Mevo.  Great thing is the Mevo will save it and YouTube doesn’t change it for a new stream when you reuse your settings.  Once everything is programmed into the Mevo it gets much easier to go live.  Again the video quality with the Mevo Start is so much better than the Mevo Plus.  We spent about $800 for the original and this was only $399.  You get your monies worth if you can leverage all its features.  Also if you are being asked for constant firmware updates which Mevo are you using and is your app updated.<br/><br/>Our church has been using the first generation Mevo for over three years.  We didn’t realize how outdated our Mevo camera was.  The video streaming began to get worse and we kept losing signal and the audio was terrible.  I went looking for another camera but Mevo still came up in the top.  I looked at the specs of the Mevo Start and realized how outdated our original Mevo was.  Today we streamed our service for the first time using Mevo Start and people complemented our video on how clear it was.  We had no audio issues or dropped internet.  We also didn’t have to plug it in since we stream for about 2 hours.  We always liked Mevo and they have made streaming affordable for our church.  This Mevo Start addressed most of our issues with the first Mevo we had.  Also the price has gone down from what we paid for the original Mevo.  It is worth the price.  It does so much more than just record video.  I love the app also.</span>
