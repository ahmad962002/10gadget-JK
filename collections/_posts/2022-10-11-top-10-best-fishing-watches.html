Product Description   Introducing the new Pro Trek PRW2500R, a high performance tool developed under the supervision of meteorologists to take on challenging environments. Like all triple sensor Pro Trek models, the PRW2500R features easy-one-touch operation of its Altimeter/Barometer, Compass and Thermometer. A reconfigured duplex LCD layout provides optimal upper & lower LCD layout for information at-a-glance when you're on the go. In addition to numerical and trend graph data, unique arrow icons help to indicate characteristic barometric pressure patterns. 200 meter water resistance has also been employed to ensure strong water resistance for river trekking & rafting where one would encounter strong water pressure. The addition of tide & moon graph/data provides convenient information for sea kayaking and fishing. Black resin band digital watch with neutral face. Accuracy: +/- 15 seconds per month (with no signal calibration)   Brand Story   CasioWith the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Awesome device, never dies with little sunlight even. Now, if only it had a glare proof screen</span>

<span>Overall, I like this watch but it is diminished by the other Protreks that Casio produces.<br/><br/>PROs:<br/>-Good features; ABC, moon, and tide<br/>-200m water resistance --&gt; no second guessing if this needs to get wet<br/>-Solar recharge --&gt; no worry about a dead watch mid-use<br/>-Atomic timekeeping --&gt; accuracy is maintained daily<br/><br/>CONs:<br/>-ABC features are very slow<br/>-Light button (a feature accessed when visibility is limited) shares space with the adjust button<br/><br/>If this was a stand-alone watch from Casio, I think it would shine more.  When I use my PRG-300 or PRG-270 watches, I appreciate how fast each ABC function responds when I push the corresponding buttons.  I push the compass button on a PRG-300 or PRG-270 and I'm looking at a direction in less than a second.  I push the compass button on the PRW-2500 and its second screen gives me some type of graphical flourish for a second or so before it goes blank then displays directions.  This is true of all ABC functions.  If I didn't own the other two Protrek models, this wouldn't seem like a drawback but the PRW-2500 seems like a slow tank compared to others.<br/><br/>The PRW-2500 has its place among the Protrek models, though, so please don't take my criticism of the unnecessary graphics and slow feature response as license to skip out.  The PRW-2500 has two features that make it stand out among its peers.  First, it will adjust its time to atomic clocks automatically.  Second, and more importantly, it has a 200m water resistance.  I would not call this a dive watch; it wasn't designed as such and buttons shouldn't be pushed under water anyhow.  In that sense, a Protrek with a 200m rating is no more a dive watch than one with a 100m rating.  The 200m rating does, however, suggest that it can be used with more force or in more forceful environments than a 100m watch.  What this means to me is that I would confidently wear the PRW-2500 white water rafting and swimming for extended times where I'd only wear the other Protreks canoeing and swimming for short periods.<br/><br/>In summation, if you're operating in rough environments, consider the PRW-2500 over other Protrek models for its 200m water resistance.  If that or the atomic timekeeping don't sway you, then check out the PRG-270 or the PRG-300.</span>

<span>There are only two downsides to this watch. 1. ( this is just my opinion) There is not a version that shows sunrise and sunset data. That is infinitely more useful to me than a tide graph since I live in the middle of the united state where it's just fields of grain and red dirt EVERYWHERE. No oceans for at least 200-300 miles. The tide graph IS super cool though and does work for those that can use it. You can press the adjust button to swap between showing the tide graph or showing the year. 2. The battery takes FOREVER to recharge. From zero I think it takes something like 179 hours of daylight to fully charge. Regular flash lights and UV flash lights won't charge this watch NEARLY as fast as the sun which is still super slow. If you buy this watch you are going to want to keep it on a night stand or table next to a window facing out wards. if you are a very active person this will be a non issue for you since you will be out in the sun a lot any ways. It does have a very nice power save feature that you can set though. You can tell this watch to go into a sleep mode where it shuts down everything that isn't immediately essential at a specific time you set and it won't come back on until you press a button, it reaches the time you want it to come back on, or the solar panel starts soaking up sunlight again. The ABC functions are fairly accurate. Not THE most accurate But they get the job done. i would never use this as a primary compass but in a pinch it will help you out. The rotating bezel is great for orienteering. Too many modern protreks don't have a rotating bezel anymore.  Over all it's a great watch. If you wear it everyday you won't have any battery issues. Most people never have issues with this watch. I'm not SUPER active so it's just more of an annoyance for me. Guess I need to start playing outside more often.</span>

<span>I seldom write reviews. This watch deserves one. Without a doubt, it’s the best I’ve ever owned. I will attempt to answer in this review all the questions I’ve had for the first week and assume others have as well, by feature.<br/><br/>Altimeter. Accurate. At first, I tried to calibrate it from what I thought was an inaccurate reading to the known elevation at my house. Shouldn’t have. Barometric pressures vary and in fluctuation can throw the altimeter off temporarily, from what I gather. Once it stabilized, my “calibrated” elevation was registering 250 feet low. Fortunately, there is a factory reset feature for the sensor. Reset it, and boom. Spot on. No touchy for me.<br/><br/>Barometer. Excellent. With a barometer function the exact reading is worth very little, as elevation and weather systems can be relative. What’s important is trend. I can almost be my own weatherman, and the trend tracking gives me about 12 hours lead time on major changes. This is awesome.<br/><br/>Thermometer. Within +/- one degree Fahrenheit. Again, I tried erroneously to “calibrate” it using the functionality to do so. And again, once the case temperature stabilized it was easily 10 degrees Fahrenheit incorrect. And yet thankfully, again, Casio built in a factory reset of the sensor for idiots like me. Which worked. So, here’s what NOT to do. Don’t think you’ll get an accurate ambient air temperature while wearing the watch on your wrist. Instead, you should expect a (somewhat inaccurate) temperature of…your wrist. The thermometer measures air temperature after sitting 20-60 minutes away from your body heat or other influences.<br/><br/>Compass. Accurate. I prefer the cardinal direction setting, but supposedly it’s pretty spot on by degree when properly used as well. I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Tide graph. Perfect. I happen to live in a preset city that the programmed charts have on record. The watch is right on track with my local tide tables and any app I set to the measurement location.<br/><br/>Sunrise/sunset. Also properly programmed by location.<br/><br/>Fishing time probabilities:  These are based on solunar theory and relative moon location. Good explanation of the calculations in the full manual version found online. Spot on, and also tracks with my son’s $22 Casio Fishing Gear programming.  For the record, solunar theory and related moon age and location is only ONE of the factors affecting fish activity. There are so many more, like time and weather, location, salt or fresh water, etc. Ultimately, fish do what fish do, but regarding moon location, my watch is properly programmed.<br/><br/>Accelerometer/step tracker:  Could be better, could be worse. When I’m NOT walking, it is much more sensitive than I wish and picks up quite a few extra steps. For me, I don’t mind because I learn what the differential is on my typical days and can mentally subtract the erroneous estimate of steps. Plus, I don’t mind the extra sensitivity because about half of my exercise is on a Total Gym glide board, and then I get some “credit” for my workout I wouldn’t on a less sensitive tracker. HOWEVER…when I AM walking the step tracker is deadly accurate all day. This too is more important to me, because I know my own step count per mile and I can fairly accurately estimate distance travelled with the math between two numbers.<br/><br/>What I don’t know yet is the durability…obviously, as I have only had it a week. I actually intended to buy a G-Shock, and while looking at the features hadn’t realized I had switched to the PRO TREK line of watches. When I started to return it, I researched and found that NO G-Shock unfortunately has been built with quite this many features. If one has tide graph and steps (most important two features for me), it does not have ABC sensors, and vice versa. And none of the G-Shocks currently seem to have fishing solunar charts programmed (although I think there is one in the Japan market, but again that doesn’t have a step tracker and/or the ABC sensors). So, all that to say if I want all these features (and I do), this is the watch that fits the bill. So I’ll do my best not to drop it off a ten story building or bury it in the mud. Hopefully, the bezel doesn’t scratch as easily as some have said it does. As long as it doesn’t look like it went through a meat grinder in a year or two, I’ll be happy.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!</span>

<span>For the money it’s pretty sweet ! The temperature feature really works ! Take it off and put it in the river for a few mins and take it out and get realistic water temps on the spot ! Tried it at place I fish where two rivers meet , one seems colder then the other and sure enough after setting watch in the one river for about 3 mins under just a foot of water for a reading of 58.7* and ck other river for 63.2* ! Pretty cool to see and know it was working !! Also the set up was a little tricky ? But after taking the time to set up right , the fish stars seem to be on the<br/>money ! Anything over 2 stars and I’m always catching fish !! Pretty neat to think you can have all this info right on your wrist and ck water temps ! I do a lot of fishing on foot in rivers and creeks so it’s good to have something to help with knowing temps and more info the better !</span>

<span>I like just about everything about this watch.  I use it primarily as an altimeter for map and compass land navigation while adventure racing.  As near as I could tell, the altimeter tracked well after factoring in changes in barometric pressure.  The display is a bit dim in daylight, but I was always able to read it.  My teammate has a similar watch, and both read reliably within a couple feet of each other.<br/><br/>My one complaint is the number of button presses required to recalibrate the altimeter when crossing a point where we knew for a fact the elevation.  I didn't count, but it's gotta be 5-7 presses just to get into and out of the correct menu.  I used to run a cheapo timex or casio (can't remember) and it was a grand total of two button presses.<br/><br/>It's a minor complaint, and I'd gladly buy this watch again.</span>

<span>I like everything about this except the storm warning function doesn’t really work right. It alarms during sunny days where no clouds can be seen however we had a tornado warning very close by a few days ago and it never made a peep. Lol. I still like it though.</span>

<span>The good:<br/>-Looks good<br/>-Water resistant<br/>-Automatic toggling between altimeter and barometer depending on your activity is pretty cool.<br/>-Fairly intuitive settings for a fairly complicated watch.<br/><br/>The not great:<br/>-Very dim readout can be hard to see (more below).<br/>-Don't trust the compass.<br/>-Instructions are a little vague.<br/><br/>On the "good" side, the watch can be set up to automatically go back and forth between the altimeter and barometer function. By way of background, in order to use a barometric altimeter, you need to calibrate it regularly since the barometer will go up or down depending on the weather.  You can do this by either setting the watch to the current sea level barometer reading, OR setting the altitude to a known waypoint (i.e. the elevation of your house above sea level).  Once you do that, the watch knows that "at this time, the barometer reading is X and the corresponding elevation is Y.  Over time, you might travel uphill or downhill which will be measured by the change in barometric pressure that the watch reads. As we all know, however, the weather can also change.  Therefore when using a barometric altimeter, you periodically want to recalibrate it.  This watch has a clever function that reads how quickly the pressure is changing.  If it's changing rapidly, it will assume that you're climbing and will switch to altimeter mode.  If the "elevation" is changing gradually (or not at all) it kicks into barometer mode and assumes changes are weather-related.  As a result, the readouts stay more accurate over a longer period of time.<br/><br/>On the not-so good side, the biggest fault are the instructions which are a little vague.  For example, the factory setting for the display is VERY dim (almost unreadable in certain conditions).  The instructions don't address it, but I found online a way to do a factory reset, and one of the settings allows you to turn up the readout brightness.  Also, the to calibrate the compass initially, a "calibrate" readout pops up and you can slowly turn the watch to get the compass working.  To calibrate later on (which you WILL need to do) there is no "calibrate" setting, and you just need to calibrate it by slowly turning the watch horizontally.<br/><br/>Based on this, you never REALLY know how accurate the compass readings are unless you check it against another compass or a known direction....which kind of makes the compass function pointless.  Once the compass is calibrated correctly, it's reasonably accurate (+/- 5 degrees vs. an accurate compass) but since you never really know if it's fully calibrated, it would be risky to use in a real world situation.  When the compass ISN'T calibrated, I've had readings almost 180 degrees off.<br/><br/>Overall it's a nice altimeter/barometer/watch, but not a good compass.  Since it's a few years old now, you can find them fairly cheap, so at the current pricepoint, it's a decent buy.</span>

<span>***UPDATED***<br/><br/>First Review:<br/>I recently had a malfunction: the stopwatch function “froze” and I can’t reset or get out of the “time” mode.  I just checked and am beyond the Amazon return window (purchased in May, return window expired in June…it’s now late July).  I’ve read a ton of reviews that say the company doesn’t stand behind their product.  The jury is still out in my case so let’s see how they respond.  I’m not going to mention my occupationS or experience, that is reserved for review #2 after I see how they respond.  For the record, I also own an MC-2 Compass (made by the same company) and it’s world renowned, so I have high hopes they do the right thing.  We shall see, more to come.  July 23, 2022<br/><br/>Review #2 (September 18, 2022):<br/>It’s a good watch!  I’m in Law Enforcement (Highway Patrol &amp; Marine Unit), so I NEEDED a good watch.  This one is hard to read at night (small numbers/characters and low backlight brightness), the included “Quick Guide” (all FOUR of them) only tell a small part of the story of this watch.  To fully understand its capabilities and how to use it effectively, you’ll need that quick guide and all 33-pages of the user manual that you’ll have to download from their website.  When I said “and”, I literally mean you need them BOTH (photo attached) to understand how to use all of the functions because neither does an effective job explaining how the thing works!<br/><br/>I’m my first review I mentioned a malfunction.  Well, it ended up being operator error on my part because I literally didn’t understand that it had gone into locked mode AND I couldn’t see the teeny, tiny little padlock icon that said it was in locked mode!  Did I mention it’s hard to see/read?  That became even more challenging because I had accidentally changed the language to something other than English and what little chance I had to recover was totally gone once it changed to some other language.<br/><br/>If you wear glasses, be sure to use them whenever you’re setting or using anything other than the most basic functions (cycling through date, sunrise/sunset, stopwatch, timer, compass, altimeter, barometer).  The user interface isn’t user-friendly or even intuitive so prepare to start memorizing which buttons perform which function when you’re doing anything other than cycling through available menus.<br/><br/>Again, it’s a good watch…very good even!  I returned it for repair and they promptly returned it with the explanation that I didn’t know how to use it (those are my words, they were much more polite and professional…thanks to them for that!)<br/><br/>I was so frustrated when it was stuck in locked mode that I bought an Ironman (100m waterproof model) on-sale for $39.95.  I can actually read and manipulate its functions at night, without reading glasses and the buttons are ultra-intuitive!!!!  Sure it doesn’t have a compass, altimeter or barometer but for a basic rugged watch you can see (even at night without glasses or a magnifying glass), it’s kinda hard to beat since I swim often and waterproofing really matters.  This Suunto cost $125 on Amazon and it’s a better watch than the Ironman I just mentioned simply because of its highly advanced capabilities.  Just be prepared to do a ton of learning to use it effectively and efficiently in the field!<br/><br/>I give the Suunto Core All Black a solid 4-Stars for quality, aesthetics, capabilities, and durability.  The manual(s), display readability, and intuitive user interface all SUCK but I’m only going to dock them 1-Star for all of those because they should be easily correctable.  …it’s a very good watch!</span>

<span>The Instinct was purchased at retail price from Amazon.  No compensation was received for this review.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>I mountain biked in southern Arizona and confirmed on multiple excursions that, solo, my sense of direction was truly abysmal.  A Garmin eTrex GPS and an analog Seiko watch kept me from the lost/disoriented/helicopter rescue stuff.  The GPS/watch combo worked for several years until April when the band broke on my trusty Seiko and I lost it down a ravine.<br/><br/>Seeking a lighter and more robust solution, I bought this watch in May and write this review after 5 months of active biking and hiking.<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>The Instinct has been reviewed, praised, admired and generally pushed atop the same high pedestal as other Garmin watches and discrete GPS devices.  The Garmin legend was built with nail-tough-hardware but frustrating and needlessly complicated software.  The watch manual is an easy read and details pretty much everything that you need for operation.<br/><br/>This review will focus on user details and tips that are not detailed in the manual but may significantly flavor the decision to purchase.<br/><br/>1. The AFR (Arizona Fusion Reactor) in the sky washed out the lcd display on every watch, camera, cellphone that I have used with one exception:  this watch.  The monochrome, transreflective screen on this baby was completely legible under 12:00 noon Arizona sunshine.  Really, truly, no marketing BS – the watch face and screen text are perfectly clear.  If you live in the southwest deserts, you know exactly why I shoved this factor to the top of the list and why a Garmin watch with this screen technology should be on the wrist of every desert rat.<br/><br/>2. Constant ON Display.  Hey, no need to flip the watch up or any other nonsense to read the screen.  If you have ever owned a watch or fitness tracker that required some type of action from you to activate the screen, you will know what a RECURRENT PAIN that becomes after a while.  Anytime you want to sneak a peek at time, date, heart rate … just move your eye balls.<br/><br/>3. The fourteen day battery is - - - - a bit of a stretch.  Possibly a couch potato tracking trips to the bathroom or something but seven day battery life for biking is real.  OK – if you use the GPS and forget to turn it off, the battery life drops but with an hour of GPS per day you can easily get 6 days and 7 days if one battery bar remaining doesn’t cause you panic. Try going 7 days with your Apple or Android watch.<br/><br/>4. No touch screen.  Just a personal thing.  I hate touch screens on watches – buttons are king.<br/><br/>5. The Android phone application is polished, comprehensive and most important – it works flawlessly.  The app is covered in Garmin documentation but several things are not sufficiently emphasized.<br/><br/>a. Sleep app can be edited post data acquisition to correct bed/wake times.<br/><br/>b. Body battery includes data on heart beat variability and exercise history.  I thought the battery concept was hokey until I understood the science behind it.<br/><br/>c. Activities are specific and comprehensive.  For example, there are multiple biking activity categories that allow tailoring to the specific type that you enjoy.  This is not just a road/mountain bike choice but subsets of each type.  This is useful because the energy expended may differ within the subset and permits better estimation of actual effort.<br/><br/>d. Data ported to watch is useful.  An example is the weather information available on the watch.  Not only are the current temp and conditions shown but a second menu shows the next 4 hours of weather and the next 4 days of conditions.  Arizona weather is pretty boring (sun, sun, sun) but this is handy up north where conditions change frequently.<br/><br/>e. Bluetooth is a beast.  I do not know the “official” range but it pairs instantly with the phone and I have never lost connection.  Sometimes the watch calls out to the phone (in my car) at night and they chat for a bit. I suspect they are discussing my girlfriend.<br/><br/>f. Best of all – you do not have to use the phone application at all.  The watch is completely independent and you can leave the phone at home during your exercise.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>The Garmin Instinct addressed my biking needs/wants/expectations.  Just get over the fact that it doesn’t include the photo of your German Sheppard on the watch face, 100GB of music/video or Starlink.<br/><br/>At the end of the biking day, with the GPS off and trip data securely on the phone, the Instinct LEDs continue to flash – tracking your heartrate and beat variations.  It watches your sleep depth, duration and energy expenditures.  It even reminds you of your wedding anniversary!<br/><br/>Reading the reviews on Amazon, it is clear that some folks were not happy with the Instinct, however; in this rat's humble opinion, Garmin hit this completely out of the park and if I lose this thing in the mountains, I would purchase another one the same day (assuming I found my way home GPSless).</span>

<span>I'm not a rugged outdoorsman, but I really like this watch. I was looking for a rugged smartwatch because my last smartwatch (Samsung Galaxy Active2) only lasted about nine months even though I have an office job and my idea of exercise is walking. I've only had this watch for three weeks and it appears rugged but time will tell. The Instinct does all that I want for a smartwatch to do and more, namely:<br/><br/>1. I can easily view data I care about monitoring at a glance. In my case, I put time, date, steps, heart rate, and battery status on the home screen. There are numerous other options. No, it's not a fancy, color display, but I don't care about that. I can easily see what I want at a glance even in full sun.<br/>2. I can easily monitor notifications and text messages at a glance. When a notification, text, or email comes in, the watch vibrates and I can easily see what it is at a glance. If I decide to read the full text, email, or whatever, it's easy to scroll down and read the whole thing.<br/>3. I can easily set timers and alarms which I use regularly.<br/>4. The phone finder works well and it's easy to access.<br/><br/>This thing has just loads of other features that I'll use sometimes. But this watch does well the main things that I want a smartwatch to do at a price that doesn't break the bank. A few other items of note:<br/><br/>-The battery life is phenomenal. I wore it 10 days before I charged it the first time and I could have gone longer. I was down to one bar, so I went ahead and plugged it up at the end of the day. At the rate the battery had been draining, I probably could have gone another two or three days on that last bar. Personally, I don't mind plugging up a watch every night, but if you like long battery life, this watch has it.<br/>-I wear the watch continuously unless I'm charging it, including in the shower. No problems.<br/>-As you can see in the photos, I invested in the silicone cover for the watch. I also got a screen protector and silicone plugs for the charging port. All this extra protection is likely overkill but, like I said, I had a bad experience with regard to longevity of my last smartwatch. I also got a metal band just because I prefer metal bands.<br/><br/>The only slight downside to the watch in my view is linked to what I consider one of its strengths. Because the watch doesn't have a touchscreen (a plus for several reasons in my opinion), everything must be done by pressing buttons and some of those actions aren't intuitive. Furthermore, the book that comes with the watch isn't that much help. But here's what I've discovered ... There are a multitude of videos online that explain anything you want to know about the Instinct. With the help of these videos, the things I do most often on the watch soon became second nature. If there's something new that I want to do on it, there's another video out there waiting for me.</span>

<span>LATEST UPDATE AT BOTTOM (5/11/2020)<br/><br/>What a frustrating activity tracker/smart watch journey I have been on. Nothing seemed quite right for what I was looking for. I am an avid outdoorsman who likes to hunt, backpack, hike, bike, and occasionally run. Things that are extremely important to me are an accurate altimeter, barometer, and GPS.<br/><br/>I first purchased the Fenix 3 HR. The watch was impressive in the beginning and I thought I had found the one. The issue turned out to be the altimeter. It was not accurate at all. I then waited for the Fenix 5. Same damn issue. Altimeter was worse than the 3. When I contacted Garmin, they told me to put the watch in warm soapy water. While this did seem to temporarily reset it back to normal, I continued to experience the same issue. As much as I would like to put my watch in a warm glass of soapy water every night, I decided to pass. The 5 plus eventually came out and appeared to solve these issues. But then.....Garmin realeased the Instinct.<br/><br/>This watch (so far) has really impressed me. It is so light weight and comfortable. The Fenix watches, while premium, are a bit large and heavy to wear. You truly forget you are wearing this watch. The features are great. It has absolutely everything I need. I’m not a triathlete and could care less about some of the measurements the Fenix gives you. Some have commented on the grainy display. I completely disagree. I would liken it to E Ink from a kindle. It truly is a pleasure to look at and is extremely clear and readable. I love that it is black and white.<br/><br/>The keys and apps are very responsive. The menus are so much faster than the Fenix. You can really whip through the widgets and settings to get where you want. The buttons are excellent and I have yet to accidentally press one while bending my wrist.<br/><br/>I am still testing the accuracy of the GPS tracking and ABC sensors but so far it is looking great. I really can’t say enough about this watch. Knock on wood, it seems like a great model from Garmin that will feel a niche hunting/outdoors market. I will provide an update in a month after more usage.<br/><br/>-UPDATE-<br/><br/>I've now had this watch for a few weeks and have taken it on several hunting trips. I am truly impressed with this watch. I cannot emphasize enough how comfortable and light this watch is. Owning and wearing heavier watches over the years, I think I forgot how nice it is to wear a watch that you forget is attached to your wrist. I hated wearing my Fenix watches to bed. Too bulky and would dig into my wrist. Tracking appears to be very accurate. Attitude has been accurate for daily use and when you are tracking an activity.<br/><br/>What I Love About This Watch:<br/><br/>-Comfortable &amp; Lightweight<br/>-Responsive Menus<br/>-Screen Visibility is Exceptional<br/>-Accurate ABC Sensors and Tracking<br/>-Recessed Buttons Avoid Accidental Presses<br/>-Battery Life Has Been Great<br/><br/>I really only have a couple complaints or rather suggestions to improve the watch. When you lock the keys (which you don't have to too often because of recessed buttons), in order to unlock the watch, you hold any button for a short period. I wish Garmin would lengthen the amount of time it takes to hold the button. It takes about .5 seconds to unlock currently and that can be accidentally done pretty easily. This is really a minor complaint though. The screen is an unknown material or proprietary to Garmin. I do wish it was a Sapphire display but I put a screen protector on it and you truly cant tell there is one on the face. My last suggestion is I wish the battery indicator showed a percentage as opposed to the 5 bars in a battery indicator. Again, its a minor gripe but it would be nice if they changed that.<br/><br/>Please ask me questions. Id be happy to answer. I've done a disturbing amount of research on these watches over the years and believe I have finally found the perfect watch for my needs. I've used all Fenix watches and a Suunto Traverse Alpha. This watch is my favorite.<br/><br/>UPDATE 5/11/2020<br/><br/>Still an absolutely great watch. This watch is on my wrist every single day. It is still extremely comfortable. I have had a couple issues that I will address:<br/><br/>-My "Back" button started to give out on me around July 2019. It is a very commonly pressed button on the watch. Luckily the watch was still under warranty. Garmin replaced the watch no questions asked and quickly. A+ to them on their customer service. If it had gone out after the warranty period though, I would most likely be SOL. I believe it is a one year warranty.<br/><br/>With that being said, I do use this watch heavily. It is worn 24/7-365. All things considered it has held up extremely well. At the new price point, I still think it is an amazing watch for the price.<br/><br/>-My other issue, and I stated it earlier in the review is the lock feature on the watch. Its great that you can lock the screen but it is extremely easy to unlock simply by bending your wrist and hitting a button. This could be a simple software fix. They just need to extend the amount of time required to press a button to unlock. It doesn't happen that often but if it does during an activity, it can be extremely frustrating.<br/><br/>This will be my last update for the watch. It has been an amazing watch well worth the price for me and I will buy another whenever this one dies. I hope Garmin continues to offer and improve this watch. It checks all the boxes for my needs.</span>

<span>I have had this product for nearly two years which is why I think this review will be most helpful. Anyone can have a good "out-of-the-box" experience but I think time will tell the real story with most any product. This is the first Garmin watch I have ever owned and it is in my opinion the best wristwatch out there for the money. Understand--this is not a smartwatch. If you are looking for a product to read emails, send text messages, etc THIS IS NOT THE WATCH FOR YOU! If you are looking for a solid and durable watch that can track your position, workouts, heartrate, steps, along with a few other frills LOOK NO FURTHER! I love first of all the band. It is comfortable, flexible, and soft. I hate metal bands and leather tends to get smelly, but the resin band stays nice and tight without being uncomfortable. The watch face is the perfect size for any wrist and the battery charge life is stellar. I use this watch for tracking my rowing workouts for fitness and it does this task well. It also has a nice "military" look rather than being geeky and it can play just as hard as you can. I do wish it had a little bit better interface for geocaching, but I use a normal gps or my phone for that. In summary--after two years of wearing daily--and I mean daily because I even sleep with it, bathe with it, and do everything with it--the Instinct has made a believer out of me!</span>

<span>I wanted to post a picture so women can see what this watch looks like on a woman’s wrist. My wrist is 6.5.”<br/>No, this watch isn’t just for burly hiker men. That being said it’s still on the large side. I’d prefer for it to be a bit smaller but I can live with it. I wouldn’t recommend it to petite women with smaller wrists but YMMV.<br/><br/>It is light and comfortable. I briefly owned the Fenix 5s but couldn’t stand how wide and heavy it was and how the lugs extended past the edge of my wrist. Even though the watch face size is advertised as smaller on the Fenix 5s, in practice the Instinct Solar is smaller and fits better. The orchid color is more muted than I was expecting but still lovely. I wanted a watch for hiking with GPS, with great battery life, and this is the best I could find without shelling out $$$ for a Fenix 6s solar (which has a smaller lug to lug distance than the 5s). The battery life on the Instinct is impressive. Haven’t had much chance to test the solar as it’s winter.<br/><br/>So far I have to give it 5 stars as the HR, sleep tracking, and GPS and all other features have worked wonderfully.</span>

<span>Bought this for my wife for Christmas after I got the tactical version...she never wears it of course because she doesn't like wrist watches...but when she does wear it to track her steps, stress, calories, etc... she actually likes it. We had fitbits before so comparing the two is like comparing apples and bananas. This watch has alot of features that you could grow into.</span>

<span>This watch is a piece of adventure. It keeps up with everything from cardio to weight lifting. It doesn’t really impress as much with solar( as I would like) I like my watch to charge better using solar than this one does, I spend a lot of time outside and should never have to charge my watch via a port, however the pros outweigh the con.<br/>I couldn’t ask for a better all around watch for the my lifestyle.<br/>This watch makes you want to workout harder, walk more and go outside because you’re always trying to outdo the last adventure you took.</span>

<span>I love my Garmin Instinct Solar. The orchid color is beautiful and makes the watch very feminine even though it is a bulkier watch. I love how you can customize the face and I love using it for workouts. This is my second Garmin watch, and I will never use another brand.</span>
