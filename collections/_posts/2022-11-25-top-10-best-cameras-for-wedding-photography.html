<span>I've only had this camera for 2 or 3 weeks so my experience is limited, but so far I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.<br/><br/>This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.<br/><br/>It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is "open" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)<br/><br/>It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.<br/><br/>Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The "mixed" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)<br/><br/>The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of "creative" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.<br/><br/>The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable "quick menu", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.<br/><br/>Drawbacks I've noticed:<br/><br/>You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.<br/><br/>It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.<br/><br/>I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far.</span>

<span>This camera is a great starter camera. I used it as my starter and it is amazing. The focus, 4K shots, nightime view, quality, and zoom is amazing if you're starting out. It produces great photos for a long time. The battery life could be longer but that doesn't take away from how amazing this camera has been for me. 5 Stars. 100% reccomend to starters and/or sports photographers</span>

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera after purchasing a Lumix FZ1000Mk2, to compare the two. The FZ300 was US$300 cheaper, and I wondered if I could get by with it instead of the FZ1000Mk2. I found the form factor to be a bit small for my larger hands, and didn't really care for the zoom control on the lens barrel. There have been some instances "in the wild" of the zoom lever surrounding the shutter release failing, so having a secondary zoom control is good, but this one seemed somewhat vague.<br/><br/>My background is a series of digital point and shoot cameras going back to the Agfa 1250. I've had perhaps 10-12 digital cameras since that time, culminating in the Sony Alpha 900, with a complete, and I mean complete, kit of Minolta lenses for that body. That said, I got to the point where dragging along a backpack of lenses and filters to be more than I wanted. My Lumix LX5 and LX7 languished in a drawer, the iPhone 10Xr had taken on more and more photography duties, but it in itself let me down on many occasions, especially in low light.<br/><br/>I ended up getting the Canon G5X Mk2 as a new pocket camera with a better zoom range than the LX7. What I needed along with that was a super-zoom bridge camera to take the place of the lenses I was giving up with the Sony A900, and the furthest reach I had with that kit was an f8 500mm reflector...<br/><br/>In the end, I found that neither the FZ300 or the FZ1000Mk2 really met my needs and settled on the FZ2500, which while still a very good camera for stills, has a more impressive video capability, even though that is secondary to my needs. The FZ2500 has a weight and size that feels better to me, the ergonomic feel more like a traditional interchangable lens camera, and it will record video only limited by battery and memory capacity.<br/><br/>The FZ300 is a VERY capable camera, and it is a favorite among people who shot birds. The 1/2.3" sensor gives it better optical zoom reach. In the end, I wanted the larger camera and a 1" sensor to match the Canon. so the FZ300 was returned along with the FZ1000Mk2.<br/><br/>That said, I did recommend the FZ300 to my son-in-law as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I believe she will be happy with it. Indeed, I think for anyone wanting something that is a huge step up from a smart phone, in a fairly light package (600+ grams) with weather sealing will appreciate this camera. It simply wasn't right for me.</span>

<span>I bought this camera because it has the basic controls that I need and because it uses AA batteries. All of my cameras use AA batteries, and I have boxes of NiMH rechargeables that I use in many of my electronic devices. They work fine in all of my other cameras.<br/><br/>The KodakAZ401 camera itself is not bad for the price, but in spite of what it says in the documentation, it will not run on the power supplied by NiMH batteries.  With freshly charged NiMH batteries in it, the camera works for a few hours, and then it turns itself off declaring that the batteries are dead.<br/><br/>I put top-of-the-line Eneloop NiMH batteries, fresh out of the charger, into the camera. The camera immediately showed that the batteries were low. A day later, the battery indicator showed that the batteries were dead. I had taken about 6 photographs to test the camera.<br/><br/>I took the batteries out and measured the Voltage. It was 1.320 Volts. That is a fully charged NiMH battery. I continued testing it to see what would happen, and a few hours later, the camera displayed a message saying that the batteries were depleted and then turned itself off. I measured the Voltage on the batteries, and it was 1.26 Volts. 1.26 Volts, is normal operating voltage for a NiMH battery.  NiMH batteries come out of the charger at up to 1.4 Volts, but then quickly drop down to 1.2 Volts for the duration of their charge cycle. So 1.26 Volts is a fully charged NiMH battery.<br/><br/>The camera battery type was properly set to NI-MH in the settings menu.<br/><br/>I took the very same batteries out of the Kodak camera and put them into my Nikon CoolPix camera. The Nikon indicates that they are fully charged. I cycled another set of freshly charged NiMH batteries through the Kodak AZ401 and they had the same problem. The camera immediately indicated that the batteries were low, and after a short time it indicated that they were dead. There is nothing wrong with the batteries. They work in all of my other devices.<br/><br/>I took a total of 10 photos with this camera, and that depleted two sets of freshly charged NiMH batteries. That makes the camera unusable.<br/><br/>The Kodak AZ401 camera will not run on the power supplied by NiMH batteries.<br/><br/>Given the many other comments about battery issues, this is clearly a design flaw and not a malfunctioning device, so I returned the camera for a refund.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It seems that everyone has a relatively capable camera in their possession at all times.  Gone are the days where pictures are for occasions, but there are some exceptions.  You go to a concert that doesn't allow smartphones.  Your non-cell phone carrying kid goes on a field trip, you go on a long trip in the Moab and don't bother with your phone.  They may be rare, but occasions like this can call for a non-digital, non-SLR camera that you won't worry about getting damaged or destroyed.... welcome, Fujifilm QuickSnap Flash 400 Disposable 35mm Camera (Pack of 2)!<br/><br/>As you may have guessed, nothing has really changed in the disposable 35mm camera game.  Really, the only two features that you could contemplate in the past were: 1.) a waterproof housing (this doesn't have one), and 2.) a flash (this has one).  So... about the flash - it's horrible.  That's somewhat mitigated by the 400 ISO film.  The 400 speed film helps to overcome the tiny optics (and the resulting sky-high f-stop), and challenging lighting conditions.  A side effect of 400 ISO film is visible film grain in some of your pictures.  This is a previously undesirable characteristic, but probably lends an analog "charm" to your photos.<br/><br/>I've not shot on Fuji Superia X-TRA film before, but it's a fairly basic, consumer formulation.  It's safe to say that the film is better than the optics and the light management.  The photos from the QuickSnap were perfectly fine.  I got developing from a drugstore minilab.  Looking at the negatives it was evident that a couple of the photos were not metered properly, but it was not as obvious in the print.  You see, the minilab operator made the brightness/contrast adjustment, and there was just enough dynamic headroom in the negative to pull out a passable (if not great) picture.<br/><br/>As far as the camera, it functioned properly.  I didn't have any issues with the shutter, the film advance, or the flash.  If you have need of a disposable camera, this is a good choice.  Conditionally recommended</span>

<span>Very pleasantly surprised. I needed a good quality camera on a budget and this one fits the bill perfectly! I started playing around and shooting after the battery fully charged. You will need to purchase an SD card, as one is not included. I am not a photographer, I actually bought this camera to record 4kHD videos of workouts/fitness content. After taking a few pictures, I am blown away by the quality and different settings. Manual is really awesome for fine tuning and really personalizing a shot.

<span>When I bought it, I thought it was for Cell phone use only, but when I attached my GroPro Hero, it adapted and when I attached also my Sony DCLR Camera, it adapts as well. Great products to carry in your car on every occasion, easy, light weight and it don't take much space since its folding. Great product too. I gave 5 stars or even 10 it there is?..</span>

<span>Nice ring light to add more light in a dim room with standard overhead lighting. The adjustable stand was easy to use. The light was perfect for a zoom meeting. The remote works perfect to control the brightness.</span>

<span>If you're looking for a starter/introductory style light, this one is great. Most lights in this price range will be about the same in terms of color and brightness. The tripod that comes with this one makes it particularly useful, as it can be placed on a desk when collapsed or near standing heigh when fully extended (depending on your height of course).<br/><br/>Either way, the functionality and versatility is very nice. I imagine this would be great for anyone looking to improve their social media posts or just for video calls.</span>

<span>Great affordable and mobile lights. I compared the lights to my studio lights and the color temperatures are off. These lights are slightly on the greenish spectrum. I wouldn't be using this together with my existing lights but they will be useful in situations where only these lights are needed.</span>

<span>I couldn't believe when I open my box how small these lights are and thinking there is now way that they would be as effective as my professional studio lights. I was completely taken back when I turned them on how effectively they work. I love the fact that they have a slider control for a dimmer. It provides ample light at full power to light up a full room, yet allows you to be extreamly creative in placing lights where you need them because of the size. Lightweight, compact and portable. They come with a set of filters that go right over the lights with ease. Set up and tear down takes only 5 minutes and your off and running. Very nice product.</span>

<span>I needed a camera w/ the viewfinder. My Canon Powershot lived a worthy photography life - it also had an adjustable LCD screen - which this Minolta has, as well an electronic viewfinder and a 68x zoom lens. I had all of the accoutrements w/ the Canon that I never used - lenses and what not. So, I'm keeping it simple. Plus, the camera body is purple - it won't get lost. I have to purchase more Lithium batteries and w a separate charger, so I never run out of power. It comes w/ a memory card, a battery, a lens cap. I have my trusty dusty Canon camera bag. This was an affordable, uber suitable camera for my little self. I'm so happy....</span>

<span>Bought this camera two days before trip to Yellowstone and Jackson hole. This camera had the two things I required. EVF View finder, and wide angle to long lens. And a long lens it does have!<br/>  After receiving it on the first day I charge the battery and went into the backyard to take some pictures. We Are blessed to have a beautiful pond in the backyard and a Male Mallord duck just happen to be standing out on a rock at 25 feet. Took a couple pictures of him and then zoom right into his face including his beak head and neck. The clarity was outstanding and the color unbelievable.<br/>  I am also an RC pilot so the next day took it out to the RC airfield.</span>

<span>Had a problem with original battery being corroded on arrival.  Had already returned a different video camera and did not want to deal with that again.  Called Amazon and they went above and beyond to refund the price of a battery.<br/>As for the camera.  It was easy to learn to use.  Making crafting videos for YouTube is so much easier now.</span>
