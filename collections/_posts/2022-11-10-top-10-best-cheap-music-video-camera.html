</ul>

The Q8 marries high-definition video with high-resolution audio, making it the perfect camera for music and video creators everywhere. Its 160 degree wide angle lens and digital zoom ensure that you’ll always capture the complete picture. Combine that with 24-bit/96k audio captured through a combination of Zoom’s ground-breaking system of interchangeable mic capsules as well as two built-in XLR-TRS inputs, and you have a world of audio options whether you use it with your hi-def video or as a standalone 4-channel audio recorder. Use it to educate and entertain, to create music, or to develop a podcast series, and do it with incredible pro quality. The Q8 comes with it’s own specially designed detachable X/Y microphone, yet it’s compatible with many Zoom microphone capsules. If you already use an H5 or H6, you can swap their capsules with the Q8 too.

<span>I bought this camera with high hopes, since it was very strongly recommended for music events.  Ultimately, however, I ended up sending it back because it just didn't work reliably as a live-stream camera.<br/><br/>Pros:  the sound, ability to easily swap out mics, recording quality, "all-in-one"<br/><br/>Cons: couldn't get it to work reliably as a live-stream camera, limited zoom, limited documentation<br/><br/>Ultimately, the problem I had with it may be due to lack of documentation and my own inexperience.  But the issue boiled down to this - I'd get everything working great in my office (using OBS), then go to the room next door to live stream and OBS wouldn't recognize the camera anymore.  I tried one more time today before I sent it back: first and second tests worked, after that the camera wasn't generating video anymore to OBS.<br/><br/>I should add that I used this exclusively with the USB cable provided.  It was only in the last few days that I realized that the HDMI port might have given me a better, more reliable signal.  Unfortunately, none were available locally, and I was up against the end of the return window.  I contacted Amazon to see if the window could be extended so I might not have to return the camera, but I was given a very convoluted answer that ultimately I had to take as "no" (but that's another story...).<br/><br/>Someone else pointed out in a review that when recording, the camera creates new files once a certain file size (?) has been reached and there is no easy way to join them.  While that didn't really bother me (though it certainly added work), others should be aware of it.</span>

<span>I really wish I could give this camera a better rating. I am classical musician, and the audio quality from a smartphone or consumer grade vlogging camera simply doesn't cut the mustard for what I do. On recommendation of a colleague I bought this Zoom Q8.<br/>The audio is as close to professional grade as one can get for a small under $500 cam, and par to other Zoom audio recorders (I have an H4).<br/>The camera is small, compact and light weight. Who works with an E-keyboard or an external microphone set &amp; mixer has a direct audio plug-in option for recording, with no humming, white noise, distortion, or unwanted "sound enhancement". Each channel has an individual gain adjust. So fat I haven't tested the built-on X/Y mics but the audio quality of recordings done by others who own the same camera is really superb. You get a real HIFI quality here; so far the BEST.<br/><br/>But there are too many shortcomings outside that.<br/>Let's start with the video quality. It's Sub par, comparable to a first gen surveillance camera at best. The fish eye effect is extremely annoying. The cheapest vlogging camera, even my phone, do MANY times better. With the "Stage / low lighting" setting, and tweaking the (digital) zoom, I get something close to acceptable, and since video quality is NOT my priority, let's keep it like that.<br/><br/>The battery comes next. It drains in no time. Getting a spare battery and a charger (not included) is an absolute MUST, unless one wants to keep the camera "running on juice" with the charging cable. Speaking of that, the charging port is of the OLD micro USB style. This might be done on purpose so nobody plugs the juice into the 'video out' new style micro USB port, but be aware if you need to replace or get a longer power cable.<br/><br/>The biggest problem however is the video format. It ONLY does .mov videos, and has no on-board converter to other, more standard / popular formats like mp4. So be prepared to invest in a video format converter, since .mov is not widely accepted... Instagram i.e. doesn't take it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if we could put a man on the moon and fly a helicopter on Mars, why the industry isn't capable to build a consumer grade camera that gets BOTH video and audio quality right without breaking the bank is out of my comprehension. Honestly.</span>

<span>I bought this field camera microphone knowing exactly what it was, and that I would get pretty great audio and adequate video.  That I could use a driver to use it as a webcam/microphone.  And it worked exactly as expected, for EXACTLY 1 YEAR.<br/><br/>This month is the 1 year anniversary of receiving the Q8, and I was going to use it for my finals, but on the day I started recording, the Q8 just died.  I emailed support who said, "no email these other people, we can't be bothered" (instead of politely forwarding to someone who might take care of the issue), but the support people at the second email don't seem interested in doing anything either.  They did seem interested in troubleshooting Zoom (the meeting software) although it has nothing at all to do with Zoom or software.  Windows has stopped recognizing the device at all, which means it's either hardware or drivers.<br/><br/>It's sad because I have an original Q3 that is as old as the hills, but still works.  It doesn't work for the purpose I was using the Q8 though, which is why I got the Q8.  But I foolishly thought it would last for a bit.<br/><br/>I gave it a 2 star rating for the really great 1 year I got out of the device.

<span>The reason I bought this camera specifically is because of it's XLR inputs.  I've used condenser mics with great success, and also fed audio from digital and analog mixers.  Sounds great.  But some of the VIDEO aspects of this camera are seriously lacking.<br/>Ironically for a camcorder that is from a company named Zoom, the zoom function itself is pretty weak.  It has 5 fixed positions, closeup to wide angle.  It is suited for music performances where you want a camera close to the performers.  Further than 15' away and it will look like you're miles away, even at most zoomed in perspective.<br/>But the biggest bummer is the HDMI output.  It's broken after only 4 months and probably less than 10 times using the HDMI output.  I was careful to provide strain relief so there was no pressure on the port.<br/>I'd recommend a better camera that allows for fully adjustable zoom function, capable of much further zooming, with a mic in jack and at minimum an HDMI mini output jack, NOT THE MICRO.  A mini HDMI looks just like the full size HDMI type A jack that we see in home theatre equipment.  I use the Canon HF R800, and I'm impress so far.  And to add the capability of high quality audio: Saramonic SR-PAX2.  Camera mounts to the top of it, tripod to the bottom.  9v battery power provides an LCD screen to monitor levels, and for 48v phantom power for 2 condenser mics, and a couple different ways to get signal into it.  3.5mm output for a TRS cable from the SR-PAX2 to the camera's mic input.  Sounds great.  Only downside is it's 9v will need to be monitored, and you'll chew up batteries regularly.  Worth it for the sound it provides.<br/>Bottom Line: if you aren't using the zoom Q8 for HDMI output, and you are ok with having the camera's view limited to within 15 feet, and 1080 max resolution, it's great for it's ability to capture great audio and a decent image.  If you're using it for HDMI output, I can't recommend it.</span>

<span>Almost everything is working as expected - very easy to set and record. Great! sound quality. However, if you use this cam with WiFi, remote controlling it from your phone, recording time goes down to as little as 20-30 minutes per battery! Without WiFi it runs for about 2 hrs per charge. Another problem that Sony engineers didn't think about: there is no way to disable very bright, red light in the front of the camera (the one that glows very intense when camera is recording), making impossible to record through the glass (studio window for example), because bright red reflection. Duct or Gaffer tape can fix it, but I was expecting little better than duct tape fix from Sony. Bottom line: Great cam for musicians. To the cost of the cam you have to add cost of additional 2-4 batteries and charger (not included with camera), or make sure you can plug it into USB charger when using, and if you planning to record through the glass - tape over the led light in the front.</span>

<span>I just got the product, and so far I'm impressed.  I'm a musician, and it looks like a perfect fit for recording gigs.  Unlike the original user review, my product DID come with a user guide.  It's minimal, but sufficient.<br/><br/>The product is small and seems sturdy, but lighter then I expected. People reviewing the release pictures of the product were worried about the microphones being easily damaged.  The arms protecting the mics feel sturdy enough.  I'm am concerned about wind however.  The mics are exposed, and I don't see a great way to cover them with a wind shield, sense any wind shield could obstruct the camera view.  Anyone who has recorded gigs outside knows that mics need a wind shield.  We'll see.  I plan to go to Guitar Center and see if they have anything usable.  Worst case I'll hang a napkin around the mics.<br/><br/>The video looks great.  It is a wide angle fixed lens, so you don't have to be far away at all in order to capture the state.  If I had to estimate, it looks like the width of the image is double the distance.  So if I go back 5 feet, I can capture a 10 foot state.  There are no controls for zooming.  And focus is also fixed.  Anything from 3 inches away to infinity is in focus.  I played around with it with very low lighting conditions, and the image looked better then I expected it to.  The image didn't get grainy.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't know about the product before getting it, is it's ability to remotely monitor and operate through the use of the smart phone.  I have an iPhone 5s.  I downloaded the free app PlayMemories Mobile (from Sony) to my phone.  With iPhone you connect your phone to the camera using the WIFI connection provided by the camera.  If you have an Android, you can use NFC for an even easier setup.  Once paired, the smartphone app displays a LIVE feed from the camera, and allows you to start and stop recording.  This is perfect for being on stage, seeing that the camera view is good, and controlling recording sessions.  It's a really good solution for live musicians.  Others have talked about the fixed view screen on the camera being a huge issue because it is side mounted and fixed.  The remote view capability on a smartphone is so much better then anything you could use with a screen being on the camera.<br/><br/>I've yet to use this at a gig.  I'll post an update once I do.  So far I think it's great!<br/><br/>UPDATE 12/23/2013<br/><br/>Here is a sample from when I first used the camera.  As you can see it has a bit of a fish-eye effect.  Because of it though, you can get much of the stage without being far away.  I'm about 15 feet in front of the guitarist here.  Also, the band isn't lit in any way.  The camera did great in low light conditions.  I'm happy with audio as well.  The room was audibly bright.  Brick walls and concrete floors.  Still the audio sounds great for a live performance.<br/><br/>http://youtu.be/u6aaf-pOHj0</span>

<span>I purchased this camera intending to record with the line level inputs and bypass the microphones. I am using at home, in a small studio, and taking the audio directly from the outputs of an MBOX Pro 3 audio interface.<br/><br/>So far so good. The audio fidelity is very good, and the level meters are accurate, but It's easy to distort on the input, so make sure you check your levels at their loudest possible input setting so you don't ruin your clips.<br/><br/>The video quality is just ok, as many have noted. I bought the camera knowing that, so no stars off there. Also, as many have said, the wide angle is extremely wide, which distorts things and makes them look far away. My studio is tiny, so this is good for me, but you have to be careful how you set up your shot. The quality is similar to a Sony Action cam, but I this cam does a little better in low light that the action cam. Meaning it's less grainy and just picks up more.<br/><br/>I did try the mic array attached to the camera, and while it's better than standard camera audio, it's just ok quality, imo. But that's about what you'd expect from tiny, inexpensive microphones.<br/><br/>All-in all I am happy with the camera and it is serving my purposes pretty well (making no talk demo videos of music gear).<br/><br/>If you want to actually hear the sound clips that were recorded through an audio interface and routed it into the line level inputs of the camera, search google or youtube for EHX Bass Clone Chorus - Demo Review #3 ... all the clips were recorded directly into the camera through an audio interface<br/><br/>Bottom line: I would recommend this camera, but would strongly suggest reading all the reviews and checking out samples so you can see what the wide angle is like, what the overall video quality is like, and make sure you know what you are getting into. The video quality is just ok. But overall, a product that does what it says it does.</span>

<span>Hi,<br/><br/>I purchased the MV-1 the weekend it was released after viewing all of the Japanese video's posted online of folks using it. I play drums in a couple of terrible bands and go to a lot of small shows in little bars to see my friends terrible bands.<br/><br/>I use a 64gig class 10 microSD card in my camera, so far this little guy has been perfect for me!<br/><br/>I set this camera up every time we have a practice session, or whenever i'm practicing alone then dump the files onto a hard drive, its so easy to put this in a corner, and get better than decent recordings to review, critique and go back to whenever you want. its been helping me clean up small problems with my playing, and it helps my guitarist remember what chords he was pulling out during a particular Jam. For an armature musician like me, this helps me get the most out of the infrequent times i get to practice.<br/><br/>The inability to zoom and side screen would be annoying if I were to use this for something other than recording music, but I don't, This is a music recording device that is crazy light, has good sound, and still gets a decent picture. The wide angle lens allows you to just point in the general direction of the show and you will get everything you need in the frame.<br/><br/>I've yet to use this in an outside venue or in a large indoor venue, but so far it has exceeded my expectations.</span>

<span>I'd rate this camera a 3.5. I got this camera for a vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico knowing I'd be snorkeling and hanging out at the beach and poolside the majority of the time. I wanted something light weight, compact, but rugged enough to handle extreme temps and rough handling. I didnt want to spend a lot and knew I was taking a chance with a cheap camera and poor pictures...this little camera surprisingly met my needs. I was surprised of the quality of pictures I was able to take. Most pix taken during the day, underwater shots and pictures of food day or evening were pretty good. I'm still figuring out the quality of photos at night. If you're up close with good focus, the pix seem to be fine; otherwise, if there is some distance the pictures turn out a bit grainy when taken with minimal light. The camera functions/options are easy enough, but still trying to figure out the best function for night photos. Overall, this was a descent purchase and a very simple camera to use. Glad I made the purchase.</span>

<span>My daughter wanted a camera. "A real one," she specified. I wasn't about to get her a film camera, and I wanted something small and tough that took decent pictures. After months of research, this was the winner.<br/><br/>It took her only a couple of days before she had gotten the hang of taking good pictures (even using a tripod when warranted), and she has since moved on to the camera's fancier features — animated slideshows, special effects like "mirrored" images, and the like. I would never have selected the camera for these abilities, but she loves them all.<br/><br/>The camera isn't perfect; it's impossible to create a slideshow except by showing all the pictures taken on a particular date. Some functions are oddly greyed-out and can't be selected. Others can be selected but don't do anything (the faux-tilt-shift in particular). But the camera is in all other respects so excellent that I'm giving it five stars.</span>

<span>After researching MANY waterproof digital cameras, I finally went with this one and was not disappointed.  I bought this camera to use not only for snorkeling and underwater adventures, but also just to take pictures at the beach and in the pool.  It works really well - a huge improvement from the disposable underwater cameras that I used to buy for vacations. I used it for a week straight in the Cayman Islands and did not experience any issues at all. The underwater pictures were very bright and clear for the most part. I even used it to capture some pictures of a sunset and the colors in the sky came out beautifully. I read some reviews where people complained that it did not take good pictures at night.  I did not use this camera at night so I cannot comment on this, however I would not let that deter you since the purpose of this camera is mainly for underwater daytime use. To keep this camera working properly, I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure I rinsed the camera off in fresh water after being in the ocean or pool every day.  It's also important to keep sand away from the camera to avoid any jams in the trigger.</span>

<span>I'm pretty happy with this camcorder. We bought two of them and they, like most consumer cameras, are a little clunky out of the box. Features like auto light on/off, auto horizon level, and demo mode, can make it finicky to get your shot the way you want it, but a quick few minutes in the menu, got this camera in good working order. It has a great zoom lens with optics that allow the image to be sharp even at the tele end of the lens. I have noticed that the edges of the picture aren't super sharp when the camera is zoomed all the way out wide. For our application this isn't an issue as we'll be using this as a close up camera 99% of the time. This camera cannot record in 4K and output video via HDMI at the same time (HDMI will go out when you start recording), it can output and record to 1080P at the same time, however. The 4K is a little soft, as you would expect with a consumer camcorder, however the footage looks fantastic when scaled down to 1080p. The built in microphone is hands down the best quality I've ever heard from a built in camcorder mic. It sounds as if I'm using an external recorder. I'm also glad it has a built in video light and nightvision, however as I mentioned earlier, the built in light turns on and off constantly in auto mode, so I recommend disabling auto and switching it on/off manually when needed.</span>

<span>This camera generally pretty good but may not be for everyone. The most impressive feature is the quality of the video/picture when playing on your big screen TV at home. Second is its zoom quality.  If you are filming things like kids sports you’ll need a tripod to keep the picture steady. The feel of the camera is kinda like a plastic toy not a high end camera if that matters to you. You’ll want to buy an additional battery because the filming time with multiple pause and recordings is approximately 45 minutes on the battery it comes with.  The worst feature is the touch screen. It’s very frustrating scrolling through your clips.</span>

<span>Bought the X900MK back in 2012 have loved it since. The 1080p quality on that camcorder is still great, but I've been wanting to get into 4k video.<br/><br/>The camcorder is very light, and to some, may feel cheap. However, I personally like how light it feels as it makes holding it in your hand easier and won't get tiring. The quality is a big upgrade compared to my X900MK and the 4k video quality overall is excellent, even when viewing on a Full HD monitor after I edit and render my videos out in 4k quality and upload them to YouTube.<br/><br/>The only issue I have is when panning the camcorder. There seems to be some sort of lag when panning which makes the image look choppy almost and not smooth at all.  You have to be really slow when panning the camcorder, which could be an issue with stabilization trying to do too much and keep up. I don't pan my camcorder too much for the videos I shoot so not a major issue, but something to consider if you're looking at this camcorder.<br/><br/>Zoom on this camcorder is pretty good as well. It may take a quick second or two for the stabilization to get set when all the way zoomed, but when I zoomed all the way while handheld, it did a great job at keeping the video pretty steady on subjects that were several hundred yards away.<br/><br/>There is a built in windscreen, which does an okay job, but it would be worth looking into getting an additional windscreen if you plan on shooting a lot of video outdoors.<br/><br/>I bought this over the Sony AX53 due to cost and knowing no matter what, the quality would be better than the camcorder I am shooting with now. I've used this camcorder multiple times now without any issues.</span>

<span>Excellent well built device!! Great 4k Video and plenty of manual features to play with if you set to Manual Mode. Overall I am very impressed by the G50.<br/>  I tested the low light performance and it was much better than I expected. Since I film in my living room under studio lights with shadows I want to get the best low light performance I can reasonably afford so I decided to go for the G60 instead with the slightly larger sensor. If I was filming mostly in the day I would keep the G50. It's really a nice, affordable camcorder. I highly recommend it!</span>

<span>I bought this to upgrade from my Canon T3i, I know right!.  I really didn't want to spend this much, but i wanted a professional camera to use for anything.  It has night vision which i wanted as well.  You can put two sd cards in at a time, and have a consistent record so i auto switched when the one gets full.  Battery life is great.  The standard battery it came with lasts about 3 hours.  I love the audio XLR option... easy to use and set up on the fly if needed. Picture quality is outstanding... even the night vision quality is fantastic.  I was very impressed with that.<br/><br/>The menus are pretty easy to navigate, and I actually forgot it was a touch screen LCD display as well, so that was an added bonus.  LOL  Still learning some of the features, but overall I highly recommend it.  I can't wait to use this more professionally for what I do.</span>

<span>I bought this camcorder for paranormal investigations. I like the size as it fits perfectly for one hand usage. The built-in infrared light does well thankfully because the infrared flashlight is a piece of crap. First, it comes without the required 18350 battery which are close to impossible to find at a retail store. Even after finding a battery, the light is still so faint that it’s still useless. I am happy with the camera itself though.</span>
