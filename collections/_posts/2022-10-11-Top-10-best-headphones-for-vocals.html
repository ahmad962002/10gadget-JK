<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>V-MODA Crossfade LP2 headphones purposefully designed and not to be confused with other heavily fashion-marketed, color-coordinated plastic garbage!<br/><br/>I am not a highly respected audio engineer, conversely I am merely a simple man that has spent 25+ years in an exhaustively expensive quest for great sound.  For starters let me share some of my favorite bands that I used to evaluate these cans.  I frequently listen to hard-rock bands such as Judas Priest, Godsmack, and Dream Theater to the more subdued Mark Knopfler, Adele and David Gilmore to electronica/techo of Depeche Mode, Madonna and Christina Aguilera.  If you like this type of music, like it loud with bass, then...read on and buy these headphones.<br/>Merriam-Webster defines Discriminate as: to notice and understand that one thing is different from another thing: to recognize a difference between things.<br/><br/>It bothers me when people do not discriminate especially when it comes to something as important as music.  Unfortunately, in the past I too have failed to discriminate when selecting/purchasing audio gear.  I have fallen victim to ostentatious product reviews and have allowed myself to be persuaded into believing that some products are perfect for all music.  The old adage, you get what you pay for, is mostly true but the notion that a high price tag equals good sound quality can vary greatly with headphones and speakers, simply because musical taste varies greatly and headphone manufacturers cannot design a product for all tastes.  I have owned at least a dozen pair of headphones over the years to include all the big label brands such as Sennheiser, Grado, AKG, Bose, Koss and Beyerdynamic.  They were all great headphones, but they just did not perform to my tastes.<br/><br/>“V-MODA Crossfade LP2’s recreates the front row rock concert experience with deafening power and low end frequency response”<br/>The standard goal of any speaker or headphone is to produce a flat frequency response, V-MODA’s produce a standard loudness contour which is something I try to replicate via tone controls or equalizer settings on my home audio equipment. These are not headphones for studio recording/mixing, instead the frequency response favors a very human-centric appeal. That said these cans will provide a new level of enjoyment and appreciation for your music collection.  I typically do not play music at excessive levels but as a test I really pushed these headphones with my Denon home audio pre-amp and then amplified through a FiiO A-3 headphone amp (great addition-more on that later).  These headphones cannot be overwhelmed when played through a clean source.  I have worn these headphones while physically mowing the lawn and been magically transported to the front row of a Volbeat concert. V-MODA Crossfade LP2’s recreates the front row rock concert experience with deafening power and low end frequency response.<br/><br/>“The isolation is so complete and sound quality so amazing you will lose yourself in an another dimension”<br/><br/>Isolation is the key to great sounding audio and something the engineers at V-MODA have accomplished.  V-MODA’s have a closed ear design which eliminates most external noise and distractions, in fact the isolation is so complete and sound quality so amazing you will lose yourself in an another dimension and become enveloped in the music.  My family doesn’t share the same love for rock music as I do and rarely allows me to play my speakers to the level I enjoy which was why I have been on a quest to find headphones that can produce high volume levels, excellent sound quality and not wake the neighbors with my late night music sessions.  The V-MODA’s come about as close to inner ear bud sound quality as it gets but with the ability to produce an incredible amount of distortion-less low end that can be felt.<br/><br/>I will also provide a brief warning that should be heeded when listening to these headphones; I have enjoyed these headphones early in the morning while reading email and have been quite startled when my wife taps me on the shoulder.  Additionally, I would encourage new users to break-in your headphones.  Headphones and speakers all benefit from “burn-in” where music is played continuously for &gt;20 hours.  With headphones this is easy to achieve, simply plug them into a source and continuously play music at a moderate level.  You will find the bass extension and sound quality smoother and more responsive.<br/><br/>Construction<br/><br/>One complaint I have had with other high-end headphones is the deceptive appearance of quality manufacturing concealed in flimsy plastic construction or cheap construction concealed by the addition of external fashion accoutrements.  I have the simplistic expectation that headphones costing &gt;$100 should be well engineered, comfortable, durable and faithfully reproduce music.  I understand the need to make headphones light and comfortable but it should not be purely with the goal of weigh savings thereby sacrificing durability.  V-MODA has produced an incredibly well designed headphone with an aluminum padded headband, solid swivels and leather coverings.<br/><br/>Comfort<br/><br/>Even with the noticeable mass of these headphones they do not feel heavy.  The aluminum headband keeps the headphones in place with a gentle snug fit.  Typically closed ear headphones can be hot and exhausting especially after extended wear.  At no time did I find these headphones uncomfortable even after 3+ hours of listening.  That said I did opt for the XL ear pads which provides more room for your ears to fit inside the headphone without being compressed which may have something to do with the comfort I have experienced.  Then again there are definitely gym headphones.<br/><br/>“You probably won’t see V-MODA headphones around the neck of your favorite basketball player…”<br/><br/>Another thing that has taken hold of the headphone market is this crazy notion that in order to be an amazing athlete you must have a pair of fashionable headphones around your neck, CRAZY!  You probably won’t see V-MODA headphones around the neck of your favorite basketball player because you are not paying for the marketing, you are paying for quality. That being said V-MOTA’s are still highly customizable with interchangeable outer shells in a variety of colors.<br/><br/>I put the included gun metal plates on to see how they looked and chose to keep the subdued flat black covers on.  I prefer the purposeful industrial look of this product as if V-MODA owes its design cues to the stealth aircraft industry.  Furthermore, the V-MOTA’s are not overly large or distracting looking.  Unlike some of headphones on the market that are insanely large with enormous pillows over each ear, if I saw someone wearing these at the airport I would not give them a second look.<br/><br/>What’s included<br/><br/>The V-MODA Crossfade LP2’s includes an impressive hard shell case, two removable Kevlar wrapped cords; one 6’ cord, a 4’ cord with a microphone/mute controls and a 1/8”-1/4” adapter. You also get 2 extra gun metal outer shell covers.<br/><br/>Upgrades<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the included cords and opted for a shorter 3.5mm Auxiliary Audio Flat Cable with a 90 Degree Right Angle Compatible which works great for walking around with an iPod in your pocket.  Additionally, I purchased a FiiO A-3 headphone amp and FiiO L9 L-Shaped Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod which makes a huge difference in the sound quality.  The Crossfade LP2’s will play just fine through iPhones and iPods just not very loud.  The amplifier increases the sound pressure and low end without having to push the solo iPod to the maximum limit which adds distortion and reduces battery life.  The combination is a bit bulky but manageable.  Clearly users of these headphones are not looking for super small portability and space savings, focusing more on sound quality I would hope?!<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>There are a lot of headphones to choose from on the market and while there are some excellent highly marketed brands out there I would caution would-be buyers from buying purely on name, price or personal recommendation from anyone that likes different music than you.  The V-MODA Crossfade LP2’s are not what I would consider an overly expensive investment for the tremendous return in sound quality.  It would be difficult to find headphones anywhere that offer the level of customizability or durability found in the V-MODA Crossfade LP2.  These are headphones that are built for portable high-end audio and truly transform with the addition of a headphone amplifier.  Last, if you are looking for a pair of cans to rediscover your hard rock, dance or electronica/techno collection, look no further.  In my opinion the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 are the best headphones for the money on the market today.  Strap them on and disappear into a color saturated realm of blissful musical reproduction.</span>

<span>First up, as you'll see a lot of people either confirming or denying with headphones of this price range, I'm not an audiophile. I do have a high standard of what I want and what I look for, but I can't accurately compare these to other headphones and be able to tell you the slight nuances between them. What I can tell you is that I was searching for a high quality, hassle free gaming headset to last me a long time. I've never been fully happy with any gaming headsets I've ever bought. You usually sacrifice quality in some regard for the moniker of "gaming headset." I thought I had found the perfect solution when I stumbled upon the HyperX Cloud II's, but a (now rectified) software issue that caused popping and an insufficient, quiet mic ultimately lead me to returning them. I really, really did not want to return the Clouds. You will have a hard time finding anything anywhere near as comfortable or a gaming headset that sounds anywhere near that nice at the price-range Kingston asks for. After I decided I couldn't settle with the Clouds, I eventually found a product known as the V-Moda Boompro Mic. After hearing a mic quality test, I knew I wanted it. So then began my search for a nice pair of cans with a detachable audio cable, and of course V-MODA's own products were the first in line. After searching around a bit I decided on the LP2's for the supposed bass response and lesser price tag than the M-100's, which I also heavily considered. Once they finally arrived and I plugged them in, I was not initially impressed with the sound. It did not quite feel like what I was paying for, but then with a little EQ work these things really worked for my ears The sound now is almost perfect for me. I would have easily given these 5 stars if not for one issue: comfort.The V-MODA LP2's come with incredibly small ear pads by default, despite being marketed as Over the Ear, they are most certainly not for any regular sized adult human. You'll find that nearly everyone who owns any V-MODA cans recommend buying the XL Ear Pads, and you certainly should. They -definitely- improve comfort by a large margin, and even the sound stage to some degree. However, even with the XL pads, my left ear still feels cramped and hits the inner wall of the cans. I have to readjust the cushioning in the XL pads more often than I would like to get a comfortable fit. Since I am using these for long gaming sessions, the problem is even more of an issue to me. I honestly wish V-MODA made XXL pads or something of that nature. I may end up returning these if I can find another set of cans that seem like they would be a great fit for what I want, but I am reluctant to give up the sound that I have tweaked to my preference. If these had a higher comfort factor, they would be nearly flawless.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Great presentation with the packaging. I was reluctant to cut the fabric that holds the lid shut. I was a bit baffled why they would include such a disposable piece of cloth that you are intended to ruin, but I guess it's for that "premium" feel, or something.<br/><br/>- Comes with a very high quality semi-hard case. It fits very tightly with almost no room for bouncing around inside. I do not think I could even manage to fit my V-MODA Boompro Mic inside, and it's just an audio cable and a small, flexible mic wire.<br/><br/>- Construction is beyond solid. All metal, no creaking. You do not have to handle these like they fragile, because they certainly are not. You shouldn't abuse them just for the fun of it, but they would probably take it.<br/><br/>- Style wins out on these, and the custom shield plates is an alluring factor, even if I don't plan on wearing them in public.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>- Comfort seems to be hit or miss with people. Even with what I would consider small ears, they still feel somewhat cramped inside. Clamping pressure is strong out of the box, but with a little (gentle) bending and overnight placing on the product box to help stretch them out, this effect has been mostly calmed. I also wish they would have added a tiny bit more padding to the headband.<br/><br/>-Sound was not good for me out of the box. With a decent amount of EQ tweaking, I think I have found a good balance that brings out punchy, strong bass, but reduces how muddy it first sounded to me.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're considering the LP2's and can't afford to go to the M-100's, you will most likely be beyond satisfied. If you are planning on using these for gaming, make sure you buy from somewhere with a good return policy, as the comfort factor may be a deal breaker for you.<br/><br/>UPDATE August 2017: My only flaw with these headphones, the comfort, became a non-issue after extended use. They continued to slightly shift to fit my head and I no longer get cramping on my left ear when wearing these. Occasionally the headband does fatigue the top of my head, but it is an uncommon occurrence and it can be fixed by slightly pushing the band forward or back on my head. Overall I definitely do recommend these headphones. They've held up great!</span>

<span>I am a college student and I like to listen to music on campus.  I usually use them for music, videos, and sometimes gaming.  I have had these cans for nearly a whole year now so now I feel like it's a good time to finally gave my review.  As a background, I am not an audiophile.  I do not look for the best and most expensive headphones.  I look for the ones that give the best sound for the money.  I seek for an uneven balance between performance and cost, performance being higher than the cost and luckily I stumbled across these bad boys.  This headset was the perfect match for me.  It offered high quality sound with high quality design at a price point that would make your wallets happy.<br/><br/>Let's start with the most important factor when it comes to audio headsets like these.<br/><br/>Performance: Compared to my other headsets that I have used in the past mainly for gaming, this one takes the cake.  It offered incredible full stereo sound that sounds very crisp and clean.  It has a very balanced sound and the bass has boom.  The bass is just right and is not overpowering.  I have used 3 headsets before.  The Plantronics Gamecom 780, the SteelSeries Siberia V2 usb 7.1 version, and the Sennheiser HD201.  I rarely used the Sennheiser so I can't really compare much but all I remember is that that one seems quiet and delivers average sound.  The sound details on that one isn't that great and the bass seems to lack as I can recall.  Both the Gamecom and Siberia performed better than the Sennheiser as the Sennheiser model is the HD201 which is very cheap and low end model.  The Gamecom and Siberia both deliver Stereo and also 7.1 as an option.  The V-moda LP2s may not have that 7.1 channel for virtual sound however on its own it sounds slightly better than those two with 7.1 virtual surround as I have tried them all for gaming mostly.  Still, you can get a 7.1 surround for the LP2s if you have the software or some adapter for it.  I use the Razer Surround Pro edition software and it works nicely.  Overall in terms of performance, the V-moda LP2s outperformed all three headsets.  It has excellent lows, great mids, and great highs.  When I go to the gym, I like to play my old gaming music from my childhood.  I would blast hd remasters or remixes of soundtracks from Castlevania and Final Fantasy series.  They get me pumped up when I train and it sounds phenomenal!  I also listen to anime music and also EDMs.<br/><br/>Build and Design Quality: When it comes to build and design quality, I give it a 9!  The V-moda LP2s feel and look very high end and premium.  It has a sexy black look and hexagonal cups that make it shout the word "SEXY!" and it is just SEXY!  Granted you can also order and customize the metal plates outside if you wish.  Oh and not only are these SEXY but these are BEAST!  It is very TOUGH in build quality.  They design this with like the HULK's soul embedded into it or something as these are built like tanks.  The material is mostly metal and some plastic but the plastic is very strong and high quality.  Also the weak spots to wear headphones tend to snap are reinforced with more plastic and metal.  The wire is braided like the cord of a high end gaming mouse and the plug is gold plated so that's a plus.  Oh and I forgot to mention the headband/headrest on this is very flexible and can flex a lot with no breaks.  All this high quality material on it makes it seem like it's a heavy thing to wear but it's NOT!  It's AMAZINGLY LIGHT!<br/><br/>Comfort: I have NOT used these with the stock ear pads but instead with the XL Memory Pads.  They don't put a lot of pressure on your head and it feels nice to wear them.  I feel like I can wear them for hours.  For comfort I say it is GREAT!  About 8 out of 10!  The headband/headrest is great too!  Also the comfort of outside noise is nice.  The outside noise is somewhat blocked and reduced when wearing these as these have passive noise cancellation.  It significantly reduces higher sounds and keeping the other sounds down a bit.  When I wear these on a indoor crowded campus food court, it made the surrounding area full of talking people sound much more quiet to a comfortable level.<br/><br/>Overall: I recommend getting this headset unless you want the M-100s which are truly for audiophiles.  Also the new V-moda headset is coming out.  The V-moda Crossfade Wireless headset is the new one coming out soon and it is said to sound on par or better than the M-100s!  Maybe it's already out and available, just not on the Amazon yet.<br/><br/>Other notes: I bought these during Black Friday sale at Amazon at a nice price.  I did not use stock ear pads only XL ones which are sold separately.  I use Razer Surround Pro for 7.1 virtual surround on my PC for gaming.  For the gym I used this headset wireless by taking the cable off and putting a bluetooth adapter on it although there is a wireless version of this headset coming out soon but much more expensive.<br/><br/>EXTRA notes to mention: It also comes in with extra cable and plugs and other goodies like extra shield plates(gunmetal color)!  It has a nice tough black suit spiderman like case and the box is nice too!  Plus 2 Year Warranty and Immortal Life 50% Program!<br/><br/>SUMMARY: [Performance: 8.5; B&amp;D Quality: 9; Comfort: 8] = MUST BUY!</span>

<span>Let me start by saying I gave these 3 stars because when I buy a new product, I expect them to work the way they should right out of the box. These did not. I just got these for my son. When first plugged in, there was a cracking sound everytime the plug was knocked or rotated. I tried them in another device and the same thing happened. I was about to return them when I decided to look a little further at the description and some of the troubleshooting tips. Sure enough there was a tip for our exact problem. I dusted/cleaned the plug and tried again. Now he's getting crystal clear sound and no issues. We decided to give them a shot keeping our fingers crossed that no other issues arise. So my advice is before you give up on these, check the troubleshooting before you decide whether these are a dud or not. The sound is good, they're super comfy-almost squishy, and aren't bulky at all. We like that they come with their own storage bag for when he has to bring them to school, and the cord is literally no tangle so it doesn't interfere with the tubing from his insulin pump... Another story review for a different day... Long cords can be a nightmare for him so this one seems to be perfect so far. We'll keep them for now. For the price, these are a pretty good set of headphones, save the fact that I had to fix them before he could use them.</span>

<span>Alright, here I go. These are my first real quality headphones, and will be writing more from the standpoint of someone upgrading from fairly crappy headphones, though I will try to use more audiophile terms to find a mix for people reading this.<br/><br/>Looks and Construction<br/><br/>Pesonally, I think that these look great. Possibly some of the best looking headphones I have ever seen, and certainly worn. They are sleek and stylish, with minimal branding - and the branding that there is actually looks good. The side plates can be ordered from their website in alternate colors and/or an engraved image, which is great. The cups will be uncomfortable at first, but as they warm to body temperature they mold to your ears, and will more readily adapt in the future. Overall, they are comfy. The cups will make your ears a little sweaty after prolonged listening, but simply taking them off for a few seconds will alleviate that. The bits holding the speakers to the band is steel, and feels very sturdy. The band itself is wondrous - I believe it is some kind of metal, and can bend ridiculously far in all directions. In fact, bending it is how you will be changing the fit. Too tight? Bend it far out. Too loose? Bend it in. It also bends very nicely for one-ear listening. Overall, these look and feel fantastic. They feel incredibly sturdy, with no superfluous bits. Just solid construction. I feel like I could drop these off a building and they would still work. The cable is a woven kevlar deal that feels like it could never break.<br/><br/>Sound<br/><br/>Ahh, the sound, the stuff that really matters. Let's begin with the bass, shall we? It is great. It is crisp and clear and packs one hell of a punch. On some tracks I could hear the bass bleeding over into the mids a little, but I think that that was due to low bitrate tracks, because on everything else it sounds perfect. I find these to be actually fairly balanced, so if the bass isn't there in the track, you won't hear too much of it, and if it is there it sounds great. The mids are a little recessed compared to some super high end phones I had the chance to listen to, but they do sound great. Leaps and bounds above the $20 headphones I was using before. Overall, nice clear mids that are vastly superior to most of what is in this price range. The highs are fantastic as well. As with the other sounds, the highs are smooth and clear too, with no detectable sibilancy that I have heard in others, and no fatigue from long listening. The soundstage is also pretty decent. The distance the cups create between your ears and the speakers works really well, and make movies and games feel very real. And despite being open, they have a very high degree of isolation. They will block out a lot of background sound with the music on, and isolate your own music well from everyone around you. Overall, some of the best sound I have ever heard.<br/><br/>Overall, these are great headphones. They are both sturdy and light, perfect for traveling or anything, really. The sound is truly top notch, and the cable is the best thing I have ever seen. Very highly recommended to anyone looking to upgrade, or anyone looking for great travel phones. I am definitely planning on buying the Crossfade LP2s in the future.</span>

<span>After much research, I decided to purchase new headphones. I had been looking for good headphones for about 6 months, until I finally decided to purchase the V-Moda Crossfade M-80s. At first I was more inclined to in-ear headphones, particularly Klipsch S4s or Bose IE2. Then, I started law school and saw several classmates wearing Beats Solo and Beats Studios, apart from all the kids on the street. I started researching on which headphones I should get since I mostly listen to Rock and Jazz music. I was amazed about all the info I found. I started freaking out when I saw headphones on the 500$ area and I started to determine a budget. On or around $150.00 was the sweet spot. I was going to wait until Black Friday to see if I could get the Beats Solo, but after reading several reviews I started realizing what everyone was saying. Beats Solos are for bass enthusiasts, which is not bad, but I particularly wanted a rounder more sophisticated sound that didn't overwhelm the guitars on my rock tracks. I also wanted something that would make the mids sound good on my jazz tracks. I wanted something to help me study, not give me a headache.<br/><br/>I'm kind of new to the whole audiophile experience, so don't be quick to judge. I first came across V-Modas while window shopping at the mall. They were displayed at the Microsoft Store right next to the Beats. The price, of course, was the MSRP. So I went home and researched more to see what they were about. I logged into review sites like CNET, Engadget, etc. It wasn't until I reached Head-Fi.org that I was convinced.<br/><br/>The reviews there were very helpful, describing the aspects that I was particularly interested in. I also liked the comments posted by the CEO of V-Moda, Van Kolton. Finally, I decided to read the reviews here. I must say, I was debating between buying the Crossfade LPs, LP2 or the M-80. Black Friday weekend came around and the LPs dropped to an unbelievable 80$. However, I wasn't sure if I wanted so much bass in my headphones. After much debating and looking at my wallet and my needs, I decided to get the M-80s.<br/><br/>When I got them in the mail, first thing I did was open them and plug 'em to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S2). I have a couple of songs in there, especially a couple of albums on FLAC. I am amazed. My 30$ Skullcandy headphones are worth nothing to me right now. I am hearing things I've never heard before with these headphones. The sound is more sophisticated. A rounder bass that doesn't overpowers the rest of the instruments. But sound isn't everything. These things are very well made. They look much stronger than my dad's Bose QC3, and I paid half of that here in Amazon. The headphones are also a visual wonder. They loko very stylish. The case is very sturdy too. You can toss it around and put stuff on top of it (books), without having to worry that the heaphones could get squished. One thing that particularly called my attention was the warranty that V-Moda is offering on these babies.<br/><br/>I also recommend that you buy them directly from Amazon or V-Moda and not a reseller/ebay. Apparently there are a lot of fakes out there and V-Moda won't honor the warranty. You should check out V-Moda's website for more details about this. If you have any questions, drop me a reply so I can elaborate on the matter. I must confess I still haven't burnt them in. Hopefully I'll get more out of them in a couple of days.<br/><br/>Edit: Can anyone point me in the direction of a decent portable AMP? Something in the $50-$100 area?</span>

<span>I have to say, all the hype about these appears to be true.  The build-quality is ABSURDLY sturdy. . .while I would never test it out purposefully, I get the feeling I could abuse these headphones in just about ANY way and they'd still work just fine.  And the sound-quality. . .well.  . .I must say, for a pair of headphones in this price-range, it's INCREDIBLE.  There are maybe a couple models of phones with the same level of sound in this price-range, but none of those have this kind of build-quality and so you could easily end up with one of the drivers going out in them after only a few hours of use, so they'd be a gamble.  As far as I'm concerned, these are the BEST sounding on-ear headphones in this price-range which also have this level of reliable build-quality.  The sound-signature is flat compared to most popular consumer headphones, lending itself well to equalization, but with somewhat of an emphasis on bass, which I would classify as fun rather than excessive.  The sound-stage is somewhere between what you typically hear with closed-back phones, and what you would find with open-back models.  I assume this is because of the V-Port technology. . .a nice touch, as far as I'm concerned.  The separation between different instruments and vocals is phenomenal, and the drum and cymbals and such hit hard and fast just the way I like them, with guitar sounding clear and, frankly, beautiful.  But, the treble manages to never reach the "painful" levels you sometimes hear with headphones with a good, flat frequency response.  I quite honestly never expected to get quite this level of sound from closed, on-ear phones. . .the sound-stage is WAY better than, say, the Sennheiser Momentum On-Ears which I have also used in the past, and the frequency-response is slightly better as well.<br/><br/>All that being said, there are a few things that others have noted in their reviews which, while not personally an issue for myself, I could certainly foresee a good portion of people having issues with.  First of all, if you have a very large head, these probably will not fit you!  And if you have large or even largish-medium sized ears, the earpads will not quite cover them completely and thus you'll have to deal with tweaking how they are centered on your ears in order to get good sound.  Finally, there's the isolation. . .I'd say  it's decent, but certainly not even close to enough for people who want to be able to listen to tunes while completely oblivious to their surroundings.  These don't leak a great deal of noise to the outside (although more than many closed-back phones), but they sure do let in a lot of sound.  From what I can tell the isolation in the upper-midrange frequences and above is quite good, but in the mid-midrange it starts to fall off, and in the low-midrange and below there seems to be no isolation whatsoever, and any sounds in that range will get in.  Personally I don't mind this, as I like to be aware of my surroundings. . .but this could be an issue for many people, I'm sure.<br/><br/>All that being said, personally, I love these headphones, and I'd recommend them to ANYONE who wants an excellent pair of over-ears that won't break the bank, as long as that person doesn't have a large head ;)</span>

<span>I've had Sennheisers (which other than the Momentum are not really designed for todays popular genres like Rock/Hop Hop/Pop/Dance etc), Bose QC15 (Best noise canceling), Sony XB400 (Best under 50 dollar phones, incredible bass).<br/><br/>My new Fidelio L1 and V-Moda M80 arrived on Friday so I will compare the two, although the L1's rival is the M80s big brother, the M100. For me, the M80 is to be used for the office, on the road, Bose QC15 on airplanes, bus and Fidelio L1 at home. I will keep the XB400's for running.<br/><br/>All will be driven from my Kindle Fire HD, Win 8 laptop and HTC 8x phone. I have also bought an FIIO E07K amp, but it hasnt arrived so this review is without that although experts here have said the L1 improves significantly with Amping. I plan on using both for a wide variety of music thats mostly rock and some 80's.<br/><br/>The Fidelio L1 is extremely handsome (personal taste) and mature. The leather headband smells very nice, the cups fit﻿ my small ears and are comfy but average softness. The brushed aluminum fittings are top notch and there is no plastic. I love the grille of the semi open back. Best looking headphone I've seen (and I was cross shopping this with the Momentums which are very handsome but have plastic rear covers.) The M80 is slick looking in a more youthful way. Both have excellent build quality and a solid feel.<br/><br/>Sound of the Fidelio L1 was lovely. I loved the width of the sound stage, depth was good. Felt I was in the concert. The mids (voices) were slightly recessed, super clear and the highs/treble was not too bright/harsh but very pleasant.﻿ Bass was DEEEP but not overwhelming or boomy. I felt Alicia Keys was singing/whispering right next to me, it was kinda impressive.<br/>This is the best sounding headphone I have had and the best looking. It was driven easily with my Kindle Fire and HTC 8x and based on what the audiophiles on head-fi are saying I look forward to improvements with the portable headphone amp. The M80 has a bit of sibilance (hissing in the highs for s and h's), is more forward (powerful presentation) and as a result tiring to listen to, had a much smaller sound-stage and did not retrieve as much detail. Both were very clear and relatively flat sounding, no 'Beats' bloated nonsense distorted sound going on here. On the other hand the M80 has more punchy bass that was faster but not as deep as the L1, PRAT (the feeling of tapping your toes to the rhythm) was excellent (less laid back IMHO than L1).<br/><br/>Sound leakage is way more than the L1 though. My wife is a sensitive sleeper and she doesn't hear me in the L1, cant sleep if I use the M80. :-) I think it has something to do with the hard cups which dont seal well. The L1 on the other hand is a semi-open back design, but Philips did such a good job that there is no leakage!!!<br/><br/>Comfort wise there was no comparison between the L1 and M80. L1 beats it hands down with a softer ear cup and less stiff band (I hear the M80 band can be stretched, something I will try but the stiff band does keep it secure against the head). This was understandable given the more portable nature of the M80 but I dont like the stiff cups.<br/><br/>The L1 is NOT portable despite what Philips says, it's a little too big for that I feel despite the ears folding flat. The M80 is portable but I wish the ear cups folded.<br/><br/>In conclusion - The L1 is a true luxury headphone and the best sounding I've heard - ever. At this price (sub 250), it's a steal. My only complaint is I wish the ear cups were detachable as I want to keep these forever and non detachable ear cups will fail at some point many years down the line and cant be replaced I assume. It's also very versatile across genres, ideally paired with Rock, music like Alicia keys, instruments, Genesis, Sting, Coldplay, Killers etc.<br/><br/>The V-Moda M80 is the most fun portable headphone out there that I've heard, is super cool to look at and compact and can take a beating as V-Moda promises. It's just not as enveloping. I still recommend it for portable use. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, I feel bass is good. I'm not a basshead though. This is the better choice for dance/trance music and hip hop but handles other genres well, and I'm sure its bigger brother (The M100) would be even better as the bass would be deeper.<br/><br/>Both are clearly made with a lot of care, the build, sound and packaging shows. Highly recommended. -1 star for the M80 for the hard cups and sound leakage as my Sony XB400 which is also an on-ear phone does not leak at all. Check out the XB400 is you want bass, it's also 80% as good sounding and is under 40 dollars. BUT, the V-Moda is way more balanced, sexy and built like a tank!</span>

AKG'S MOST POPULAR PROFESSIONAL HEADPHONE. A classic design which has become a standard in monitoring. Now with Varimotion XXL capsule for studio sound at home and for portable use. The 'integrated semi-open air' design incorporates a highly accurate dynamic transducer, and an acoustically tuned venting structure behind the element produces a naturally open sound quality. The circumaural (around-the-ear) pads are designed for hours of wearing comfort, while the steel-cable, self-adjusting headband construction and single-sided professional quality audio interconnect ensure extended reliability in demanding professional studio applications. Proven, popular, excellent - New, improved and even better. Made in China. The item includes the OFC screw type cable.   From the Manufacturer   The AKG K 240 Studio is an update of the "classic" AKG K 240 Monitor. The new K 240 Studio delivers even wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity than its well-known and widely-used predecessor. The secret to the semi-open K 240 Studio's sound quality is the new XXL transducers in acoustically tuned vented enclosures with circumaural (around the ear) pads. The circumaural pads envelope your ears nicely and reward you with smooth, solid bass and well-balanced, articulate mids and highs.Founded in Vienna, Austria in 1947, AKG has built a legendary reputation in the professional audio industry for products that perform flawlessly. The reputation of AKG and its celebrated quality are built on more than 55 years of experience, incredible design, meticulous craftsmanship and a clear understanding of what truly sounds right. AKG introduced the K 140 in 1974 and the K 240 Monitor in 1975, which became the most widely used headphones in recording studios and broadcast facilities worldwide. Generations of musicians and audio engineers use these AKG products to create great mixes, hit songs and albums cherished by millions around the world. The new AKG Professional Studio headphones carry on the tradition of these audio tools and are a sound investment that will pay handsome returns with years of flawless sonic performance for professional recording engineers and demanding users of high quality home or portable audio equipment. Delivers solid bass and well-balanced mids and highs XXL Transducers with Varimotion DiaphragmThe new XXL transducers use AKG's patented Varimotion diaphragm to ensure extremely accurate response at any listening level. This technology creates a diaphragm that is thinner, more elastic toward the outside edges for more powerful bass response and thicker, less resonant in the center for pure, accurate mids and clear, detailed highs. The large size of the transducers makes the overall sound more life-like and three-dimensional to capture the emotional and sonic content of your soundtracks.Gimbal-Type SuspensionTo ensure your listening comfort, AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a self-adjusting headband with a flexible steel structure to deliver optimum fit for your headphones without any fiddling. The structure is flexible, yet strong enough to allow bending for single ear use and is durable enough to withstand rough handling. A gimbal-type suspension ensures the earcups of all AKG Professional Studio models will conform to the shape and size of your ears without pressing on them for hours of fatigue-free, comfortable listening.Wear Them As You LikeRugged construction, a non-twisting headband, and powerful sound allow you to use your headphones on a single ear only or wear them in any other way you may prefer. AKG Professional Studio headphones are ideal for DJ and live sound use because they are durable enough to withstand the roughest kind of handling during transport or on stage.Detachable Cable with Mini XLR ConnectorThe new AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a detachable input cable for easy replacement if ever necessary. The cable and headphones use mini XLR connectors for perfect contact and secure mechanical connection. The cable is made of 99.99% oxygen-free copper and has gold plated plugs on both ends including the screw-on 1/8" to 1/4" stereo jack adapter for maximum signal transfer.Perfect for Portable AudioYou need good quality audio for all your listening--including computer, minidisc, portable CD or DAT player--as well as in the studio. Owing to their high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the AKG Professional Series headphones are efficient enough to be used with these lower level output sources and still deliver the high definition sound you need when working in the studio or on stage. The excellent workmanship AKG headphones are known for and high quality components ensure loss-free transmission and reproduction of high-resolution signals from all types of digital audio sources.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>... if you understand that they are excellent STUDIO or detailed listening headphones. They are not light on bass, but also they do not unrealistically emphasize bass like consumer headphones do. I've been listening to these for about six hours now, and as they settle in and get broken in, they keep getting better and better. I've thrown all kinds of music at them - a LOT of classical piano, some orchestral works, cello, brass, a drum improv, 0-Daiko (huge Japanese drums), female and male vocals, rock incl metal, and more. They do a fantastic job on all of it. If you want smooth and accurate bass, the way it is being performed, recorded or produced, the K240s will do the job nicely, without overstating or understating anything. Mids are detailed and clear, so is the treble. They sound very similar to my studio monitors, which is exactly what I was hoping for. I don't want my headphones to alter the sound in any way. I want them to accurately reproduce it.<br/><br/>These are NOT noise-canceling or noise-isolation headphones. You will hear noise from the room, and the room (and any open mics) will hear whatever you are listening to on the headphones. That is just an instrinsic feature of open-back (or partially open-back) headphones. No bluetooth either. This is a wired-only headset. The cord has a female mini-XLR connector on the headphone end, and a 3.5 mm plug on the other (plus a 1/4" adapter).<br/><br/>The headphones don't appear cheap or poorly made. I plan to treat them with respect, hanging them up when not in use and that sort of thing. I've ordered replacement memory foam ear pads (Brainwavz) and a 3 meter cord. The provided ear pads and cord are more than servicable, however. The cord has a nice rubbery texture and is a good length. I just needed a little longer.<br/><br/>I recommend the use of a headphone amp or audio interface with these headphones. I'm using a DAC amp I got on Amazon for $50 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XJ89KV6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and I have found that I need to feed the K240s quite a bit more gain with it than the Philips headphones needed. If you have an underpowered audio section on your phone or tablet, it might not be enough for the K240. Most higher-end smartphones and laptops will be fine. However, still consider a headphone amp. Not just for volume, but for dynamic range, for signal to noise. You don't want your headphones to be starved for oomph when it matters most, and I think these could be underpowered and struggling in the wrong setting.<br/><br/>The best feature of these headphones is that they disappear. They are very light, and the sound is very clear and airy. As a result, I find myself forgetting that I am even wearing them. It's just me and the music. And that is a good place to be.<br/><br/>These are very tough to beat in the open headphones category, unless you are prepared to spend $400 for a pair of Sennheiser HD-600s and even then it's a bit of a horse race. Perhaps consider the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro for $150. But you can buy the K240s AND a decent small headphone amp for $100. Then sit back and enjoy them. That's what I plan to do.</span>

<span>I’ve only had these a short time, but so far so good. I needed them for a temporary WFH scenario where normal studio monitors wouldn’t do. My previous headphones’ ear pads and cups were starting to deteriorate and flake off. Since I’d bought that brand/model twice and had the same issue, I decided to switch to the industry standard AKG headphones. I’d seen them being used by others for years, but never owned a pair myself. They’re comfortable, seem to have a flat, even frequency response and they’re lightweight to boot. I notice a bit quicker ear fatigue than my previous brand. Not because of how they sound, but it just feels nice to take them off after, say, half an hour of use. But they’re comfortable enough to wear while working. Would recommend.</span>

<span>They sound great still.  After 7 years I still go back and forth between these and a pair or K371s.  I bought these in 2015 as an introduction to higher quality equipment.  Since then, I've gotten them wet, rolled over them with a desk chair, fallen asleep with them on, crammed them into a suitcase, and worn them for at least an hour or two each day.  They sound great - surprising good with games.  The frequency response is detailed and well balanced, although if you're a bass head open backs may not be for you.<br/><br/>They cable's toast and the gold paint is worn off on the lettering, but both are totally my fault. The beauty of these is that the common weak point on headphones, the cable, is easily replaceable.  You can even attach a microphone inline with the mini xlr connector.<br/><br/>If I outlive these, I'll probably get a pair of K702s, but they don't compare at nearly 3x the price.  If you need an affordable intro to better audio, a casual/backup pair, or several pairs for a group of people then these are still an excellent choice in 2022.</span>

<span>For the price - you won’t find a better set of studio headphones - these are great headphones - and their biggest advantage is their semi-open back design - this allows you to get a more natural sound - more air in the headphones - I don’t recommend mixing or mastering with headphones - but using something like this with its semi-open back design at least allows you to get a little better more natural sound in your headphones - it’s at least a good start.</span>

<span>These are truly solid headphones, especially for the price.  I would price them in the $80 - $120 range, and it would be worth it.  Pretty decent lows, I think the low mid frequencies are a little over represented but once you get used to that, your ears can adjust accordingly when mixing.  My favorite headphones to mix on are the Beyerdynamic DT770’s, these are slightly louder.  I use a Presonus Audiobox usb96 that I travel with for use with Logic Pro.  Great representation of my mixes with that combination. You won’t be disappointed for sure, I’m going to buy another pair when they’re back in stock for a backup since they’re so cheap.

<span>I needed a new set of over the ear closed back studio headphones, but didn't wanna spend lots of money, as it's not really necessary. These do the job well enough for me. When I plugged them into my phone, I was initially disappointed, but when I used them in the studio, as they're meant to be used for, is where they really shined. I compared them to my other headphones that are 4x expensive and the AT pair actually sounded better. I like them because there is no added bass, which you don't want added bass using them as studio headphone monitors, cause you want the true sound of whatever you're tracking so you can adjust sounds accordingly. If you're looking for a pair of listening headphones, like for your phone, etc, this would not be the pair I'd suggest. But, if you're looking for some inexpensive headphones for tracking then these are a good option. I would like for them to be a little louder, that's why I overall rated them 4/5 stars.</span>

<span>SO, JUST WHAT DOES "PROFESSIONAL" MEAN? These ATH-M20X "Professional Studio Monitor Headphones" may not be suitable for a dedicated audiophile--but for field work, podcasts, etc.--these are a great buy for the money.<br/><br/>For critical listening, I love my GRADO LABS open back phones which sadly, provide NO sound isolation whatsoever. When it comes time to record in noisy environments, the ATH-M20X "Professional Studio Monitor "Headphones are more than adequate for critical listening. These are NOT Noise Cancelling cans by any means, but they provide just enough isolation to make them valuable in the studio OR in an airport, etc. These are full-range phones with impressive bass reproduction (yes, you can fit a kettle drum inside your head.) They are NOT the most focused or best sounding cans--but for under 50 bucks, they are pretty damn good. I use them for podcasting and critical music mixing. Again, for audiophile ears, you you'd probably do better with GRADO SR60's (around $65)--but when sound isolation (not noise cancelling) is a must, I found myself impressed.<br/><br/>If you are a professional recording engineer, you should be able to afford $300+ cans that are noticeably superior--but for the rest of us, these ATH-M20X  Headphones are more than adequate for "studio work."</span>

<span>So I got these yesterday, and I know I am not going to keep them for long (more on that later) so I want to get this review in ASAP. First off, while I know what I like &amp; I can recognize quality, I am definitely NOT an audiophile, so I'm not going to try &amp; tell you in TECHNICAL terms why these headphones are so great, but I can give a layman's perspective. Also, I am going to do a lot of comparing to the Samson SR850's I just bought AND my standby Koss PortaPros (which I compared the Samson's to in my review of them) Anyway, lets get started.<br/><br/>First of all the looks of these. My 13 year old daughter unboxed them while I was at work &amp; immediately exclaimed "These are NICE !" With that, she put them on, plugged in her iPod Touch &amp; didn't take them off until I got home several hours later. This from a kid who's favorite headphones are a purple pair of Knockoff Beats I bought at a flea market. They are MUCH better looking than the Samsons. The earcups are smaller &amp; lower profile, and the headband is covered in a stylish black leatherette. There is a LARGE AudioTechnica logo across the top of them, but who's going to be looking at the top of your head ?<br/><br/>As far as comfort goes, they are very comfortable, They are much lighter than the Samson's, and as I said smaller. The ear pads are suitably soft &amp; covered in the same leather like material as the headband. And while I doubt you could lie on your side comfortably with them on, they would be MORE comfortable than the Samson's in that position.<br/><br/>As for build quality, they are REALLY light, which worries me a bit, but they seem very solid. The main structure is definitely metal and the wires are thick &amp; well covered. The plugs also look a step up from your average headphone connector. While I am sure my kids would manage to break them eventually, I think they would last longer than your average headphone. And with me, they will be just fine.<br/><br/>Finally, lets talk sound. They sound AWESOME ! Really awesome. Much better than headphones at this price should sound. When I listened to the Samson's the first time I knew they sounded better than my Koss' ... but not by a lot. These are OBVIOUSLY better. The bass response is better, and everything else is CRYSTAL CLEAR ! Just stunning. That being said, they are not as loud as the Samson's which kinda surprised me since they are smaller &amp; closed back. But because of the better bass &amp; improvements across the full range of sound, I would definitely put these ahead of the Samson's AND the Koss' &amp; I am sure ANYONE who heard them all side by side by side would agree.<br/><br/>Now there are a few negatives. Like I said they are smaller &amp; Lighter than the Samson's. And I was looking for something LARGER ... so in that respect, they are going away from what I was looking for. And I still am surprised the Samsons are slightly louder. With the bigger size they should need more power to drive them properly. But since the M20's have less sound leak than the SR850's, this is really a non-issue.<br/><br/>And while they are very comfortable, after wearing them for a short time its clear that my ears are sweating in the M20's where they were not in the SR850's. Again, it may be because the latter are semi-open, but I think its because of the cloth covering on the SR850's pads AND because they are bigger.<br/><br/>Overall, even with the negatives, I would recommend these over the Samson SR850's w/o question. But, if that extra $15.00 means a lot to you, the Samson's are still an EXCELLENT Choice. And they will probably be my choice, since once my son HEARS these. he will be wanting to trade me the Samson's for them.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have had these for just about 36 hours &amp; I just had a perfect stranger come up to me &amp; ask me if I liked them.l He obviously knew a lot more about headphones than I do &amp; has much better equipment (a $170 pair of BeyerDynamics) but he was impressed with these especially at the price.<br/><br/>UPDATE to the UPDATE: I recently bought a Fiio E6 Headphone Amp &amp; when my son comes home from College, I will try these out with the Amp. Considering how much they improved my Samson SR850's (I would put that combination AHEAD of these now) I am sure they will sound even more awesome. However,  I will NOT be buying that Amp for my son. If he wants one, he can buy it himself.<br/><br/>IN RESPONSE TO .... the two questions .... First off the Amp improves the M20's as much as it improves the Samson SR850's. The sound is cleaner, and I prefer using the degraded setting on the amp with increased volume on my source on these as well.<br/><br/>Second, as I said without the amp, these sound nearly as good as the Samson's WITH the amp. So I feel I have done enough for my son in that respect. If he wants to UP the quality with the amp, that's his choice. Just because I am not paying for it, doesn't represent my feeling for him one way or another. Of maybe it does. Either way I feel secure in my role as a parent &amp; the opinion of one crank won't affect that.</span>

<span>Before I review these headphones, I must say something about their intended purpose. These are NOT designed for listening to music anywhere except sitting down in your home or in a studio. The cord is incredibly long and bulky, and the headphones are far from stylish. If you're looking for headphones you can wear on-the-go, stop right here and go look for some in-ear-monitors or smaller sized headphones. If you are looking for the best sound quality you can find in $100 headphones, and don't care much about anything else, this is probably the right place.<br/><br/>Design Overview:<br/>These headphones are MASSIVE. These are my first pair of studio monitors and I was not expecting them to be as giant as they are. I have a normal sized head- These headphones look ridiculous on me and on larger heads, still seem pretty big. I am not a very fashion-minded person but even I think twice about taking these around. The headphones fold up for convenience, allowing them to fit in my backpack without too much trouble. The cord is one of my biggest gripes with the headphones. It is not on par with the quality of the rest of the headphone.<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>These headphones will hurt your ears and the top of your head after about an hour. I was very disappointed with the stock earpads, and the plastic headband is covered by what seems to be leather with little to no padding. About a month after I bought these, I ordered the replacement earpads from Shure's higher end version of the product, the SRH-840, and slapped those onto my SRH-440. I am much happier with the comfort of these headphones with this 15 dollar investment.<br/><br/>Cord:<br/>The only thing I like about this cord is that it is detachable and twists to lock into a jack on the headphone. I have a lot of issues with the stock cord. It is something like 10 feet long uncoiled, and even coiled up takes up too much space on my small computer desk. The cord is cheaply made, with the wires nestled into a plasticky tube that gets kinked up permanently much like a garden hose. Within three months the cord was unbearably tangled and did not coil up properly. With this stock coiled cord, it is impossible to go anywhere with the headphones as you have a large bundle of cord that barely fits into a pocket by itself, much less with an mp3 player. I replaced the cord with Shure's straight cord, just to find the cord was still something like 8 feet long, and made of the same low-quality garden hose plastic. The best thing about this cord, how it locks into the headphone, also made it very hard to find a third-party, decent cord. After some hunting on eBay, I found a reasonable length cord made from decent material. I should not have to go through this much trouble to find a cord I can walk with, and don't completely understand the appeal of a cord this long, unless you sit 10 feet away from your audio jack in a studio.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>I'm no audiophile, but I can tell you without a doubt that this is some of the best sound you can find in a headphone at this price range. Each instrument in your music becomes separate from each other, and much more clear. Low quality earbuds will bother you with how muddled they sound after listening to these cans. With a headphone amp such as the FiiO E11, you can even hear small details of each instrument that are difficult to describe. The sound of these headphones is never harsh, and the sound is warm but crisp. The only downside of the sound is a minor deficiency in bass. A lot of headphones have far too much bass, but these have the treble slightly overpowering. I'm not complaining- this is easy to fix with a small EQ adjustment.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>Overall, these are great headphones. I'm fairly picky about quality, and most likely, others won't have as much of a problem with the design of these cans. The manufacturer was likely trying to keep the price down on these while still maintaining an entry-level audiophile sound. Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helped decide your purchase.

<span>I needed an upgrade to my old headphones that (admittedly) I got at a garage sale. Nice full size headphones but the cable was getting damaged and had that annoying volume control feature. I think its cool but at the same time stupid because I find it the first thing to go. I fought with them for a while until I finally had it. So I went looking for an upgrade that would cater closely to what I'm doing more nowadays, that is home/studio listening for enjoyment and music production. I live in a rather noisy area where I hear the fire trucks and ambulances coming and going regularly and among other things. So I needed a pair of closed-back headphones for isolation as I find the sound reproduction of noise canceling headphones to not be as accurate and nowhere near this price range. I also wanted a set that offered the replaceable cable and ear cups option as decent headphones can last a long time but these two parts always wear out before decent drivers do. Amazingly enough I discovered the Shure SRH 440's. I got everything I was looking for. These are really nice headphones for what they're designed for (e.g. home/studio listening). These might not appeal to people used to higher end equipment but as a start into the world of detail and sound resolution it's wonderful for the price.<br/><br/>There are drawbacks that I feel some people miss about these. These don't have much bass impact (e.g. you don't really feel an explosion so much as hear it.) The sound signature is a rich neutral (e.g. it strives for balance and clarity, middle of the road). They are not really made to be run by Iphones and Ipods. These guys need a little more power to drive them to their full abilities with a headphone amplifier. They sound good unamped but sound their best amped. One other thing is these sound particularly tight and bright out of the box. There's nothing wrong with them because they need to be "broken-in." Some people like the sound from the get go, but for me it took a little getting used to. Over time the drivers have been slowly relaxing and loosening up making it sound even better with time. If your looking for nice pair of headphones that will last and deliver great sound, these are a nice choice at this price bracket.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>  + Marvelous sound that is balanced and clear. - Even at really low volumes (while amped) I can still hear amazing detail.<br/>  + Great isolation. - I don't hear the traffic anymore with these on and I'm not cranking these. I listen at very moderate levels.<br/>  + Removable cable for cable replacement. (Or to change to a higher grade audio cable)<br/>  + Solid build. Can fold up for easy transport and storage.<br/>  + Gold-plated Plugs (For signal efficiency.) 3.5MM with a screw on 1/4 plug.<br/>  + Full-size over the ear cups.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>  - Shallow cushions - The rim of my ear rests against the drivers. Depending on position can become uncomfortable.<br/>  - Shallow Headband cushion - There is some cushioning but mostly to cover up the inside parts.<br/>  For me it gets a little uncomfortable in certain positions but once I find the spot I'm content.<br/><br/>As these aren't powerhouse audiophile headphones, they don't require a serious amplifier to run them.<br/>If your a budding audiophile, spend a little more on your headphone amp and you'll be happier for it.<br/><br/>My experience (if you wish to know)<br/><br/>Putting these on and turning on the music is like being transported. I found myself relishing music even more through these as I began to hear it in a whole new way. I enjoy all kinds of music from Metal, Classical, Folk, World, Electronic and Alternative. When I put on Vivaldi: Four Seasons (FLAC format), I couldn't believe my ears. The clarity and beauty of this music resonated out of drivers with such detail. The descents and ascents of the lows to highs and back were a treat. String instruments sound incredible in these as well (Violin, Acoustic Guitar, Cello). One thing is you'll notice the quality of your music more. You'll hear the effects of the poor sound reproduction in the higher compression formats. However, you'll also notice other parts of the music that cheaper headphones can't reproduce when listening to CD's. Some music will be more appealing in these than others. Mostly music that relies more on its musical detail (Classical, New Age, Flamenco) than impact.</span>

<span>The drivers way above the price range for sure. They sound just about as good, if not better than my trusty old ATH-M40xs.<br/><br/>The only problem with sound is that, because I have a wide head already and I'm stretching out the headband to the max, so much as a yawn will widen my head even further, making this headband emit cracking/popping and squeaking noises as it stretches, around 1.5x as loud as what I'm listening to. It's really disruptive to movies and music. Metal-structure headbands generally don't have this problem, in my experience.<br/>Now, they are my dedicated studio monitor headphones. Like the name intends lmao. The cracking and popping noises, although distracting, doesn't mean it degrades driver performance so they're still very useful for monitoring.</span>

<span>This is a fairly good headset with decent sound that does an adequate job at music reproduction.  They are fairly inexpensive, so going with the old accepted 'wisdom' that you get what you pay for,  I really hadn't expected much from them when I made the purchase, so they've pretty much lived up to that lofty expectation.  Anyway, I've used them pretty much on a daily basis for months now without really given them much thought, so I've been happy enough.  After all, they were affordable.  They aren't particularly uncomfortable.  They didn't sound horrible and they seem to be all I need for the use to which I put them.  I unplugged the old set, put 'em away, plugged in these and that was that.  Because I wasn't expecting much, I never considered doing any sort of quality testing or comparison listening when they arrived.  That was a mistake.  With clear hindsight, I'd now say I'd already pretty much convinced myself they would do when I ordered them, so I never bothered to check if they actually were.  Naturally they sound okay, since I wasn't expecting much, but they're being used almost exclusively for non-critical, background listening to music on my tablet while I'm doing other things (almost anything instead of watching the idiot box while my wife is in the same room, online and talking with her coworkers and clients and trying to concentrate on her new full-time, off-site job).  So, since I haven't really been thinking about anything more than whether or not they reproduce music, they're okay.  Not awful, not great, but okay.  That's what I expected so that's pretty much what I got.  I should have been more careful.<br/><br/>A couple of days ago my wife was out exercising before starting her work shift, so I took advantage of the opportunity to test-drive some new music I was thinking about purchasing.  I needed to be more discerning  in my listening and I needed to be online, so I moved over to my desk so I could use my souped-up PC and Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speaker system, a combination that reproduces music pretty well for me.  I realized from the outset I couldn't expect to favorably compare my inexpensive Sony 'phones to that, but I was completely surprised even so.  I'd never checked, so I never realized just how much of the music I'd been missing with the new headphones.<br/><br/>Now I started thinking about my headphones a bit more critically, the old and new.  Yes, the old set was a bit long in the tooth; after all, it was quite a few years old and had seen a lot of use.  Even so, I'd replaced it not because of a problem with the sound reproduction, but because the connector cable was wearing out and getting a bit ratty.  Worse, it had developed a somewhat quirky connector that often required reseating in the jack to work.  A pain in the butt, but when they worked, they still sounded quite good.  I then remembered listening to music and thinking about just how great it sounded on a brand new laptop I used recently (with the old headset).  At the time, I attributed the great sound pretty much entirely to the new sound chip in the costly new Dell, but maybe it had been more than just the laptop.<br/><br/>Time and past time for action!  I pulled open the junk drawer in my desk and started digging around, movin' aside all the old serial cables, card readers, cabled mouses (mice?) and such until I found the cloth bag I'd stored my old headphones in when I got the new set.  I disconnected the Sony's, set 'em aside and plugged in the old ones.  Rats: same old problem.  I reach up and jiggle the connector around this way and that, push it in a bit further and pull it out a skosh until it's just right and finally, sound!  Wow.  I noticed immediately that the music was much more detailed than it had been with the new headphones.  I was clearly hearing vocals and instruments as distinct individual elements, instead of, or rather, in addition to the one musical whole produced by the entire band I heard with the Sony headphones.  A very noticeable difference.  So I listened carefully for awhile, unplugged the old set and tried the newer Sony set again for a couple of songs, then unplugged them again and reconnected the old headphones.  There was absolutely no doubt about it -- the old no-name headset (only about $20 more expensive than the new Sony's) absolutely reproduced the music with more clarity and even a deeper low end.<br/><br/>Now what to do?  Well, when I'm not paying close attention to the music, the Sony headphones and my Samsung tablet are fine, so I have those in the living room beside my easy chair (to use while my wife is working).  If I want better sound while she's at work, now I have the option to move over to my desk and use my old headphones on my desktop.  Not ideal maybe, but it works for me.  I still have the problem with the connector on the old set every now and again, but unless and until it breaks down completely, it works.<br/><br/>Bottom line?  These inexpensive Sony headphones work, they're not uncomfortable, they're not even close to being awful, so they may be perfect for listening to music in the background or other such offhand use where not too much attention will be paid to the details.  Folks that aren't too picky about music or really don't care about all the subtle little nuances that better, more expensive headphones reproduce accurately should be happy with this inexpensive choice.  Again, they're not awful, they're not great, but they are okay.  On the other hand, for some being merely okay really might not be all that okay, so if that's you, or music in all its multifaceted, heavily nuanced glory is more your thing, it might be better to think about something better.</span>

<span>Feb 2022 update to the newest Jan 2022 pair i mentioned sounding muddy.  I have used them a few days and now i think I have the fix ... they need EQ help but they sound decent now, even if not "great".  My fix was in Rockbox (Sansa mp3 players running Rockbox was always my main use-case) I left "Treble" and "base" alone and kept all of my prior sound settings I had for prior models sounding good.  I kept the i want to say around the 1k and 2k EQ ranges that were at zero and i pulled them down a bit ... THEN I also (based off a youtube video suggestion on muddy sound) i pulled down the low end in the advanced EQ part, STILL leaving a boosted "base" in the individial "base" part .... hard to explain for those that dont know Rockbox but it's like an android EQ where you pull the low end down in the slider portion but also ENABLE a "base boost" toggle or something that an EQ app may have ... that sort of thing only you have more control over how much the "base boost" is "boosted".<br/><br/>Not all songs sound great but that could be the source file ....even the one i am thinking of doesn't make me go "wow .. that is not the way i am use to these headphones sounding on that track" .... I still would prefer not having to do this and having them tuned the way they use to be tuned (maybe i got a bad pair) ... but they are usuable now and i like them<br/><br/>Jan 2022 Update:  I recent bought a "backup pair" this past December and just tested them today ... I do like vs the 2016/2017 versions of the "110's" the cable from the split down to the connect it seems thicker (like the "100's use to be") ... though what I dont like is ... the tuning ... I still have those old 110's and I 100% notice a clarity difference ... turns out I cant return these if i wanted to (not saying I would ... ) but doing an A-vs-B comparsion I totally hear a clarity difference ... these new ones sound balanced, do not get me wrong, but they sound a tad muddy vs the old pair ... and I totally admit i do a combo of a U or a V shaped EQ when using the Sony 100's or 110's ... these dont sound great un-EQ'ed .... .but ... this exact pair while they work sound muddier than any 100's or 110's I have had before ... if this was my own experience with the MDRXZ 100's or 110's ... I'd be considering other brands in the same price range<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/>This review is based on my first impressions with the "110's" on a number of mp3 player, and a number of "100's" (the previous model https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WODP20/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 ) that I have had and used over the years.<br/><br/>Pro - Sound Quality<br/>So far I DO notice more bass in these new (my first pair of the "110's") pair of headphones and unlike prior experience with Sony (and other companies too ...) earbuds where the "new great model" .. didn't sound as good as the prior ones did ...<br/><br/>These 110's just add enough to the bass and possibly treble too, that makes it definitely sound better then the 100's though it doesn't fall into the trap I described above, when sometimes they add "more bass" and it turns out the bass is so strong, that it drowns everything else out.  I have to say that this is not really a knock on the 100's .. I do still like them but for the same price on either ... I'd go with the 110's but if there is a "good deal" on the 100's and I was getting them again ... I am not against getting another pair of the 100's either.<br/><br/>Yes these are "cheap" headphones and probably not as good quality wise as a really expensive pair though I do recall some reviews saying they tried these along side a pair of "$200 Beats" and while the did say their friend's Beats did sound better ... they personally would rather get maybe two or three pair of these and still have say $150 left over ... meaning "they do not sound price-vs-quality of the sound" .. 'that much better'<br/><br/>Pro/Con - Build quality<br/>These ARE plastic headphones of course, though I do not agree with those that say "oh its like they are from the Dollar store ... the plastic is horrible ..etc etc"... just if your going to buy a much more expensive pair of headphones ... your will probably get better quality too<br/><br/>The one downside that ... I admit I see in these, and are a problem in the pair of "the 100's" that was 100% caused by me ... AND EVEN THEN that exact pair, needed fixing but still sounds great ... I am using THEM while typing this review, is the part where the 100's and the 110's ear-cups move.  I am not sure "how it could be made better" but that was the exact point of failure for my long-used pair (again 100% my fault for HOW the break,happened) .. note that if it wasn't for me they would still be fine and that is after 3+ years of HEAVY use and they still work ... so maybe it's fine for being able to fold (in both models I mean)<br/><br/>Pro - Fit<br/>I am not sure if i can say one way or the other "I have a big head" (100% not a small head) but they fit fine .. even out of the box.  Heck after that DIY type of repair I did on my broke pair .. .I had to flip them backwards and .. they for the most part still fit great ... these 110's are no different.<br/><br/>By the way I have glasses (regular and sunglasses used when wearing these) and just like the 100's, these are nice and comfy ... not too tight or too lose, if you ask me<br/><br/>??? - The cord<br/>The cord looks different from the 100's I have and I like the cord ... basically I think some of the cords on others are way way too small and that always leads to the problem of one of the two sides going out for good ... The cord on the 110's looks a tad smaller diameter wise but really if that doesn't mean that issue I just described DOESN'T happen .. I do not really care... I just want the headphones to work for a long time ... if the cord is different but there are no issues ... this change is fine by me.<br/><br/>Plug - I will keep this review updated IF there is a change but I have no had these for long enough to comment on some of the reviews who keep having issues with the plug breaking ... NOT on this pair but my other pair of the 100's get plugged into and unplugged from stuff for over three years now and often too ... never had a problem .. but then again I cant comment on these. for now.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>I would recommend these no question ... though if your expecting a super high end sound (aka are an "audiophile") you MAY BE disappointed though as someone who loves his music ... I think the sound with the right equalizer settings, on the device or program your using... I do LOVE the sound of these.<br/><br/>Update - After using a new pair of the "100's" ... aka the prior model<br/><br/>Really ... the 110's do have the slightly higher bass and that is not a bad thing either  .... the new pair of the 100's I am using I actually thought were the 110's (I just forgot what headphones I was using)... THE POINT? ... they both have great bass and I think the pair that I use to wear daily (the broken pair that still works great.... just doesn't fit perfectly anymore)'s fit actually effects the bass ... that old pair I hold the earcups closer to my ears than how they "sit" now .. .and I hear alot more bass.<br/><br/>Between the 100s and 110's ... if the way each one of them fold doesn't matter to you for say fitting them into a caring case .... I recommend both 1000% (no typo) ... find the best deal  ... if you can get one a little cheaper than the other ...cool ... there is more bass by a little bit on the 110's but do not think I am saying a new pair of the 100's are weak in that department.</span>

<span>I like the fact that this Sony ZX series wired over ear headphone is comfortable on my head and over my ears. These Sony ZX Headphone are not totally outside noise canceling, which I prefer.  I have hearing issues, especially when my husband has his new big TV sound louder than my TV in the next room.  When he is watching sports on his TV he gets emotionally involved with the game and loudly commenting on how they are playing that sport, as if they can hear him.  I can hear through the headphone, when he shouts but it is very faint and does not bother me at all.  Depending on my concentration while wearing the Sony ZX headphones I noticed that I can't hear the doorbell or someone knocking on my front door and sometimes I can not even hear the phone ring.  I also, noticed that the sound quality is very good for this Sony ZX Headphone that do not have a control for volume on the set itself.  This Sony ZX series headphone is not wireless, which I am finding out that the newer TV's do not have a connecting plug to connect to a wired headphone.  Do not forget to get a connecting wire or cable from the back of your TV to were you sit to view your TV, unless you are less than 3 ft from you TV, in which case you will probably not need to be buy any headsets to hear your TV.  I have a connecting cable (20 feet plus) from the back of my TV plug to my sitting area, which is approximately 10 to 12 feet away from my TV.  I have been using this Sony ZX Series Headphones for over 20 years and I am very satisfied with the performance and quality of this product. Hope this helps!</span>

<span>However don't expect a 10 dollar pair of headphones to be at $100 performance. These are currently selling for around 10 dollars on amazon. It may go up or come down slightly after I made this review but either way at $9.99 plus tax it's very hard to be overly critical on these headphones. I've seen recent youtube video of some guy criticizing them and I don't know why. They are literally dirt cheap headphones and you get what you pay for. I went with the white model just because black headphones seem so common these days and the wires on these feel very cheap so you are going to want to try to take care of them as best as you can. Try not tangling them up and try not stressing the cable out because over time this may cause the headphones to go bad but again these are 10 dollar headphones so hard to complain. The sound quality is pretty good. I wouldn't call it great but we're not spending hundreds of dollars on headphones. These are only 10 dollars currently and even at 15 dollars I would say these aren't bad. I do think that the headphones feel more like they're designed for children with smaller heads and smaller ears but even then I don't think it's bad even for Adults to get these for themselves. I am currently typing this review with my headphones on and while laying on my pillow they do slide a little. That's just a minor complaint. I will not give dirt cheap good sounding headphones less than 5 stars mainly because I don't want to be harsh on something that doesn't cost a lot of money. If you want something better then be prepared to spend more money. Sony makes pretty good products so this is a trustworthy brand and even if they end up eventually dying which has happened to me with even more expensive headphones then it's not expensive to replace or buy from some other company. When I was a kid I had an expensive Boise Headphones my dad bought me and they died on me and we never had them replaced. I remember the sound on those sounding pretty great but they apparently weren't durable at all. This was probably a decade ago. Don't know if Boise has improved on their headphones or not but because of the bad experience I stray away from more expensive headphones.</span>

<span>These headphones do not boost or cut any frequencies. What is there is what you get.  Which is what you want when you are monitoring or editing. If I were using these for listening to my music, I'd rather have Bose noise cancelling phones, but these are much better for monitoring and editing.<br/>The carrying case is sweet.<br/>The price was nice.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>What kind of headphones do singers use?</h3></h3>
    

In-ear monitors are headphones that are inserted into the ear canals and used by singers to hear themselves sing.
<h3><h3>Which headphones have good mic quality?</h3></h3>
    


According to The Wirecutter, the best headphones for good mic quality are the Sennheiser HD 6XX, followed by the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 ohm and then the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x.
<h3><h3>Should I record vocals with headphones?</h3></h3>
    

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to record vocals with headphones depends on a variety of factors, including the type of headphones you're using, the mic you're using, and the environment you're recording in. However, in general, recording vocals with headphones can be a good way to achieve a more focused and intimate sound.
<h3><h3>Why do headphones sound better singing?</h3></h3>
    

The human voice is already an amplified instrument, so the headphones don't need to work as hard to make it louder. Additionally, because vocals are generally recorded in a studio setting with microphones, they often have a more upfront and rich sound when played back through headphones.
