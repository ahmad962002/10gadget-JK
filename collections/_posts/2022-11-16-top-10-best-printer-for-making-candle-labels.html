<span>Labels are super expensive, and the printer will occasionally waste 2"+ of label for no reason at all. At one point I moved the printer so I had to unplug power, so when I plugged it back in, bam... 2" wasted. It was a 2" wide label, so how much does that 2" cost? About $0.37. That's without mentioning the 2"+ that it wastes when you first install the cartridge.<br/><br/>Wireless printing works ONLY from your phone. Even though the printer connects to your local wifi network, windows can't detect it as a printer, nor can Brother's p-touch label software. It requires connection via USB.<br/><br/>Label quality is just ok. I love the fact that I can print labels that are extremely configurable and will look the way I want because of WYSIWYG, but I tried to print a label with a company logo that is green. I tried several different shades of green and it never came out green. It was either a yellowish gray, or a very dark gray. I can't make it look green. Photos actually look really good on this printer. It's very surprising how good they look for inkless technology, so I have to give them that. I printed out their template that's for putting on a company ID badge, and it looks pretty darn good. The green of the company logo looks a bit better when printed large, but still not exactly the vivid green I was expecting. Text quality is really good though, and that's a large part of the reason I bought this printer. I was tired of my standalone brother label maker.<br/><br/>Something that makes me extremely mad... I installed the windows software to see if I could use it with the printer wirelessly. Without the installer asking it just suddenly rebooted my computer. I lost hours worth of work because it did a forceful restart. So mad at Brother for doing this.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure I will keep this printer, but it's a nice little package for what it does.</span>

<span>We were using this to make labels for some of our smaller products. The printer was a little bit more of a headache to set up than I wanted it to be for sure. My suggestion to anyone using it is go straight with the app and Wi-Fi usage rather than trying to link it to a computer and use the 1980’s desktop program. My main problems with it were that the coloring was definitely off. Greens are darker. In general, all bright coloring is faded or turned white. The labels themselves are not sticky enough whatsoever. I’m sure that they are find to put on a binder or a piece of paper or something along those lines, but to use them as a label for products is a waste of time. They curl up and fall off in minutes.</span>

<span>I purchased this printer in March 2021 and it is amazing! I use it to print product labels for my Etsy shop, and it is used exclusively with my 2019 MacBook. In the year and half that I’ve had it, I’ve had a few hiccups with it - but that’s par for the course with any tech product.<br/><br/>I’ve found that the labels look better when images are set in a white background. Full color can be done, but it doesn’t look as good in my opinion. Color quality and variations are attributed to the label cartridges, not the printer itself. I recently printed 130 identical 2”x3” labels and I noticed very slight color variations (I used multiple cartridges) but nothing extreme.<br/><br/>I love that I can use AirPrint with this machine. I can print from a different room in my home and it works just as well as it does when I’m sitting next to it.</span>

<span>I personally thought it was okay it worked fine all except for the app it’s a little weird to use but I got the hang of it. But the product itself is simple plug and play print quality was decent didn’t really get my colors to perfection.  It still a pretty good tool to have around if needed.</span>

<span>I started doing some online sales as a side hustle and this thing is a life saver. If you're printing lots of labels on a regular basis this thing will save you so much time. It's also much less expensive than some other big brand options and works flawlessly. They give you some tips on where to get free labels but the labels they produce and sell are also very inexpensive and high quality. I haven't had to reach out to support because it's been working great out of the box but based on the documentation it seems like they're easy to get a hold of if you need anything. Definitely recommend for anyone with a budding online business.</span>

<span>I run a small indie board game company and this thing has saved me an INCREDIBLE amount of time and pain.<br/>I had a Dymo label printer and it constantly jammed, misaligned, and skipped labels when I tried to print anything over 2-3 at a time. I decided to try this after my label printer finally destroyed itself because it isn't smart enough to know when it is out of paper. I wondered if all small label printers were this horrific?<br/><br/>Apparently not. Because this thing is tiny, simple, and has gotten me through over 500 kickstarter lablels in a matter of minutes with no errors, no duplicate prints, and none of the fuss of my old printer. The only downside is the label roll holder is absurdly huge and takes up far too much space on my desk, so I will be returning that part and making my own, smaller one from wood.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the single best purchases I have made for my small business. And I hope this serves me well for all of my future KS projects. :)</span>

<span>I purchased this product for my child for one of his birthday presents, and it did not disappoint! It’s cool because you can actually mount it onto your fridge via the magnetic holder it comes with.. so it’s always within distance for use. it is the size of a cell phone from the 90s, and prints labels perfectly. It comes with three refills of different label textures. So far, it’s been more useful to the family than to my 13-year-old, we have printed our name to put on the mailbox among other things. All around, this is a really cool item and I highly suggest it as a gift if you want to stand out!</span>

<span>For the price, and for a home printer that’s occasionally used, it meets our needs. I got this printer a few weeks ago and it did take some time (an hour or so) to connect it to my laptop and cell phone (for the remote printing capabilities). I am not tech savvy, and I did get frustrated during the process. It also lures you in with “ink for 6 months!”…more like 1 month. I print the occasional paper for my kids school, a recipe here and there, and maybe a few sheets - it’s out of ink and I’d guess I’ve used 30 sheets. Definitely not 6 months worth, and definitely not if you’re using it as a primary printer. I’m disappointed because I think that was false advertising. For what I need it for, what it does and the cost, it’s fine for our home desk option. Don’t purchase if you’re using it for college kids who will need to print a lot, or for business/office use; you’ll run out of ink constantly. Let’s also mention the ink is $30…after 1 refill, I’m going to donate the printer and buy something else, or else I’ve spent more on ink refills than the device cost!</span>

<span>Pros: Easy set-up, connects to computers via WiFi, small and compact<br/><br/>Cons: Just try and print something, anything, and this printer will sit on it until it's darn good and ready to actually print.

<span>Light weight and compact enough to not get in the way. Prints fast for me. Easy to assemble but to setup you will need to install the App on your phone or PC for it to work. If you have trouble printing right with Windows 10 it is due to MS update and there is a patch for it, the link in the app so you can install the driver. Wireless and you can print from anywhere to the printer. Also an option for HP+ and Instaink so they send you ink when you are low before you run out, you pick your plan on how many pages per month you use or change it whenever. Never run out of ink. The basic low end is only 99 cents a month!  You can choose to opt out of it. Cannot comment on durability and life because I just go it the other day. But with HP+ there is a 2 year warranty included.</span>

<span>I love the small size and the clean, crisp printing.  However, setting up the wifi was a very difficult and involved many steps (unlike other wifi printers I have purchased).

<span>Bought this to replace my old HP wifi printer/scanner (upgraded to windows 10, no HP drivers for a 14 year old printer).<br/>PROS<br/>1) Small footprint<br/>2) Printouts are extremely good.<br/>3) Fast printing.<br/>4) Can scan single sheets of paper.<br/>Cons:<br/>1) NO flat bed scanner, which I use for everything from receipts, to stamps, to old pictures, pages from a book, to full sheets of paper. (Not with this thing).<br/>2) Can ONLY scan full sheets of paper.<br/>  a) Need a store receipt scanned? Forget it, you MUST tape it to a FULL sheet of paper, wasting the paper and messing up the receipt.<br/>  b) Need to scan a page out of a book, not with this thing, unless you are going to tear the page out of the book and tape it to a full sheet of paper.<br/>  c) Want to scan in old photos, 100% forget it, i) photo must be taped to a full piece paper. (Tape will not be coming off tye x photograph when done.  ii) the rollers pulling the paper through the scanner will totally destroy old photos.  So do NOT try it unless you want horribly scanned and destroy photos.<br/><br/>I  can only rate this as three (3) stars because this is a very good printer with a totally worthless "scanner" function. Cannot scan small things like receipt. Will totally destroy any old photographs you might want to scan.  This device should have been sold as a printer only. Only then would it be 5 stars for is speed and print quality. The horrible/worthless built in scanner drops the rating down to no more than 3 star.  Whose dumb idea was it to incorporate a single sheet roller scanner in to home printer? It adds no value to this device.</span>

<span>5 stars for Amazon fast delivery and this good cheap printer but 2 stars or less for HP wireless greed...<br/><br/>To connect with USB, you will need USB-A to USB-B cable (not provided).  No big deal for me; I found an old extra one that I don't use.<br/><br/>My instructions below for Windows computer only:<br/><br/>You can FORGET about the HP Smart software.  Go to support.hp.com, search for HP 3755, and download either the file "HP DeskJet and Ink Advantage 3700 All-in-One EasyStart Printer Setup Software – Offline Use Only"  dated Mar 24, 2022 (if you just want to print, no scan) OR "HP DeskJet and Ink Advantage 3700 All-in-One Print and Scan Driver and Accessories" dated Mar 14, 2022 (if you want to print AND scan).<br/><br/>Once you downloaded the software from the HP site, SHUT OFF your computer's WIFI (do not turn WIFI on until the end of this printer installation).  Run the software.  Follow the on screen instructions.  I think you only need to agree the EULA, everything else you can skip or say no.  Use manual set up instead of automatic if asked, it should force the USB connection or to choose between wireless and wire.  Turn on the printer.  Connect it with the USB-A to USB-B cable...  If the screen is stuck at spinning while looking for the printer, ignore the "do not disconnect usb" warning, just unplug the usb cable and reconnect or try another USB port from your computer.  After the installation process, now you should be able to print.<br/><br/>To use the scan function, turn the WIFI back on.  Go the Microsoft Store, get the "HP Scan and Capture" app.  Open the app, location the HP 3755 in the setting.  Since there is no physical button on the HP 3755 printer, you will need this software to scan.  Within the app, you can choose where to save the scanned photo/document.<br/><br/>I was able to wire connect this printer with 3 Windows laptops as a backup printer.</span>

The replacement did not print one label correctly from eBay or Stamps.com after installing the software and following all of the directions properly the label printer continued to not print the edge of the label. I don’t know if it’s some communication issue with their Mac software, but it was very frustrating.</span>

<span>It is not easy to use. BCL do not have their driver on their website at the time I tried to download from their website. If you search google you can have the instruction said you will need to install Zebra driver to use device. Compare to Zebra ZP 450, I’m not feeling BCL has 300 dpi quality. Otherwise everything is good, if you are looking for device cheaper than Zebra ZP 500, can use same driver like ZP500. It’s good. The PC will recognize it is ZP500, only you know it is BCL. Do not compare tech support as Zebra — can’t.</span>

<span>Setup the printer for my Etsy shop. It’s easy to use. It took me an hour or so to get the driver downloaded properly. I downloaded and installed it twice. Second round worked. Makes fulfilling orders on Etsy so much easier and saves time.  The manual and driver is all online and the FAQ page was helpful on some things. Overall, I’m really happy with the value. I looked at many of these and went with this one because of a couple reviews.</span>

<span>Driver install was simple. However, it took some time to get labels to print. You must download and print the 4 by 6 versions provided by whoever is providing the label. If you get something elsez you'll need to use some sort of editing tool to get the correct print area, and even using those tools you run the risk of lowering the quality of the image being printed. However, once we got that part figured out it works great!</span>
