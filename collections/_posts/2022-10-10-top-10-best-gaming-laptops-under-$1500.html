<span> The original purchase of the laptop, the touchpad did not work at all. The return process isn't quite as easy as I still haven't even recieved credit yet and I ordered it the beginning of September. I had to order it a 2nd time due to work and after a week or 2 the charging cord fritz and stopped working. I had to work with Amazon who had to connect me with Acer with was such a pain to get a replacement charging cord sent. Now with all that said, I do enjoy the laptop for gaming and work. The start up is so seemless and the gameplay is flawless! I love the option to turn on the fan separately when playing a high usage game, and the customization of colors of the keys are a plus. I do also love the additon of the side number keypad as I occasionaly work with numbers and it makes it so much eaier. I hope that the glitches I had in the beginning were just out of the norm and this will be a future proof laptop!!</span>

<span>This is my 2nd Acer product and I've never been more happy. The speeds are amazing, quality is top notch. The laptop can get hot if you don't have proper venting but even with higher temps I've never had issues. Solid laptop, plays any game or program I throw at it.</span>

<span>The most recent reviews are kind of mixed so I decided to add one. Many years ago I was a pc gamer, I’m talking AMD phenom 2 black edition and dual ati 4850 days, overclocking- I considered myself a power user… I wanted to get something that I could game with but mostly use for work and college. I’m not naive to the fact that battery life would be terrible, so plugging it in and battery isn’t an issue for me<br/><br/>This laptop is great, I haven’t had any issues with it. It’s fast I play mostly COD but I’ve also tried flight sim, horizon, really any game I could that I thought would stress the CPU and GPU. It runs everything, really great.<br/><br/>Typing on the keyboard is fine, trackpad is fine, everything you open pretty much opens instantly, price is great, etc..<br/><br/>I wish I would’ve got one with a 2k or even 4k screen, but it isn’t really a deal breaker as the screen is really good.<br/><br/>The one thing I’ll agree with everyone is that it gets very hot, but I think a lot of the expectations are that it should be cool. When you’re using word, PowerPoint, etc, heat isn’t an issue but gaming it gets hot, like very hot to the touch toward the top of the laptop, which is to be expected. I do have a cooling pad and it helps some but again it’s to be expected.<br/><br/>If you’re on the fence this is a great pick, I was torn between a laptop with the 3070 vs this one with the 3060. This has the higher TGP of 105w vs a lot of the 3070s with the lower TGP, from the research I did this one with the higher TGP results in the 3060 being faster than the 3070s around the same price range.</span>

<span>this is my first time having a asus laptop and it is just excellent! The multicolor backlit keyboards are beautiful and the computer is looks and feel very sturdy. The features  are very convenient; i can see my phone notifications, transfer calls from my phone to my laptop, and drag tabs to my phone with myasus and xglide. it has three modes: silent, performance, and turbo which I find very useful for different task. However, I gave it a 4 star because the battery life isn't as long as they describe and also one of the keyboard's keys fell out and I had to reattach but it was minor problem so not that serious. I’m also writing this to disclose about my 90 day extended warranty.</span>

<span>For clarity, this review is for the 15.6" GTX 1650 version, not the 17.3" GTX 1650Ti version.<br/><br/>Positives!<br/><br/>This laptop is perfect for me and what I need right now. I am currently in between homes, over the road a lot for work and have all of my stuff in storage, including my main PC, so I bought a laptop so I could continue doing work and gaming while on the go.<br/>This laptop is not top of the line by any means, it's no $2,000 laptop with an RTX 3080 or anything like that, but if you want a good mid-range laptop that can get 60FPS on some everyday gaming, this is as good as mid-range laptops get in my opinion.<br/>Even on my main, much beefier PC, I've never been one to crank up the settings and enable raytracing, 4k etc. I'm more of a framerate type of person and this laptop does a great job getting high frame rates if you're willing to adjust the settings accordingly. The screen is a clean 1920x1080, lovely quality (though the brightness isn't that great), comes with an NVME 512GB hard drive which is not a bad start if you're not trying to install a Call of Duty game with 100gb patches, but that leads into another glowing positive - this thing is upgradeable and I love it! One of the hardest things about picking a laptop for me is the eventual obsolescence, so in the few times I've bought a laptop in my life, I prefer ones you can upgrade which will allow you to skirt by the expected lifespan for a bit longer.<br/>Overall, my complaints a few, but I will point them out.<br/><br/>Negatives!<br/>Honestly, 8GB of RAM is... well, it's not enough for any modern PC that you want to do more than browse the internet, but this negative hardly counts against it because once again, it is upgradeable! I added 32GB to mine and it runs like a dream now. The fact it ships with such low RAM is forgivable because that's probably why the price of entry is as low as it is.<br/>I also had a few problems with the Wi-Fi antenna at first, which I know is not unique to my laptop, but after a few online searches, troubleshooting and settings adjustments, it hasn't dropped the connection for a couple of days, so I think I'm over that hump.<br/>My last complaint and honestly maybe the only one that could be considered "major" is the screen brightness. To be clear, I'm talking about BRIGHTNESS, not QUALITY. The resolution is wonderful and the screen is a clear HD experience, but keep this thing away from the sunlight if you want to see it easily... I took it to the park one day and while I could see the screen, I felt like I was squinting, and I had to change my preferred dark mode to light mode just to see the Windows UI better. Once again, I consider this a minor gripe and won't take a star off, because if you're using this thing indoors or in appropriate shade, the screen is beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for an affordable, upgradeable, laptop suited for everyday gaming (as long as you're not trying to push max settings, 4k or raytracing), you won't be disappointed!</span>

<span>My hubby is the big PC gamer, I am a consol peasant. However, there are certain games we have been itching to play together and they are either not cross platform within game or just PC only. When we saw this deal I thought "well my old laptop is laggy AF and has no memory and was never meant for gaming" so we decided to get this in place of a full blown PC set up (which we didn't have space for even if I wanted it).<br/>But I am impressed, for a medium serious gamer, the battery life is decent, i play over wifi and it's still great without ethernet cable. They designed really well so it doesn't overheat and does not require external cooling fans, as the air blows out the back, I would suggest giving it a few inches from the wall which most people do anyway because the air blowing out can be pretty warm.<br/>The laptop is quiet but the fans do make some background noise but it's not bothersome, and I hardly notice it when playing a game only when shutting it down.<br/>Overall I'm very happy with it! I would recommend this brand if anyone asked me.</span>

<span>Tldr: it's a good laptop that has 1 open nvme slot if you want to expand your storage and it has 1 open Ram slot for expanding your ram. It's worth investing the 20 or so dollars to get another 8 gig 3200 speed ram sitck, if you want.<br/><br/>it came with 8 gigs of single rank 3200 speed Ram, a 3rd gen 512 GB Samsung nvme I think it was 3200 mb/s read and I want to say 2200mb/s write and one nvme slot unpopulated, Realtek ethernet/Wi-Fi 6 capable wireless card, no SSD cradle (just in case you are looking at YouTube videos and saw that one was installed in there) its fine and a 3060 Max P if I remember correctly.<br/><br/>Here's where things got a little frustrating.<br/><br/>I had to plug it in before the power button would power on the computer despite it having 40% battery (this only happened once), it took a lot longer to boot the first time; long enough I thought it was broken and then the screen turned on. Windows 11 came installed and was about a year out of date (last november 2021), which is understandable stuff sits in a warehouse but it's kind of buggy till you run Windows update, so do that first thing then install your programs or some won't open when you try to run them (happened to me)<br/><br/>Now the ram situation. Amd processors work much better with dual channel ram which means two sticks of ram not one 8 gig stick. Its unacceptable at this price point (my opnion), that said it was doable on 8 gigs; when you take into account switchable graphics mode takes 2 gigs of ram the cpus on chip graphics this leaves you with 6 gigs for system tasks, but once you start getting stuff installed Windows uses about 4 gigs of RAM leaving you 2 gigs free. I just don't know how 8 gigs of RAM is sufficient these days given what I mentioned, that said it did surprisingly well in cyberpunk on mostly high settings at 1080p.<br/><br/>Secure boot was enabled by default which is kinda annoying because if you wanna run Linux you have to disable that if I remember correctly and amd's platform security processor was also enabled by default as well. most people won't care about this or even know what they are but it's an annoyance for people who want to install other operating systems ( just hit F2 while the computer is booting if you want secure boot disabled)<br/><br/>I didn't feel right not mentioning these things, it's something I wouldve wanted to know before purchasing if I didn't know much about computers. Overall I'm happy it just took a second to get it setup and running optimally.</span>

<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I spent a while deciding on a lower end gaming machine to get after growing weary of PSN offerings over the last few years. Have been a console player on PSN for 27 years and wanted a good machine to start my PC adventures again. For PC Gaming you have to have good gear. And man can this machine deliver! It boots up and shuts down in about 5-7 seconds and flys through games and apps. I'm running Xbox live, Steam, Epic games with no issues.<br/><br/>The keyboard is nice, one of the reasons I picked this machine, very comfortable to use hours on end. Fans are loud, as most of these gaming machines are, but really not too bad...I don't ever really notice them while I'm playing. I run my HDMI out to a 4K gaming monitor and it runs great. Some people complain about the touch pad, but I never use it....using the Nitro gaming mouse and love it. I like the thin bezel screen design, keeping those red LED's on my keyboard. Some gaming laptops do not have a good keyboard layout...this one is nice.<br/><br/>I also can confirm this works with Meta Quest 2 with a link cable (to a decent degree). Some low end gaming laptops do not even have a USB 3.0 port, this one does. Don't expect this machine to work great on all VR games and it takes a bit of tweaking to get your system running smooth, I did have some issues with a couple Steam VR games. But I can confirm it works reasonably well with VR Pokerstars and PopOne is playable (I still prefer wireless for that as there is not a real advantage in using link cable, but it was a great test on framerate and playability). I will be trying more VR games eventually. You do have to optimize this laptop a bit but not too much to do , trim down the fat. But it is fun exploring what this machine can do with VR games.<br/><br/>Some tips:<br/>I HIGHLY recommend getting another Ram stick, 16Gig min. (I'm running 16 Gig and always have 4-8 Gigs free) . At 8 Gigs it's just not enough.  I also highly recommend getting a larger SSD card (just add on) as these games do take up space quickly. I dropped in a 1 TB card so I am at 1.2 TB now. Taking the back cover off was not really too hard, once you take the screws off and pop off the first latch, just be careful as this case is plastic.<br/><br/>I use an adjustable metal laptop stand and have the back raised 3 or 4 inches to keep the air flow underneath good (lowered down a bit) , after a couple months of use it seems to work well and gives me a comfortable angle to use the keyboard.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>Hello to anyone who is actually reading this. So I bought this budget gaming latop and kept it for like 5 days and I was a little disappointed in it. It can do work/business things very well but for gaming....not so much. When played minecraft, raid shadow legends, forager, borderlands 2, and other fun games, the fan got really loud. Or the top of the keyboard got really hot since it was made of some type of metal. Of course I used the msi app thing to mess with the fan speed; having the fan lowered made the keyboard really hot. But to have the keyboard cooled, the fan has to be loud...but overall, it's a really good work/business laptop.</span>

<span>If you need a good gaming laptop for starting out or something that can handle multitasking with games in the mix then don't overthink ot and just buy this.  MSI when it comes to gaming,multitasking and customization is the best of the best no dispute .<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>●The screen is absolutely bright and full of color,  I almost never use this screen on the laptop and have it hooked to a monitor but I recent took it to my back porch and did some work ... the laptop was even clear and bright I'm the sunlight<br/>● The speed and Raam of this computer are perfect for gaming and even playing triple A games doesn't kill this beast . I've played Skyrim, jurassic world evolution 2 and even.... CYBERPUNK ... any gamer knows cyberpunk breaks things lol<br/>● I recommend downloading MSI Dragon center to monitor your fan speed,heat , cpu usage etc. Dragon center is clean and easy to understand as well<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>● sometimes before I purchased a laptop stand this laptop would get rather warm... over 125F however cooler boost easily fixes it seconds . This however for some people might be concerning so I recommend to definitely buy a laptop stand for about 20-30$ and your laptop should stay cool</span>

<span>Spilt a drink across it immediately so now the keyboard is sticky but that's only complaint about it lol. Got this as a gift for my daughter who's beginning to get into more resource intensive games. She was pretty floored how well it handled all the games she plays (Mostly through Roblox) on max settings. It really does look good and loads them much faster now as well. If it breaks due to my catastrophic cluts moment, I'll probably buy her the same model again ($600). Might upgrade to one of the higher end graphic card models</span>

<span>The laptop seems to work okay but I would hesitate to buy one again.  From my perspective:<br/>Cons.<br/>1.  Slow to boot up.  My previous laptop was less expensive, had a slower processer, and booted up in half the time.  It was an Acer.  The Acer did fail hard though.<br/>2.  Hot.  When holding on my lap it gets warmer than I like.  It needs a better cooling solution.  I buy a laptop for use on my lap, not a desk.<br/>3.  Hard to upgrade.  I like to add a second hard drive for backing up data.  This laptop has a spot but you must break the warranty seal and it isn't very easy to split the case.  Be careful to not crack any of the plastic case.<br/>4.  On the pricy side.  Given my experience so far I think this laptop is over priced.<br/>5.  Keyboard is minimal, I like a few of the numeric keys that are missing on this keyboard.  My old Acer was the same size and had the keys so they could fit.<br/>Pros.<br/>1. The display seems nice and clear, though similar to my older Acer which I also liked.<br/><br/>Overall right now I would not purchase this laptop again.  However if it is significantly more durable than my old Acer I will be happy with my purchase.  If Acer's were more durable I would have bought another one over the MSI.</span>

<span>This MSI is quite the little powerhouse, it runs any game I throw at it at a steady 60 FPS with max graphical settings. I initially stress tested it with Doom Eternal, and it was as though I was playing it on my desktop. If there were any differences they were so negligible I didn't notice.<br/><br/>On top of that with the 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs, which is usually put into gaming laptops, makes multitasking during gameplay a non issue. Whether you're recording gameplay, or listening to spotify, or both!<br/><br/>The MSI is also built with metal casing unlike some of it's competitors, such as the Acer Razor, which is pure plastic. This gives it a sturdy feel, and adds a bit of protection.<br/><br/>Now, I did say this is a powerhouse so it does suck battery life rather fast. Granted there are options to conserve power, but even then at the very, very most you may get half a dozen hours, but more likely closer to four, or five. This for me isn't a deal breaker since I generally have a power socket nearby, and when I do not it's only for and hour or two max.<br/><br/>I will also point out that this machine gets hot, real hot the harder you push it. So I highly suggest using a cooling pad with it.<br/><br/>Other than that it's been running magnificently over the last few weeks since I got it. If you're looking for a really good gaming laptop, this is worth the price, and then some.<br/><br/>I highly recommend!</span>

<span>If you're reading this you may have read independent reviews on another site. Some complain about the weight, build quality, I even found one complaining about how thick it is... I found one review complaining about how it's not comparable to a full power 3070 laptop GPU. While true it's comparable to a 115watt 2070 (looking like this ones 7-9% better by my measures), but it also has a newer better processor than my old 2070 laptop so that's a bonus.<br/><br/>So about laptops, let's be realistic, the rule of thumb in laptop GPUs is that the current generation is nearly equal (+/- a few %) to the generation before it. That's been a pretty accurate saying for the past 10+ years.  This GPU is the lower wattage version, if you have a 115watt 2070 save your money it's not going to be a huge difference unless your playing CPU intensive games... Comparing this to my wife's laptop with a full powered 3070 it's lighter, has comparable battery life, and runs a little cooler. It seems to be less FPS at about a 10-20 FPS difference in some games at high to ultra settings, but still maintains 60+ in all tested games. Comparing it to my old 2070 laptop this ones a little better, but not worth the upgrade in the name of performance, for me it was an upgrade in portability.<br/><br/>Yes it gets hot, but mine has yet to approach thermal throttle territory, and yes it has some weight, and yes it's thick compared to almost all nongaming laptops and a little thicker than some other gaming laptops. Admittedly this is my first msi laptop, but the build quality feels good to me in comparison to the Alienware, Lenovo, and Asus laptops I've owned, it's also thinner and lighter than all of the ones I've owned, especially the Alienwares.<br/><br/>One downside is the battery, plan on having this thing on an outlet if you're going to use it for more than an 1 or 2 hours gaming, 3-4 hours just running with word and a browser. This is the biggest drawback I could find, which doesn't bother me much since outlets are easy to come by this day and age. When comparing to other laptops I've owned its dismal, even my 2070 watt laptop got 6 hours when new, 3-4 hours when gaming. I figure this may be a side effect of people wanting to make smaller thinner laptops... Both my wifes 3070 laptop and my 3070 laptop have the same dismal battery life.<br/><br/>Another possible downside is the limited storage. With games like Forza Horizon 5, CoD, GTA, etc you're not going to have a vast library on the m.2 that comes with it. But my external SSD works fine to solve this, and while I haven't taken it apart I read there is either a second m.2 or a 2.5 inch bay - note that's just what I've read, I have not personally confirmed this. All in all the limited storage may affect some, but it's easily remedied using an external drive, thumb drive, and possibly internal expansion (again, I haven't confirmed this yet)<br/><br/>It's a settings game to achieve 144fps, same can be said for getting 240 on a desktop pc, but it's so far been doable at decent graphics in most games I've played on it.</span>

<span>I know MSI haven't been in the gaming computer business that long, but they have a great reputation as a motherboard manufacturer, so based on that, I decided to try them out. I'm glad I did. I've been surprised at how very, very good this laptop is.<br/><br/>Graphics - the RTX 3070 handles Cyberpunk (ray tracing off) at a consistent 75 fps, FFXIV on maximum settings runs at 140+ fps, GTA V on maximum settings runs at 80+ fps, Witcher 3 runs at 90+ fps, etc. all on max/ultra settings.<br/><br/>Processor - I haven't run into anything that's slowed it down yet.<br/><br/>RAM - 16GB has been fine. I haven't run into any need for more based on the games I play.<br/><br/>Storage - the 512 GB turned out to be a little small for my needs, so I had to add a WD Black SSD and swap that to my main drive, though it's not MSI's fault that I didn't buy a big enough drive.<br/><br/>Monitor - Has great blacks and contrast, but no touchscreen. I don't care about that, though.<br/><br/>Build - the shell is made of a sort of brittle plastic that cracked with I was peeling the bottom off to add the new hard drive. Don't expect it to survive a drop.<br/><br/>Battery - I honestly don't know. I wanted a laptop because I have a home base with a monitor and keyboard, but I also need to move from desk to desk where I always have a power supply. I rarely need to use it on the go, per se. I've read it can be low, though.<br/><br/>So, based on my needs, I'm super happy with how this laptop performs. If you really wanted to spend an extra $2000+ to push those FPS into the 200+ range, I guess you could, but I don't really see the need. Very strongly recommended!</span>

<span>I got this laptop almost a month ago now, and it does everything I wanted and then some; however, there are a few downsides I've discovered since owning it, but I think a couple of them is just Windows 11 being buggy.<br/>First, it gets really, really hot. Absurdly hot. I installed Core Temp to keep an eye on the CPU temperatures, and it gets up to 90C+! The normal safety shutoff for motherboards is 80C, and even at 80C that's cooking the CPU. With the temperatures going above 80C, I hope it will still last a while. I didn't want a laptop that would only last as long as the warranty.<br/>Second, and I think this one is Windows 11, the screen has weird artifacts if you don't shut down for a few days. I'm a user that only puts my computers to sleep instead of shutting down; it doesn't hurt it, but it does use a small amount of electricity to keep it running. With this laptop, the screen flickers after a few days of this if anything moved/updated, and I've even had an issue where part of the screen was being duplicated.<br/>Third, I would say is more of a me issue than a laptop issue. You have to open the lid to press the power button. I keep the laptop shut when I am at my desk to use my monitors, and I got a dock for when I'm at my desk. There is no power button on the dock I got nor any I looked at, and the only way to turn on the laptop is to open the lid, press the power button, and close the lid back.<br/>Fourth, it gets REALLY slow when it's not plugged in. Absurdly slow. I understand that when it's not plugged in, it's using the CPU as the GPU as well, but there's a HUGE difference in performance when it's plugged in vs on battery. It's usually not that noticable.<br/>Fifth, is the battery. If you're searching the web (not streaming anything), you won't have issues with the battery life, and it'll probably last you around 3 hours on one full charge; however, if you're like me and using the laptop for working or streaming, it will barely last an hour to hour and a half. Maybe I can find an extended battery or something down the road, but for now, the battery life isn't so great.<br/>I know I've only mentioned the negatives I've found, but I did give it a 5 star review. These can be overlooked with the positives I've experienced vs my tower PC.</span>

It sat for 12 months (too long) and I’ve spent the last ~12 months trying to get it working. I tried updating it 20 times but it failed repeatedly so I wiped the whole computer and reinstalled the OS. Still no good. I tried upgrading to newest version of windows with no luck. Reverted back to current version and still won’t work. Ran antivirus scans with multiple antivirus software packages and never had any flags. Never downloaded anything to get a virus. Now it won’t even connect to internet and none of the troubleshooting works. Biggest waste of $1,000 in my entire life.</span>

<span>No issues with the laptop at all, everything works perfectly. I am just used to using heavily cpu and gpu intensive applications, this computer gets very warm on the keyboard, the fans keep it reasonable, but doing anything is going to mean the fans are going and a lot of heat will get created. Love how small and light it is comparatively. I love the RGB keyboard, I can set it to a faint blueish purple, wasn't expecting that from all of the advertising images. The ergonomics for typing are a bit strange too, the keyboard is fine, but with how far back they are set, it almost makes you want to have a desk with an inset and lots of ventilation in the inset for ergonomic purposes. Oh, also I have no idea how much of the sRGB colorspace the monitor can display, and I can't calibrate it, but everything feels very yellow and washed out compared to my previous monitor, which I think was miniled.</span>

I fought with that machine for about a week before returning it.<br/>As I really like the first machine overall, I decided to give the ASUS TUF series another try and went with a bit of an upgrade from the first machine.<br/>Initial start up and Windows 10 set up went flawless and easy.  Wifi connected quick easy and fast.  From my first experience I was able to go through and do a lot of basic setup with the ASUS utilities and basic Windows preferences.<br/>Everything worked fine until the first BIOS update to version 309 installed.  After that the wifi became quite erratic.  It might or might not connect.  When it doesn't connect, the wifi won't display any networks at all.  In some cases the hardware will shut down and there won't even be a WiFi option.<br/>Pros<br/>It is a big screen and decent keyboard.  Backlighting is somewhat programmable for overall color and there are apparently some basic special effects that can be turned on with the ASUS Armory Crate utility.  In this instance the machine came with 16G of memory, 6G of graphics memory and a 1T SSD.  I never really got to try out the gaming or usability of the machine as the WiFi not working is a deal breaker.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>The NUM LOCK key has no visual light or marker to indicate if it is on or off.  A small LED like the Caps Lock would have been fine, but it has none so you have to find out the hard way.<br/>Once all the basic Windows 10 stuff is set up from original install/set up the machine runs quite well and was a lot faster than the first machine I had.  When Windows 10 starts doing the upgrades/updates, DO NOT ALLOW THE BIOS UPDATES!!!!!!!!!!!  The WiFi problems are due to faulty bios starting with versions 309.  Versions 310 and 312 completely shut down the ability for the wifi to work at all.  If you don't have a Cat5 cable to plug in for internet, you will be out of luck.<br/><br/>Heat.  This is a powerful machine and the processors generate a lot of heat.  There should have been some kind of built in stand offs on the underside to give more air space under the fans.  As it is designed it sets too close to a smooth flat table for enough air to flow.  It really needs a laptop cooler if you plan on doing any real gaming.  If it has about 3/4 of an inch under the machine at the top end, it seems to stay fairly cool if you have the fans running at all.  (I actually can't hear them myself)<br/><br/>I will probably be returning this to Amazon.  I would not recommend ANY of the ASUS computers at this time due to the BIOS WiFi issue.  For me, the lack of WiFi access makes this a boat anchor.  Of course ASUS isn't really saying anything about this ocean liner slamming into an iceberg.<br/>Be aware that there are a lot of "make do" fixes online for the ASUS WiFi issue.  I suspect it is going to be worse before it is better.<br/>The first machine started having problems the first evening.  Through the following week the WiFi became more and more erratic until it just wouldn't work at all.<br/>At this point THIS macnine is ONE DAY OLD and the wifi is completely shut down.</span>

<span>I previously posted about receiving this computer as a refurbished product. I am removing that post because Ted and all the folks at the seller recognized the mistake right away and jumped through hoops to get me the new product I ordered within 24 hours. I cannot say enough good things about folks who recognize a problem and offer real solutions, and then follow through on those solutions.<br/><br/>The computer? Fast, well built, great screen<br/> It runs hot, of course, so get a quality laptop cooler.</span>

<span>Have been using the laptop for a week now and it has been a substantial improvement from my last laptop. I haven't found a game I can't play in Ultra graphics so it's pretty great. My only issue is that on start sometimes, the laptop can't find the hard drive and starts in the BIOS menu where it can't really do much. the way I've fixed this issue when it occurs (and I'm being 100% serious) is by turning off the laptop, flipping it over, giving it a couple of love taps and a single shake and it restarts without issue.</span>

<span>This laptop is perfect for anyone looking for a low budget gaming system. It plays games like Need for Speed pretty easily on high settings.<br/><br/>I would recommend adding another 8gb stick of RAM for even better performance.<br/><br/>What I don’t like about this laptop is the battery life. Even when not using it for gaming the battery doesn’t last very long. I sometimes use the laptop for work, so I’m using a lot excel and web browsing and I will usually have to plug it in at least twice to get me through the day.</span>

<span>Installed extra RAM, as needed with Win11<br/>Added 1TB SSD drive as well for storage, easy install. Had to take back off however be careful and take guitar pick to get that off, nothing metal.<br/>When setting up win11 it asks to login with MS account, bypass by pressing Shift+F10, then do a ipconfig /release. Once that is done, press the back arrow and you will be able to create a local account on PC to avoid registering to your email account as that is super super annoying.<br/><br/>Overall, laptop sturdy, not too heavy, super quick to get into windows once turned on. I like the power button as it is out of the way when you pick the laptop up(at times you may press that by mistake in most other laptops and can put to sleep, etc).<br/><br/>Laptop pretty much ready to go at that point. I had to install nvidia gforce software to upgrade the vid card software and drivers.<br/><br/>Other than that, SOLID.<br/><br/>Have fun, good for the price.</span>

<span>First off, I want to acknowledge what a great value overall this laptop is. It is specced well for the price point, and the white with teal only lights is drool worthy imo. Their needs to be more laptops with color options besides every shade of black, and 20k shades of grey. It literally turns heads in the library when I take it out lol. The plastic made case doesn't feel cheap or low quality at all. When I got it I upgraded to 24gb ram from 8gb. I didn't know the 8 was soldered onto the mobo, and that's my fault for not doing enough research. Also when I got it I added a 2nd 1tb wd black ssd, along with the nonamer brand one it came with. There's no Xtra thermal pad for the 2nd m.2 slot  that comes with the laptop, and there definitely should be. We'll see if heat is an issue down the road for it.Adding this 2nd ssd , unbeknownst to me they are put into some sort of raid mode,by the bios,not 0,not 1, and it can't be changed. The bios is absolutely atrocious. Almost nothing can be tinkered with.  even in advanced options(f7) anything interesting is greyed out i.e. graphics options,storage options, secure boot stuff. it's despicable that you can't change any of this stuff, and really bent me jaded me on this laptop abit. If your braindead and just want to game, this is optimal. If you want to squeak every bit of performance, and optimize YOUR laptop like I have my whole life, this isn't that laptop.ASUS cuts off every avenue for enhancement, and they use the Intel dynamic tuning, and Intel management engine to put a kibosh on any attempt to subvert this garbage. The screens good not great, sound is good not great, also im pretty sure they turn off some of the VM features of the i7 chip this laptop came with the vt-x. So power users need not apply here. 'Nuff said.</span>

<span>My laptop works pretty good. I had a couple of technical issues (eg NVidia video card disappearing) and tech support was absolutely unhelpful (after spending a very long time with them).<br/>Check the specs on the machine you are buying because there are similar models with different features. I did not get some of the features I expected to get (and what I saw in promotional videos and even unboxing videos). Be careful.</span>

<span>I maxed out the ram out of the box, so its right at 40 gigs. This device is used for editing 4k drone video, writing estimates,  pretty much real time.<br/><br/>Also of note, this is my second purchase of the ASUS brand, the first one was also very reliable and has served me well, it was even dropped and lived to compute to this day. I upgraded to this computer due to my older ASUS (7 years old) could not handle the 4k video so well. (BTW, I am not referring to the cheap base models of ASUS, rather the gaming computers.  As  you can see from the photo, I have 2 monitors hooked up, and the original ASUS right beside this one.</span>
