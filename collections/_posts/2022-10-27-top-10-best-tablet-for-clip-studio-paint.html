<span>I've used many Wacom products for the past 20 years<br/>from the graphite (price similar to this one) to Intuos XL and M touch (=today's Intuos pros),<br/>Cintiq 13HD, and these day I use Cintiq 24 PRO for work.<br/><br/>I am planning to travel around while working since my work is currently remote<br/>and can be done anywhere as long as I have a pc and a tablet to draw.<br/><br/>I initially thought of using my new ipad but I could not get used to the apps<br/>and the apple pen cause I was so used to the precision of a Wacom pen.<br/>Next thing was to bring a laptop + my old Intuos 5 M touch around<br/>but I realized I don't even need the M size and it won't fit my tote bag.<br/>Plus, it's pretty heavy to carry around with a laptop.<br/><br/>So, I decided to look into cheaper and smaller Wacom tablets that I can use<br/>without worrying about damaging or losing, and this one was perfect!<br/>It's also wirelessly connectable via Bluetooth which I liked.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1. Really small and light-weight to carry around<br/>2. Great pricing<br/>3. This is great for beginners - intermediate artists<br/>4. Wired and wireless<br/>5. Easy setup<br/>6. Precise Pen just like any other Wacom pens<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. The surface is a little too rough and it makes my hand clench my pen a bit harder<br/>since I need to use more force to draw something with a darker opacity compared to other pro-line-up tablets I have (cintiqs, Intuos Pros all have smoother surface that's just good enough and not too slippery like ipads)<br/><br/>2. Because the bezel around the active area is really thin (which is a pro for it's small size and lightweight), your palm might feel a bit awkward at times because there's no edge for your hand to rest on.<br/><br/>3. The build quality of the pen that comes does feel a bit cheap but it still draws without any issue and no battery's needed.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/>-I would recommend this to beginners who just wanted to get into digital art without overspending.<br/><br/>-I pasted on a paper-like screen protector made for a screen tablet so it's smoother than the original Intuos's rough surface. This will allow my hand to be more relaxed and the pen nib will probably last longer.<br/><br/>-For those who already own more advanced Wacom tablets, don't expect this to be on the same level of comfort as the pro lines but it's a nice tablet for traveling. I highly recommend you attach some kind of smoother texture screen protector on the tablet as I did because, without it, I find it harder to draw big curved lines (due to too much friction). My hand gets really tired quickly.<br/><br/>-Overall, I'm happy with it as it's wireless and easy to carry around. I would recommend it for any artists beginners - intermediate.</span>

<span>I scored this tablet about a month and 1/2 ago… Its a good drawing tablet with five assignable buttons and a handy storage strap for the nice included pen! A very comfortable drawing tablet with a fairly large working area… way better than a Bamboo or smaller tablet… a smooth, vaguely “paper-like” feel to the drawing surface. Captures my lines and pressure very well! Front row stuff!<br/><br/>You get a few extras, a couple of new tips, a little cleaning rag, a basic USB “mini” to USB “A” charge cable… a fussy set up but I got it to pair with a little (grumpy) effort.<br/><br/>However… its an older “new product” and I had to send it in for full (!) replacement—quite easy, actually—to get THE INTERNAL BATTERY UP TO STOP DRAINING! It was annoying to have 1/2 the power disappear in just one night of non-use (off, no Bluetooth)<br/><br/>The tablet had been sitting in a hot warehouse for four years—what with all the less expensive brands, I guess this one just sat and sat there… waiting. Melting.<br/><br/>Anyway, the newer tablet was shipped inside a week AND it can sit unused for weeks holding its charge! (Of course, once you start using it you power will run out after 15 hours of drawing on it) all-in-all a very nice drawing tablet for its somewhat “high” price… all the amenities of a true wireless pad.<br/><br/>Very fond of my Wacom now!</span>

<span>I am blue-collar worker going back to school and needed to take notes.<br/>My options were:<br/>1) Write in books, hard to look and search, harder to carry, gets lost, and negative to environment<br/>2) Use ipad, great quality, digital, can looked at after 2 yrs, but expensive<br/>and there I found this tablet.<br/><br/>Initially I was sceptical if I could write without a screen.<br/>It took a bit of adjustment in beginning to get used to it, but now I dont feel any difference. So overall:<br/>Pros: Easy to use, easy to carry, awesome for adults/kids<br/>Cons: Nib may need replacement but that is six months use (is that really con)<br/><br/>What I bought: Blue-tooth version that i charger overnight and use in the day<br/>Quick twist: Not all of area is usable with online graphic tools, but is a tool drawback - although it would be nice if Wacom added the software feature to map to some known writing tools like whiteboard, excalidraw etc.<br/><br/>Other than that, wish I had bought it earlier, but now with this, i am just storing digital notes.<br/>Awesome tool!!!</span>

One by Wacom drawing tablet is designed to make learning easier. Use the digital pen and tablet with your computer to draw, edit photos, express ideas, write formulas and interact in online classes in a way you can’t with a keyboard and trackpad. The simple USB connection to a Chromebook, Mac or Windows computer couldn’t be easier (some devices require a USB-C adapter) and the battery-free pressure-sensitive pen doesn’t require charging so it works the moment it touches the tablet surface. With Wacom’s 35+ years of digital pen development, you can count on One by Wacom as a high-quality, reliable product to last well beyond your school years. This product works with devices capable of running the latest version of Chrome OS and has been certified to meet Google's compatibility standards. Google is not responsible for the operation of this product or its compliance with safety requirements. Chromebook and the Works With Chromebook badge are trademarks of Google LLC.

<span>It worked like crap and I was confused but then I downloaded the driver's from the Wacom website and it was perfect.</span>

<span>Recommended by many, this tablet is amazing for osu!. The pen has some grip and can be held comfortably. The tablet has some extra friction which can help you aim with less shaking. Because of the lack of hardware smoothing, you may need to download tablet drivers and add an antichatter plugin (inside the drivers). This doesn't mean that it's bad, on the contrary, this is actually a good thing! Less hardware smoothing means you have more control over your aim and you won't have to worry about the software messing up your aim. Overall, I recommend this tablet 10/10.</span>

<span>I bought this to use with GIMP and Blender on my Linux machine and had an awesome experience with it. Wacom doesn't advertise as being penguin-friendly but the Linux kernel has the drivers for it. For both me and a friend of mine, this brand is truly plug and play (Mint and PopOS).<br/><br/>For actual use: You don't need the glove, it won't register input from your skin, you can put your hand right on it but the glove does make it feel smoother dragging your hand around which is nice. If you hover the tip over the pad it moves the cursor, touch down to click, button one is middle mouse, button two is right click. Perfect for controlling the viewport.<br/><br/>Also a super useful feature is being able to set the tablet's rotation/orientation and the ability to switch between relative and absolute cursor position. So in other words the tablet can represent the whole screen or it can work like a laptop trackpad in how it moves the cursor around.<br/><br/>If you're worried about not having shortcut buttons then remember you still have a keyboard for that so that makes this, in my opinion, the best value for a graphics tablet since it's the cheapest medium sized one I could find [for brands I know are Linux compatible].</span>

<span>This pen display is really good for its price, the main features are there and you can't deny that they work perfectly well. Here are the things that are kind of missing or that I would want: touch screen for zooming etc, wireless capabilities, maybe an extra button or two, and the adjustment of the height level is super basic so be prepared to use random books if your desk isnt the right height or angle. Really solid tablet, simple to use and connect.</span>

<span>This, unlike the Wacom Cintiq, is a lightly priced LCD graphics tablet alternative that won't exactly put your wallet down like Ol' Yeller. I've never used a huion product prior, but I've used this practically every day of my life almost. This graphics tablet isn't the best for beginners, seeing how it's pretty advanced in the way of using pen touch screen technology and several other confusing buttons, but if you're familiar with what you're doing then this is something you'll like.</span>

<span>Overall, it's very, very close to the quality of Wacom's more expensive screens. It pretty much outshines the Wacom One in every aspect but one:<br/><br/>The Huion's only drawback is that you must fiddle with driver calibration to ensure the cursor remains immediately underneath the pen's tip. Even after that, accuracy is never perfect, unless you hold the pen exactly as you did during calibration. It's not a deal-breaker, as you will eventually calibrate it to be almost perfect within the work area. It can be a tedious trial-and-error that can take at least an hour to fully understand what works. In a nutshell: As you tilt the pen, the cursor will drift towards the tilted direction. Huion hasn't quite figured out how to fix this; Wacom and Apple are the only panels are the only options to not have this issue. To Huion's credit, the most recent, easy-to-install firmware update helps reduce the drift, but it's not perfect. If you're switching from real drawing, a Wacom screen, or an iPad, you will immediately feel the slight drift in accuracy.<br/><br/>Many reviewers don't mention this, because they draw in a way that doesn't tilt and rotate the pen very much. If you watch their reviews, a lot of Youtubers don't really alter their wrist position. I didn't find a discussion on this until I stumbled upon Nikage's website, which features only written reviews. Nikage tests XP-Pen, Huion and others, and has reported that both Huion and XP-Pen have tilt calibration issues, as both companies are still pretty new to tilt. Apparently, Huion is the more accurate of the two brands, and Huion's newest Kamvas 13 has the issue as well. The tilt calibration issue is rather small. Once you get used to focusing on your cursor more than your pen, the tablet is an absolute joy.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love here. The laminated screen, the bright and accurate panel, the adjustable stand, and the pen sensitivity are all very nice. The drivers continue to be improved and work flawlessly with all of my 2D and 3D software packages. Compared to others (including Huion's 2020 Kamvas 13), the aluminum and etched glass build quality is exceptional, and some artists may prefer this for durability.<br/><br/>I was an early adopter when this was released, and suffered wobble and lots of tilt calibration issues. Huion keeps updating firmware, and things keep getting better. The wobble was completely eliminated, and what was once fairly dramatic tilt offset is now greatly reduced, to the point where some more gestural artists won't really notice it. Fine line work and detail painting may begin to frustrate some artists, but most people just zoom in at those times.<br/><br/>Unlike the ipad, which uses capacitive touch to determine location, any tablet monitor with a digitizer below a screen will suffer slight calibration issues.</span>
