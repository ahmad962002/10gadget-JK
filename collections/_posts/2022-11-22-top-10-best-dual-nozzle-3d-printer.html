<span>This is my 3rd printer now. Specifically got it to print TPU where my other 2 struggle with this material.<br/><br/>The enclosure is nice. Doesn’t help keeping it quiet but it does help keeping the cats from batting at the prints.<br/><br/>Ran the test print - 2 color cube - over night. Woke up to both extenders being jammed. 4 hours later, tried again. To clear the heads requires removing 3 screws and and 4 or 5 parts. Not a huge deal except I’ve had to do this 6 times now in 1 week.<br/><br/>The build plate is tiny; smaller than the Ender 3. It might be almost as tall as the other 2 but smaller x and y.<br/><br/>If you can’t run a long print (15-20 hours) without it failing, it’s garbage IMO. Planning on returning it or selling it.<br/><br/>When it works, it produces a great print. If you have to do maintenance on it every other print, that’s a serious design flaw.</span>

<span>I was very excited when the new creator max went for sale, hoping it might be the ideal prosumer intermediate printer we have been waiting for that would build on the best features of contemporary printers like Dreamer , Creator Pro &amp; Adventurer. Unfortunately the printer was a huge disappointment in this regard, the print quality is about the same as Creator Pro. It seems like a slightly refreshed version of the former, so it won't be worth upgrading for minor bells and whistles. The printer is quite noisy, and it was astounding a 2020 Pro model doesn't even have a detachable print bed, or auto leveling, and subpar setup/assembly experience. It's really doesn't justify the premium price.</span>

CEL Robox 3D Printer Robox is a 3D printer that combines the best next-generation features at a fraction of the cost. Designed totally from scratch with performance in mind, it's an exciting and much-anticipated model. But it's not just hype - CEL has delivered a truly stunning product at an equally attractive price point. Precision Creating objects that are accurate to the software model requires extremely precise motion and the highest resolution possible. All Robox motors and axes are attached to a single stainless steel frame which is a reference surface for all motion; this is rigidly attached to injection molded parts which form the body of the printer to create a super-stable platform. Additionally, the Robox boasts a surreal 20 micron maximum layer resolution, allowing for the smallest details to be created flawlessly. The nozzle valve system created by CEL cuts off filament completely, eliminating ooze and contributing to a much smoother surface finish - meaning less time spent on finishing work. Forward-Focused CEL uses powerful custom-designed stepper motors in the Robox, meaning that your printer won't become obsolete just because there's an updated head available - the motors are equipped to handle it. SPECIFICATIONS: Print Technology; Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF); Build Volume: 210x150x100mm/8.3x5.9x3.9in; Best Layer Resolution; 20 microns; Filament Diameter; 1.75mm+/-0.05mm; Nozzle Diameters; 0.3mm (0.012") and 0.8mm (0.031"); Material Compatibility; PLA, ABS, HIPS, Nylon, PC, PVA; Internal Lighting; Full RGB; Print Bed: Tapeless Heated Polyetherimide; Power Requirements; 100-240VAC, 50-60Hz; connectivity USB 2.0.

<span>After having this printer for 1 week now, I am sorry to say that it is no longer functional.  I purchased this printer because it had the highest resolution "20um" utilizing a 0.3mm and a 0.8mm dual nozzle head assembly.  The dual head is a little misleading because at first impression you would think that you can use to materials at the same time.  But that is not the situation with this printer.  You can only use one material at a time.  The dual nozzle allows you to have the larger nozzle printer fill volume and it uses the 0.3 nozzle for printing the perimeters with finer detail and control.  At first I would give this printer a 5 star for their ingenuity, however, reliability and support forces me down to a two star.<br/><br/>Problems that I have found with this printer are listed below:<br/>1.  When printing objects that go to the high limit of the Z axis, causes problems with the homing sequence on the next print.  I.E.  The printer drives the head into the body of the machine and you can hear the motors grinding.<br/>2.  Door interlock - After printing, the bed does not always go far enough forward to release the door lock.  You can not do a home because your part is still inside of the printer and the head will have a potential to crash into the part and then bind the entire system up.  I believe that there is no position feedback on any of the axis, so it tends to loose position and because of that the door can not open.<br/>3.  Advertise that you can use Nylon and Polycarbonate as well as HDPE, however they provide no spools for this.  One of the other reasons I bought this printer is because I want to run nylon material.  Since they don't sell the nylon spools, I did not want to take a chance on putting a standard spool into the printer.<br/>4.  Material wiper sucks - At the start of every print, the system will eject material out of the fine nozzle "0.3mm" and the out of the course nozzle "0.8mm".  If the material does not stick to the very edge of the bed, then it will fall into the Y axis motion track!  I don't know why they did not put a small plate at this end of the printer to catch the material.<br/>5.  Advertise a true "dual head" - They advertise a true dual head in which you can print with two materials, however they currently do not have any such head available.  They don't offer the dual spool holder either.  Apparently it is a "future" enhancement.<br/>6.  Support is difficult - At $1500 cost of a printer, I would expect support to be a quick turn-a-round.  I have read other people complain about having issues with the print head and that they had to "pay" for the shipping to return the print head over to England in order to get a replacement head.  Really!!!!! This is an expensive printer and the owner has to pay for shipping on defective parts, to an overseas company!  Thank goodness for Amazon returns!!!!!<br/>7.  Ability to change mater mid build is not user friendly and problematic at best.<br/>8.  Small Z build height.<br/>9.  They claim that the reason for using "their" smart reels is to have better control over the material quality to prevent jams,  well that is a load of crap!  After the first 20 hours on the supplied white PLA, the material would not feed.  The extruder feed would just grind and grind.  I changed out the white PLA to the supplied green ABS and I could printer for another 20 or 30 hours and then, it would not feed as much volume through the printer and the material got thinner and thinner on the printer surface.  Eventually I could not print at all.  I could not use the remaining PLA and I could not use the ABS.  The spools was still more than 3/4 full.  When I tried to put the white PLA back in after the green ABS stopped printing, the extruder feeder would just grind at the material and refused to feed it.<br/>10.  The extruder feed can not keep up with the print speed.  I tried to run the printer at higher speeds, 40mm/s and the extruder just could not keep up with that speed.  I had to reduce it to 30mm/s to prevent missing material.  I would say you can't really run this unit faster than 30mm/s when using the 0.8mm nozzle.  Maybe if you have small layer height it would be possible.  &lt; 100um.  But at layer heights of 100um, it just could not keep up with anything above 30mm/s.<br/><br/>Positive Items:<br/>1.  The machine has potential, they designed it so that you can remove the print head and snap in another head that would support true dual nozzle, two material and dual material reel system.  On top of that, they designed in in such a way that you could turn it into a CNC and put a cutting head on it with either a knife or router head.  Although, I am not sure it could take much torque.  But, that is future and this in now!!!!<br/>2.  Print quality is excellent when it works.  Since it can use the 0.3mm nozzle for perimeters and 0.8mm for inside volume and build functions, it allows the printer to have nice high quality prints at a faster speed.  However, material warping can quickly erase that nice high quality.  FYI use nylon when it is available!!!!<br/>3.  Has ability to do 20um layer heights.  I don't really see the need for this, after seeing the results from a normal 100um printer using the fine nozzle for perimeters.</span>

<span>I like to tinker a bit, but I see myself as a noob when it comes to 3D printers. This is my first 3d printer so I can't really personally compare this to other printers, but I can say that it is getting close to being plug and play. It was a choice between Ultimaker 2, Lulzbot Taz 4, Makergear M2, and Cel Robox. Out of the four, Cel Robox is the newest and did not yet have any reviews on Amazon when I purchased it. It was a bit daunting at first. I decided not to get Ultimaker 2 and Lulzbot Taz 4 because they cost way more and asked myself the following question: Do I really need to print something bigger than 4" or require a big build volume (Cel Robox's build volume is 8.3 x 5.9 x 3.9")? No. For my needs, I just needed to print components that I can attach to my actobotics components and couldn't justify spending more for build volume. Ultimately, Cel Robox won over Makergear M2 because of future-proofed technology (removable/replacble/upgradable print heads) and child safety, but Makergear definitely has amazing features/reviews and has a bigger community right now.<br/><br/>My criteria and how they panned out with Cel Robox after receiving it 5 days ago:<br/><br/>* Ease of use:<br/>Plug and play - print right away after installing Robox Automaker software (the white card is a usb drive accessible by flipping it to pop out and install software), but do the following first before printing (you knew the "but" was coming) :<br/><br/>a) This is optional but Robox community suggests that you always run a Purge (there seems to be test filament in the print head upon unboxing so do the Purge before anything else) OR print the "Robox/3D Models/pyramid.stl" on Draft (you can always pause then cancel once the first few layers of the pyramid is confirmed sticking to the bed if not it takes 9 mins to print pyramid). I did find that preheating the bed, warming the ambient temperature inside the printer, and preheating extruder gives you successful first layers after especially with ABS filament.<br/><br/>b) Let the bed cool down a bit so when you clean up the purged material or remove the printed pyramid, the alcohol from the IPA wipes doesn't evaporate right away and it'll be easier to remove the filament material when the bed is cooled down. It doesn't contradict the first step of preheating since the bed is still warm after and ambient temperature inside the printer is relatively warmer as well.<br/><br/>c) Clean the bed with Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) wipes.<br/><br/>d) Add your model for printing.  Before you press the Print button though, set the "Brim" parameter to either 2 or 3.  It will add an extra thin first layer around the perimeter of your model.  This will ensure that the first layer sticks and stays down instead of lifting up or bending up that sometimes happen on ABS prints.  If you can't see the print button that looks like a play button, make sure the filament has been fed properly by pushing it in a bit, make sure you hear a motor whir after, and feel the filament getting pulled in.<br/><br/>e) Now print whatever you like.  Remember to let the bed cool down a bit before removing your print.  Remove the Brim layer.  Then clean up the bed again once you are done.<br/><br/>Note 1: If you find that the filament is not sticking on the first Purge, AutoMaker software has a "Calibrate Nozzle Height" on the "Status" tab &gt; Click 3 dots on panel divider to open advanced settings &gt; "Maintenance" sub tab.  This will make sure that the extruder nozzle isn't too high from the bed when printing the first layer. IMPORTANT!!! Before you run it, you will have to remove the PEI plate (the brownish plate with the Robox logo) on the bed. Slide the front black tab with a metal clip to the left, push up the plate a bit from the front finger slot, and slide it carefully out.  Follow instructions to determine if the nozzle height is set just right.<br/><br/>Note 2: You'll find that printing in "Draft" instead of "Normal" or "Fine" may be enough resolution for your needs. With Draft, it will exclusively use the larger extruder. Normal and Fine uses both extruders.  Go with "Draft" first if you're printing the design model for the very first time. It will save you lots of time. It won't be as pretty but it will get the job done.<br/><br/>I found that the Automaker PDF User Guide is outdated and this confused me a bit. Skip the documentation about the auto registration part since it is no longer in AutoMaker software. Also remember that you can click on the 3 dots on the panel divider to show Advance Settings. There you will find a panel to send GCode commands to the printer as well. If you can't open the printer door for any reason (make sure print is not paused and has cancelled/finished printing), just send the command "G37" to open the case door. I current do not know how to reopen "*.robox" project files that has my model scaling and rotation saved settings since the documentation doesn't match the latest version of AutoMaker. It's not big issue for me but Cel I request that you update your documentation for every AutoMaker version release.<br/><br/>Finally, Robox is plug and play because you don't have to assemble the printer. You also don't need to level the bed and don't need to configure your filament/material settings every time before printing. But unlike inkjet/laser printers, there are some things you still need to do to ensure a successful print. A successful print right now can still have blobs and stringy parts. As far as I've researched, all consumer/commercial 3D printers have issues and they are not at the stage where 3D printers are truly plug and play like paper printers.  You will still occasionally get bad and inconsistent prints.  Even with the amazing technology Cel implemented on Robox, I still would not say 3D printing is now mainstream. But of all the 3D Printers, Cel Robox I think has addressed more issues than the competition (auto-leveling gantry, heated plates, microclimate ambient temperature, material detection and number of supported types, filament retract resolution, pause-resume, print-speed, extensibility, safety, etc). I wish I could say how it compares print quality wise since this is my first 3D Printer.<br/><br/>* Community<br/>On my first ever print, the first layer filament didn't stick to the bed. Don't panic if this happens to you. This is why doing the above steps is very important and they avoid this from occasionally happening. I figured out how to resolve my issue by reading the manual and going to the community forums. I'm impressed that I didn't have to open a support ticket to solve it. I lurked into the forums by the way and haven't introduced myself to the community yet. The community is smaller compared to other forums because the printer is relatively new and you won't find a lot of youtube videos yet.<br/><br/>* Technology<br/>Instead of throwing specs around like 20 microns resolution (which I probably won't even configure/use since it will take forever to complete a print), I'll just say that I like the idea of upgrading the print heads. I can actually buy (backordered) a different print head RBX01-DM Kit Dual Material Head + 2nd Extruder. Even with that added to the cost, it is still cheaper than MakerBot Replicator 2X, MakerGear M2, Ultimaker 2 and LulzBot Taz 4.  The Robox already has dual extruders but it is for the same material only. It has dual extruders with different sizes to speed up print time (uses bigger extruder to fill in material and smaller extruder for finer details outside).  RBX01-DM has dual extruders for different color materials or different material types (probably same size extruder though). Robox is like the Dremel of 3D printers. It has the potential to attach 3d scanners, print circuit boards, and probably even do traditional subtractive manufacturing like cutting and routing.<br/><br/>Note 1: You can print with different colors using the regular print head by pausing print, eject material, feed in new color material, and then resume print.<br/><br/>Note 2: You're not stuck with buying Cel Robox branded filaments with EEPROM chips. You can buy and use filaments from other manufacturers/providers.  It just won't have the pause/resume capability. There's a thingiverse Robox Reel Spooler: www.thingiverse.com/thing:576324 that allows you to rewind other brand filaments back into the Robox EEPROM SmartReel and even setup a custom material profile (temp, speed, etc. settings) for it so I guess you can still get pause/resume capability with other brands.  Think "Cartridge World".  I have not confirmed whether this works or not.<br/><br/>* Safety<br/>I have kids and while I encourage them to learn 3D printing with me, the bed and nozzle can get extremely hot.  It will automatically lock the case door while printing. I like that I can lock the case door before turning it off as well.<br/><br/>UPDATE 1/19/2015:<br/>It's been a month and things are actually better.  With the recent software update AutoMaker 1.01.01 (now uses Cura slicer same developed by Ultimaker), I was able to print this seemingly impossible ring of ball bearings:<br/><br/>http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:51806<br/><br/>Something I thought was not possible to print on the Robox. I was also able to complete my 3D Printer Smoke Alarm project just recently.<br/><br/>http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:633143<br/><br/>Experience so far:<br/>Overall, I'm satisfied and I do understand why other reviews haven't been great. I do acknowledge reviewers are very technical and knowledgeable about the subject. The experience they share is very valuable. A lot of things I printed also didn't work out and got stumped for awhile too. For example: Some models cannot be printed as is. I wish it is what-you-see-is-what-you-print, but humbly learned it's not.<br/><br/>On the hardware side I've had the same problems some have mentioned here so I don't think it's a lottery of good Robox printers. When nothing sticks on the bed I recalibrate. When nothing is coming out of the nozzle, I preheat nozzle, eject the material, re-cut filament, and try again. When it doesn't print right, I rethink and iterate. The community has been great and has helped me a lot.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is for this price point it's really good (I have no affiliation with CEL Robox). I encourage you to keep at it and it'll work out. To me, having a Robox is like having an Automatic(P) mode on your digital camera.  It's not only because it can set material, auto-leveling, and profile settings automatically but it has amazing tools to resolve issues with features like Eject Material, XY Offset, Nozzle Opening, and Nozzle Height calibrations. It's really good. This is recognition that is well deserved.<br/><br/>But just like with photography, the camera is not good alone. You need good lenses, a sturdy tripod, studio lighting, composition, and a good workflow. The workflow I learned is to always do planning and preprocessing: solidify models 1st with Rhino3D/MeshMixer, split the models if needed, plan orientation, and alternatively use MeshMixer to generate the support layer.  So far, I've only used the default print settings on the Robox and have not played yet with all the different manual settings. Honestly, the Print quality is not yet on par with the $2500 and over printers.  I think with future software improvements (Robox software has only been in development for a year) and learning how to use manual settings will help improve the quality even further.</span>

<span>I had this printer for 13 months now, all I have is frustration. I had printed ~10 packs of robox PLA filament until now...<br/>I almost cannot remember how many times it broke and how many parts I have changed...I tried to record all the print major failure and broken part here.<br/><br/>1. When I just got my printer within first several days, the nozzle broke and leaking a very large amount. I call amazon customer service and have a replacement.<br/><br/>2. After I got my replacement, within 1 or 2 weeks, another error showing up and it's start flashing red light. The CEL customer service told me that it's rare to have this issue it should be coming from thunder storm which I highly doubt. They offer me a repair which they will pay for the shipment for sending back the printer, but they told me it will cost them 30 days or more to fix the issue.. I called Amazon customer service again and they said they could give me another replacement if I want.<br/><br/>I just don't know what did I think that I accepted the replacement. I guess I really had a faith on CEL thinking of this could only be some rare issue, and the replacement won't have the issue again.. This time, I order an pro-care with the new printer which guarantee to have the issue fixed and and replacement printer will be send if the issue cannot be fixed immediately.<br/><br/>3. 3 months after last replacement, I was quit happy with the replacement for 3 months, there is no issue coming out. Until the a week before Christmas last year, the extruder broke. I contact the CEL customer service and they provide me  some instruction and send me a replacement extruder. It takes me 8 hours to replaced the extruder and it's still not working. The customer service let me use my pro-care and send me an replacement.<br/><br/>4. However, the replacement still not working. The thermal sensor fails this time. The customer service apologized and send me another replacement 2 days later. The printer works okay this time, and they give me an backup nozzle this time.<br/><br/>5. I was stop using the printer for ~5 months earlier this year (2018), and then I started to use the printer about 2 weeks ago, the printer is working okay for two weeks and then unfortunately it broke again, the nozzle is broken with stuck material, and I follow the instruction of removing the struck material, it's still not working. It needs to returned to the customer service for repair, but this time my pro-care expired, and I need to pay for the shipping and the repairing fee which cost a lot maybe more than a new nozzle.<br/><br/>I think the product is not very reliable, and very easily broke. Within 9 months of using this, I almost has all the different component broke at least once. Extruder, power supply, nozzle, thermal sensor...<br/><br/>I have to say this printer has a lot of features I really like, and the customer service is always very kind very nice, but the reliability has a lot of room to improve. It requires to have a tremendous of patient and love to this printer to have one. I hope my next printer would requires no customer service and I can focus more on my design instead of fixing the 3d printer..</span>

<span>I paid over $1300 when I first bought this machine. I had it for less then a week and the head started leaking. Cel Robox wanted me to send it to AZ so it could be repaired. I asked them to send me a new head and they refused. I returned the printer to Amazon for a replacement. That head also leaked after the warranty expired. They did send me a new head as it was within one week. Now, that head has leaked as well-number 4 on heads, number 2 on machines in just over 2 years. I do not print commercially, just for my own needs. They knew they had a poorly designed head that is why they came out with a second version. In short, this machine costs way too much money for the problems I have had with it. BUY SOMETHING ELSE, DO NOT  BUY THIS ONE or you will live to regret it just like I have.<br/><br/>EDIT<br/>I bought a QIDI X Pro to replace the Cel_Roox. It works flawlessly. I am able to print even with the material that Cel customer service told me was too wet and causing the print head failures. Crazy it works just fine in this printer. I went round and round with them in their forum and they have now removed the entire thread. They have multiple problems with their hardware and they refuse to acknowledge or take responsibility. I was told recently by their tech support that the print head will only last 100 hours. I never got close to that with their hardware but with the new printer I am close to 150 hours now without one single issue. As has been mentioned several times, the customer support at QIDI is amazing. Avoid the Cel-Robox like the plague.</span>

The dual extruder are nice and the flashprint software is actually pretty good. It printed great right out of the box (after installing the heads and loading filament) wish it would have been able to print nylon tho. The heat maxes out at 230c.

<span>I've been wanting an IDEX (Independent Dual EXtruder) 3D printer for some time.  Having dabbled with dual extruder printers where both extruders were mounted to a single print head, I know all of the problems that one might encounter.  The Creator Max 2 seemed to tick all the right boxes, and it hits a sweet price point at just under USD $1000 for the features it claims.  They include a bunch of extras, such as extra 0.4 mm nozzles and a couple 0.6 mm nozzles, as well as a thick sheaf of replacement build tapes.<br/><br/>So, what's wrong with the printer?  There are some design issues that are concerning, such as having only a single lead screw on the Z axis that should probably be thicker/more robust.  (I've seen printers ship with lead screws this skinny, where the lead screw gets bent during shipment.  You won't get reliable, consistent layers like that!)  No camera and no filament run-out sensor, so prints will not pause if your spool runs out, and no way to check on your print without either setting up your own webcam or manually checking the printer periodically.  Those didn't seem like huge sacrifices considering what IDEX printing brings to the table.  The removable build-plate kit seemed like a good idea, but the execution is really poor.  More on that in a bit.<br/><br/>The set-up went very well, and the manual was pretty clear for the most part.  A few forgivable grammar issues, but at least the pictures were clear and well labeled.  There was very little guesswork involved on my part.<br/><br/>I was able to print several test objects, including a 2-color moai (using the included spools of white and blue PLA).  All successful printing at this point was done directly on the main build-plate, which already had build tape applied.  The tape provides a good adhesion surface, and seems to last for several prints.  X and Y axis calibration didn't take too long.  The assisted bed leveling worked perfectly -- as long as I didn't have the magnetic removable build plate kit installed.<br/><br/>Satisfied, I started printing replacement spool holders, since FlashForge included spool holders that only really work with their filament spools.  I even remixed a spool holder design to work with the Creator Max 2 and published it on Thingiverse.<br/><br/>Up to this point, I had run into a few issues with the FlashPrint software and the printer's USB implementation.  Sporadic USB disconnects while uploading gcode from FlashPrint, or when attempting to use the control panel in FlashPrint to fine tune some things.  Some "Card error" messages with the SD card that shipped with the printer, though these seemed to result from failed uploads (due to USB disconnect).  You can copy files directly to the SD card from your computer, and this worked flawlessly.  FlashPrint's control panel lets you do coarse adjustments, but if you want to manually enter specific values in specific fields, good luck; the software would revert the value as soon as I hit enter.  Besides which, the printer is likely to disconnect while you're in the middle of doing anything via the control panel.<br/><br/>It's when I tried to install the magnetic removable build-plate kit that the real problems began.  The kit consists of a magnetic pad with adhesive on one side; you peel off the backing and stick the magnetic pad onto the aluminum build-plate in the printer.  The removable steel sheet sits on this magnetic pad, but there are no registration marks or interlocks of any kind to hold the sheet in place, so you have to be careful and a bit clever.  They also include 4 binder clips with the kit, ostensibly to help stabilize the build plate for "larger" models.  Once this kit is installed, you will discover that the whole build plate assembly is now too thick to do bed leveling.  (If you buy this printer, be sure to do all the bed leveling before installing this kit.)  Edit: I have read that some users work around this issue by cutting the springs under the build plate to shorten them.  I would not recommend doing this!<br/><br/>The problem is that the printer's Z-axis calibration utterly fails here.  This is separate from the bed leveling, and lets you set a Z offset for each extruder, and is absolutely critical for first-layer adhesion.  No matter what values I set for the Z-axis calibration, the printer would seem to ignore them and put the nozzles way too close to the removable build plate, digging into the textured build tape that had been preinstalled on the removable plate.  (Yes, they pre-installed build tape on both the printer's built-in plate as well as the removable plate.  It's also, incidentally, very difficult to remove this tape.)<br/><br/>At first, I thought that the magnetic pad was to blame, since it undoubtedly expands a bit when the build surface is heated.  You can't do Z-axis calibration unless the plate and nozzles are cold, so that's an issue.  There's a manual work around, but it involves FlashPrint's control panel, which has issues as described above.  But after some experimentation, I discovered that no matter how large a Z offset I set during calibration, the printer would ignore my setting and use some default.<br/><br/>There are fixes for this, but all of them are ugly for various reasons.  You can put a Z offset in the slicer (yes, FlashPrint supports this in expert mode), but then your sliced model will only work for when you have the removable build plate kit installed.  You can improvise a Z-axis shim using a popsicle stick or a coin and glue or tape it in place, or you can 3D print a Z-axis shim.  The shim's purpose is to depress the end stop sooner than it otherwise would have been triggered.  (The end stops are mechanical switches, incidentally, not optical.)  This is kind of a dirty hack in my opinion.<br/><br/>You can use the included binder clips to sort of squish down the removable build plate and magnetic pad.  This helps a bit with the nozzles digging into the build surface, but you still get elephant's foot, and the binder clips are likely to get in the way while you're doing calibration, printing, or both.  You have to be super aware of where the tool paths will take the print heads and ensure that whatever you're doing, the binder clips will not get in the way.  A tool head impact will cause the unit to seize, and can quickly cause damage if you don't cancel the operation you're performing.  The belts are a little bit loose (even with inline tensioners!), so you can hear the stepper motor pulleys slipping on the toothed belts when this happens.  Obviously this requires close supervision, especially during a print, and in my opinion the binder clips are too dangerous to use in this application in any case.  They are an invitation to damage your unit, so why include them?<br/><br/>Well, the thing is, the magnetic removable build plate kit was clearly an afterthought.  It's also a $40 item, so it's clearly intended to be disposable.  I'm sure the magnet will lose its strength after repeated heating/cooling cycles on the print bed, so unless you feel like taking your chances with the binder clips, you'll have to throw this thing out and buy a new one periodically.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what turned me off this product was FlashForge USA technical support.  It is likely that they have nobody at FlashForge USA who has any real knowledge or understanding of their products, and they repeatedly said they were forwarding my e-mail inquiries to the "R&amp;D team."  Since when does a company's R&amp;D team handle support issues for a product?  Only if the product was poorly engineered to begin with, and the customer is a guinea pig for testing a half-baked product.<br/><br/>The support team was always a day late and a dollar short.  I started communicating with them last week (October 27th, a Wednesday), got very little feedback from them and hardly any recommendations of things to try or diagnostics to perform.  I received no feedback on Monday, and only received an inquiry from them today while I was repacking the printer for return shipment to Amazon.  They wanted to know about my FlashPrint version.  I had installed the latest version available from their website, 5.1.1, and I was only notified of an update today (5.2) when I fired up the software to answer their question.  Since they had asked repeated questions about my firmware version, and the firmware can only be updated via FlashPrint currently, my guess is that they had a newer firmware version for the printer which somehow wasn't being made available to me.  They could have simply sent me a ZIP file with updated firmware to try -- you need only unpack the firmware file into the sys folder on the SD card, something I could have easily done, but they never did any of that.<br/><br/>My impression is that they just didn't seem to care much about the customer, paying attention to details supplied by the customer (i.e., firmware version), or providing any kind of support for a printer that isn't a cash cow like their more expensive offerings.  Even if I had been a little more patient with their support team, I could never in good conscience recommend this printer to a novice or even a seasoned hobbyist.  They couldn't definitively tell me whether they thought my printer was actually defective, or whether I just needed to do some things on my end to fix the problem.  This is a total fail.<br/><br/>This thing is defective by design.  The flaky USB connection makes using a computer in conjunction with this printer a dicey move at best, and something like Octoprint is out of the question.  I haven't seen a USB implementation on a 3D printer this flakey since my first gen Dagoma Neva.  The half-baked removable build plate is a joke and a liability, seemingly included just to tick a box and lure in customers like me who could really use the convenience.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this printer, but today I returned it to Amazon.  Caveat Emptor.</span>

<span>Disclaimer: I received this product free of charge to review it. That said, I have owned 12 3D Printers and I can say that this is a really solidly built machine that just works. The independent dual extruders (IDEX) is an awesome feature. I've printed TPU and PLA at the same time and have also printed two-color prints that came out perfectly with no cross-coloring. It heats up quickly, both the bed and the extruders, and it's fairly quiet too. So far, every print I have tried (including three sets that used both extruders simultaneously) has come out beautifully with no failures - something I can't always say about a brand new printer.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>• Dual Independent Extruders - very cool, very capable<br/>• Super solid - metal frame and excellent gantry<br/>• Flexible magnetic metal bed makes removing the print way easy<br/>• Responsive full color touch screen that actually works as expected<br/>• Filament holders built in to the back of the machine<br/>• Enclosed, Direct drive system, so you can print ABS, TPU, NinjaFlex, PLA, PETG and more<br/>• Full sized SD cards are used, which is way more convenient, in my opinion, than micro SDs. 16GB card included.<br/>• Two KG of PLA included<br/>• Assembly took less than an hour<br/>• LED lights inside make it easy to see the progress<br/>• Super easy to use bed leveling - just one knob to mess with and you're done<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>• Most Flashforge printers include a built-in camera, this one does not<br/>• No WiFi or CloudPrint functionality<br/>• Bed is not particularly large. Not tiny, but I prefer larger print volumes<br/>• No auto bed leveling<br/>• Uses the .gx file extension instead of .gcode, which makes it tougher to use with Cura, but it comes with FlashPrint, which works great<br/><br/>All in all, I'm really impressed with this printer. Flashforge's printers aren't cheap but they're all high quality. I've owned four of their printers so far and they're all really well built and they have great support as well.</span>

<span>Serious love affair for this printer, unfortunately I got a bad one.<br/><br/>Extruders not in same plane and no amount of shimming resolved the issue.  Wrong parts in the bed leveling assembly, leveling would not hold. USB connection dropped frequently.  Old docs came with the unit.<br/><br/>As a one extruder unit it worked well, but I bought it for the dual.<br/><br/>Took one star off for getting a bad machine  added it back for the exceptional service by Mr. Tang.<br/><br/>Once this one is credited, I'll be ordering another.  Hopefully this time I won't get one made on a Friday or Monday :).<br/><br/>Amazon and Mr. Tang made this experience FAR better than it could have been.<br/><br/>Edit:  In case you are wondering why I gave the unit 5 stars after all the problems and frustrations.  The unit itself is decent as reflected by all the positive reviews.  Amazon made it good when they really didn't have to and the support from Mr. Tang was what customer service should be and rarely is.<br/><br/>Being an engineer, I know that these kinds of things do happen from time to time, what makes all the difference is how it was handled all around, for that I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Will be ordering another now :-) and am more than reasonably sure I won't have these problems a second time.<br/><br/>Edit 2:  I was right the second is stellar and I have been printing all sorts of needed goodies with EXCELLENT results.<br/><br/>A couple of VERY minor problems.  Bed tramming didn't hold well but Tang sent me a set of replacement springs and hardware and that seems to be holding quite nicely.<br/><br/>Suggestions:  Get a dial indicator and mount for it off Thingverse (Flashforge one for Creater pro works just fine), and magnets to fit.  Mou night have to drill it out slightly to get the dial indicator shaft to fit, but that is trivial.  Makes tramming the bed much, MUCH easier to record to value after you have trammed it with the blue card.<br/><br/>There are a number of useful mods for the Dreamer on Thingverse.<br/><br/>I'm looking at printing some replacement spool mounts that might allow Hatchbox sized spools internally, report to follow.  If this doesn't work, there is an item on Thingverse to raise the cover and keep dust and such out which will also help with keeping the interior warm and free of breezes which helps.<br/><br/>If you have to leave the top open to feed full sized spools, a cleaner / lubricator has been recommended.  It was also said that a couple drops of mineral oil in the cleaner sponge helps too.  Plenty of spool holders on Thingverse.<br/><br/>Linux software leaves a bit to be desired but they are working on this.  I did purchase Simplify3D and am happy with that but still learning it.  Recommended :-).<br/><br/>I've been using the Hatchbox filament I found here on Amazon with excellent results.<br/><br/>Throughout it all Tang continues to be amazing, just wish all my customer service experiences were half as good.  Amazing man, fast response and totally knowledgeable about the unit.<br/><br/>Get one, you'll love it.  Not quite a Startrek replicator but I am more than pleased especially after all the horror stories I have read about a lot of the other printers out there.<br/><br/>About all I would like to see in a similar unit would be a greater build volume and auto bed tramming (AKA: leveling).<br/><br/>Yep, very pleased with the unit and especially so with Tang.</span>

<span>Currently, I am giving this printer a one star because of the fact that FlashForge does not honor the hardware warrenty and lifetime technical support on this printer because it was purchased through Amazon.  They say that Amazon is not an authorized distributor of their product.  With that being said, I currently do not have any immediate issues with this printer.  In fact, from a functional point of view it is working fine.<br/><br/>The print quality is good as well.  One problem that I am having is ensuring that the material sticks to the print bed.  Especially the PLA.  I have leveled the printer several times and sometimes it sticks and sometimes it does not.  I tried using the painters tape that comes with the printer and that does not seem to help.  I set the bed temperature and that seems to help.  Once the print sticks, the prints come out great.  It is just getting the first print to stick to the table that becomes an issue.<br/><br/>Now, lets review the "Out of the Box" experience.  The printer came to me well packaged.  Everything was there with nothing missing.  I found that the setup was fairly easy and took a total of 30-40 minutes from the time I un-boxed it until I was printing with my first part.  So, overall it was not so bad.<br/><br/>The wireless setup was a bit of a challenge because their document states connecting your computer to the printer via wireless to a SSID name that did not match the documentation.  That took me a bit because there are alot of wireless devices in my neighborhood.  Once I got that done, I was able to connect to the printer via wireless.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price and if you purchase this through an authorized distributor I would give this printer a fair 3.5 to 4 stars.  I can't give it a 5 star because there are areas for improvement with this printers software/firmware.<br/><br/>FlashForge, If you are watching these reviews, see below suggestions:<br/>Slicer improvements:<br/>-  Allow us to set a different speed and nozzle/bed temperatures for the first few layers<br/>-  Allow speed overrides based on closed path length.. I.E. if a closed path is shorter than the moment forces can handle allow a percentage fact to reduce the speed for that path.<br/>-  Allow us to have a feature to turn off the last top layers when we are working with files that are solid geometries and we set the infill to 0% so that we can get a cutout outline.  There are many nice items on thingiverse that have complex exterior shapes, but are solid objects, such as many of the vases.  Normally we could turn off the infill and get our desired effect, but without having the ability to turn off the top layer fill, it closes the object off.<br/>-  Allow us to select a fixed number of bottom layers which would be solid fill.<br/>- Fix your printing estimation time, it is way off<br/>- Have your touch screen show the current layer number that it is working on, this is helpful to work with the online model and stopping the print as know areas<br/>- This one is more of an optional feature, but the above others should be necessities.  Gives use the ability to change print heats in the middle of a print so long as the material is the same type, on the fly changing<br/>-  Give us the ability for on the fly velocity overrides when we notice our print is going to fast, than way we don't waste material and have to start over in the slicing program<br/><br/>Everyone else, these are my only observations at this time since I have only had the printer for a couple of days.  I am more worried about the print head and nozzle reliability since I am not eligible for the warranty because I purchased this printer through Amazon.  This is a "double-edge-sword" situation because Amazon has a great "no hassle" return policy.  But if you decide that you love what you bought, then you are screwed because you are not covered under the 90 day warranty.  Also you don't get life-time tech support.  Bad on FlashForge for that policy.  My opinion is that if we have a purchase receipt, then it should be something that we can "register" with FlashForge and then they honor the warranty.</span>

<span>I spent weeks narrowing down the positives and negatives between a number of popular 3D Printers. The final draft was between the Dremel Idea Builder, Flashforge Creator Pro and the Flashforge Dreamer. I wanted something that would be fairly easy to set up,  and fire away some quality builds. The Dremel sounded like the perfect candidate. I was trying to convince myself that working only with PLA plastic would be fine, as the Dremel does not support ABS, or has a heating bed. The trade off would be ease of use, and "living room friendly". After tons of research, I decided I wanted the option of having both. In addition, the Dremel is actually the FlashForge Dreamer minus the above mentioned, and clearly aimed at the consumer market. I guess it was a good sign that Dremel chose the Dreamer to slap their name on. I was a mouse click away from going for the Creator Pro, as the reviews were overwhelmingly great, but I wanted something just more contained. See, I am in a hi rise, so this would have to also look somewhat decent near my desk in the living room. The Creator Pro was a bit more beastly, with filament streams flowing in from the top. I realized the one of the things I would be giving up if I skip the Creator Pro would be the wide choice of filaments from various manufacturers. The Filament spools on the Creator Pro are fed from the back, outside of the unit,  so there's no size restriction. With the Dreamer, the filament rolls are self contained, inside the unit, and it's not exactly roomy in there. After further reading, I understood that there were a number of ways around the Dreamer's filament limitation. A few examples: Leaving the lid partially off and feeding any sized pool from the outside, or, there are few types of 3D Printer-created spool adapters on Thingiverse.com. Yep, you actually can build a new spool adapter on your dreamer to widen the choice of filament sizes/types. Update: 02/18 - Printed Out a Spool and now using Filament from Filamex (affordable).<br/><br/>The Dreamer took about a week as it came directly from China, and was in stock at the time. It's been four days since I've had it, and I've been practically non-stop printing. After reading horror stories about the initial trial and error with your first attempts (a 3D printer given), I was happy to have a perfect build on my second attempt. The documentation can be a bit fuzzy in spots (figuratively speaking), but a visit to youtube made things easier.  Also, having to wait a week for delivery gave me that extra time to study up on all the possible issues I may run into.  The unit comes a white ABS and a dark blue PLA filament reel, plus a tool box with some spare parts and a few tools which is nice bonus. Also included is a 4GB SD card and USB cable.  You can hook up your Dreamer to your computer via USB or WiFi, then send your work to the printer. I've been putting my saves on the SD card and just feeding them directly to the printer. Also, if you need to make copies of one of your builds, you choose the SD card on the Dreamer's handy display panel, find the name of your item, and hit print!<br/><br/>Setup was pretty painless - took about 15 minutes. Leveling the plate is what was initially a lengthy process, but each time you do it, it gets easier. Now in two minutes, I'm able to level it, as opposed to the initial 20 minutes of paranoia. I started the first few builds with ABS. During my research, my two concerns were how much noise this would produce,  and how bad the smell of heated plastic would be.  As for ABS, it's not even close to what I expected. I was thinking it would be the equivalent of dumping an entire Mouse Trap game into a fireplace.  There is definitely a fume in the air, however it seems to be somewhat become undetectable after spending hours in the same room. We have one of those essential oil diffusers nearby, which definitely helps. Keep in mind, someone who may be more sensitive to the fumes may feel differently.  PLA is even less detectable, so no problem there. As for noise, I'm happy to report that it's a total non-issue. The fans are louder than the extruder riding along the rail, so no battles with the neighbors, even during graveyard runs.<br/><br/>The quality of the prints are better than I expected.  I've seen some 3D Printer samples on various sites that had me concerned. Perhaps being zoomed in with a camera flash shows too many imperfections,  but trust me when I say, the quality of these prints are quite satisfying, especially tor the price.  Both PLA and ABS are wonderful, and have their pros and cons.  We made two iPhone charge stands with both plastics, and they were equally impressive. The ABS had a matte finish, while the PLA seemed to have slight transparency and a bit of a sheen.  The quality of the print will all depend on a number of factors including how fast you want results. We printed small articulated elephants that took only one hour and came out amazing. This was on a medium quality setting with 15% infill. while a super artsy nested gyro wheel thingy took 9 hours. The end result was worth it!<br/><br/> The one issue that you will learn to fear in the world of 3D Printing is stabilization of your work in progress.  Without the right preparation, your masterpiece will be knocked off course, and churn out an angel hair pasta monster from hell instead.  The heated bed is initially covered with Kapton tape,  which at the beginning, held down the fort for a few ABS prints. I did not have the same luck with my first PLA attempt, as it dislodged from the bed, minutes into the print. I immediately hit the cancel button. There is a reason why Flashforge provides you with a generous roll of blue painter's tape. PLA likes painters tape. Just cover the Kapton and you're ready for some PLA prints, well sort of.  I found using a glue stick (you'll see this recommended everywhere) to be one of your best friends s in the line of bed adhesion. Spread it across the blue tape, and man do those PLA builds become well behaved and come out perfect! I also started using it directly on the Kapton tape when it's time to go back to ABS, because the Kapton will wear and tear within days. Speaking of Kapton, if you don't want to keep having to buy more Kapton when the initial covering becomes really scary, you can do with many other 3D Printer owners have done, purchase a sheet of glass to clip to the bed. Getting glue stick gunk off of glass is a heck of a lot easier than Kapton.<br/><br/>The included software (Flashprint) is super easy to use,, but after day three, I took the plunge and purchased Simplify3D. This gives you a ton more control over your work, and has many important features. It's pricey, but it's worth it. Apparently, Flashforge's support for this system is top notch. I haven't needed any help yet (aside from asking on the whereabouts of my shipment while in transit), but I feel confident based on what I read. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my decision.  As I hype this, the extruder is dancing around to a soft, mechanical melody, producing yet another eye popping plastic wonder.</span>

<span>I've had the printer for about a week and have run several different prints. It is very easy to use and it's not hard at all to get good quality output... IF you follow ALL of the instructions! Most of my prints have succeeded. A couple failed, but a quick Internet search turned up plenty of advice that made it easy to correct the issues. For instance, the "unload filament" option doesn't really work if the machine has cooled off--it has to be unloaded right after a job. But a quick web search turned up a good workaround--just do a "load" followed by an "unload" and you're good to go.<br/><br/>The build plate is very sturdy and so is the rest of the machine. It's fully enclosed and none of the outside parts get hot, so it's child-safe. It is quite noisy--think of the noisiest inkjet printer you've ever heard, then add a loud fan to that--but not any louder than, say, a warm Xbox 360.<br/><br/>The front panel is very easy to use and so is the included software. A 3D printer needs good software to tell it what to do, and from comparing my results to others on the web, it seems like this software package does a pretty good job. And once you've uploaded a model, you can print it again directly from the front panel! The internal memory is big enough to hold LOTS of models--I'm up to fifteen, I think, with no end in sight.<br/><br/>As with any 3D printer, calling it a "printer" is a stretch. This isn't an office machine, it's a machine tool like a lathe or a drill press. It needs to be calibrated and maintained like anything else in your workshop, or it won't produce good work. Leveling the bed--which is as much about setting the gap between bed and extruder as it is about making the bed level--is crucial. The thickness of a sheet of paper can mean the difference between a good print, and one that breaks free of the plate and gets dragged around by the extruder halfway through the build. </span>

<span> helps a lot, but can make the print stick *too* well and become very difficult to get off. (Razor blades help; the little spatulas you see for sale on Amazon don't work as well as I'd hoped.)<br/><br/>Why not five stars? Here are the problems:<br/>- Dual-extruder printing, which is a key feature of this machine, doesn't work all that well. The problem is that the idle extruder leaks slightly, leaving little dribbles of plastic on the model. There's an option to build a "wall" around the model that's supposed to help scrape off the excess, but it really doesn't work all that well. It seems like this is more a software problem than a hardware problem--the software needs to be smart enough to cool down the idle extruder, then heat it back up as needed.<br/>- The wi-fi is a little unreliable and VERY SLOW--10-20x slower than USB! If you have a strong signal and don't mind waiting, it's very nice to be able to put the printer somewhere other than right next to your computer. But if the wifi fails at the end of a long upload... so frustrating. An option to restart the upload would be welcome. (Tip: use the upload time to preheat the printer. It would be nice if Flashforge could just build that into the software as an option!)<br/><br/>None of these are dealbreakers, though. Overall I've been very satisfied. It's been a lot easier to get into 3D printing than I thought!</span>

<span>I have a Voxel Labs Aquila but wanted IDEX for dissolvable supports. This printer looked like a good deal. Getting the printer assembled is fairly easy. Calibrating the printer so you can use it is another story. Once you have it calibrated the printer is still a spaghetti factory.<br/><br/>As I said, assembly is fairly easy. I was easier than the Aquila despite being a much more complicated device.  The gantry comes assembled and attaches easily to the base. There are 'drip pans' that come with the device, but the screws weren't included. The documentation claims the thumbscrews can be replaced with another fastener without notice. My experience is the screws were replaced with nothing. There is also a place on the right side where it looks like something should be plugged in, but nothing to plug it in. This is likely for a z limit switch which is only installed on the left.<br/><br/>Once assembled the problems begin.<br/>The drip pans are placed such that they will only serve to clog the nozzles, as the nozzles sit over the wire brush rather than the pan. JG Makers official YouTube even shows the device with different drip pans. Members of the community have updated drip pans on Thingiverse, but the manufacturer should provide working pans.<br/>The bed itself is large, but it wobbles. The manufacturer's YouTube channel has videos on how to correct this. The first iteration of the video would completely nullify the ease of assembly, as it requires you to disassemble much of the base. The second video is simpler, but in the end you have one or two screws that don't fit back into the frame. The YouTube video ignores these screws.<br/>The z-limit switch and the thing that pushes the z-limit switch seem to get out of sync. The bed leveling assist built into the firmware doesn't actually respect changes to where the z-limit switch is triggered. Leveling this bed requires the z-limit switch place the extruder precisely in the center of the build tray, so the process requires you to back into a different menu to move the device up in z to hit the switch again. This was very frustrating, and not apparent, during my first attempts to level the bed.<br/>Calibrating the second extruder was more challenging than I expected as well. While some drift in x makes sense, the extruders not being aligned on y and z in the factory is puzzling. Adjusting the second extruder on Z isn't hard, but the manufacturer doesn't tell you how to do it properly. Instead I followed a community YouTube video which explained the process better. This is a second step that negates the advantage of easy assembly.<br/>The SD Card that came with the printer was incomplete.  It contained no sample .gcode to test the printer. I had to slice a model myself.  My version of Cura is newer than what they had a profile for, so I had to guess at some settings. Eventually I tried Ideamaker, and found a profile for the printer in Ideamaker.<br/>The build plate that comes with the printer does a good job sticking to prints the first few times. In fact, it does too good a job.  I have remnants of earlier prints that I'm not sure how to remove short of detergents.<br/><br/>I'm very frustrated with this printer. I have yet to get a properly registered two color model  to print. I'm looking at the box, and I think this printer is destined to find its way back to where it came from.</span>

<span>after tuning and very very long bed levering i was able to print great things on this machine!<br/>wort the money my answer is: YES<br/>CONS FOR THE PRICE:<br/> no bed auto leveling<br/>the fans are super noise<br/>you can't upgrade the extruter  the hot end work just fine i not recommend use abs or wood filament<br/>others printers for this price offer features like Wi-Fi and web cam to monitoring your print<br/>some parts yoou need to print like: filament sensor location, the brush filament can to work as should be, better bed springs, YOU MUST HAVE TO UPGRATE THE FANS TO NOCTURA FANS BECAUSE THIS PRINTER SOUD LIKE A.C UNIT</span>

<span>Bought this as a replacement for the stock Creality Ender 5 Pro hotend. The installation went very easily, and also allowed me to tweak and adjust some other parts of the hardware. Print quality with this hotend is improved over the stock hotend, but be aware that because the hotend is all-metal, you will have to raise your temperatures a few degrees to get the filament flowing properly.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good upgrade for the Ender 5 Pro.</span>

<span>Here I will attempt to give my Experiences an Impressions of the MicroSwiss Hot End!.<br/>First I was a bit surprised its called Micro Swiss but its made here in the U.S.?????<br/>But We Live In The times We Live In Right!.<br/><br/>First off I must say it is a Very Good Unit for as a young fella i had toolshop training and i have to say<br/>in quality the Unit i received was first rate .<br/>Now I received  My Order quickly so as usual both Amazon and the Seller has their act together and i can only say 'Good Going' guys on the shipping, You did well!...<br/><br/>TO INSTALL:<br/>I wont go into 'Great Detail' here as their are YouTube videos that explain the detail better then i can.<br/>Put simply if you have simple tools most Americans have, And you are capable say of fixing a Kitchen Faucet then you should be able to assemble and mount a MicroSwiss Hot End to a Ender Printer ,.<br/><br/>'Now This Is A Balancing Act as Its Important to understand the Pluses and Minuses!'...<br/><br/>See My problem was My Bodwin tube melted and started causing my hot end to leak!!!!!.<br/>Granted I couldn't see re-placing this with a factory unit, So i bought a MicroSwiss and a new<br/>High Temp tube!.....<br/>So if you are buying this to replace a Bad or Worn or a Defective Hot End then this is a deal for you!...<br/><br/>But if you ARE buying this just to increase temps so you can process NYLON or Hi Temp materials<br/>then 'This Part' alone cannot help you!.<br/>In fact it was a 'Bad Disappointment' to find despite adds to the contrary!...<br/>Yes and truly Micro Swiss is a top grade part and is an improvement over the factory Hot End!.<br/>And i definitely like the way my parts are coming out now, But in truth it only adds about 5 degrees to my operating temperatures!.<br/>This Part Does NOT Automatically of itself INSURE that 'Your Machine' will run NYLON!.<br/><br/>In Truth Its Kinda A Half and Half Thing!.<br/><br/>Most Folks are buying this or something 'like it' for 'Ender Printers' to increase Melt temperatures!.<br/>But due to Computer Settings and P.I.D. Enders are 'Locked Down' to 260C O.K.<br/><br/>Plus the Heat Block on the Micro Swiss is plain Aluminum and not the Stainless Steel I was hoping for.<br/>As that alone "drastically" limits Operating Temperature.<br/>Please remember THIS is not a fault, It is simply the way that part is designed to run/operate!.<br/><br/>Very Fortunately I Dont have to run Nylon in my normal work!.<br/><br/>Yes if i changed the 'Junk Aluminum' block with a Copper Block which Amazon carries that could possibly kick me up towards 270C which would make it more realistic to run some of the newer Nylons that Amazon is currently listing and those are Quality Goods!.<br/>Now with a 'Stock Hot End' I ran 'Taulmans 230' which is a low temp NYLON and it turns out some fine parts that has to be said, But i must also point out its not Rock Hard but its good for use where toughness is needed but some flexibility is allowed,.<br/><br/>To Close let me state that the MiscroSwiss is good and a fine choice to replace worn and bad parts as it certainly does a fine job in the normal temp range the Machines. were originally designed for!.<br/><br/>But clearly DONT buy an ENDER if you intend to run NYLON as that machine simply isnt set up for it!.<br/>Yes some people try altering PID or tampering with the computer code and have wound up damaging their machines.<br/>Buy a Prusa or a different make which is more Modern and Up to Spec!.<br/><br/>But for my uses MicroSwiss makes a fine part, it installed easy, Runs fine and does its Job!.<br/><br/>Recommended!<br/>IndianaED</span>

<span>Buying this product was a huge mistake. I was looking forward to having lots of fun printing and learning 3d modeling but it was a huge disappointment. My first print failed because it didn't adhere to the bed properly. I then tried again, this time printing the 3D benchy from thingiverse this was an absolute disaster. The pla filament became completely stuck to the build plate. I tried everything to get it off, I tried bending it, I even tried using a scraper, it wouldn't budge. Not wanting to give up so quickly I ordered a new bed plate and tried again. I got the same results. The pla filament became completely stuck to the bed plate rendering it useless, since it is impossible to remove the filament residue. To make matters worse the manufacturer claims that it is auto leveling, well there is no such feature you still have to level it yourself. Apart from that there is also the camera that they say you can use to view your model while it is printing which is absolutely horrible. It produces a grainy image and I could not make out anything. For a printer that costs $849 I at least expected it to work as advertised. I'm boxing it up and returning it. Buyer beware!</span>

<span>I had two Adventurer 4s. One delivered from Amazon, and one delivered from Walmart. Surprisingly, the one delivered from Amazon had a practically perfectly level bed without any warpings or issues. There is no auto leveling, but an average of the 9 points you dial in. For the AD4 that had the good bed. About 90% of my prints printed with practically no issues and I have over 350 hours of printing on this machine so far. The other AD4 I got from Walmart had a major issue where the bottom left corner was really low, and the top right corner was really high. So no matter how I leveled it I would have adhesion issues or poor first layers on large prints. There is no way to resolve this short of trying to take it apart or dealing with their terrible customer service. I returned it after about a week because I do not expect to have to jump through so many hoops on a printer that costs so much. My recommendation is if you don't get one then isn't close to perfect, return it. I recommend only buying it if it is a prime item for the sake of return. This printer is way too much money to be playing games or trying to make something as important as a level bed work. I'm not advocating that everyone abuses the return system, but I hope the shipping process and manufacturing process will be looked into with how many of these I hear are being received with bad bed leveling or other broken parts.</span>

<span>After reading about the assembly, set up, and troubleshooting to establish a baseline for printing on more cost effective 3D printers, I decided to give the Adventurer 4 a try as a "turn it on and print" solution. Needless to say, it has been a great experience for a first time creator!<br/><br/>All I had to do besides unboxing (ensuring to remove the tape and hidden pieces of packing foam was to go through the semi-automatic leveling process, load the filament, and start printing.<br/><br/>My primary uses are to make parts for photography and astronomy equipment, as well as things for around the home. I have not delved into any artistic modeling.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1. Fully enclosed and easy plug and play printer that doesn't require much tinkering to get started.<br/>2. Enclosed compartment for filament spools.<br/>3. Included slicer software is good for basic components.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. Wireless connection only works with proprietary slicer software. Sending prints via the "popular" slicers out there did not work.<br/>2. Although advertised as "auto leveling," it's more of a semi-auto process of the printer self adjusting as you dial in the Z-Space for 9 points across the print platform. It's still pretty quick and easy after watching a couple videos located on the internet.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this printer for someone starting out or that has never 3D printed before- assuming you have the budget for the price tag.</span>

<span>I was getting into 3d printing and I started off with and Ender 3 V2. Long story short, that printer was nothing but problems and to get it working properly I’d have to spend the same amount in mods that I paid for the printer itself.<br/><br/>I figured it would be better to too but a better quality printer period.<br/><br/>I initially looked into Prusa, and for my needs/wants, I still think it would have been the better printer. As it was out of my prices range (no pmt options), I looked to FlashForge FF.<br/><br/>While an Adventurer 3 would have been the affordable upgrade, I wasn’t a fan of the ability to only store a 1/2 kg spool of filament (I wasn’t aware of thingiverse at the time), so I went with the Adventurer4 for the extra storage and bigger print volume.<br/><br/>Right out of the box, all I needed to do was calibrate the bed leveling and it was ready to play.<br/><br/>The bed leveling feature is semi automatic. It’s definitely better than hand leveling the bed like with the Ender3 but it still involves allot of manual intervention. Not a big deal but it is inconvenient.<br/><br/>Operation of the printer has essentially been set and forget for the most part. Very rarely have I had issues with failed prints but one thing that did get me is I did run out of filament mid print and the printer did NOT stop. After checking the setting, that feature was disabled.<br/><br/>Pulling the filament after the run it does require some disassembly. Sometimes it’s as simple as selecting “change filament”. The nozzle heats up too it’s max temp and you can simply pull it out.<br/><br/>The last instance I had, it wasn’t that simple. As there was no filament inside the nozzle, heating it up didn’t let me pull it out. I had to heat it up and push the filament TOWARDS the nozzle. After which point, I could then pull the filament out and reassemble.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this printer was worth every Penny in that I don’t have to worry about failed prints or any other mishaps. Plus it in and 9/10 times it complete successfully.<br/><br/>For me, I’m not a huge fan of proprietary technology. The nozzle on this printer is FF specific and to my knowledge, it can’t be swapped out for another that isn’t specific to FF. On top of that, there’s not much, if any, options for tinkering/mods. As someone just getting into DIY, I want a machine that I can truly make my own.<br/><br/> But as a reliable starter printer, I have no problem recommending the A4. It does everything you’d want a 3d printer to do and is reliable. I’d say this is more for the 3d printer novice who’s simply wants a machine that works.</span>
