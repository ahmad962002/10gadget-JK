<li><span class="a-list-item"> JBL Signature Sound: Nothing beats incredibly clear music and calls from 11mm dynamic drivers powered by JBL Signature Sound..Note : If the size of the earbud tips does not match the size of your ear canals or the headset is not worn properly in your ears, you may not obtain the correct sound qualities or call performance. Change the earbud tips to ones that fit more snugly in your ears  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 40 (10 plus30) hours of playback with wireless charging: Never miss a moment with 40 hours of Qi-compatible battery life (including 10 hours in the earbuds plus 30 hours in the case). Need a boost. Just 15 minutes of Speed Charge gives you another four hours of playtime—fast.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 6 mics for perfect calls with zero noise: Six beamforming microphones reduce wind and noise interference so your words always come through loud and clear. And with VoiceAware, you can choose how much of your own voice to hear by controlling the amount of mic input routed back into your earbuds.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Oval TubesTM for better comfort, isolation and bass: Better shape, better sound. That's why JBL designed these headphones with Oval TubesTM and oval silicon tips for a perfectly snug fit. The stick closed design with oval tubes ensure better noise cancellation and enhanced audio quality for those who prefer a cleaner aesthetic.  </span></li>

</ul>

<span>I wanted to give these a score of 4.5, but that wasn't an option. I liked everything except the controls. I bought it at $100, but it is a good value even for $150<br/>I will compare this to Edifier TWS1 Pro and CA Melomania 1+ which I used with Google pixel 4a 5G<br/>Setup:<br/>Live 2 pro is the best. It supports Google fast pair unlike the other 2. Melomania supports 5.0 Bluetooth with a right earbud as main so you can initiate a connection with either both side or right, but not left alone. You can switch easily from right only connection to left only, but not left to right. Edifier TWS1 Pro had bt 5.2 with aptx adaptive so it was easy to switch and connect.<br/>App support: melomania as a decent app, but no as good as JBL's. Edifier TWS1 Pro had no app support.<br/>Connection quality: the JBL has a reliable connection with a few cuts that last 2 seconds( I did most of my testing on music mode). It didn't have aptx so I used AAC. AAC had a smoother sound with wider soundstage. SBC had harsher sound that felt compressed. Edifier TWS1 Pro had no cuts at at all thanks to aptx adaptive. Melomania had ACC and standard Aptx and BT 5.0 unlike BT 5.2 on the other two. It had many connections issues and cuts. It tends to restart when a connection is lost while playing music and you end up hearing a startup voice prompt and the volume resets to %50. Very irritating.<br/>Battery life: that all features about 10hr + 30hr battery life in theory, but only JBL can come close to these numbers. The TWS1 Pro doesn't always attach properly to the case to charge and remain connected draining battery when that happens. Melomania is even worse because on top of this it an earbuds can connect to your phone sometimes even while charging so it had the worst battery life. I didn't like the high performance mode of Melomania because it sounded worse and drained more battery. I used the regular mode.<br/>Wireless charging: only JBL has it but I don't have a charging pad to try it<br/>ANC and Transparency modes: only JBL has it and the are both good but not the best in class.<br/>Case: TWS1 Pro has the thickest case. JBL's case is slightly smaller. Melomania had the smallest case. TWS1 Pro had only one LED light to indicate battery level of the case. Melomania had 5 LEDs for the case. Jbl had 3 leds for the case and 2 leds for ear earbud (7 leds in the case). That is so cool.<br/>Earbuds: TWS1 pro has bulky earbuds, but the touch area was not flat and it made touch controls easy to miss despite the responsive touch response. JBL has responsive touch controls, but the small surface area of the touch controls makes using touch controls a nightmare. Melomania had small earbuds that had responsive physical buttons.<br/>Comfort: all 3 were comfortable for me.<br/>Volume: Edifier TWS1 Pro had the lowest volume followed by Melomania. All of them were loud. JBL wasn't far behind Melomania.<br/>Sound quality: melomania had some weird magic. It sounded the best. It had great tuning and probably the best driver response time. It was warmer in a nice and natural way and it was the most detailed especially in bass. A V-shape tuning. However, it has the narrowist soundstage. JBL had a sound profile that is a bass boosted version of the Harman Target. It has a great bass. It was the smoothest sounding and it has the widest soundstage. TTWS1 lacked subbass and it had the harshest treble, but the least detailed. None of the 3 had an excellent mid but JBL had the mids of the 3 while Tws1 pro had the worst mids and weaks vocal details. In conclusion, the details of the driver carried the melomania, but JBL was the most balanced, smoothest and had the widest soundstage.<br/>Equalizer: TWS1 pro had no app. Melomania had a decent 5 band EQ but the frequencies were not properly labeled. JBL had the best EQ of all earbuds. It is a full featured EQ that labels the frequencies. I was able to make a custom EQ to make the sound even smoother even though JBL was already the most balanced of the 3.<br/>Autopause: only JBL has it.<br/>Sidetone: only JBL has that.<br/>Multipoint connection: only JBL has it. I could connect 2 devices at the same time (Android and windows), but I couldn't for some reason get both devices to seemlessly switch audio without completely disabling the other. That's weird and could be a bug.<br/>Earbuds controls: these is the area that made me want to deduct 0.5 star from my score for JBL. It has controls for everything, but you have to choose from 3 button presets that you can't manually edit for each earbud (playback, volume, ANC and Transparency). This is ridiculous. I can't have volume and playback on the same earbud in mono mode. Also I had to give up ANC preset completely because I set volume for left and playback on right. Tws1 had the best button preset for mono and stereo (despite not having ANC). Melomania had the same controls till they decided to remove volume control from mono mode in a firmware 😑<br/>Latency: tws1 pro had the lowest latency thanks to Aptx adaptive. Melomania had an average latency. JBL had the worst latency on music mode (default preset). On video mode it has a low latency that is comparable to Aptx adaptive in Tws1 pro. Normal mode didn't lower latency that much from music mode, but it made sound quality noticably worse than music mode.<br/>I had to return Melomania 1+ because of all the connection issues and it stopped working. I am still keeping the Edifier as a backup earbuds despite the not so great sound and charging issues. I love the JBl live pro 2 and it and I will update my review if anything change in it</span>

<span>If you are looking for headphones to use while working out in a noisy environment, or even just while on a treadmill, these are a great choice. Use them with the JBL headphones app and make sure you get the right fit, but I do not even hear the treadmill when I am using these - and it is noisy!</span>

<span>JBL understands nice sounding bass better than other companies.  I did have to EQ to unbury the vocal fundamental 150 - 500hz (boosted this +2db). The EQ controls in the app allow to EQ pretty specifically.  Now, this EQ change is dependent on your ear canal &amp; ear cup size — for me the vocal fundamental was buried.  I have to use the large cups.  JBL &amp; other companies should make curves for different cup sizes, as their “vocal” preset EQ boosted the nasal and harsh frequencies of vocals.  They should contract a professional music mixer for these EQ curve presets.  They should do the same for movie EQ curves.  Aside from out of the box EQ, JBL products are capable of producing warm bass, and smooth mids and highs — I didn’t really touch the mid &amp; high frequencies besides the soft slope falling from the vocal fundamental boost.  Now that the ANC is good and doesn’t cut out giant chunks of frequencies from the music is very awesome — thanks for figuring that out.  Recommended.</span>

<span>I love these ear buds. The noise cancellation is excellent, and sound quality is everything I was hoping for. Battery life is exceptional, I can listen 8 hours at the office without having to charge them. I can use them all day without my ears getting sore. Very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I initially purchased these at the beginning of June as a second pair of headphones for around the house.  Everything I have uses Bluetooth, so it's nice to have a headset that I don't have to reconnect manually to different sources, and has a really long lasting battery.<br/><br/>For perspective, I daily drive a pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 noise cancelling headphones for work and when I'm out and about.  They cost me about $300 a year or two ago.  They sound great enough, and the noise cancelling is at the top of the class with Bose and a rare few others.  But that asking price is much too high for most people, and for a secondary use like mine, there was no way I was going to spend that kind of money a second time for convenience's sake.<br/><br/>I did a bit of research and landed on the Soundcore Q30's.  I eyed the Q35's for a bit, but determined that even their ~$120 price tag was a bit much for my purposes, so I waited until the Q30's went on sale for $60 and snatched them up.<br/><br/>I opened them up, and they felt very sturdy, although more on that later**.<br/><br/>As other's might report, they are extremely bass heavy un-EQ'd.  But the app functions very well, and you can rebalance the EQ to your listening taste.  The best part of this is that it stores the EQ preset on-headphone, so when you disconnect your phone and connect to another device, your custom EQ settings carry over.  The fact that my $300 Sony headphones don't do this is mind-boggling, but it is a much appreciated feature.  And if you're a bass head type, no EQ'ing will likely be necessary.<br/><br/>The noise cancelling is excellent for this price bracket.  If you're going into this expecting the same caliber of noise cancelling as the Sony's, Bose's, or other $300+ headphones, you will be disappointed.  But they get ~70% of the way there for ~1/5th the price.  That's an substantial value proposition that cannot be ignored.  They're also quite comfortable on my ears, and I have no issue with long listening sessions.  I'm not sure if you can or cannot replace the earpads, but I can update this review when I cross that road.<br/><br/>The headphones also allow you to connect to two independent Bluetooth sources, and switches between them automatically when sound is coming from one source and not the other.  First device connected seems to take priority, like it's the "primary" Bluetooth source.  Also, controls are almost all physical buttons and not "touch" based, which is a big positive for me.<br/><br/>The battery life is top of class.  40 hours is not an exaggeration, slightly less with noise cancelling turned on.  Not surprising since the headphones come from Soundcore, an Anker brand, known for their batteries and chargers.  But nonetheless, this makes them an EXCELLENT at home wireless headphone.  They charge with USB-C, which is nice for compatibility with different chargers you might have lying around.  They also charge quite quickly to full, which is great if you forget they're dead and need to give them a quick jolt.<br/><br/>**After about 1.5 months of ownership, two small plastic trim pieces on the headphones cracked and fell apart.  The structural integrity and function of the headphones remained intact, but they were cosmetically a bit roughed up on their own.  This is where the second half of owning a Soundcore product comes in.  The customer service is TOP NOTCH.  I messaged them my problem with a picture, they followed up asking me for a serial number, and then apologized and sent me another pair the next day, and didn't ask to return the first pair.  They, without hesitation, just gave me another one to make sure I wasn't dissatisfied with my experience.<br/><br/>Let me be frank, adult language incoming.  When it comes the righting product wrongs, no one in this industry gives a f***.  They'll not respond to your emails/customer support messages or give you the run around followed by some limp-d*** reason for denying your warranty.  For what it's worth, Soundcore IMMEDIATELY owned up to the issue and sent me a replacement unit ONE DAY LATER.  This is the kind of thing that inspired me to follow through with writing a review.<br/><br/>TL;DR<br/>Pros:<br/>- Comfortable<br/>- Customizable EQ w/ local profile<br/>- Good enough noise cancelling<br/>- Dual Bluetooth sources<br/>- 40 hour battery life<br/>- Tactile/physical button controls<br/>- Inexpensive<br/>- Immediate warranty followup from Soundcore<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Bass-heavy ("muddy") sound un-EQ'd<br/>- Unsure if earpads can be replaced</span>

<span>I’ve never had ‘real’ noise canceling headphones before. I have a pair of MPOW’s (about 6 years old) that I use for my workouts because I don’t mind if they get sweaty and beat up, but these new headphones are much better at shutting out external sensory stimulation. When I need it to be quiet, they are Perfect. This summer I lived surrounded by apartments of dog owners that would bark all day. On my days off when I was at home, I didn’t even notice until I’d take my headphones off. It was a great help in protecting me from sensory overload. And the sound quality was crisp and clear. The battery life was good, and the headphones were comfortable and easy to adjust to. I hope they last me a long time. I like that you can change the settings to ‘turn off’ the noise cancelation so that you can hold a conversation, but that the cancelation setting still seems to work so completely. I love technology. It’s so amazing what people can do with it.</span>

<span>bought 2nd pair!!<br/><br/>Sound - Youtube and many other music/music videos played on iphone CANNOT be altered due to Apple's non-existent EQ, or if you only use Apple Music you can slightly change to the preset EQ settings but its not changeable, only what the preset is.<br/>Regardless for me personally, I dont use Apple Music, I use Youtube for videos/music videos(&amp; other videos) appx 97% of the time - AND Youtubes horrible compression makes for terrible sound alot of the time, AND, people upload differring quality sounds for videos, and theres a constant adjustment I am making for Documentary style/Voice, Music, Music Videos, Comferences, etc etc throughout my day.<br/><br/>Plus I have a lot of music and videos from a personal collection not in the normal genres or readily available, these I import into the VLC App, USB Apps, and others that can store and play my music and various videos, teachings, conferences, etc etc - Again, so many variable quality sounds, and some sounds are good that people do, but I prefer the bass, I also prefer to take out alot of the highs present or extra present with alot of talks and general videos of music etc (especially they seem to be more "highs"[tinny sounds that hurts your ears] in compressed things on youtube and web etc] - So again, I need to constantly adjust, which I can with the SoundCore App that comes with these specific headphones.<br/><br/>Honestly, I already owned the Bose QC35II ($400) prior to this, and although i still have them, I use these wayyy cheaper Anker SoundCore, simply because the sound is similar as standard, but because its not possible to have an EQ with BOSEQC35, 35II, or the new 45II unless you are playing something through VLC's App, you have ZERO adjustability with Bose, none, at all.  I am at a loss that they can sell a headphone above $100, let alone $350, and do so without an EQ in their app(And Ived asked many times through their help/support - infact theres a dedicated "reason" in the dropdown for their help section in the Bose App that specifically refers to "Eqalizer", so it is beyind me theyve trashed their customer base for 6 years+ whilst recognising millions desire it and need it and have spent $200/300/400+ on their headphones and they dont even care!)  I would never recommend Bose, never again, until they pay someone in their app department a days wages to create an EQ for their existing App!  Sure Bose are definitely more comfortable, for sure, but i am now used to the Anker and stretched them on purpose to make them less tight - and I can do 8-18hours a day with them now easily!<br/><br/>Phone calls are way better on the Anker Soundcore QC30 than Bose QC35/35II, because those two models have hiddeous Mic set-up and so people can hear your background louder than you, and their really bad to be on the other end of unless your friend who has them is in a soundproof room!<br/><br/>Bluetooth is amazing - it immediately connects to your devices, without any tweaking, and, again, sorry to compare to Bose QC35II, but thats my $400 ones, and the Bose are terrible, every update brings problems for 4/5 updates released, and its not remedied until the next update, and with pairing instantly, think never great for the Bose (my sister/brother in law and my good friend all have Bose QC35 and 35II, so its not just me!)<br/><br/>I dont know what elese to say, I came back here because if i was going to buy Bose, and I saw this, Id be so glad to have saved $200-300, and got a wayyyy better set of headphones, and I just cant say enough about how good it is to change the EQ for any and every song or music file or video you play on your device as the SOUNDCORE App is for the whole phone, any app, any file that has sound on it!<br/><br/>If they could somewhat steal the comfort design of the Bose and use these theyd be perfect!  I am so glad you dont have to be rich to afford something good, and thats why i love Anker, seriously, 95% dont have $200-$700 for a pair of headphones!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Hope this helps</span>

<span>July 2022<br/>Review after about 2 months of using these Anker Life Q30 wireless headphones, almost daily.<br/><br/>Overall I have to say these headphones are very good. I am quite happy with them. Just some small cons.<br/>They have become a game-changer for my movie watching experience. Way better than conventional speakers, even a good quality surround sound system.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Audio quality is great. Good highs. Powerful lows. Great for movies with heavy audio engineering. The surround sound comes through very well. Great for music. Maybe a bit too bassy out of the box. I did not bother to download the app and use the equalizer to lower the bass. But I would rather have too much bass than too much tweet or high end.<br/><br/>Battery life is great. I only have to recharge them every week or 2. And use them almost daily for about 3 hours a day or so. They charge pretty fast too.<br/><br/>Bluetooth range is quite good. Clear across a few rooms, and around corners.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>The headband is a bit too loose. Even when they are at the most closed position, they tend to be slightly loose. I try to wear them while doing exercises, laying down, bending and moving my body, and they tend to slip off too easily. When I wear a hat or a hoody they feel much better and snug. I would not wear these headphones for jogging.<br/><br/>They are a bit warm on the ears after wearing them for a long time. This is probably because they have electronics inside the ear pieces and batteries. And are heavier than conventional over the ear headphones. It's not a huge deal, but I added some cloth "softies" over the ear muffs and they feel better that way.<br/><br/>The noise cancelling feature clogs up my ears. It makes them feel like I am on an airplane or have risen quickly in an elevator and you feel like you want to pop your ears.  I never knew about this issue. Then I watched some reviews on headphones and someone mentioned this issue. And sure enough it happens to me with these headphones. This might be a case by case issue for different people. Not sure how the science of it works. But unfortunately, I can not enjoy the benefits of the noise canceling feature on these headphones. But this is not a deal breaker at all for me. When I am watching a movie or listening to music, I can barely hear the outside world anyway. So no big deal.<br/><br/>Now that I know what it feels like to listen to good quality audio on decent quality wireless headphones, I am a convert. I did not know that bluetooth could transmit such good quality audio. I was skeptical. But the technology is now good enough that I can let go of my long wired headphones and have free movement while listening to music or watching movies. These headphones are keepers for sure. I just hope the battery lasts many years. Or that they are user replaceable should they ever die on me.<br/><br/>I did not know of this brand before buying them. I watched many online video reviews before buying them. I have been a loyal Sony brand headphone user for over 30 years. But the prices of their over the ear bluetooth headphones were too overpriced in my opinion. So I tried these. No regrets.</span>

<span>Hey fellow Amazonians!<br/><br/>I have bought so many different pairs of wireless buds and given them all away.  Either they weren't loud enough, sounded terrible / I sounded terrible on calls, or were downright uncomfortable.  The JBL Endurance Peak 2's are SO close!<br/><br/>Wear ability:<br/>These are great and feel light.  I don't have the feeling that they'll fall out.  The speaker portion isn't ungodly big and they're just mostly comfortable.<br/><br/>Battery Life:<br/>Not impressed. With their large frame, I would expect a much longer on-ear time.  Their claimed 6hrs is definitely with the volume on minimum.  I like to use ear buds to sleep with.  They may last 4hrs realistically at sleeping volumes.<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>These are not bass kings.  They are decent in the midrange but fail in the bright highs and lows.  Voice calls are super clear however.  Don't expect to get these loud either.  I sleep with these at 75% volume.  The mic does pickup amazing for calls.  They're better at picking my voice up than my built-in laptop ones on zoom calls.<br/><br/>Ergonomics (Touch Buttons):<br/>These are cool but, they don't pickup my fingers all that well so it looks like I'm batting my ears to get them to function.  They did pickup better when my fingers were sweaty.  The slide function only works on the right ear bud and I will say, that's the best function of the whole thing.  The swipe function picks up so well that the residual heat on my pillow turned my volume up/down.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I like these ear buds.  I'd recommend them at $79 or less just for the comfort and trust factor (as in they won't fall out.)</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I did a lot of research to find headphones that would deliver what I wanted. I'm fairly picky about sound and am very easily bothered if parts of the sound range are artificially boosted or otherwise out of balance. Which describes most of the common headphones that are out there these days with their amplified bass, muddy notes and uneven middles and/or upper notes.<br/><br/>Just as a point of comparison, I looked closely at Audio Technica because I had gotten the chance to try two of their models. The sound was a lot better than most, fairly clear and defined overall. Nice. Seemed slightly muddy though on the finer details. And somewhere in the middle range felt a little 'off' to me in ways I don't know how to describe. And parts of the sound profile sounded farther away than other parts. Subtle but it was there. So they were nice in many ways but not quite satisfying for me the longer I listened to them. Additionally, the m50s (the more popular of the two models I tried) had a noticeable amp on the bass which also wasn't quite my speed. Though that's pretty common knowledge about the m50s, so hardly a surprise.<br/><br/>I also seriously considered the Sennheiser HD 598 headphones. The reviews are tempting but I just can't have open-back headphones in my current living arrangements. I need at least some ability to shut out noise because of bad neighbors, etc. Even though the 280's are not noise reduction headphones, they do an amazing job of dampening outside noise without any fancy technology. Not only is my music nearly unhearable to anyone sitting in the same room with me, but noises in the room around me are partially blocked out even when I'm wearing my 280's without any sound playing in them. Something to do with how closely they fit I think, seems to automatically dampen some of the noise around me. So they fall somewhere inbetween actual "noise reduction" headphones and normal on-ear headphones which block out nothing at all. Seems to be a little more so than other over-ear headphones as well. Overall, that's been nice.<br/><br/>I was concerned at first about the 280's since many reviews noted they have a decent clamping fit on the head. I have had huge problems in the past with various on-ear headphones which clamp too hard against my ears and cause physical pain. I knew these were cupping around the ears instead of directly on-ear, but I was still more than a little concerned that this "clamping" might be too tight to be comfortable. Thankfully this has proved to fine. When I first put them on, there was a noticeable sense of "pressure" on the sides of my head, but not bad enough to be outright uncomfortable or anywhere close to painful. Thankfully within the first 12 hours of use, they seem to have relaxed a bit and now are plenty comfortable to wear for long hours without issue. Occasionally if I don't have them adjusted right, one of the ear pads can end up resting slightly onto of the edge of one ear, which can become uncomfortable hours later. But it's simple to adjust them on my head. Usually happens if I was in a hurry in putting them on and since they are comfortable enough I won't notice for awhile that it wasn't on quite perfectly.<br/><br/>As for sound, they've been pretty much exactly what I was looking for. The sound is natural, pretty much like real life. No artificial boosts or drops in parts of the range going from high to low. Sound is nicely crisp and defined, no muddy areas. Holds up when listening to a wide range of genres, from rap to classical, pop to country, acoustic to electronic. Watching movies works fine. The lack of bass boosting is more noticeable on genres that overly rely on the bass being boosted and didn't actually balance their music enough without it. So some rap, some dance, some action movies will have a little less 'umph' to them than you might expect or than they seem to have intended. I count that as a mistake on the original mixer's part though and still prefer to hear what is actually there rather than an overly beefed up version of it which a bass boosting amplified headphone would give me. Plenty of rap and dance music holds up though, so it's really down to whether or not the people who mixed it in the studio did their job correctly or if they had cut corners in the production thinking it wouldn't be noticed. I suspect if I had a portable amp to plug them into, I could get the best of both worlds for those songs and movies where production fell a little short. For me, it doesn't really bother enough to sweat it.<br/><br/>The sound on these headphones do feel like it comes from the room around me (even though it isn't actually) rather than the pads on my ears or inside of my head. Again, this headphones have a more natural feel to their sound than anything I've tried before. Some say "flat" but I say "real" in a way that feels more true to the sound it should be.<br/><br/>There is one minor and subtle thing I did notice with these: sometimes I have to fiddle the volume up or down just a slightest hair to get a song to sound at its best balance-wise. I suspect that this is where the fact that these are only a $99 pair and not something higher grade shows. Still, it really isn't bothersome, only just barely noticeable and more than acceptable for a $99 dollar set of headphones. So for a newbie audiophile, these do the job and keep me satisfied. I am sure I will eventually explore higher grade audiophile headphones at higher price points. But for now these are hands down the most satisfying I have found for around $100 with closed backs. Not for bassheads though. If you love a decent sound but still love a bit of bass amp, you should probably choose the Audio Technica m50 over these. If you like an even and more natural sound at this price point, these Sennheiser HD 280 Pro's are worth it and a solid choice. They are exactly what I was looking for and the only ones in this bracket which don't actively bother me. In fact, I can forget it's through headphones and just focus on what I'm doing instead. So just in case any of this helps anyone else who may be pouring over hundreds of reviews trying to imagine what these vs other headphones would be like, just like I was a few months ago. Best of luck on your quest!</span>

<span>I am a professional audio engineer in film and music.  I was looking for affordable headphones for personal listening while traveling, that could also be used for work in the studio and in the field.  I purchased the HD-280's after several months of research, and I am extremely happy with my purchase... so much so that I will be outfitting the studio with several more pairs.<br/><br/>Most of the headphones I own are for "professional" application, and thus require more power to drive the speakers. At 64 ohms, these cans are easily driven by my iPod and sound great without requiring a headphone amp.<br/><br/>There are a lot of reviews regarding the sound of these phones, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on audio "flavor."  The HD-280's are nice and flat --minimal audio coloring, which makes them perfect for a studio tracking situation.  There is plenty of bass, but they aren't bass heavy. After a lot of research, I don't think there is a pair of headphones out there that can stand up to the "true" audio quality of these phones at this price point.  They could be used for mixing in a pinch, though I will always use a higher quality (more expensive) set of headphones for mixing (I rarely mix with headphones, but for reference, when I do I use </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Beyerdynamic-DT-770-PRO-250-ohms/dp/B0006NL5SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 250 ohms</a>
<span>.<br/><br/>For tracking, the HD-280 can't be beat.  And at under one hundred dollars, there is no question that these are the most affordable, quality option for outfitting a studio.  However, even if I had unlimited money, I can't imagine purchasing anything but these in quantity.  The attenuation is fantastic (they are tight to the user's head and leak almost no audio), and I get little to no audio bleed even when tracking super-close vocals.  While they *can* take a lot of abuse, at this price, they are practically disposable (even though the ear pads, cord, and headband pad are easily replaced), so I don't have to get so testy with the jack*ss lead guitar player tossing them on the floor after a session. :-D<br/><br/>Because of this fantastic attenuation, we will also be using these to record audio in the field for film and video applications.  I first received these while on vacation, and I was actually using them NOT PLUGGED IN to simply create silence.  They are on par with the ANSI ear protection I use while working in the woodshop.<br/><br/>The coiled cord will keep the cord alive longer, but it is a little annoying because of its weight. If one is not careful, they will also tangle more easily than a straight cord. I will likely explore options for a straight cord, especially when using these while traveling.<br/><br/>The cord is made to be easily changed, and the included instruction manual has clear and specific instructions for how to do this.  However, it's not as easy as simply unscrewing or unplugging the cord (my Beyer-Dynamic DT-150's simply have a six pin connector); you need to take apart the housing of the left speaker and unplug the cord from the inside.  There is no soldering involved (the end of cord plugs into a spot on the inner board), and the entire process should only take a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether these phones are "comfortable" or not.  I chose to ignore the people complaining that they were uncomfortable, even painful, after about an hour of use and decided to take a gamble.  Due to the tight compression of the pads against the head, the complainers were right.  While I don't think my ears stick out abnormally far, I do find that the inside of the headphones (the speakers) press up against the top of my ears, so I do need to take a break every once in a while.  I would say this is simply the price of such a tight seal against the head (and worth the trade).  It's actually also a good "timing device" to remind the user to take a break every once in a while; when they start to get uncomfortable, it's probably time to give your eardrums a break anyway.<br/><br/>I may eventually have to purchase "personal travelers" that are a little more comfortable (lighter, less pressure on my ear tops) and portable (these are pretty heavy and fairly large), but for now these are making me happy --I just have to give my ears a chance to breathe a little more often. Perhaps the "in-ear" options can never be beat for this reason (weight and comfort).<br/><br/>The padding is leatherette (like all of my Beyer-Dynamics) and will likely need to be replaced after a couple of years, but due to the popularity of these headphones the replacement pads are readily available (have been for years, and likely will be for many years to come).  The padding for the headband is made of the same material, and also readily available.  There is a "Ziploc" type fastening system that runs the length of the entire headband (on top) for easy and secure fastening.<br/><br/>I love that the speakers are rotatable 90 degrees.  They lay flat on the table when you set them down, and you can solo one side or the other (though they don't flip 180 degrees as some reviewers have suggested so you have to pull them away from your head a good deal to do this).<br/><br/>While they don't get "tiny," its nice that these full-size headphones can collapse to about the size of a 750ml bottle of Crown Royal (though I prefer Pappy Van Winkle bourbon).</span>

<span>I got these to supplement the pair of Sony MDR-V6 I have, and in comparison, they're pretty disappointing. The bass is a bit too much, and the treble cuts out way too early, making their sound quality noticeably worse than a pair of mid-range earbuds to my ears. If you just want loud bass, then sure, they'll deliver that, but all sharp percussive sounds tend to come through pretty badly.<br/><br/>Aside from that, they do cut out a lot of ambient sound despite not being actively noise-cancelling. I also found them to be extremely hot, to the point of being uncomfortable to wear for long periods, but that might be a bonus during the colder months.<br/><br/>In general, I'm not super impressed. I feel like I could have had better sound quality and greater comfort for a quarter of the price from a pair of earbuds, which would also have the bonus of not requiring a low-impedance amplifier. Definitely would not consider these an alternative to a pair of Sony MDR-V6, either, which is a notion I've seen a lot around the internet - don't listen to the claims of similarity; they don't compare.</span>

<span>I absolutely love these. The pads on the ears feel like pillows or clouds they are so soft and squishy. Compared to my other headphones that I've purchased these are much better build quality and have a much better sound. Nice and bassy as well as good highs. I highly suggest these for the price.</span>

<span>Pros would be that it does provide some noise cancellation, but that is to be expected with any set of over-the-ear closed-back headphones. They fit comfortably (thus far), and the sound is pretty nice for the price. A good balanced sound, with enough bass, etc.<br/><br/>The 30-hour battery life is a great claim, we will have to see if it lives up to it before I can give a rating on that, since I just bought it.  But that would explain the 2-hour charging time.<br/><br/>Cons would be- it came with an extremely short charging cable- less than 2 inches long?  Fortunately I had a normal length charging cable with exactly the same end and a charger, so it wasn’t a big issue.<br/><br/>Another potential con is the swiveling hinges on the ear pieces- this seems like a weak point in the construction, and after owning them for a long period of time, I can see them falling apart at these particular points. I know I’ve owned enough bluetooth headphones that the joints where they either fold or swivel are ALWAYS the weakest points in the construction- and I know I have replaced two units that were still working great as far as the electronics- pairing, connecting, playing great sound, etc- because the joints fell apart and I couldn’t physically wear them anymore.<br/><br/>I hope this is not the case with these phones, because I like how they look, and how they sound, and I have bought a hardshell case to carry them in to prevent unnecessary wear and tear from dropping them, spilling something on them, etc, etc.<br/><br/>I have owned other Philips products, including a Professional Series home theatre amp that I’ve had for ten plus years which still puts out great sound- and I’m hoping my confidence in the brand will not be misplaced.</span>

<span>I was looking for a pair of headphones and I wanted something lower priced to start out since I normally stick to my airpods. Overall these are pretty comfortable, I have a small head so they do slip around a little but they cover my ears rather than sitting on ear uncomfortably. Having an actual pair of headphones is great and the sound is ten times better than my airpods, however, the sound leakage is very bad. If I take them off and push them off to the side, even when the volume is very low I can still hear this music. This isn't great especially since I bought them to wear around campus. So these certainly won't be replacing my airpods, but they're a good addition.</span>

<span>Highs:<br/>- Excellent noise canceling performance<br/>- Really nice fit and finish, comfortable to wear<br/>- Excellent build quality and durability (hinges seem very sturdy)<br/>- Easy to use, with very functional touch control<br/>- Good design, not intrusive or overly flashy (sophisticated in my eyes)<br/>- Easy to connect and Google Assistant functions are great (i am using a Pixel 3A XL)<br/>- Updated firmware (auto prompted me this) upon connecting the first time<br/>- Versatile folding positions<br/>- Awareness mode (so I can be aware of the surrounding without having to take these off)<br/>- Super fast charging times<br/><br/>Lows:<br/>- Not the lightest but understandable with the quality of materials they are using<br/>- MicroUSB and not USB-C<br/>- Power button sometimes take a bit longer to shut off (have to hold down more than 3 seconds)<br/>- 2.5mm jack in instead of 3.5mm<br/>- Not the most bass heavy (this is both a good and a bad, depending on taste)<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>These are surprisingly a great pair of ANC headphones that performs just as well as the Sony WH-1000XM3, the gold standard in ANC headphones, while costing almost $100 less than the Sony! It isn't as functional when it comes to tuning its audio profiles but in terms of everyday usability and its ANC performance, it gets a 9/10 from me.<br/><br/>Build quality is amazing for a sub $200 headphone, the leather, memory foam, hinges, and even the paint on the earcups are textured perfectly so that these should last a good few years of heavy usage with no worries.<br/><br/>Audio quality is above average but it does lack the smartphone software that allows you to adjust the EQ and such on the headphones but I think this can be compensated by adjusting the EQ on the music player you are using. I tried playing some FLAC on a non-amplified line using the 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable that is included, it does a great job of delivering clear highs and mids without muddles from the bass. It definitely excels at the trebles, an indication that this is great for clear conversations too. And yes, calls are extremely clear when I use this for regular phone and VOIP conversations on my phone.<br/><br/>Connecting to the phone is easy once it is paired, turning it on does the job automatically. Pairing is easy too, hallmarks of a good BT 5.0 implementation. It even show a picture of the PH805 on my phone after I click on its name in the Bluetooth devices.<br/><br/>There are 3 excellent party tricks that makes this an excellent steal at $180 or so.<br/>1. The 3 ways that it folds: flat fold, curl fold, and flat and curl fold (where it fits in the pouch)<br/>2. Awareness mode turns down the music and broadcasts the environmental noise so that you hear whats around you easily and can carry a conversation with the person in front of you while wearing it, which is quite fun/funny but useful on commutes<br/>3. Google Assistant: I actually started looking at my phone less and less now that I own this pair of headphones. Having Google Assistant able to read back any text messages, even messages in Line app because that function is enabled when wearing this headphone means that I can focus more on work and not get distracted by the many other things going on on my phone! And having the touch control on the earcup, without any additional markings, is a great design in nature.<br/>4th bonus party trick: its touch control is really useful for turning up and down the volume, no more trying to find the volume rocker or buttons, just swipe at the right ear-cup and it adjusts the volume, although slowly.</span>

<span>The sound quality of these headphones is solid--- crisp mids and defined bass, not too tinny highs. The controls are very intuitive and easy to get used to, and they're comfortable to wear. I really appreciate the overall design, which is minimalist and simple with no shiny bits or excessive branding. A lot of headphones in this price range try really hard to look futuristic or "industrial", which often just makes them look tacky and less comfortable to wear. I like that these are just simple and utilitarian. The one gripe I have is that the construction doesn't feel especially solid--- not cheap by any means, just rather plasticky. However, I would still recommend this to anyone as a solid pair of headphones on a budget.</span>

<span>I realize the QC45s have some slight shortcomings in certain areas but their strengths are why I chose them. I have watched so many reviews on the top N/C headphones it irritates my wife, but here is what you can learn from my OCD (hopefully). First the competition and why I didn't select these.<br/>Airpod Max - Cost, weight and the stupid, stupid, stupid case.<br/>Sony XM4/XM5 - Bulky and didn't want gesture controls (just my preference).<br/>Bose NC700 - Didn't like the style and band adjustment, didn't fold up small enough and gesture control.<br/>There are other headphones in the consumer space but these are the big players and my top 3 reasons for picking QC45s were,<br/>1. Space, these fold up into a small case, big, big plus. My main use will be for travel and I wanted the smallest footprint for my carryon.<br/>2. Noise cancelling, I tried and compared these to Sony and the NC700 at an electronic shop in an airport and I thought these were the best. This was before the XM5s, from reviews they might have a slight advantage but not significant.<br/>3. Comfort, all the reviews said the weight, clamping force, cabin pressure, cavity size and breathability were the best of any of the N/C top picks. Smart move by Bose to have another iteration of the QC35s, the comfort is unrivaled.<br/>I will use these mostly for travel, I had QC15s I bought for a wedding anniversary for my wife and I when we were flying for a cruise. They served us well, even bought a Bluetooth adapter for them, still working great and gave them to a family couple. That was 10 years ago, so another anniversary seemed like a reasonable purchase. The other players have features that surpass the QC45s, better sound, more bass, more adjustments but none of these were that important to me. For me comfort was very high on the list and I just like physical buttons and the sound is very good so no complaints there.</span>

<span>Pretty pleased with this purchase.  I previously purchased Bose hardwired headphones about 10 years ago and loved them. When these were featured on Amazon and were wireless, I purchased them<br/><br/>I primary use them with my IPhone and Spotify music. The noise cancellation option works pretty well and allows me to enjoy the music without distraction.  The padding on the phone is extremely comfortable that I use them to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Relatively holds its charge pretty well for full day of music<br/><br/>I attempted to hook them to my laptop with the wire but was unable to listen to a teams call.

<span>Coming from the qc25's I really expected a lot more from these. I've had them for about 2-3 months and have used them everyday, I usually use them to sleep as my house can be pretty noisy in the early morning. While the noise cancellation is great compared to the qc-25s they really made things so complicated with the user experience. From using the app to using these wired it can be pretty confusing at first! For example if I am in Bluetooth mode and I plug the wire into my computer the sound will immediately go to the lowest setting on the headphones forcing me to turn it up and this is every single time I plug into wired. It's really a pain but I'm used to it by this point, it's just very confusing to me why it would preset the audio to the lowest point when connecting via 3.5mm. Other than that the sound quality isn't amazing, in my head its a little flat compared to the qc25's which I always thought of as bass-heavy. In the end though I am happy with my purchase as my main goal with these was to be able to sleep in past 6am without being woken up which they do wonderfully especially with some white noise or ambient sound playing!</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>*Introduction:<br/><br/>I bought the Bose NC 700 right around the new year in 2021, so about a month ago. Like many people, I've been working from home for the past year. However, I have 2 young children who can get noisy, so I wanted some noise cancelling headphones. Also, I like listening to music and gaming, so I'll address that as well. Here is my review, broken down by subject:<br/><br/>*Noise Cancelling:<br/><br/>When I set out to get a pair of noise cancelling headphones, my main priority was, of course, noise cancelling. Naturally, I gravitated towards Bose due to their fantastic history here. I have never owned a pair of active noise cancelling headphones before, so I can't really compare to anything. However, I can say they are amazing. Any low-frequency constant noise is basically gone. I have a small office room with 2 central air registers; I can't hear either of them with the headphones on. I can hear my kids when they are loud, but the "punch" is gone, and it feels like it takes a level 10 crying baby, down to a level 7. All of this is without music on. Turn any music on, and it becomes near impossible to hear anything. I mean it; turn on some rock or rap and kiss noise goodbye. I'm sure the offerings from other companies are great too, but these are wonderful at noise cancelling.<br/><br/>*Sound Quality:<br/><br/>Sound quality is difficult to measure as it's subjective, so I'll try my best. I think the Bose NC 700's sound quality is pheromonal. I can hear lots of fine detail, and nothing has ever felt clipped or muddy, unless the music itself is. I personally really like the sound signature (think how the headphones are tuned, not how "good" they are), but a lot of people want more bass. Keep in mind, these do have good bass, but they won't turn your brain to mush.  I am not a bass lover, so these are great for me. I typically stream Spotify from my computer or phone at the highest quality setting and set the app's EQ (see below for more info) to low = 0, mid = 2, high = 5. So, if you really want bass, I would try the Sony XM4's, but these sound really good and clear.<br/><br/>*Design / Comfort:<br/><br/>This is probably the trickiest for me to review. I’ll start with looks. I think they look cool and different from other headphones. They have a good amount of adjustability and feel pretty solid. They have 3 physical buttons: a noise cancellation level button, and voice assistant button, and a Bluetooth pairing / power button. However, I do not like the silicone headband. It feels cheap (to me at least) and isn’t overly comfortable. It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t feel good. Same goes for the leatherette ear cups. They’re fine, but do not feel premium. For nearly $400 I want something more luxurious.  As a quick aside I’m 6’ 4” and wear glasses. After 6 ish hours wearing these off and on the tops of my ears where my glasses sit starts to hurt. The clamping force (for me) is a bit tight. You can reduce the clamping force by extending the earcups, but for my head it makes the earcups be too low, and that’s not comfortable either. It’s not a terrible thing, but I’m usually happy to take them off at the end of the day. That’s still almost a full work day’s time which is pretty good.<br/><br/>*Battery life:<br/><br/>They are advertised for 20 hours, I’m not sure how much time I actually get but it sounds about right. I usually charge them every other day or every 2 days. I like the battery is measured in hours rather than percentage. Since I don’t travel this isn’t a big deal anyways, but you can get better battery life from other headphones.<br/><br/>*Touch controls:<br/><br/>Touch controls work fine for me. I think this comes down to preference. I’ve had no trouble getting used to them, even swiping up/down for volume. Somehow the volume swipe considers your speed or force to change how much you adjust volume per swipe. A full swipe up / down is about 25/30% in windows.<br/><br/>*Bose Music App:<br/><br/>This section (and the next) is where my review goes off a cliff. I hate the app. When I first got the headphones, the “simple” paring that the little user pamphlet outlined didn’t work. I had to manually pair through my phone. When pairing with my windows 10 laptop, I initially couldn’t get it to work at all. I had to find this post: Steps to pair NC 700 headphones with Windows 10 - Bose Community - 293028 to get it to work. Also, my headphones came uncharged. Between the lack of charge and Bluetooth issues it took about 30-45 minutes before I first heard anything with the headphones.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when you open to music app to change to EQ or something else, your headphones will not be detected. The only solution I’ve found so far is to reboot. This is extremely annoying since it takes about 10-15 seconds to reboot your headphones (see below for why that is).<br/><br/>Another annoyance is that the self-voice level option for when you’re in headset mode is buried withing the app settings. This should be part of the initial settings when you first open the app. You also cannot map it to a tap combo short cut. I would love to be able to do that since I’m adjusting all the time due to my surrounding sound levels when I’m on a call.<br/><br/>1 Last thing, and I wasn’t sure whether to put this in the app or headphone software section. You cannot disable the multiple Bluetooth connection feature. Are you on a zoom meeting on your laptop and you get a call on your phone? Guess what, your audio, both input and output, automatically switch to the phone ringing in your ears. Listening to Spotify on your phone and then the windows chime plays? The windows chime interrupts your music. Even if your windows volume is muted, the audio switch to no sound for the duration of the windows chime. This wouldn’t be a problem, if you could disable the feature. You could unpair and repair devices manually, but if you unpair your phone where the music app is installed, the music app will “forget” the device and you have to go through the setup process again for a new device. It’s mind-boggling stupid and I can’t believe this app made it to market as is. For reference I have a One Plus 6T. Related to this, I’ve never had a successful switch from computer to phone when a call comes in. I can hear the ringing initially, but not the caller once I accept the call. Also, they cannot hear me at all.<br/><br/>*Headphone Software:<br/><br/>The headphone’s software itself is annoying. Not quite as bad as the app, but far from good. Upon startup, the headphone’s voice will tell you the amount of battery you have left and the 2 devices you’re currently connected to. At first this didn’t bug me, but after a while, it is extremely annoying. Most of the time, I know what devices I’ll be connected to. Just let it be a triple tap shortcut or something similar.<br/><br/>Also, there are definite problems somewhere along the chain of input microphone processing. Often my colleagues say I’m cutting in and out when I talk in lower tones. This usually occurs when the central air is running, and it’s input noise canceling is running. As far as I know, there’s no way to reduce or turn off the input noise cancelling. This is frustrating, since one of the selling points for these headphones is good mic quality. It’s very disappointing.<br/><br/>*Summary:<br/><br/>In summary the headphones sound great, but the day to day software issues make these a hard pass at $400. I don’t have the Sony XM4’s or other competitors for comparison, but I cannot recommend against these headphones enough. This will be the first and last Bose product I will own for a long time.</span>

<span>Can a Bluetooth (BT) headphone that sells for less than $80 beat an expensive Bose BT headphone? Let's find out!<br/><br/>HOW I DISCOVERED<br/>I was ironically turned onto the Bose 700 (proper model name is NC 700) by "Oluv's Gadgets" video channel, where he ripped the Bose to shreds! (Search for video "Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700-the worst?") And rightfully so, it turns out. Except at the end, where he did an impressive Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) test of multiple headphones along a busy road. (BTW: I and many owe Oluv a donation: he refuses all sponsorships, and Amazon inexplicably de-affiliated him! Check out his videos.) In his video, the NC 700 seemed near-silent compared to the others, which piqued my interest. I'd previously bought the Ankbit (a sub-brand of 1Mii) E600Pro, and was almost over the moon with it, and wondered how much better the Bose could be, at multiples of that price. Not much, it turns out. So this is a comparison, as much as a review.<br/><br/>CODECS<br/>Bose NC 700 HAS NO APTX!! I was shocked: even the Ankbit has AptX! (Update: it does have the proprietary Apple AAC codec, so there's that.) Not as much a problem, it turns out. SBC should be auditorily indistinguishable at strong signals, and is much more stable when dealing with weak signals. Technically, the lack of AptX should be a con, but strangely for me it became a plus, per real-life experience with AptX stability, and study of Bluetooth codecs. The Ankbit can connect on SBC like all BT speakers, but you can't override the auto-negotiation. In real life, codecs are a preference which, for most people, will be based on misunderstanding, so focus on compatibility and stability.<br/><br/>WIRED CAPABILITY<br/>The Bose NC 700 has a tiny, NON-standard 2.5mm wired headphone jack, NOT the standard 3.5mm (1/8-inch) jack!! The unkindest cut: Bose cheaped out, and this EXPENSIVE headset doesn't even include an adapter!<br/>The Ankbits don't even need an adapter, but they were STILL nice to include a fancy wired, TRRS smartphone-compatible headphone cable WITH AN INLINE VOLUME CONTROL WIRED REMOTE! Don't worry, it gets worse!<br/><br/>SOUND<br/>The NC 700 ranges from just "good, but NOT great" in BT (tuned/factory EQ'd) mode, to "bad" in Wired/ANC Off mode, to "downright awful" in Wired/ANC On mode! Yeah, you can install a famously INTRUSIVE Bose app into your inner sanctum and try to make it sound better in Bluetooth mode than Bose themselves could, with your own custom EQ. But the Ankbit sounds unbelievable right out of the box in BT mode, and still sounds pretty good in both wired (ANC On AND Off) modes. Surprisingly, the Ankbits had actually MORE bass in wired (no factory tuning) mode, which is slightly boomy: the Ankbit's BT tuning actually flattens the bass, reserving a bass bump for the lowest registers, making it have incredible bass for music, while amazingly also not interfering with spoken word.<br/> Sidenote: something I've not seen anyone discuss, even "Oluv's Gadgets" is the COMPRESSION EFFECT (lack of dynamic range), which is in addition to the Bose's poor frequency response. The Ankbit is fully dynamic-sounding. The Bose's true auditory flaws: the dearth of bass, combined with a lack of dynamic range, strangely make them excel at lengthy speech. If you listen primarily to talk, or just loathe bass for some reason, or you think I'm an idiot and that you can hear better than me, the Bose should do well for you. I still prefer the Ankbit overall, including for speech, partly due to their comfort.<br/> I'll give you a perfect analogy: the Bose 700 sounds like 'a decent $40 BT headphone'. I have one, I know. It's amazing what 40 bucks will buy now, but it's not the same as the Ankbit E600Pro at a higher price (you can also get promotions via 1Mii's newsletter). Which makes it even more baffling, that at [many times] the price of a median headset for the Bose, you get sound on-par with a median headset. (And far worse in wired modes.) In BT (tuned/EQ'd) mode, while not an enormous difference side by side, it's enough of a difference—for me—to actually "enjoy" the music, vs not enjoy it ("meh"). But I am finicky with audio. So, I wouldn't rely on the Bose if I could only have one headset. And noise cancellation had better be VERY high on your priority list. Also, there are many complaints of Bose users trying to use this headset for PC work, especially Microsoft Teams. Bose even sells an overpriced USB dongle to try to address the issue. Another Bose fail.<br/> UPDATE: there are "Bose NC 700 HP teardown" videos, where you can see how ridiculously tiny the drivers (speakers) are in relation to earcup size. Furthermore, Bose muffles the drivers by mostly covering them with what looks like a layer of thick aluminum foil, possibly to protect what may be an ANC mic suspended over the center of each driver. The small drivers themselves seem like afterthoughts, and further explain the low weight.<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELLATION<br/>The Bose's drivers are curved toward the ear canal by plastic 'ramps' or inserts. This apparently necessitates a small driver, hence reduced bass, and lower sound quality generally. I believe this is a tradeoff to achieve better ANC, which is where this product shines, NOT for music quality. As expected, the Bose is the clear winner in ANC over the Ankbit, altho the Ankbit does quite well. The Bose adds to this by apparently being one of the few who provide ANC to your audience in phone/headset mode (I haven't verified this). My female partner (who I've determined has low-frequency hearing loss) can't understand me with ANC on. Whereas I can understand everyone just fine, as long as I pause whatever's playing. So 'voice cancellation' depends on your hearing ability. And ANC will block deep voices better.<br/> Bose provides 3 levels of ANC from the headphones, but my partner and I only ever use On and "Off" ("transparent mode"), so the Medium just gets in the way. We both prefer Ankbit's physical slider switch, easier and simpler on/off for ANC (which still works when BT is off, BTW).<br/> With the NC 700, ANC IS NEVER OFF!! Level "0" is "Transparency Mode", which actually AMPLIFIES ambient sound!! That's fine, but let me fully turn the ANC mics off, if I want to! That also affects battery life. I think you might be able to fully disable ANC in the app, but then AFAIK you're stuck with no ANC at all, so the solution is worse than the problem.<br/><br/>CHARGING<br/>The Bose 700's can't charge while listening, did you know that?<br/>Yeah, they completely shut off when you plug in.<br/>The Ankbits happily charge while listening.<br/>Both charge via USB-C.<br/>The Ankbit included a charging cable (USB A to C, which is perfect for users with older tech who might not have a USB-C cable). The Bose included NOTHING. Except a fake 'quick start guide', which only insisted (in about 29 languages) that you install their app immediately!<br/><br/>SELF-NOISE<br/>Hiss or white noise from the ANC and BT circuitry is endemic in BT headphones. And BT headphones and speakers will quickly mute their output when you pause media, so it's difficult to study their true self-noise when transmitting sound. Self-noise (both in ANC/Standby, and while playing) is low on the Ankbit, but even lower on the Bose—but still detectable in a quiet environment. I'd say the Bose has quieter circuitry overall, including while playing. However, with the Ankbit you can truly disable ANC, which means 'no' noise when in Standby (nothing playing). If you're in a truly quiet environment and not playing anything, you won't need ANC, but it's still on with the Bose, so the hiss is there too, right when you could actually be bothered by it.<br/>If there is background noise, you probably won't be able to notice any hiss on either.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/>I feel like the Bose rated hours is overly-optimistic. It doesn't take long to go from 100% to 70% state of charge (SOC). The headset feels light, and sacrificing battery size had to be part of that. The other culprit is that ANC is never truly off, in any powered-on mode. Everyone knows ANC saps battery. Even if it's just sitting on your chest, ANC is active, and the battery's draining. The Ankbit will go for literally days with ANC off. Bose loses again.<br/> UPDATE: from the teardown videos, the NC 700 battery is 630 mAH (small). Ankbit claims an 1100 mAH capacity for the E600Pro, almost double, while probably also using less electricity, so that explains that.<br/><br/>COMFORT<br/>The Ankbit E600 Pro is definitely the clear upset winner, despite being slightly heavier. Bigger, wider cups FTW—and they fold, UNLIKE the Bose. The Achilles heel of the E600Pro is Ankbit/1Mii made the headband too long (the only fix is to wrap something around the headband). The NC 700 simply fits small (female-medium and smaller) heads better. The Bose cups touch my ears; Ankbit's don't. Bose earcups are tighter, and disappointingly vinyl-covered, not fabric. The 700's are not uncomfortable, but the E600Pro is one of the most comortable headphones I've ever worn. Ankbit wins again.<br/> I will say that I suspect the Bose design feels more sturdy. Neither are 'creaky', but the Ankbit feels more plasticky and fragile, and I've seen photos of broken Ankbit arms, but not Bose 700's (other Bose, yes). It doesn't seem common at this point, but Ankbit shouldn't use thin structural plastic. And I've had the plastic arm on a cheaper, gently-used BT headset break recently, so now I'm worried. The Bose 700 uses plastic for structure, but seems stronger.<br/> I've tried 2 wraps to lower the Ankbit's headband height for my partner, the simplest being an ACE bandage. Both worked for her, though we shouldn't need to do that. Even without the wrap, the large cups provided a bit of extra travel on her head, so it still fit, despite being too low.<br/><br/>ANC<br/>Bose wins: this is really what you're paying the high price for. But NEITHER are substitutes for real hearing protection (I've experimented). ANC can be helpful for less-serious noise like a vacuum cleaner or blender, but NOT as range earmuffs, etc. On that note, the Bose would give me weird, somewhat-painful pops from the speaker in the ear closer to a significant noise, such as blenders. So it really wasn't even useful for that. The Ankbit's noise cancellation wasn't good enough to run a blender AND hear my program, unless I turned it up to unhealthy levels, though it was helpful if Paused. Earmuffs were just better. Where ANC shines is background noise, such as air conditioners and traffic. Bose is the pioneer in ANC, back to the 1980s, but you'll pay for it. The noise cancellation reaches into higher frequencies than its competitors, due to more mics, better processing, and probably that weird 'ramp' inside the earcups (which ensuing small drivers I think are the culprit for the crap audio quality).<br/><br/>VOICE PROMPTS<br/>The NC 700 is overly-active with voice prompting, with a full TTS engine that sounds suspiciously like Microsoft's "Zira" voice, but some will like that. At least the Bose briefly pauses your media whenever it does one of its many prompts. But the auto-pausing can cause problems, or just not work at all with certain applications (in whole, it's a plus). The Ankbit features the famously-bad Chinese computer lady saying "ANC on", but thankfully that's the only voice prompt, the rest are beeps. The audio prompts of both the Bose and Ankbit are both too loud (hurts my ears, which is ironic for devices that are supposed to block noise). The best thing is that the Bose can actually verbally tell you the SOC (and WILL tell you, when you turn it on—even if you don't want it to), whereas the Ankbit won't bug you about battery level until it's already unhealthily low, so you have to be more proactive.<br/><br/>APP<br/>I encourage all users to NOT use "apps", unless they're genuinely necessary or important to you. Even then, for security I'd encourage you to install those apps on a "low security" device. I think it's crazy for people to do online banking on mobile devices, but it's somehow common. Let's put it this way: any device you'd do banking on, you shouldn't install apps randomly, especially on Android.<br/> There is no difference between "security" and "privacy". Bluetooth headphone apps are notorious for stabbing you in the back. Bose was not the only one discovered to be doing highly questionable things with their app. REMEMBER, these headphones have MICROPHONES, plus the apps can monitor mobile device activity and location. Bose furthermore infamously forced everyone to REGISTER just to use their app. It later blew up in their face, and I'm taking off an extra star just for this.<br/> I find the ability to customize an EQ compelling, but I'd rather have a device which didn't need its sound tweaked in the first place. Being extremely finicky, but also anti-app, I took a chance on the Ankbit E600Pro, which has no app. Thankfully, my gamble paid off. I'm overjoyed by the Ankbit's sound.<br/> I don't plan to install the Bose app, because I didn't buy the Bose for music (luckily). But if I do, it won't be on a device I use regularly, and I'll probably uninstall it when I get the EQ I wanted anyway. I also won't give Bose any genuine personal info, nor should you, but they can probably figure out a lot anyway, depending your device. The Bose app EQ isn't very sophisticated anyway (not many bands). I'll just keep the crappy default tuning, as it works for speech, and these headphones will never be great for music. I have better stuff for that.. including the Ankbit.<br/><br/>SWAGGER<br/>I despise the idea of buying/not buying a practical item based on looks or social BS. Both the Ankbit and Bose have a narrow headband profile which doesn't look as chunky as many over-the-ear 'phones. Of course the Bose "look" better, but you pay a price for the 'spacey' design: they don't fold, and hair can get trapped easier in those 'poles'. Though I hardly have any hair-pulling with either, I have less with the Ankbit (virtually none, it's amazing). For those of yous who would buy Bose based on 'impressing' people, I'll tell you that true audio enthusiasts almost universally dislike Bose, and oftentimes despise them. Bose is no 'hood ornament' for me, it's a mark of shame. The one thing I respect by Bose, is their ANC headsets. They make (expensive ones) for pilots, and I think were first to market with ANC. That's where my respect stops, and the "app" beef set the disrespect in stone. Bose is always-overpriced stuff that usually sounds 'good' but not 'great'. I think both "Ankbit" and "1Mii" are ridiculous names, but the company has pretty solid (China-based) support, and a warehouse in the US. I can't speak firsthand about Bose support.<br/><br/>CONTROLS<br/>I don't hate the Bose touch controls as much as I thought. Volume control can be more nuanced than the Ankbit, depending device. I still prefer well-implemented physical buttons. I've had numerous times when the touch-sensitive area rested on my shoulder or hands, and unexpectedly announced the battery SOC. You also can't use most gloves. But the Projected Capacitive Touch Sensor is well-implemented.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>You don't always get what you pay for. There are better choices for a lot less money, EXCEPT if you want the best ANC (and ANC for the microphone)—and are willing to endure Diminishing Returns for it.<br/> The Bose was an expensive experiment and gamble, but since my life partner and I were 'fighting' over the Ankbit, we needed another. And since the Ankbit was a bit too big for her, and I like to experiment, I held my nose and tried the Bose. I went into this knowing the Bose music quality would be sub-par. But we mainly use headphones for speech, so adding wireless has been liberating. I wanted to experience the state of the art with ANC. I nearly bought a Bluetooth-equipped 'hearing-protection' type muff, but thought we'd have comfort issues (she hates having her "head squeezed"). Pay your luxury tax and sacrifice music quality if you want the best ANC there is (but not the best "muffling": true hearing protection earmuffs will still blow it away).<br/> Despite the fact that the Ankbit doesn't even fit her right due to the too-long headband, my LP still says she would STILL choose the Ankbit, if she could only have ONE (though due to the fitment issue—and that alone—it was a hard question for her). That's even if I didn't wrap the headband to bulk it up! That's saying a lot. And she claims even she can discern the better music quality of the Ankbit. That's saying a lot too!</span>

<span>These are good. The battery life and charging case, the sound, all the normal stuff. But they have a known problem. They quit working as a pair.<br/><br/>I spent 3 weeks trying to fix them and found a lot of information. JBL knows they are sometimes not "paired as a set" when shipped and will replace them. But don't send them back until you try this!<br/><br/>What happens: one side or the other will stop working. They are not a set anymore. Not stereo. You can connect to R or L but not both as a unit. JBL help site says reset them by holding down the button for 10 seconds. They also want you to take them out of the case while the case is plugged in to the wall socket for charging. Then put them back in and hit the button on the L one 3 times in a row. Then do that on the R one. They should both blink blue then turn white when they become a pair.<br/><br/>NONE OF THAT WORKED FOR ME.<br/><br/>DO THIS: Unpair them from your phone. Put them both in the case and then take them back out. Hold one in each hand and push both buttons 3 times at the same time. It took me about 4 attempts but the lights turn solid blue when you get it. Then a prompt will show up on your phone that they are ready to connect. Click yes. Done.<br/><br/>More info: mine worked when I first bought them and then quit working as a pair. Nothing I found online worked. This fixed them today. I hope it helps you also. These are not cheap. I didn't want to throw working earbuds away.</span>

<span>Overall these earbuds met my expectations. Great sound quality, great battery life, small compact sturdy carrying case, smooth connection, fit comfortably for long periods of time. Personally I really like that the side control buttons on the earbuds are physical buttons rather than touch controls.<br/><br/>With the side control buttons you can perform the following actions:<br/>Next Song - 1 press left<br/>Previous  - 2 press left<br/>play/pause - 1 press right<br/>accept/end call - 1 press right<br/>siri/google assist/bixby - 2 press right<br/>You can also just use only the right or left earbud in mono mode and then 1 press will be play/pause and 2 press siri...<br/><br/>Cons<br/>These earbuds are not on the list of supported devices for the JBL headphones app so you won't be able to do any EQ customization or personalization.<br/><br/>There are no way to change volume with the buttons which would have been nice to see. The one time I've found this to be a headache is when using the earbuds with my Samsung smart tv which didn't allow me to change the volume of the earbuds from the remote or settings. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be way around this because these earbuds are not supported on their app.</span>

<span>UPDATE, BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Well, I'll be damned, its been exactly a year since I wrote this. It was pure luck that I checked my reviews today.<br/><br/>Anyway, build quality.<br/><br/>The M20xs I bought a year ago are still going strong, and I use them constantly when I am not on my computer. The cable is fine, the gold plating has worn off of the plug (that's normal after a lot of use), and the plastic doesn't appear to be worn. If I cleaned this thing very well, it would look brand new. However, not everything is in perfect condition, and that would be the padding.<br/><br/>I started to notice after a while that the earcups were starting to feel harder and harder. As a sanity check, I took a look at my dad's m50xs to see if they were still soft, and they were (he doesn't use them that much anymore). I looked into it, and apparently, the fake rubber-leather stuff Audio Technica uses in their earcups slowly deteriorates over time by getting harder and eventually cracking due to the stress of cushioning. This is a result of constant contact with body oils (this is why my dad's pair is still soft). Thankfully, these are replaceable, but they are $25 for a pair, which is quite a bit. I got these headphones for $30 dollars while they were on sale, for perspective. There is also the chance that they use some cheaper earcups in the m20xs, which wouldn't surprise me. In which case, the replacement earcups for the m50xs could be considered an upgrade.<br/><br/>What is more worrisome is the headband. Unlike the m50xs, which have a higher quality rubber on the headband, the headband on the m20xs is made out of the same material the earcups are. You can't replace it. Although its unlikely that the headband will get severely damaged from cracking since it doesn't exactly cushion, I can still see some dents in mine that don't go away.<br/><br/>Other than that, these are still my favorite general purpose headphones, and I still recommend them. I'm on the edge of replacing the earcups though. If it does break at some point, I might aim for the m40xs due to the shorter cable options, better build quality/materials, and better sound. I'll give it two more years and see what happens to them.<br/><br/>REVIEW:<br/><br/>So, I have never been wealthy enough to own a good pair of headphones. Hearing about the constant praise of Audio-Technica, I decided to pick of their budget pair of monitors, the ATH-M20x. My father has a pair of their M40x or 50x, but I am pretty much not allowed to touch them. That's why I can't say which ones they are.<br/><br/>As perspective and for comparison, the main headphones I used before these were the Sol-Republic v8 tracks, and I use a Logitech G230 gaming headset currently for my desktop.<br/><br/>The song I tested between these headphones was Ocean Man by Ween, because of the formidable range in pitch. I also remembered the song the day I did this, so it was a bit nostalgic for me to listen to it again.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, the first thing that struck me with these headphones was that the bass was much less compared to the other headphones. Now, this isn't a bad thing, because it let me focus on the other tracks in the song, such as the guitar and percussion, which became much brighter. This made the song sound much clearer than my other headphones, which lacked a little in mids and highs.  My Sols overall had much more bass, but the rest of the frequencies seemed filtered out because of it. It's mostly the same story with my g230s, but the highs are much better than the sols. Realizing this, I finally figured out why I couldn't hear footsteps very well in the game Counter Strike Global Offensive, which encourages me to buy another pair of the M20x for my desktop, as well as a mic. The only real issue I have with the M20x at this point is that I cannot hear bass drums very well if they aren't mixed loud enough, which is disappointing, as percussion is one of the most important factors in music to me. Overall, these have generally amazing performance in the audio range, despite the bass seeming only a tad bit weaker than it should be. If they boosted up a tiny bit, I would be satisfied. Not worth to take a star off however, especially for the price.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that these headphones are higher in impedance than normal, so I have to near max out my volume on my phone to get somewhere acceptable to me. This isn't a problem, but I'm afraid I may get some distortion in some songs. This is also sad, as I use a separate Creative Zen audio player for my high quality CD rips, which don't go as loud as my phone, making it essentially useless. They also don't really like to plug into my phone with the case on, so I have to jam it in the jack and hope it doesn't spring out. This is along with the other problem with my audio jack, which is that they always think I'm using an inline mic unless I unplug and re-plug and hope they see them as regular headphones. If it doesn't, then bumping the cord can cause google to start voice detecting, which is very annoying, as well as randomly pausing and playing a song. To reinforce it, this is a problem with my PHONE, not the plug. This is more of a me problem, however, they still have issues being plugged into a phone with a case. Making the end coned and the adapter it comes with internally coned would solve this problem.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, one of main reasons why I bought a g230 was because they are very well built, and could take multiple falls off of my desk. Same goes for the Sols, which are pretty much designed like a tank due to the super strong headband and hard but not brittle plastic. The M20x however, seems like it would need a bit more care with the headband, since it is not topped with plastic. I usually just throw my Sols into my backpack everyday, because it can handle it. These will need a bit of extra attention to not tear up the foam on the headband. I tried buying a </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/hard-case-from-Caseling/dp/B00LZ3VFW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">hard case from Caseling</a>
<span>, but the description lied to me and said that these headphones would fit. They didn't, and now I have to return it as soon as possible to get my 13 bucks back. They do fit my dad's well though because they fold, and is a pretty good case. Otherwise, the ABS plastic is nice on the drivers making them strong, and the headband has spring steel metal in it. There are no visible defects anywhere, not even unmixed plastics or rough spots on the foam. This is fairly impressive for a product made in Taiwan. Another thing I would have liked would be to color the logo inset on the sides of the drivers, it would make it easier to see. I assume this is to differentiate different models.<br/><br/>Now, the cord I have a bit of an issue with. The cord itself is very nice; it's well insulated and flexible. The jack is nice too, it appears gold plated and has a nice bend protector. The issue I have is that it's way to freaking long, at a staggering 3 meters. This may be a good thing for some people, but I am going to be walking around with these. I have to coil up the wire (thank god for that insulation) and put a cable management strip on it to shorten it. Now, there is a good 4 inch diameter coil in my pocket that is 1/2 an inch thick, and is VERY annoying. If they could have at least shortened it to maybe 1 meter, I would not be writing this. This is worth a star for me, so off it goes. Despite this, the cable has to be one of the best impeding headphone cables I have encountered, keeping out eddy currents very well, which would cause distortion with the huge coil I have to lug around. A good way to test if a cable is well insulated or not is to try and use the cable as a stylus on a touch screen. If the screen reacts in any way while playing music, the cable has failed the test. No matter how I tried, looping it, squishing it against the screen, it would not be detected. That is a good sign for a good cable, as no electrical fields are going through that thing. As a solution to the coil, I may do some research on the internals of the cord, and shorten it myself. If you are also hateful of this issue, the better ATH models have interchangeable cables that can be much shorter. To me, it isn't worth it to pay 30 to 40 extra dollars for that feature.<br/><br/>COMFORT:<br/><br/>So, my g230s are a very comfortable pair of headphones for me to wear, as they are over ears. My Sols on the other hand are on ear, which was a huge issue to me when I bought them. It's not that they were uncomfortable, but it was because of an odd problem I have with my right ear. My ear canals are extremely small, so I can't use earbuds, which is really my main reason of buying full on headphones. In this case, the Sols would squeeze my right ear shut! There would be no music to my right ear unless I physically held the driver, and stretched my ear a bit. Now, the M20x are also over ear, so that's great for me. It's actually the main reason why I bought these, I wanted a nice pair of over ears that would not impede my hearing. Not only this, I would say they fit even better than my g230s due to the many degrees of freedom, so I am extremely happy here. My issue was solved due to these headphones. The actual foam the headphones use is nice, definitely on the drivers. The headband foam on top is durable and a bit stiff, but not noticeable. The bottom foam seems the same as the drivers, so no problem there. All of the foam seems to be wrapped in a thin fake leather material, and it feels nice. My g230s are just wrapped in perforated fabric, which makes it a tad itchy.<br/><br/>MY OWN JUDGEMENT:<br/><br/>Now, because I like nice things, I want it obvious what I'm using is nice and worth it. I like to make a statement, so I buy things that fall under these categories:<br/><br/>1. Looks cool<br/>2. Does it's job well<br/>3. Lasts a long time<br/><br/>So, for it looking cool, I would say "eh." As I previously stated, the logo isn't painted in, so they just look like headphones from afar. My Sols on the other hand, look 100% sweet, with it's circular drivers, solid looking headband, minimalist logo, and shiny plating (that wore off around the edges of the drivers, sadly). These don't have that aesthetic I'm looking for, but they do look like monitors, which kind of makes up for it. To me, they just look intermediate, not pro.<br/><br/>For doing the job well, that is a definite yes. The cool factor to me can immediately be vetoed in the case that something works like a well oiled machine. This is that case. They just sound good, and anyone who would borrow these would tell. My sols aren't that good sounding, and my g230 is okay, so these are technically the best headphones I own at the moment. A case where this wouldn't be true would be Beats by Dre. Yes, the headphones look very nice, iconic even. Despite this, they pretty much are just a step up from those 5 dollar Koss headphones you buy at drug stores when you have nothing else to use (those headphones are very good for the price though, so I like them for that).<br/><br/>I don't know for certain yet if these will last a long time. This is another factor that directly goes with doing the job well, as having these factors multiply each other makes for a godly product. My Sols and g230s definitely fall under this category, as they have both lasted me 2 years. The Sols are almost done for, however, as the right driver's plastic cone buzzes on certain frequencies. The g230s look literally brand new and haven't degraded audio wise, so they have served me well, and will keep doing so. Beats by Dre also do not fall under this factor, as they must be treated like kings, or either they will shatter the moment you look at them (an anecdote from a friend). Because it misses the two most important factors, Beats headphones are useless to me, especially with the price they ask for. I will have to live with the M20xs for a while to see how well they do with this factor, and I am predicting another strong yes. And even if they only last me a couple months, they are still only $30, an amazing price for what these headphones are. One thing I realized that may break them is extending the drivers over and over again. The metal tracks that are attached to them go in and out of the headband, and you can feel them moving inside through the foam. You can even pinch it and make it really hard to move it (annoying sometimes), which means they aren't encased in anything. This leads me to predict that at some point, they will poke through the band. Because of this, I will not shorten them every time I stow them away. Someone posted a picture that looked like this happened to them, so I will watch out.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>These are an amazing pair of headphones that meet many of my quality standards, as I am a bit of a snob. They sound great, but bass drums can be too quiet or hard to distinguish. They are made very well, despite the freaking long cable and too thick of an end for the jack. They are very comfortable, and solved the issues I had with other headphones I owned. They succeed my personal checklist, but I will need to test for durability. So, as a final statement: if you are on a budget and want nice over ears for sitting down and listening to music, pick up a pair of ATH-M20X headphones. If you have more money, shoot for the M40x or m50x if you want to walk around or need better quality. I am pretty satisfied despite my current situation, so I hope you can enjoy these headphones more than me.</span>

<span>I needed a new set of over the ear closed back studio headphones, but didn't wanna spend lots of money, as it's not really necessary. These do the job well enough for me. When I plugged them into my phone, I was initially disappointed, but when I used them in the studio, as they're meant to be used for, is where they really shined. I compared them to my other headphones that are 4x expensive and the AT pair actually sounded better. I like them because there is no added bass, which you don't want added bass using them as studio headphone monitors, cause you want the true sound of whatever you're tracking so you can adjust sounds accordingly. If you're looking for a pair of listening headphones, like for your phone, etc, this would not be the pair I'd suggest. But, if you're looking for some inexpensive headphones for tracking then these are a good option. I would like for them to be a little louder, that's why I overall rated them 4/5 stars.</span>

<span>These are actually really good headphones overall.  They have a really long battery life, cancel out noise perfectly and have great sound.  They are easy to pair and I love the fact that they fold up easily for carrying them with you. I did give it 4 stars but I would say 4.5 because they are a bit uncomfortable on the ear after a while.  They become a bit tight which makes them kind of sweaty on the ear after extended wearing but overall great headphones.</span>
