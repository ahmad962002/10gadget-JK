Upgrade your sound and style with Samsung Galaxy Buds Live. Designed with a larger Galaxy Buds speaker, improved bass, and an open fit, playlists sound more like live music than ever before. An open design creates a live listening environment, suiting those who prefer a natural, spacious sound. When you need to block out background noise for a phone call or important tasks, initiate Active Noise Cancellation with a touch. Tap earbuds again to let in surrounding live sounds— colleagues’ voices, flight announcements, street traffic—while still enjoying your favorite playlist or podcast. Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are easy on the eyes, light on the ears, and have long-lasting battery life. Features including Active Noise Cancellation is enabled through a Bluetooth connection or the Galaxy Wearable app on Android, available through Google Play Store and the Galaxy Buds app on iOS devices, available through the App Store. Actual battery life may vary and depend on usage conditions such as function settings, playback file type, and Bluetooth signal strength.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got these on sale during prime day for $80, and for that price these are pretty good.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling:<br/>I didn't expect much from an earbud, and yeah it's not great. I notice it a little bit, but my v1 galaxy buds cancel out noise better by just fitting deeper and more snug in the ear. And it doesn't even remotely compare to my bose over ear noise canceling headphones (but that's not a fair comparison). I can't wear these while mowing the lawn, the mower will drown them out. It seems highly dependent on the shape of your ear as to how well the noise cancelling works.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>Sound quality is great for earbuds. Better than my galaxy buds v1. I'm not a big audiophile, but I do notice differences in sound quality.<br/><br/>Fit:<br/>I have small ears, so I was skeptical these would even fit at all. They do fit, and are not uncomfortable, and they stay in my ears even when working out. However, I think optimal results for things like noise cancelling are highly dependent on the shape of your ear. My ears are simply not shaped to fit the way they do in the advertising. I watched many videos of how to wear them the "proper" way and I think I am, but my ear shape just doesn't allow for optimal results with noise cancelling.<br/><br/>Overall Thoughts:<br/>If you can get them on sale, they're a decent set, but I would not recommend them in situations where you need to block out lots of background noise. I only wear these when working at home our out in my yard in a quiet setting. If I'm on a plane, or mowing the lawn, I'd reach for my v1 galaxy buds or bose over ear headphones. You may win the genetic lottery where your ear is shaped perfectly for these and its more effective, but it's hard to know until you wear them.</span>

<span>Once I determined that I did want wireless earbuds, I was torn on which to get, because earbuds have never stayed in my ears no matter what rubber inserts I put on them. I had a pair of Raycons that were pretty good at first but always wiggled out eventually. Well, the Galaxy Buds Live have fixed this problem for me! They sit inside of the folds of your ear and don't really go in, which means that they've never popped out when I've been using them. If you also have this problem, consider these earbuds. The sound is excellent -- though, because they don't form a seal on your ears, the noise cancellation isn't as intense as other brands. Keep that in mind if your preference is getting fully immersed. I enjoy still being able to hear what's going on around me, so it's not a problem for me. The Buds Live and their case have a nice build quality, and I really like the cute "coffee bean" appearance they have. Overall, I would definitely recommend them, and recommend them even more if you're like me and you have trouble with getting traditional earbuds to stay in.</span>

<span>I bought these as a replacement for another set I had misplaced.  The design put me off and I wasn't sure I would like this little bean shaped earbud, but now I think they are great.<br/><br/>I don't always like wearing headphones that drown out all noise and remove situational awareness.  This shape allows me to change how much situational awareness I have based on the movement while they are in the ear - so I can move them a bit "up" and hear more of what is around me or push them more into the ear and drown it all out.<br/><br/>The fact that the case itself acts as a battery for charging on the go is the best feature since I can pretty much go multiple days without charging.  It was definitely worth the cost.</span>

<span>This is my second pair, my first I purchased directly from Samsung and I noticed some slight differences. The biggest is the battery. For some odd reason the battery drains alot faster than my first pair, not sure why... but I find I have to charge it more. The second is the feel of the buds themselves. These are a bit lighter which is weird because they are light to begin with. The sound quality is about the same. They served their purpose as my back up set.</span>

With up to 24 hours of total battery life and a complete yet simple set of controls, Sesh Evo is the easiest way go truly wireless. For example, the buds automatically enter pairing mode the first time they power on. And after that, they’ll instantly pair with the last device you used. Likewise, you can adjust volume, skip tracks, take calls, activate an assistant and even select different EQ modes—all with a single finger, and without ever touching your phone. Sesh Evo earbuds are water, sweat and dust resistant. Built-in Tile technology helps you find your buds if you misplace them. And with the Skullcandy Fearless Use Promise, if anything ever happens to a bud or the case, you can replace it at a discount.

<span>I purchased these about three months ago. They are a great product. The sound quality and noise cancellation is great. The only problem I have with these is they no longer work...my case suddenly went out. It was not exposed to heat, and although I have dropped them a couple of times, they still worked properly. After they suddenly went out, I looked towards other users for answers but they told me that sometimes the box will short fuse and go out or it may be damaged and need repairs. The skullcandy company offers a 2 yr warranty but in order to have your earbuds or case replaced, you must send the entire thing to them. This can take up to weeks and if your package somehow manages to get lost in transit or stolen, they will not replace it. These headphones cost me $35 dollars. I am very upset that they just randomly stopped working. But, you may get lucky, so I still recommend that you buy them. If I could, I would buy another set, but I can't afford to buy a product that I'm not sure will last longer than three months. Kind of annoying, don't you think?</span>

<span>After my Indy EVO buds kicked the bucket, I was looking for another Skullcandy pair to replace them.  So, I decided to try out the Sesh EVO because "why not?"<br/><br/>The Sesh are a fantastic pair of wireless buds, and I much prefer them to the Indy.  The quality is great for buds, they pack a surprising bass punch that I missed with the Indy and overall have a decent range all around.  I use buds at work, one ear at a time, swapping when needed, and they pair individually just fine and then pair together just as intended if both are taken out of the case.<br/><br/>The case was my main worry when first getting the Sesh, as I had become accustomed to the Indy case, but thankfully my worries faded.  The case is sleek enough to fit in my pockets and doesn't bulge out as much as I thought.  It takes a little effort to open, more than you would think, so I don't feel like there is a worry of the case opening while in a bag or similar.  Even if that happened, the buds themselves stay in their charging spot very well, the magnets hold them in place with ease.<br/><br/>In ear the buds sit comfortably just like any other, the ergonomics fit my large ears out of the box.  One thing to note is that the control options on the buds themselves are a tactile press, not touch press like the Indy.  So it takes a more deliberate action to pause or lower/raise the volume.<br/><br/>Battery wise they last a decent chunk of time, there hasn't been a worry there.  As for charging, the case itself charges very fast but the buds themselves take a bit long to fully charge up.  So prepare to leave them in a little longer than you might want.<br/><br/>Overall these buds do everything right and surprised me in places for their price.  A definite wireless bud option that works great.</span>

<span>Skull candy is my go to brand for audio. I spend a lot of time to myself at work so I figured some earbuds would make the time pass faster. The sound quality of these ear buds are great! A nice mix of highs and lows with plenty of bass but if you plan to wear these while moving a bunch, they aren't such a great pick. Even with the smallest tips on, the buds would slowly wiggle out of my ear and almost fall out and I have pretty average sized ears. Still a good purchase but I'd use them while sitting or traveling instead.</span>

<span>I bought these in November 2020 for all my self-care walks and bike rides. It's been nearly 2 years and I've found them great, sweat all over them, BUT my friends are all disgusted when I try to use them for calls - I can't hear them well, and they can't hear me at all. Alas! Still a steal for the price (I also managed to snag them on sale).</span>

<span>Update:<br/>Knocking a star off. Still a decent headset. Discovered a couple, to me, significant deficiencies, since my original review.<br/><br/>1) Battery life is far lower than rated 12 hour. getting about 8, maybe. Mostly listening to podcasts.<br/>2) Lack of low battery warning. If there is one, I never heard it.  The other earphones I have used all have clear warnings , usually stating '20% battery remaining' and such. I have not had any warning, and ran out of battery 2 times so far.<br/>3) the buttons on the neckband are really not logical, or marked what they do.<br/>4) battery indicator is on the other side of the neckband than the charging port.  Not a big deal, just odd.<br/>5) no 'over top of ear' wire routing like others I have used. Just a preference.<br/>6) I miss having an add-on charged battery to greatly increase the use of the product without having to find a charging port. Not easy when out of the home/car.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I have found the phone function and quality is very good.  No complaints from anyone I have talked to about the sound quality on my end. Most headsets I have used were bad to very bad. These are very good.<br/><br/>From a dead battery, I charged about 20 minutes, got about 20% battery (according to the app).  I guess that is pretty good.  Using the headset as i type. Battery is now 15% after about 25 minutes of use (podcast listening)<br/><br/>Still don't like the neckband.  Prefer over top of ear, tight around the head wire style with nothing on my neck.<br/><br/>Still, the sound quality for music, when equalized using your music app, is very good. Sound and mic quality are very good for phone.<br/><br/>The business end of this set is there.<br/><br/>Original review below:<br/>Coming from an older pair of similar Jaybird headphones.  Purchased these because they seemed similar.<br/>Seems a lot of review are doing pros and cons. Seems reasonable. Impressions below pros/cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>lightweight<br/>fits my ears<br/>fast charging<br/>simple controls (also a con)<br/>good sound..well..after using your music app's EQ to adjust to your hearing level<br/>phone/mic seems very good.<br/><br/>cons<br/>disposable product. No adding/changing batteries that I can see.<br/>during quiet songs, you can hear sound transmitted from your clothing, etc. Not terrible. Just something new and odd.<br/>non-intuitive simple controls (simple to learn, however)<br/>no app to fine tune the headphones to your hearing level and tones to your ears.<br/>out of the box, sound is flat and zero bass. using your music app like Amazon Prime Music, you can tune an equalizer and greatly improve the sound<br/>relatively low volume<br/>not crazy about feeling the cord on my earlobes and the band on my neck.<br/><br/>Impressions:<br/>Not bad for the price.  Initially, I thought they were horrible. Turned on the EQ in Amazon Prime Music, which fixed that !  Out of the box , the sound is unimpressive, to say the least. Not crazy about the semi-rigid band. I liked the all wire of the Jaybird, as you could have it conform to your head with no movement for a real nice fit, making you even forget you had them on.  These, you always know you have them on, as you can feel them on your earlobe and on your neck.<br/><br/>Even with the annoyances, will give it 5 stars. Will revisit the review if there is any significant update<br/><br/>Nutshell, they are almost identical to a $15 set I have, in all respect except these do sound a lot better.  Is it worth the price... ehhh I don't know. As I listen to music writing this, I am liking them a LOT less than my old Jaybird Freedom.  The sound quality (after setting up the EQ) is better, however, but the neck band is getting more annoying</span>

<span>These are workhorse Bluetooth earbuds that I like better than Airpods, with a 5 star rating in every category except sound quality - and the only reason I deducted one star is because Apple is selling stuff that is truly audiophile quality now. They are "almost" wireless which is to say, no wire to device but there is a wire between the earbuds - for completely wireless you'll need Powerbeats at nosebleed pricing. No earhooks, but when fitted with the right size tips, they stay in place. You can keep them around your neck all day and only put them in when you decide to watch a video clip or take a call. They are comfortable for Netflix/Prime binging. They are hard to lose if you drape them over your neck. Apple Genius Bar replaces lost tips for free, but only in person.<br/><br/>These sound better than Airpods, are a close match to Airpods Pro but without active noise cancellation, drape comfortably from the neck so they won't get lost (ever had an Airpod mysteriously slip out of your ear and lost it?) and if you choose the RIGHT SIZE ear tip, have EXCELLENT SOUND. With an undersized ear tip - like I had at first - there is inadequate bass. With a proper air seal, bass is excellent in an honest way, not pumped up artificially like old-skool Beats, with equally honest, balanced, mids and highs (you won't appreciate what they can put out until listening to some Dolby Atmos sound effects videos on YouTube). NOT fatiguing to watch videos for hours. Good sound stage and special effects with Atmos capable devices (Apple iPad/iPhone with A10 chip or higher, Fire HD 10 current edition, Fire HD 8 current edition) on Atmos encoded sound tracks (FWIW, Atmos is Dolby's effort to provide 360 degrees of sound effect from just earbuds - and it's surprising how well it "fakes" normal surround sound from multiple speakers, front and rear). (Also try Windows Sonic for Headphones, free in Windows 10, buried in sound card settings.)<br/><br/>Where Beats Flex are outstanding is price - under $50. That's equivalent to knocking $100 off the first-release BeatsX which rolled out at $149.95 in 2017. And convenience. Unlike conventional Bluetooth earbuds, which have to be endlessly paired and re-paired to use with different devices, Beats Flex will pair with ALL your iPhones and iPads and Macs provided only that they are signed into the same iCloud (Apple ID) account. On Android, you download an app, and so long as you have the app you don't even have to be signed in under the same Google ID.  With Windows 10 - sorry, conventional pairing and repairing.<br/><br/>With a device you just used (or used yesterday), logging in and connecting is automatic - device power on, Flex power on, you are connected. If you move to a different device, whether Apple (with same Apple ID) or Android (with Beats app running), you first need to click on Connect (even if the device flashes a signal that it notices the Flex). It's easier done, than described.<br/><br/>You can also share audio with a friend's Apple device - two headphones paired to one phone or pad.<br/><br/>There are some controls, but all I ever use is the magnetic clip attachment between the rear of the two buds, to sleep and to pause playback on the iPhone or iPad. And the off button, when a session is over.<br/><br/>Battery life is great. I can watch videos all day and night, the battery lasts longer than I do. Or, on saner schedule, go several days without a recharge. Compare that to 3 or so hours from some indie, cheapo (but good) Bluetooth earbuds (hook over ear style).<br/><br/>Charges with a USB C cable (included) so one more cable to carry, but ultimately greater compatibility and fewer cable-wars (Apple is taking baby steps to kick Lightning to the curb and focus on C).<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Cheap, good sounding, wireless, over-the-neck earbuds with Apple quality. Wow.<br/><br/>Caution: I have some sync issues with VLC video playback (but not YouTube, Netflix, Prime). It's easy to fix by adjusting the sync delay setting in VLC. I don't have these sync issues with MPow Flame airbuds. I think the Flex emphasize audio quality over perfect sync, that or VLC and Flex don't play nice with each other. Anyway its annoying but easy to fix, and I suspect the programmers at VLC will eventually take care of it.</span>

<span>Oh my gosh--- first of all I have some hearing loss and it can be hard to clearly hear (as an example) in a zoom meeting or such.  I attend court via zoom fairly often and the sound quality is not great.  But, since I've gotten these I don't strain to hear or understand --- outside noise is not cancelled but it is also not intrusive--- it's hard to describe but you are aware of sounds outside of the headphones but it's subtle.<br/>But, maybe even more importantly (at least for me) is that they have different sized earbuds!!-- I have tiny ear openings and any of the earbuds that come with say your iPhone or on the airplane, don't fit me.  These have a small sized bud and I love the fit!!<br/>The sound quality is great.<br/>Last but not least, you can walk away from the computer for some distance and still hear and be heard!!  Several feet at least.  I absolutely love them!!!!!!</span>

<span>I purchased these to use when running and riding my mountain bike.  I've had zero issues with them and I'm quite impressed with the battery life.  The sound quality seems excellent to me, an average person with no musical skills.  My ONLY complaint is the charging cable, which is kind of a big deal and caused it to lose a star.  It would be nice if it were the standard USB connection instead of this weird thing that it is.  I can only plug in to charge if I have my laptop with me.  This is a huge annoyance since I also have no technical skills and don't know the first thing about what kind of adapter I might need.</span>

<span>I have only ever used the original AirPods design since they came out. I enjoy how they can sit in my ears without causing them to hurt after prolonged listening. But they let in many sounds, and it's not worth using outdoors or in noisy conditions like a college dorm.<br/>So that is when I looked at Sony's LinkBuds S. They were on sale for around $148 at the time of purchase in August, and I sprung for the deal!<br/>The noise canceling is pretty decent; it's my first experience with ANC, but I was slightly underwhelmed. But I don't expect every sound to disappear at this price point.<br/>The Buds' sound is excellent and crisp. I personally noticed a little less bass when listening to music. Still, I downloaded the Sony app and tweaked the EQ settings to my style.<br/>When purchasing these, I was tempted to wait for AirPods Pro 2, but I needed something relatively new for college.<br/>The right side Bud does hurt my ear; I think it is because my right ear may be shaped differently. Not sure. I kind of ignore the uncomfortable feeling. I had another set of cheap silicone-tipped earbuds, and they did the same thing in my right ear, so I think this discomfort is just for me or other people with different shaped ears. And yes, I did try different silicone ear tips, but it didn't work. I might have to experiment with that a little more.<br/>The case and buds look very cool, especially with the mate feeling, unlike the AirPods case, which is slippery and scratches easily. I think you do not need an exterior case for the case, as it will barely show wear and tear.<br/>I'm very surprised by Sony's packaging. They created a box to use the space as much as possible. Very little to no plastic use, very cool, in my opinion. They are doing more than Apple or Samsung in the " Eco-Friendly " department in this technology era.<br/>Battery life is excellent, although I don't use them for that long anyways at a time. I don't walk everywhere with earbuds in my ears.<br/>Overall, I recommend these buds for people who may go between "ecosystems" like windows, iOS, etc. These buds can be paired to (but not connected to at the same time) up to 8 devices. Unfortunately, they do not offer multiple device support (connected to 2 or more devices simultaneously). This may be inconvenient, but switching between devices takes less than a second, but you have to do it manually.<br/>However, seeing the price back up near $200, my recommendation lessens. I would say go for it if they stayed at $140-$150. Not sure If I can recommend them when they are so close to AirPods Pro Gen 2 earbuds.<br/>But despite the price, good overall experience with my first Sony product. They will probably go down in price this year, hopefully.</span>

<span>I've been eyeing these buds since they were released but was hesitant to purchase them due to the mixed reviews for the ANC, even with the initial launch discount. That said, my new neighbors are frat boys who party at any hour and are destroying my night-shift body's minimal sleep schedule. And, while I do have noise canceling technology (Bose Headphones), they aren't devices that one can wear comfortably in bed. As such, I decided to bite the bullet when these buds went on sale on Prime Day for $158.<br/><br/>Having worn these now for a few hours, I'll share my current thoughts:<br/> - ANC is far from sub-par. You might notice a decrease in quality if you're used to the high-end stuff, but if you're like me and your only experience with NC are headphones that create pressure on your ears, this is certainly a worthy purchase. The Sony app is still learning to adjust (it has only been a few hours after all) so I'll sometimes hear my fan on full blast if I move locations, but the earbuds adjust and make the fan noise completely vanish within about 15 seconds.<br/> - I consider myself to have ears on the smaller scale (I'm 5'1") and am usually skeptical of earbuds that have a round body. That said, these have not yet caused any ear pain and the Medium ear tips (these are the tips that are on the earbuds when you open the box) had a fairly comfortable fit. After a few hours, I decided to try the Small ear tips and realized that they were the better fit for the fact that the earbud bodies sat more snugly in my ears and didn't protrude as much. Unfortunately, I found that the Small tips were a tad too small for my ears as the NC could no longer completely block out the sound of my fan. After about 5-10 minutes of bouncing between the Medium and Small tips, I decided to stick with the Medium tips since NC was of better quality. And it's not like I'm worried about the buds falling out of my ears.<br/> - Charging is fairly simple, both for the buds and the case. I did notice that some folks here were upset about the lack of wireless charging but, as a cat parent, I find the ability to charge my case via a secure cable extremely reassuring.</span>

<span>(This is a lengthy review, so in case you are short on time I have included a quick Pros/Cons summary at the top.  This gives an idea of my overall opinions, but for more details continue to read on below.)<br/>(Note- I will mostly be comparing these to other earbuds that I have used and/or reviewed recently: AirPods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II )<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>--Comfort/Fit:  So far, these are very comfortable to wear.  They are slightly smaller than some of the other earbuds I've tested, and are up there with Airpods Pro in terms of comfort.  They also feel very secure in the ear, unlike some other brands.  No complaints here with comfort/design.<br/><br/>--Mic Quality:  The mic quality of these is excellent.  I tested out with calling friends, and these were either 1st or 2nd best sounding earbuds according to the people I called.  My friend says that these mics are the best out the earbuds we tested in this range.<br/><br/>--Multiple Ecosystem Support:  These work well with all ecosystems, whether you are using Apple or Android; and with assistants including Alexa and Google.<br/><br/>--Good ANC :  The noise canceling on these is also fantastic.  This technology has come a long way, and sometimes it can be hard to compare ANC, since each company produces earbuds that prioritize blocking out slightly different frequencies.  To me these seem like they are close to the best , but maybe the XM4s and Airpods Pro are SLIGHTLY better, especially the XM4s at low frequency ranges.  The Adaptive Sound Control is a neat feature that can change ambient sound settings based on your location, though I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>--Overall Sound Comparison:  With the default EQ settings, the overall sound quality actually seems slightly worse than the WF1000XM4s to me.  I also prefer the sound of the Klipsch T5 IIs with most music, and even the Galaxy Pros with some songs; as these LinkBuds S can sometimes sound slightly muffled or dampened in comparison.  Still good quality sound overall, just not as good as some of the other options in this range, and not my favorite with any type of music I tested.<br/><br/>--No Wireless Charging:  This seems like a big disappointment for this price range.  I would expect that ALL earbuds that are over $200 should have wireless charging at this point.<br/><br/>MORE DETAILS:<br/>Here are my thoughts on each category, again mostly comparing to:  Airpods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II.  (I also enlisted the help of a friend of mine that is an Audio Engineer, to give his opinions and to use some of his equipment.)<br/><br/>Sound -  These sounded great to me when I first put them in and listened to a variety of music.  I was not disappointed in overall sound quality at all, and if you aren't comparing these to anything else, you will also probably think that they sound great.  It was only after rigorously measuring their output with my friend's mics, and also repeatedly comparing them to all of the other earbuds,  that I was able to notice the slightly muffled sound compared to the other earbuds.  The Airpods Pro, Klipsch T5 II, XM4, and Galaxy Pro all seem slightly more “clear”, with a broader range.  The midrange on the Airpods Pro might be the biggest difference here, and when I switched back and forth between them I felt like I was missing some of those midrange frequencies with the LinkBuds S.  Overall sound range/EQ preferences are of course very subjective and personal, but my friend and I both agree that these are definitively not our favorite in this category.<br/><br/>Design/Fit – I like the way that these fit in my ear, and they are right up there at the top with Airpods and Klipsch in terms of being lightweight and comfortable.  For me, the Galaxy Pros were a little to clunky and felt like they might fall out sometimes, but the LinkBuds S fit great while also feeling secure.  The texture of the buds themselves is almost a little scratchy, which took me a little while to get used to, but I think I prefer this texture for touch sensitivity.  For me though, I have always preferred the press-able buttons on the Klipsch T5 IIs over all of these touch sensors, partly because I often wear a headband over the earbuds and a sweaty headband can mess with the touch sensors sometimes.<br/><br/>Calls – This is probably the best overall feature of these earbuds.  The microphone quality seemed to be the best out of all the earbuds when testing out on my friend's equipment, and in real-world testing I experienced similar results.  These were either the best sounding, or a close second best when compared to other earbuds when making calls.  These sounded the best in almost every environment, maybe tied for best with Klipsch in noisy/windy environments.<br/><br/>Water Resistance - These have the same IPX4 rating as most of the other earbuds, but note that the Galaxy Buds Pro have a superior IPX7 rating, if that matters to you.  So far these have been working great for exercise, but again personally I prefer more headband-friendly designs sometimes.<br/><br/>Charging/etc:  These charge at about the same speed as the other earbuds, and have a similar battery life.  The BIG difference is that these don't support wireless charging, which seems odd at this price range.  These come with a short 9 inch usb-A to usb-C cable in the box, no plug/brick.  This is my least favorite in terms of charging options compared to the other earbuds in this price range.<br/><br/>OVERALL:  These are solid earbuds that feel great, produce good sound, have good ANC, and have excellent microphones for great call quality.  They do just about everything well, but at this current price I can't say that they are my favorite, or even the best value.  Overall my favorites are probably still the Klipsch T5 IIs, which are currently less expensive than these LinkBuds S earbuds at the time I'm writing this.  My second favorite would either be the Galaxy Pros or the Airpod Pros, both of which are slightly less expensive and produce slightly better sound in my opinion.  The only thing these LinkBuds S are the best at seems to be the mic/call quality, but even then the difference there isn't big enough for me to recommend choosing them overall.  Personally I'm sticking with my Klipsch T5 IIs for regular use, but if you are a diehard Apple user, I would have recommend the Airpods Pro over these LinkBuds S at the current prices.  If these drop in price in the future and are competitively priced with some of the other options, then they might be a good choice; especially if switching back and forth between ecosystems is important to you and you don't mind the lack of wireless charging.</span>

<span>Linkbuds S I am using are connected to my PC, android phone and iphone. They are very easy to switch between three devices. On PC I use it for Teams. These sounds very natural for calling and never notcied any disruption. I did reset these few times due to some connection issues when I paired these multiple times to same phone but they working very well. Noise cancellation and transparency mode are very good.<br/><br/>I feel they lack the support to stay connected with two devices at the same time. They are still the best.</span>

<span>I gave it a good rating because the vendor was excellent. I do love how they fit and feel. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the right side to work so the vendor immediately refunded me. I also noticed that the volume didn't seem that great. I even purchased another reconditioned set, and they work fine but again the volume just isn't that great. I bought them to wear while motorcycle riding and I don't think they will be loud enough. For around the house though they seem sufficient.</span>

<span>after having these for a couple months i want to gift them to all my close friends and family!! they are great!!<br/><br/>occasionally they blip out for a half a second and whatevers playing goes silent. initially you think the music is stopping for an incoming call but the music quickly starts playing again..<br/><br/>sometimes when i pop one earbud in after being in the charger case for a couple hrs it will announce the battery status and every once in a while it says the battery is at like 50% or a low amount when its actually been charging for the last while. once i go onto the app it correctly displays the battery level..<br/><br/>the voice activation features only work when the app is connected. so when you pull the headphone out of the case and put it in your ear it will automatically connect and if somethings playing on your phone it will pickup and continue playing through the earbud.... all that being said if you dont physically open up the app and let the software auto connect on the phone app then the "Hello Skullcandy" wont work. the app pairing can sometimes take 3-7 seconds..<br/><br/>the over ear plastic part of headphone that holds in the bud is not moldable or customizable it is a set dimension and will morph back to that set shape. personally i like this as im used to the way it slides over my ear and can put them on easily.<br/><br/>something over looked is the ease of installation of a earphone with your non dominant hand. these require a hook, slide, and twist motion to get them over your ear and locked in<br/><br/>these could be like 20% louder and that would be awesome for highway rides in an old pickup while listening to a podcast conversation<br/><br/>9.7/10 satisfied with purchase. have recommended to a handful of people already and next christmas a select few of my associates will be receiving these as a gift from me personally.<br/><br/>JAWZ</span>

<span>I don't write many reviews. For this product, and it's relatively high cost, I felt I should inform others of my experience with the Push Active True earbuds.<br/><br/>I've been buying SkullCandy products for 11 years now, they're my go to company for affordable audio. This is their first product I've been 'meh' about though. They just don't have that standard 'oomph' I'm used to, and I find myself turning my phone's audio to near max levels to hear clearly the same songs that come across quite well on my JBL earbuds of a similar design style. Even after playing around with the equalizer option in the SkullCandy app, my earbuds just don't get where I need them to go.<br/><br/>I bought these things for the battery life, so I could use them on-shift to listen to music and audio books without worrying about recharging mid-shift. In retrospect, I fear I'll only be using them to listen to audio books or podcasts though, because they just don't do my music playlists justice. Ah well. They're not bad, they're just not worth the cost in my mind.</span>

<span>For the most part these wireless earbuds are great, I do love the sound quality and the connectivity and the fact it has an awareness setting where you can listen to your music or podcasts and also be aware of your surroundings, that is very helpful when riding my bike or Im at work and need to be more aware. The only things I do not like is having to have the Skullcandy app open if I want the voice control to work, also the voice control does not always work right sometimes you have to close out of the app and re-open it in order to get it to work, and it has a mind of its own sometimes, Otherwise these are a very good product I will continue to use! Until I find something better eventually.</span>

<span>I had given my older iPhone earbuds to my Grandson and didn’t want to pay the cost for a new pair, so someone suggested these earbuds and they have been great. They stay snug in my ears, have great sound and we’re a great value for the money. We recently went to Europe and used them on the plane, connecting them through a transmitter. While they were not as good as an over the ear headphones for noise canceling, they were very adequate. I would recommend.</span>

<span>I bought these earbuds for listening to audiobooks while working or cleaning. I use them almost daily for that and I am happy. The sound quality is perfectly good for what I'm doing, but would be a little disappointed if my main purpose for the earbuds was to listen to music for any length of time. The earbuds and the case charge quickly. I have charged the earbuds 3 times without charging the case, I haven't tried for more times, but the case hasn't lost complete power for me yet.</span>

<span>Haven't had them long, but good product and I was happy with the sound, especially for the price.  I can also say, they are  - by far, the best fitting ear phones i have owned.  I need the ear, wrap around piece and cant wear normal buds (they fall out), but with the wrap around, they actually fit my ear perfectly.  Battery life seems great, i haven't had to charge the case yet.  I dont use them for calls, not sure if they work good.  Besides that, definitely endorse them...</span>

<span>These headphones are comfortable to wear. They stay in place well. Great sound quality for an affordable price. My only complaint is the touch control surface is made from a material that coming into contact with produces a sound and feeling that makes my soul cringe. It’s a personal texture problem that in no way reduces the performance of the headphones. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone with an active lifestyle. The battery life and ease of charging is amazing and helps complete this five star review.</span>

<span>Little noise canceling. These earbuds constantly fall out of your ears. I've tried every size bud. I get frustrated when I'm in the middle of something messy my hands are icky or wet and my earbuds slightly fall out so it stops playing whatever I'm trying to listen to. Then when I try to push them back in, they fall out completely. I cannot eat anything or talk because it loosens them and they turn off. Frustrating.</span>

The sound is crisp and clear! I didn't rate the battery life because I just got them. I purchased the 3 year warranty just in case something happens to them. I would recommend the warranty because my old ear buds (different brand) quit playing sound loud after 2 years. They also fit perfectly and don't fall out. Very comfortable to wear! This is a great buy! Especially for the price! I only paid $42.59.  That includes tax and a 3 yr. warranty! I'm extremely happy with my purchase!!!</span>
