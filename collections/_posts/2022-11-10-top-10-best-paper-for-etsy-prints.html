Strathmore Inkjet Paper- Inkjet paper is the ideal surfaces for reproducing artwork, photographs and craft projects using today's technology. These high quality inkjet papers produce excellent results in desktop inkjet printers.

<span>Have been looking for a textured paper to reproduce original watercolors that I paint on textured cold press paper and then scan. This paper seems decent though not truly fine-art quality. For sending out greeting cards with a pleasant texture it is probably fine and economical. At first I got pretty bad results blotchy and gray instead of blacks, but I believe I had printed the first examples on the wrong side of the paper. It is not marked.  Looking at the package I tried printing with the side up that faces the top or front side of the package. The texture does look different on the different sides. The back side looks more indented like with tiny golf ball dimples. The front texture looks a little artificial and not really like any natural cold press WC paper I've seen. This is undoubtedly a regular cellulose paper that has been embossed. At any rate, after I got the right side it looked much better with okay dark density and slightly soft definition.  The weight is slightly heavier than Epson Matte Double sided which has been my default smooth inkjet paper for art and matte photos. It feels a bit stiffer. I print using an Epson r2880 with matte black ink, using the preset for Velvet Fine Art paper, as well as the Watercolor Paper - Radiant White preset. About the same.<br/><br/>Next time I send out holiday cards this might be a good choice without breaking the bank. Not sure what else I'll use it for.</span>

<span>I've always used Epson Velvet Fine Art paper for all of my illustration prints, but wanted to try the Strathmore paper just to see the difference. It's an ok paper for printing artwork that you might be framing for use at home or maybe for a gift. But if you are going to be selling prints of your work, you may want to test the paper first. I was not happy with the texture. And I understand they market it as TEXTURE, but man, it's a lot of texture. More than I thought it would be. It's just to much, even more so that the paper I use for my actual artwork. It is acid free, but it's not archival. So if you are selling giclee prints, this is definitely not the paper for you. The actual printing on the paper is fine. And probably would be okay if you are filling the whole area, but I felt that it takes away from the artwork if it is visible in the negative space.<br/><br/>To me, it's just okay. I'm going to hold on to it for personal projects, etc, but will not print on it for items I sell.<br/><br/>Happy printing!</span>

<span>I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Epson Velvet Fine Art paper. I have an Epson Eco Tank ET-2760. I've found that Epson paper works best for colors on it. The photo shows the difference between regular 60 lb cardstock, Epson presentation paper, Strathmore, and the velvet fine art. Personally, the colors were washed out on the Strathmore no matter what side I printed on and no matter what the print was of- this is watercolor, but a digital image was not any better.  The print wasn't very crisp, but I didn't really expect anything to be once I saw the texture. The texture is ok, but the ridges are rather far apart (I'd expected it to have tighter or closer ridges- see picture). It's 80lb but it feels about the same to me as the 60lb normal cardstock I used (it's slightly stiffer but doesn't really feel like the 80lb I've used in the past). Overall not bad paper, but not for what I need.</span>

Newsprint is an ideal choice for practice drawing, sketching, printing and many other art projects. The color of this paper is a traditional off-white newsprint.

<span>This review is for the product listed as "Sax Plain White Newsprint Newspaper - 6 x 9 inches - Pack of 500 Sheets - White". When I check this product again, it finally dipped down to lovable pricing ($3.02!!) but the supplier has changed. Please keep this in mind. Product is now listed as "School Smart Newsprint Drawing Paper, 30 lb, 6 x 9 Inches, 500 Sheets". Still around half a penny per sheet. Great deal, I will buy it again.<br/><br/>At less than half a penny per sheet (I bought these for $2.32 + Free Shipping) this paper is hard to beat. Not the best if you're planning on drawing and then subsequently saving these for extended periods of time, or for using wet medium. If you are using this for art at all, this is strictly for practice. Keep in mind this is newsprint. It will probably yellow and fade, like newsprint does. But I wouldn't know for sure, I haven't waited that long to find out yet. Anyway, there's something liberating about drawing on cheap paper that will expire. I don't feel afraid to draw terribly, and I don't freeze after completing a "good" drawing. Just keep on drawing for the sake of mileage, baby! Buy two of these and draw 3 pages a day, and it will cost you $5 the entire year. Insane!</span>

<span>WARNING: I am a paper-holic. I like getting different kinds of papers for different uses &amp; this is exactly what it says: newsprint. Just like blank newspaper paper :-) If you are searching for a specific type of paper &amp; for specific use like I have been the past couple of weeks, read on.<br/><br/>Until I find some affordable 52 GSM paper, I wanted something very thin to take notes on that I can slip into my Bible and other books without being too thick. This is perfect for that.<br/><br/> It's great for kids to draw on with crayon, pen and, pencil (not too sharp).<br/><br/>A regular old standard ink pen works well on it. The paper is very soft and smooth.<br/><br/>Don't get this wet. I can get it slightly damp (just slightly) and it's okay. Water would turn this back to pulp.<br/><br/>I was able to punch holes in this for my notebook and it did fine. Cutting it was okay as long as I did small amounts so that the paper stayed even.<br/><br/>I even attempted sewing this and it does take thread well enough - if you want to make booklets for kids or notes, etc.<br/><br/>This is a great paper for someone who likes to write on soft paper, take lots of notes, doodly (not with wet ink/markers though!), or has kids that like scribbling and art. You can see in a couple of the photos that a regular highlighting marker is okay on the paper &amp; doesn't show through the other side unless held up to a light,<br/><br/>The best thing about this is that it is really easy to recycled or dispose of without taking up a lot of room.<br/>I have not tried running it through my printer yet but that's next. I think that it would be cool to print out my own doodlings.<br/><br/>I am sure now that you know way more than you wanted about this paper, but I can't be the only one who likes details! LOL</span>

<span>I really like this paper. It makes my art look beautiful. Colors are vibrant and true to the digital version. It IS a little thin though, and feels like thin cardstock. If you want sturdier art prints, you'll want to find something thicker.<br/><br/>Be very careful which side your print on though! The package says "The whiter side is the printing side," but both sides are almost identical in color. I couldn't tell the difference between the two even in good light. I thought the smoother side would be the printing side, but soon found out that I was wrong and wasted a LOT of paper. The ROUGH side is the printing side, NOT the smooth side. Don't make my same mistake ;-;<br/><br/>TIP: if your Epson printer doesn't have a dedicated setting for presentation paper, set it to Premium Matte. if you don't the colors come out weird!</span>

<span>Got one of the ecotank printers so i can finally stop buying ink cartridges every couple weeks. I really like the big tanks on the printers as they are handy if you like printing lots of photos like I do. I've tried the cheap no name paper and never really liked them. Also tried the thinner cheaper name brand paper and didn't like the way they felt. This paper is thick enough and the quality is high enough that it will actually feel like photos you have printed at the stores.

It's very convenient, the pack was at a great price, and with 100 sheets, I think this will last me some time before I need to buy more. The photo sheet also arrived super-fast and two days earlier than expected (3 days in total). I also really appreciate it comes with instructions on how to print and how to take care of the paper so the photo doesn't get ruined. All in all, I'm super happy with this purchase.</span>

<span>My only gripe is that the paper surface delaminates when using masking tape.  I have not had this problem with Strathmore 400 series paper.  Other than that, the two preform about the same.  It holds a reasonable amount of water, and stands up to some scrubbing.  It buckles about as much as other 140 lb paper in the price range (It's certainly not as good as Arches, but that's in a whole different league)<br/><br/>Normally I tape all four sides of my paper down because it creates a nice boarder on the post card, and prevents buckling.  With this paper that's not really an option because it rips no matter how careful I am or what angle I pull at.</span>
