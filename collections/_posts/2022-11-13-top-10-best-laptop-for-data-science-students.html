<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>I was looking for a replacement computer gift with decent modern specs and this one had hit all of the right buttons. Good brand, good parts, great price, no catches.<br/><br/>Naturally everything is going to be a lower powered variant. It is an ultrabook after all. But as an upgrade from a 6 year old gaming laptop it certainly decimates that in performance. When I look at comparative modern laptops with 3050's in them they seem to be more expensive with less features (8GB RAM, smaller drives, overheating issues). They just don't make as much sense. Plus, LPDDR4 turns out to be actually more of an advantage if you really want optimized power draw overall.<br/><br/>For regular use this ultrabook balances that power draw with meeting your performance demands. It starts up in seconds (especially on an upgraded 2TB SSD). Another reviewer of the same model said it has 2 slots but I only saw one when opening it and in the documentation. I very much hope I jam completely wrong and just missed it so I can add more storage, but you should only expect 1 slot to use.<br/><br/>For gaming, it can basically run everything to date. Not necessarily on ultra unless it's older titles but surprisingly reasonably given the 3050 ti and high core AMD CPU. The fans are louder doing Windows updates than with playing. Just make sure you have your applications (including productivity like graphics software) set in your NVIDIA control panel to use the NVIDIA processor option. You may have to manually set some things that way to avoid using the APU.<br/><br/>The only real downside to it is the lack of ports. You'll end up using a hub if you need more peripherals, unless you have a fancy unified dongle. But if you're using those higher end products then you're probably not buying this computer to be fair.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't know why Acer is selling this for so cheap (It's varied for the past few months from $750-$800 full retail) but I'm grateful that they are. Easy 5/5 value.</span>

<span>After several months as a daily driver I am separating my way with Swift X. List of malfortunate issues follows:<br/><br/>The very first automatic windows update, after I bought this laptop, was not successful and I had to force windows 10 21h2 installation from the Microsoft website. After that automatic updates worked well although I did not accept Win 11 update.<br/><br/>Acer update tool never found anything to update even though windows update had optional updates for wifi and bios.<br/><br/>Bios update made a total mess since it cross linked and effectively lost boot partition. I have added second ssd from the beginning  and that one had UEFI partition as well since it was a Windows boot drive in my previous laptop. It took me two hours to figure out what happened and to transfer boot files to a proper UEFI partition. When I think now it was probably a reason why windows update had problems from the begining.<br/><br/>Next big issue is a wifi card. Every two to three weeks wifi card becomes invisible to Windows and only way to bring it back is to click on the reset on the back of the laptop. Yes, there is a pinhole button at the back that apparently disconnects BIOS battery and after that all comes back fine. I did not see pinhole reset on any recent laptop or probably ever, and was thinking interesting engineering but did not think I will use it regularly.<br/><br/>Fingerprint scanner becomes unresponsive from time to time, you can see an exclamation mark in Device manager and you need to uninstall and scan for changes so fingerprint reader works again.<br/><br/>Lately laptop does not want to go to sleep mode, I close the lid and can hear the fan coming on and off preventing me from sleeping at the night. Ridiculous but this is not Acer specific issues, previous Asus Zenbook did even worse - it would go to sleep mode only to discover that it actually force restart windows next morning when<br/>I open the lid.<br/><br/>On battery power this laptop can run for a very long time, easily over 10 hours, however  numbers that Windows shows sometimes are ridiculous. I have screenshots where windows estimates 100+ hours, then 3 hours later and 30% less battery still gives 90+ hours. Totally amateur calculations, but more of a issue is that on a battery power laptop does not even turn off screen when using the same workload as plugged in, mostly Excel, and of course not always, but more than 50% of time.<br/><br/>There is a noticable sound lag when using internal laptop speakers. Extremely annoying, but when you connect headphones there is no lag at all.<br/><br/>I was not a fan of keyboard from the first touch - too mushy, and keyboard layout was wrong for me, especially small and crowdy arrow keys plus page up/down missing and combination for home end with multiple keystrokes. Ok, I kind of like when different manufacturers offer different laptop keyboard layouts, you know, it is good for your brain to learn and remember new combinations, but only if it is an ergonomic experience, which is not here.<br/><br/>I am still giving 3 stars for Swift X since power is there, ryzen 5800u is very usable, size and weight are quite good, although appearance is kind an old fashion, storage includes second ssd, screen is good, 3050ti is surprisingly powerful, I tried VR mixed reality and it was just fine... until today I got BSOD, which I did not have in years, after chrome did not want to play videos across YouTube, Facebook and any other web page.<br/><br/>And that was it, too many important information I cannot afford to loose...</span>

<span>This is by far one of the best Windows laptops I have ever owned. It came with minimal bloatware (much of which I cleaned up upon receiving the laptop) and the memory and processor performance of my personal laptop keep up with high loads: multiple virtual machines running, WSL running Linux, Firefox, VSCode, Spotify, Teams and Outlook run almost constantly on my laptop with no gaps in work or delays from loading.<br/><br/>I originally intended to make a lot of use of the RTX 3050Ti that's in this laptop, but I have yet to put it through the ringer with synthetics or processing loads. I have no doubt it runs rather well, as I have connected numerous displays to the laptop using USB-C and USB 3.0 and found no issues.<br/><br/>There are a couple things I should mention about the laptop that aren't really cons, at least not for me. The keyboard is a general chiclet style keyboard, the same you find on most laptops these days. Surprisingly, the keys have a bit of travel and tactile feedback for a chiclet keyboard, so they are fine for the coffee shop or on-the-road. Key brightness is minimal, it would be useless in sunlight anyway. The screen does not get tremendously bright, but I have used it in direct Florida sunlight without issue. The mousepad is a bit frustrating at times, but it is hardly different from most laptops on the market. It functions well and has a wide plane for my larger hands. The fingerprint reader is nice, I hardly use it. Camera is good for a laptop, it isn't an amazing quality, but for business meetings and talking with friends it will be more than enough.<br/><br/>There is an HDMI port, one USB-C port, and one USB 3.0 (with power delivery) port on the left. One more USB 3.0 port on the right along with a 3.5 jack for headphones or a headset. You can charge the laptop with the USB-C port, but make sure your charger or the USB-C hub can deliver 90W of power to match the stock power supply. Less than that and you may see your battery decrease under a reasonable load. I do recommend getting a USB-C charger as the included power supply connector is tiny and seems like a single fall away from the shaft breaking off.<br/><br/>I would 100% recommend this laptop for someone who does a lot of computer work, maybe not a gaming machine but it will at least code games and test them without issues. You could probably play some recent AAA titles on lower settings.</span>

<span>Jack of all trades laptop that does everything pretty well. Ill go over some of the important categories in detail. I did end up returning this laptop for reasons Ill mention but it is a good device overall.<br/><br/>Build Quality -<br/>Build quality is good overall with metal construction and not too much flex on the chassis or lid of the laptop. It has some upgradability with a second, empty m.2 drive slot. Which is pretty nice since you can expand on the original 512gb SSD without having to replace it. The RAM is soldered onto the board and, therefore, cannot be changed. 16GB should be enough for most cases, but again, with them marketing towards creators the option to expand past 16GB may have been nice even if only a single so-dimm slot was accessible like in the Asus g14 for example.<br/><br/>I/O -<br/>I/O is solid for a 14 inch laptop with it housing 2 USB type As, 1 USB 3.2 type C (charging capable), a mic/headphone combo jack, and an HDMI port. Though for a device marketed as a "Creator Laptop" Id have expected either a full size or at least micro sd card reader.<br/><br/>Keyboard/Touch pad -<br/>The keyboard provides a nice typing experience. Though the keys are a little mushy for my liking.<br/>The touch pad is also very solid with a smooth surface and accurate tracking. Could be a little larger possibly but is fine for the size of the laptop.<br/><br/>Battery Life-<br/>Battery life is pretty good for this segment. Could probably find better at a similar price but given the hardware in this laptop it is plenty good I'd say. I was generally reaching around 7-9 hours at 50% brightness and with background apps disabled. Usually while web browsing, watching videos, and coding in Visual Studio. Make sure to turn off one drive syncing though as its on by default and drastically lowers battery life.<br/><br/>Display -<br/>The Display is both a pro and a con for me. It is very bright and color accurate but it is not very good for gaming. Now this is not a gaming laptop so i was not expecting a high refresh rate display or anything along those lines. What I was not expecting was to be so impacted by the high response time of the display. Every game I played experienced ghosting and was generally not very responsive. It ended up being a deal breaker for me as, while I bought this for university primarily, gaming is an important 2nd use case for me. The performance is not the problem as ill touch on shortly, but the screen hinders the gaming experience too heavily for me. This is a subjective opinion as I am sure it wont be a problem for most and it may have to do with the fact that I have always had a high refresh rate display on both laptop and desktop for the past few years but its an issue for me nonetheless.<br/><br/>Performance -<br/>Performance is great for the price and size of the laptop. My model was equipped with the R7 5800u + 3050ti. This combo could handle pretty much any workload I threw at it. I never completely stressed the 8 cores and 16 threads the CPU had to offer but I did not experience slowdown when coding in visual studio or when I had a large amount of chrome tabs open. I am not a content creator but I would imagine this hardware combined with the color accurate display would make it a great fit for any kind of photo or video work, as it should given its advertised towards this use case. For the gaming side, the 3050ti in this thing is only a 40w part but its no slouch. Easily beating out integrated graphics or the underwhelming MX line of dedicated GPUs from Nvidia. There wasnt a single game I tried that was unplayable. Even cyberpunk can hit 60fps with DLSS. The most graphically intensive game I consistently play at the moment is Battlefield V which will run at a steady 60fps on medium or 50-60fps on high with some dips. The 3050ti in here seems to be on par with a full wattage GTX 1650ti while trading some blows here and there from what I have seen. Again, certainly not a gaming laptop, especially given the screen, but it is more than capable of allowing you to play pretty much any game in your library at some level of settings. Pretty impressive for a laptop with this combination of price and portability.<br/><br/>Thermals/Acoustics  -<br/>Thermals are a strong point of this laptop. Unlike full fledged gaming laptops, the 3050ti in here is a bit easier to handle. As such, this laptop running only a single fan. While the CPU can run a little toasty from time to time it will usually spike then drop to a more comfortable operating temperature. Seemingly up to around 95C then settling in the low to mid 80s in my testing. The GPU stays pretty cool at all times, even when being maxed out. Thankfully, due to that single fan, even under load the laptop does not get very loud. I did not test the exact decibel count but its quiet enough to where I could play a game without worrying about putting on headphones as opposed to a traditional gaming laptop where eventually jet engine mode activates. That said, when installing programs and doing some other seemingly mundane tasks that can put a little stress on the CPU, the fans will spike which can be annoying.<br/><br/>Closing Thoughts -<br/>Overall I really liked this machine. It offered good performance, battery life and build quality for a good price. The display ended up being a deal breaker because gaming is too high of a priority for me to compromise in that area. Which this laptop showed me honestly as I was not expecting it to be something I found to be such a problem. All that said, it probably wont be an issue for most and if it sounds like it would be to you Id recommend looking elsewhere.  Otherwise this is a great option for pretty much anyone looking for a good all around device in this price range.</span>

<span>I bought this replace my laptop from 2016 which suddenly died. It was a great Dell laptop and cost half the price, but I figured it'd be worth it. I only use my laptop to watch youtube/netflix, and just browse the web. So I figured at $600 this would be more than enough, but it's been more of a hastle.<br/><br/>Firstly, the fan is pretty loud, and randomly revs up pretty significantly when I'm doing nothing more than watching a youtube video and scrolling thru reddit. It sounds like it's powering a small generator, and after awhile I have to shut if off because I'm afraid it'll over-heat.<br/><br/>Secondly, for no reason at all, it randomly restarts itself. In the weeks I've had it, its done this half a dozen times. No warning, no error message before OR after. The screen just goes black, restarts itself, and you're back at the startup screen, whatever you were doing now gone. It just did this now, which prompted me to write this review.<br/><br/>With everything going on, it's almost impossible to find another laptop without having to search for EXACTLY what you need, then wait for it to ship and HOPE its what you need. Too complicated to return, and not worth "repairing", I'm stuck with this $600 placeholder.  I just don't understand how this 2020 laptop at double the price is WAY WORSE than my old 2016 Dell, which never had fan or restarting issues. Buy at your own risk.<br/><br/>UPDATE 6-18-20, 5 days after the return windows closed, my laptop is now a $600 paperweight.  Suddenly, the Wi-Fi stopped working or detecting any networks. I googled it an apparently it's a common problem. No fix at home, I took it to a pc repair shop where the guy told me there's nothing he can do and I should return it, which is now impossible since the return Windows closed 5 days ago. The laptop has NO Ethernet port, so it's WI-FI only, which is now busted so no way to download or try to update or fix it online. Now I have to deal with the manufacturer and hope they can fix or replace it.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, just over 30 days and it's bricked. $600 down the drain.<br/><br/>edit: 8-24-21, this POS is worse than ever, basically unusable. forget about ever worrying about A.I. taking over, because if this is what we have in 2021, there's no possible threat. I'd burn this thing if it didn't damage the environment.<br/><br/>edit almost june 2022 - POS is bricked, dead. pathetic computer, all I EVER did was watch netflix and surf sites like tmz and reddit, I never even MOVE it from where it permanently sits, hooked up to my t.v. HP needs to go out of business, what was once a AAA brand is now clearance-bin garbage.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY ANY HP PRODUCTS. Customer service is useless and ppl tend to sell laptops AS IF they're new in box, but they have removed them and messed around with internal settings and put their own cards and hard drives to "upgrade" it but this just VOIDS THE WARRANTY. Better off buying in-store where you can see it's sealed, new in box.</span>

<span>This was a pretty good laptop for the price. The worst thing about it is the silver keys with letters marked in black, those are really hard to see from any angle but straight up. The function keys are extremely difficult to read. That's probably just a poor color choice on my part. It also runs a little hot, that can be a real problem over any fairly long period of time. It's a good backup to have if you make the mistake of buying a Lenovo.</span>

<span>I bought this for my wife, who does e-Bay, Skype calls to family, normal business stuff and no gaming. I was very surprised that it have better performance than I expect for an entry level machine. The screen and keyboard are magnificent.<br/><br/>The only problem I have is that there is no removeable battery. That means that if you are installing a second hard drive there is no way to know if your machine is truly off. If you do that, ignore the instructions and add the additional step of disconnecting the battery cable before you plug in the cable. Welding is not something you want to do in the innards of a new laptop. The laptop is fine, so the design is resilient. We just don't have the use of a second disk drive or the USB connector on the left side.</span>

<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>I'm far from a computer expert. I bought this computer for work because my job requires me to use a couple of different specific software programs. I needed a computer with a lot of storage, a fairly large screen, a numerical keypad, and most importantly, a cheap price tag. This computer has all of those things. I don't do any gaming or anything really sophisticated on it. Just work and some internet browsing. It boots up quickly and has been running smoothly so far. My biggest complaint is that it came with a lot of Microsoft bloatware that I hadn't experienced on my other laptops and by default it uses your Microsoft OneDrive for storage instead of the computer's SSD. The first time I logged onto the computer it asked me to either sign up for a Microsoft account or login to an existing one. My job requires me to take a lot of photos, so I was saving my photos to the computer without realizing it was uploading to my cloud storage account. That was an annoyance because I had to figure out how to switch that off. I unintentionally used up all of my cloud storage space because I didn't realize the system was set up that way. Once I figured out how to fix it, I was good to go. Also, the computer essentially comes in a "safe mode" which limits a lot of what you can do. It is designed for you to only use apps from the Microsoft app store and not download any software from any other source. It can be turned off, but it is another annoyance. I feel like they were trying to make it like their version of a Chromebook, but that makes it just as annoying as a Chromebook. Overall, it is a great computer once you get past all the Microsoft stuff.</span>

<span>This is a Great laptop. I first order another Lenovo, which was defective or something. Because it was so new there were no reviews.  I returned it with no problem.  I thought I didn't need such a high grade laptop. So I decided to get this one, and it's almost half the cost. Im not a gamer on PC, but this also comes with entice gamer pluses, including Xbox promotion time. I periodically watch movies mostly pay bills, read and writing docs. For personal use, I am please with laptop. It is fast, smooth has sufficient memory.  Graphics are great, touch screen works great, and so does touch point, even has backlit. It comes with with windows 11 home, Great for me. I transfer all my docs and pdf, photos, music, and some apps. with Lenovo migration assist, so easily through my wifi. I did buy from Microsoft site, and pdf app, so I can edit and sign forms that only cost me 49.00 one time fee for up to "I think" it was 5 different devices. I would difinately recommend this laptop.  I bought it on the lighting deal last week. Loved the price even more. Thumbs up for this laptop.</span>

<span>I purchased the Ryzen 5 16gb/256gb variant.<br/><br/>I wish I had gotten the variant with more storage (1tb instead of 256gb)... although if I choose to upgrade, I can do it myself since theoretically the M.2 NVMe SSD is able to be replaced.<br/><br/>Came with laptop, 65w PD charger, and stylus with AAAA battery. I purchased two accessories (listed at end of review)<br/><br/>One USB C port: Supports PD charging up to 65w (charger included but you can use your own if it supports PD) and data transfer at 2.0 speeds.<br/><br/>Two USB A ports: both support 3.2 speed, one of them has constant power (intended for charging other devices when laptop is off).<br/><br/>One audio jack: headphones out and microphone in use the same port. Plugging in regular headphones is just as normal, no adapters needed.<br/><br/>The side mounted power button is hard to hit but you will rarely use it. Even after being shut down, it will turn back on when you open it.<br/><br/>Fingerprint reader is quick to recognize your fingerprint. Unlocking the computer after startup is extremely quick.<br/><br/>Touchpad is very responsive and features the same tricks we use on our phones (i.e. double tap, scrolling, ect.) For examples on the gestures you can use, search "touchpad gestures".<br/><br/>The screen is bright. Using it in a classroom, office, or outside in the shade is great. Direct sunlight is where it becomes hard to read.<br/><br/>The screen folds all the way back. You can use it in any position. Once folded, it will orient itself to the way you're holding it. Think of how your phone automatically changes it's orientation if you rotate it.<br/><br/>Webcam is decent. I love the privacy slide cover it has. With this I always know that the camera is covered.<br/><br/>Keyboard is normal. It's a laptop keyboard. Clicky but spongy.<br/><br/>Battery life is normal for a laptop of this size. Whatever the advertisement says is probably true. I've never tested it because I always have it plugged in.<br/><br/>GAMING: It can game. I have successfully played Valorant, Fortnite, and Minecraft. It can do it, but don't expect 1080p at 60fps unless you turn down the games performance.<br/><br/>Notes: I purchased these accessories:<br/><br/>1. A screen protector called: "Spigen Tempered Glass ... (81X20005US)"<br/><br/>2. A case called: "mCover case ... /5-14ALC05/"<br/><br/>3. And put clear tape over the palm rests.</span>

<span>After several months of use, this laptop has taken all I've thrown at it, and has done well. The touch screen is quite responsive, and works well. This is a great laptop for working, browsing, general use. I love the yoga features, tenting the laptop for videos, or sharing view, etc. It's a bit large and heavy for use as a tablet, but it does work, and would probably be better for people with larger hands. The battery life is adequate, and I'm happy with it for my usage.</span>

<span>I have only had this laptop for about a month.  Overall, I really like it so far and have had no trouble transitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 11, although I don't give this machine a lot of tasks; it's my travel computer and my bedside companion.<br/><br/>I did have a concern about the battery charging, though, and I want to alert people to the issue. If you don't want to read this review any further, just please remember to keep the Lenovo Vantage software on your computer in case you need it.<br/><br/>First, the laptop ships with a charger that is a small brick with a cable that has a three-prong wall plug and another cable that connects to the USB-C port on  the laptop.  I used the charger and the battery charged up to 100% with no problems.  I had my battery set to "Battery Saver" in the Windows 11 system settings.<br/><br/>The laptop does have the older type of round charging port, but you have to buy a separate charger to use it.  So that's what I did; I went to the Lenovo site and bought that charger---which by the way, is not too lightweight itself, but at least it's more manageable for use on trains and such, and it has the two-prong wall plug.<br/><br/>So last night, I decided I had better make sure the additional (travel) charger worked okay.  I noticed, though, that my battery was only charging up to 60% of capacity.  The charger was powering the machine, but the battery wasn't filling up.  I thought maybe the charger was defective.  At that point I switched to the charger that came with the laptop, but with that charger, also, the battery wasn't charging beyond 60%!  Oh, no!  At that point, I thought my laptop must be a lemon.  I downloaded an additional software from the Lenovo site, Lenovo Diagnostic Tool, and ran a test on the battery.  The battery test failed!<br/><br/>I remembered that another Amazon customer who had reviewed this laptop had complained that he couldn't charge his battery beyond 60%.  A Lenovo representative responded something about a setting that prevented full loading of the battery to extend battery life if the laptop is kept plugged in.  I looked for that setting in the Windows battery settings, and changed my Power Mode setting to Best Performance, but that didn't help.  I could find nowhere in the Windows Settings to get the battery to charge more fully.<br/><br/>Eventually, I looked in the Lenovo Vantage software, under More Settings, and found that my machine had been set (not be me, I swear) to Conservation Mode.  This setting is only in the Lenovo Vantage software, and is NOT the same as Battery Saver in the Windows settings.  Once I changed my laptop from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charger in Lenovo Vantage, my battery started charging again.<br/><br/>The purpose of Conservation Mode is to conserve the life of the battery if the laptop is continually kept plugged in.  Because that's how I use the laptop, I will continue to use Conservation Mode, but will try to remember to switch to Rapid Charge mode if I want to take the laptop to another location without taking along a charger.<br/><br/>I suspected that the travel charger I purchased separately had somehow triggered the computer to convert from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charge, but that is not the case.  If the computer is in Rapid Charge mode, either charger will charge the battery to 100%.  If the battery has a charge of less than 60%, and the computer is in Conservation Mode, either charger will charge it to 60%.  If the battery has a charge of between 60% and 100%, the computer is then put into Conservation Mode and plugged into either charger, the computer will be powered by the charger but the battery will not be further charged.<br/><br/>I hope this review is helpful.</span>

<span>I bought a used one and it has been perfect so far. Cold boots in 10 seconds. It weighs half of what my old 12" laptop weighs. The backlit keys are easily readable without turning on any room lights. Battery life is awesome. I love it!<br/><br/>Edit 8/22/2022 - Everything is going great with this laptop. I'm having a little problem with how sensitive the touchpad is. As far as I can tell there's no way to make it less sensitive. Any accidental touch will make something happen that you might not have wanted. I just have to remember to keep my hands away from it when not needed. The keyboard is easy to read at night with the backlight on. During the day it's best to turn the backlight off with the F8 key to get the best readability.<br/><br/>Edit 10/13/2022 - I love it!</span>

<span>While it has a USB-C port, it did NOT come with a USB -C charger--just the big bulky plugin barrel charger. You will need to buy a separate 65W UBC-C charger if you don't want to lug around the traditional brick charger.<br/><br/>Laptop is thin and light, yet feels sturdy. I haven't experienced the fan noise. Can confirm the speakers are very weak--just don't get loud enough. Screen is big (minimum bevel) bright, and crisp. There was some bloatware installed but easily removed. It's almost a blue-grey color. Fingerprint logon is super convenient.<br/><br/>So far so good!

<span>As a relatively inexpensive and light laptop, the Acer Swift 3 is pretty solid. It's not a heavy duty laptop and it isn't going to be a great option for gaming or video editing or anything that requires a lot of processing power, but as a general purpose laptop for surfing the web or watching YouTube videos it's going to be perfectly functional.<br/><br/>It weighs in around 2.6-2.8lbs (my scale isn't very precise and the reading fluctuated between the two after several tries), which makes it quite easy to carry around without feeling weighed down. The construction feels about what I would expect for a computer in this price range, which is to say it's not top quality but it's not flimsy either. The keyboard is not overly clicky, although it is a bit louder than i would like. I am generally not a fan of laptop keyboards as I prefer a bit more responsiveness but all things considered it's not bad. The backlighting on the keyboard works well.<br/><br/>The Cinebench score was a rather pedestrian 5000. But regardless of benchmarks, I have found it works perfectly well for my everyday needs. I can have a full-screen video running on one screen while surfing the web on another with no lag or hiccups. I keep several programs open all the time (including Chrome which is a serious memory hog) and the laptop doesn't have any performance issues. Considering the price point I am very satisfied with its performance.<br/><br/>The one negative about the setup is that the RAM cannot be upgraded (I got 8gb and wanted 16gb but wasn't going to pay the ridiculous cost difference to buy it pre-installed).  I also would have liked 1 more usb port, but 2 is pretty standard so it's not something I would hold against it. Overall I am very satisfied with this laptop. If you don't carry your laptop around very much you might consider looking around for other options because there are probably other more performant options around this price range at the cost of more weight. But if you want a portable, inexpensive laptop that performs well on common everyday tasks then this is a great choice.</span>

<span>Overall, this is a great laptop for its intended purpose, but DO NOT ORDER 64GB!!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The OS takes around 20-30GB (I can't remember specifically how much), default programs (i.e. MS Office) easily eat up another 20GB, and after everything is accounted for you are left with10ish precious GBs remaining--and you'll learn very quickly that whatever you use this thing for will chew right through that space. The Windows updates alone will eat up your GBs, Windows' caching will passively eat up more GBs when you aren't looking, and in less than a year you will be wasting hours deactivating hidden folders, deleting everything you can find, Googling what you can/cannot delete, perpetually slow-loading from a USB stick, and budgeting the remaining GBs between 2-3 programs.<br/><br/>Soon, you won't be able to download Windows updates because you're literally juggling 200MB of HDD space and the system says you don't have enough room to download the next patch. At least you don't have to worry about it sneakily upgrading to Windows 11 one day, because there's literally no room left for it to do so.<br/><br/>And that was to save a trivial amount of money (&lt;$50) on a bigger HDD. I feel pretty stupid for being so stingy now, but at the same time I can't help but blame the manufacturer for not putting a disclaimer that the OS consumes HALF of the HDD, and Windows' default programs eat up *almost* the other half, and realistically you are left with 10GB of HDD space.<br/><br/>Perhaps the other INCREDIBLY annoying thing about Windows 10 is that it will eat up HALF of your RAM just by existing. I never really gave much thought into how much RAM the OS eats up until I found myself staring at Task Manager wondering why Windows 10 needs 4GB of RAM on a laptop that only has 8GB to spare. Absurd. If you can order one with more RAM, then do so, otherwise just know that you'll need to keep this thing running light.<br/><br/>Also, the awesome mousepad with the toggle number pad was super cool, until the poor thing stopped working after several months. It now requires a wireless mouse to function. Oh well. Still not nearly as aggravating as the HDD/RAM situation.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Aside from those issues, for $110 it was a fantastic deal, I would highly recommend it for developers and students who want a light, portable, and simplistic device for text editors and running basic programming projects on. It is preferred by techies who need to move and connect to company devices for troubleshooting, updates, etc., and I think it would be an excellent tool for that job. Obviously, this is not a gaming laptop, and I don't think anyone who buys it is under the impression they'll be running Unreal Engine 5 on it either, but it would totally work for freeware games and simple games that could work on dinosaur computers.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This laptop is a work and school laptop primarily, and it is a wonderful and nifty tool that excels at that role, just be prepared to deal with a broken touchpad potentially, and know that half of your RAM will be eaten up by the OS.<br/><br/>And please, for the love of your sanity, DO NOT ORDER 64GB HDD! Get the larger HDD, you'll severely regret cheaping out on less than a $50 price difference.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop to use as a spare machine in my consulting practice, and also for use with my ham radio hobby. When I saw the specs on this laptop, followed by the price, I couldn't help but order one. My key requirements were size, weight, and a decent screen. This little machine fits all of those requirements in spades.<br/><br/>I have been more than impressed with the L210's performance and features. While it's definitely not a gaming machine, it's more than adequate for anyone that needs to do web browsing, office apps, and other non CPU- or memory-intensive tasks.<br/><br/>I'll start with the cons:<br/>- 4GB RAM (non-expandable/soldered in, despite Asus page stating otherwise)<br/>- 64GB SSD (easily expandable; I added a 500GB SSD for about $50)<br/>- Just adequate screen resolution (1366x768) - fine for most tasks<br/>- Non-back lit keyboard (even though the product listing says that it is backlit)<br/>- Relatively slow, but adequate Intel Celeron CPU<br/>- Limited USB-C support; cannot charge the laptop via USB-C and it will not support an external USB-C monitor adapter.<br/>- Weird 10-key pad on the touch pad. Enabled via a small button on the touch pad; it's too easy to accidentally turn it on, wreaking havoc when you use the touchpad. No way to permanently disable via BIOS.<br/>- No touch screen, but not surprising given the price point<br/><br/>All of the above were clearly spelled out in the product description, so none of them were a surprise. And several of them were definitely design decisions, in order to keep the cost down and the battery life high.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Amazing battery life. I've been seeing 8-11 hours per charge in normal use<br/>- Super lightweight and small form factor; 2.3 pounds/1.05kg and very thin<br/>- Nice port options. Built-in HDMI, USB-C plus 2 "classic" USB ports<br/>- Expandable hard drive via "M2" SSD stick. Took me about 5 minutes and $50 to expand storage by 500GB<br/>- Very nice keyboard, rivaling much more expensive laptops<br/>- Comes with Windows 10 "S mode", easily upgraded to Windows 10 Home for no charge<br/>- Really great price. I had fully expected to have to buy an unknown branded laptop at this price point. Asus is a great brand with a history of providing good support and high-quality products.<br/><br/>In summary, I'm very pleased with this purchase. It fits the bill for my needs perfectly and has fantastic battery life. It weighs less than my iPad Pro with folio keyboard and runs full Windows 10, including all of the apps that I need it to run.<br/><br/>Of the cons listed above, only the 4GB RAM limitation and the lack of a backlit keyboard are major annoyances. That said, this machine supplies all of the functionality that I need as a backup / travel / ham radio laptop. Since I have other machines for video editing / gaming / etc, I don't need this machine for those tasks.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a nice little laptop for basic office tasks, this is a great choice!<br/><br/>(I forgot to mention that Asus is giving me a 90-day warranty extension in exchange for writing this review.)</span>

<span>First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!<br/><br/>This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.<br/>2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.<br/>3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.<br/>4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.<br/>5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.<br/>6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.<br/>7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been less<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.<br/>2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.</span>

<span>I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it.</span>

<span>This is the only ultra-book I could find with a 64gb ssd, 4gb RAM, weighed only 2 pounds (actually 2.1) and cost $200.  If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this.<br/><br/>The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily.  If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive.  The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs.<br/><br/>I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds.  There is a Micro SD slot.  256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc).  The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded.<br/><br/>WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color.  The USB ports are V 3.x.  The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook.  Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen.<br/><br/>I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability.  The card slot seems a bit flimsy.<br/><br/>I have been unable to get anything near the "whole day" claim on a battery charge.  6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good.<br/><br/>Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful.  Also, Windows 10 is far more versatile than the Chrome OS, in my opinion anyway.</span>

<span>This is the perfect super-portable Linux machine. I can run Dwarf Fortress and Stardew Valley without an issue (at the same time, even). I had some trouble with Wi-Fi drivers installing properly using Manjaro/Arch and gave up before going too far down the rabbit hole. Mint works perfectly using the Xfce edition, and I’ve got i3 windows manager installed next to that and it’s flawless. Drivers seem to work out of the box (with the correct distro at least). Battery life is so good - I’ve never gotten past 50% before my nightly charge.<br/><br/>As a point of pride I didn’t even let it boot to Windows before ripping it out and putting Linux on, so I can’t speak to that, but you definitely get a great bang for your buck running dainty Linux vs resource gobbling Windows. Hard drive is big enough that I didn’t feel the need to get a microsd, though there is a port for one. I still have 33 GiB free after the OS and all of my tools.<br/><br/>No fans to make noise, no moving parts really which is nice if you like it quiet and clean. Despite this the bottom gets only pleasantly warm but nowhere near hot or uncomfortable with a heavy load. It’s very light at about two pounds, and the size is big enough to not feel cramped while still fitting in practically any bag.<br/><br/>There’s plenty of ports despite the small size, and the the inclusion of HDMI is surprising but welcome. The keyboard feels good. The touchpad is fine (though with i3 or similar windows manager I don’t need to use it much). I even got the webcam  and mic to work with out of the box drivers.<br/><br/>The screen is very glossy, but the range of brightness is good and so far I haven’t been too bothered by reflections. Everything is plastic to keep it lightweight. It feels well built, not flimsy. I wouldn’t trust it to hold up to rough handling, but I’m not worried about it jostling about in my book bag.<br/><br/>Overall I couldn’t be happier with the little guy. It’s exactly what I was looking for, and seems like it’ll serve me for years to come.</span>

<span>Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!<br/><br/>This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.<br/><br/>I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.<br/><br/>The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this.<br/><br/>GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!</span>
