<span>I purchased the Hero 5 Black the day it came out.  I have owned GoPro Hero cameras since the company introduced the Hero (first Hero after the 960 model).<br/><br/>From all the reviews and the technical specs, I knew it was going to be basically Hero 4 quality pictures and videos with just a few "convenience" upgrades.  I use my camera for my fishing/boating/kayaking and my interest in the weather.<br/><br/>I've only used it a few times since I purchased it.<br/><br/>I really like the "newer" user interface. In some aspects I like it is waterproof without a housing, but, other ways I feel that it will get more use/wear marks on it now that there is no waterproof case.  The battery and charge port doors are very difficult to get open, but I'm sure that is just because the camera is new.  I don't like the fact I have to turn the camera on, go through setting just to turn on wifi.  The Hero 4 Black wifi could be turned on by itself with the side button.  I don't like the fact there is no way to connect an external battery (such as the battery BacPac)  and keep the camera fully waterproof.  With the GoPro BacPac and third party extended batteries, you changed the waterproof housing back door and that kept the housing waterproof using the extended batteries.<br/><br/>10/17/16 - Update<br/><br/>In my initial thoughts on not being able to connect an external battery source and still keep it completely waterproof may have been a rush in judgement.  The few times I've used it kayaking, I was surprised how long the battery actually lasts.<br/><br/>I definitely like the new "rubberized" feeling the camera has.  It does feel more rugged.<br/><br/>I mainly upgraded from my Hero 4 Black due to the waterproof without housing and the voice control.<br/><br/>103116 - Update<br/><br/>Camera is very finicky and buggy.  I expected this since just about every camera this company has put out was rushed.  The most frustrating thing I've come across is when the Capture App shows I'm recording in one FOV (field of view), i.e., Wide, Medium or Narrow but the actual camera shows its in another field of view mode.  Very confusing/fustrating.  I just updated the camera to the latest firmware, so hopefully that helps.<br/><br/>For how the camera operates right now, I would recommend people to wait until GoPro issues another firmware update or two...which hopefully will fix more bugs.<br/><br/>7/19/17 - Update<br/><br/>Ive been have all kinds of problems with the camera in the last 2 weeks.  This camera has worked perfectly since I bought it in October of last year.<br/><br/>After playing phone tag with GoPro for 3 days...3 days of multiple calls to them and waiting on hold for literally hours, the two people I spoke with told me to re-install the firmware for the 3rd and 4th time.  I did and Hero 5 still isn't working correctly.<br/><br/>Its a shame, since I do really like the Hero 5.<br/><br/>7/20/17 - Update<br/><br/>GoPro ended up replacing the faulty camera.<br/><br/>10/5/17 - Update<br/><br/>The replacement camera started having powering issues and the Wifi problem showed itself on this camera.<br/><br/>I will say that technical support has really improved since my last experience in July.<br/><br/>The camera started having intermittent Wifi issues with my smart phone and GoPros SmartRemote.  The camera started powering itself on and off for no reason.  I'm in the process of getting another replacement camera.  It's nice that GoPro does offer firmware/features updates through the life of each GoPro Hero model...but, it would be nice to get a camera that doesn't fail after a few months.</span>

<span>It must be noted that for the first few days of owning this camera, I considered it a terrible investment due to the issue of the GoPro experiencing problems with the SD card. I was seriously regretting my purchase until I got it figured out, and for that, this product unfortunately loses one star for me because it was a major pain until I got it working correctly. It is something that a user should not have to deal with right out of the box. I will post at the end of this review what I did to correct the issue, and if you're experiencing SD card errors I would expect it will clear your problem up as well.<br/><br/>With THAT out of the way, you can rest assured that this camera is by far one of the best ones your money can buy available on the market today. The image quality while recording at 4K is stunningly beautiful, not to take away from the great quality at 1080P or 720P, as those deserve their due credit too. The sound recording quality is noticeably better when compared to the previous model Hero4 due to the improved microphones in this model. I haven't messed with all the features in this camera yet but so far I think it's an awesome looking, great performing, fantastic little piece of equipment to have in your camera arsenal.<br/><br/>As for the SD card error message displayed after about :10 seconds of recording: I purchased a SanDisk Extreme 32GB UHS-I micro SD card as recommended by GoPro themselves to be a trusted card in their device. No matter what I did... no matter how I formatted it... THIS CARD DID NOT WORK IN MY CAMERA. PERIOD. I instead went out and purchased a PNY 32GB UHS-I micro SD card and I have not had a problem since. Hopefully the same thing works for you if you're experiencing troubles with this great camera as well!<br/><br/>Here's a link to the micro SD card that actually worked for me: (https://www.amazon.com/PNY-Elite-X-32GB-microSDHC-Adapter-UHS-I/dp/B01G26R13Y/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484790784&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=pny+micro+sd+card)</span>

<span>Ok. now that I've gotten more experience with my GoPro Hero 5 Sports camera. Mostly with time-lapse. Here are some things I have learned.<br/><br/>1. GoPro only takes photos in RAW format if time between photos is 5 seconds or greater.<br/>This is not good for those of us who like to use RAW information to edit photos. Or, prefer not to lose information while converting from JPG to DNG. Time-lapse with 5 seconds time frames are ok for time-lapse videos that are meant to be at a fast pace.<br/><br/>2. Aperture on the GoPro is a fixed F2.8. For those who don’t know. This is the iris of a lens. On a real camera, you can adjust the size of the iris to control the amount of light to the camera sensor. F2.8 is a very wide iris. It is allowing for as much light as possible to pass through the lens and on to the sensor. And, another note on F-stop. It’s also used to control the Depth of Field in a photo.<br/><br/>3. GoPro uses ISO to try and adjust the sensitivity of the sensor to light. The tradeoff is that too much of an adjustment, that allows more light, creates noise in your photos. Or an adjustment towards less light makes your photo too dark. If you are wanting to compensate in post editing, its best to go adjust from light to dark. There is still noise in the photo. It is just not as easily seen.<br/><br/>4. GoPro Shutter speed. Absolute no control. You could be making the best time-lapse you’ve ever made, and suddenly, the shutter speed on the GoPro changes right in the middle of your time-lapse. Forcing you to make the choice of either deleting or shortening your time-lapse. I would say that this is the most frustrating part of the GoPro currently.<br/><br/>Overall. If I were to ask GoPro to make changes to their cameras. It would be to have better control of light with shutter speed. Maybe have them create advanced software for those of us who would like more control over the camera. I understand the fixed lens, as it is a sports point of view camera. Usually, sports activities are in well-lit areas without too much change in light. ISO control for the moment on the camera seems to be ok.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I’ll continue to play with the GoPro until my new toy arrives sometime in February.  I’ve learned quite a bit about camera gear since I’ve gotten my little GoPro.</span>

<span>First one was a charging dud, this one started up right away!  One reason we buy through Amazon is the great customer support regarding returns.  Our first GoPro ordered a couple of weeks ago refused to charge no matter where plugged in and we couldn't get the Hero main screen to show even with just small battery amount it came with.<br/><br/>We returned and requested a replacement GoPro which arrived today.  We turned on before charging the battery fully to check due to the previous issue and this one started up and showed the main screen immediately.  Kudos to Amazon for prompt replacement!<br/><br/>Now to the camera.  We are senior sometimes "geeks" and enjoy tech things.  This is our first GoPro so we were excited to receive and start testing.  I will say that unpacking and removing the camera from the box top mount was more challenging than expected LOL.  We love the touch screens but had nothing in the included "how to" booklet related to sound.  During test video recording we weren't able to hear anything, saw nothing in preferences to help adjust volume and ended up using good old online "search" to find out that we needed to swipe up during playback mode to check the volume.  Once we increased this we heard the sound recorded.<br/><br/>This is just a preliminary report as we plan to record more and save to my Mac to use IMovie and then create a DVD.  We will use the camera for our cruise vacations, especially beach and snorkel time.  We always create 1-2 hour movies to bore our friends and family.<br/><br/>The reason for the 4 star is that the battery seems to drain quickly and also wish the camera was just a little bigger since we won't be mounting to a helmet or chest, just a small float type stick.</span>

<span>This is a neat little camera that I mainly use as a dashboard camera during my travels. As some have already posted the image stabilization is great in all kinds of situations.  Some reviewers have mentioned some problems with the app.  I haven't had any problems.  You are given 5 chances to connect your camera to the app and I got it on the first try.  And the app is really handy since you can make adjustments on resolution, ISO, shutter speed, directly from the app.  But you also have to connect to the app each time you power up the camera.  Or not use the app at all.  My only complaint is the lack of instructions.  I had to go on You Tube to figure out how to best set up my camera.  And there are some great videos out there to help you out.  Also, you may want to look at some accessories like mountings for your camera.  In all, I'm glad I got it.</span>

<span>I had a GoPro hero 9. Half the shots stop recording, major touch screen issues. It is a mess!<br/><br/>This Osmo records when I know it’s going to, the touch screen interface is clutch. The app works better. Picture is totally usable for pros. I’ve used this for a shot in a TV commercial, scuba diving, FPV freestyle, skating, surfing… this thing keeps up and just works! Lots of 3rd party support, ND filters, Even small rig makes a couple cages for this.<br/><br/>The Hero9 does have a better image… that is if you can get it to record half the time. For ease of use I prefer this Osmo over all my GoPros. I’m looking forward to the nex gen Osmo hopefully this year!<br/><br/>If you fly FPV this is smaller and lighter than a hero 9 or 8! And the screw on ND filters are awesome!</span>

<span>It’s good. It does what it says and for the price, I think it’s a great action camera. My complaints are about what is included. It comes with a cage and two mounts. Both mounts have double sided tape. No mini tripod. No handle. The two mounts it comes with are fine if you want to mount it permanently to one thing and never move it. They could have easily added a 1/4”-20 hole to one of the included mounts so it could be mounted to a tri-pod. A camera that can’t be mounted to a tripod out of the box is unforgivable. If you buy this camera, but an accessory kit so you’re able to have more flexibility of mounting the camera. You’d also think that a camera that has a lens and two screens would come with at least some sort of cheap carrying case to protect all the pretty shiny surfaces. One last complaint. It doesn’t come with an SD card. Call me crazy, but I think when you buy a camera, you should be able to take it out of the box and use it, without having to buy a card and an accessory kit. My complaints are minor, that’s why I only deducted 1 star. But people should know that if you buy the cam (and you should buy it, it’s a great camera) you’ll also need to buy a few extras to complete the package.</span>

<span>I was really surprised at how stable and solid the mount attached to my helmet. Because of the multiple air vents on most bike helmets the self stick that comes with the kit is impracticable as there is not nearly enough surface area. There were no instructions which would have been helpful but in the end it wasn't that hard to figure out how to set it up.  There is a strap on each side with a snap down closure.  What makes the mount so effective is there is medium density rubber attached on the bottom. When pressure is applied from each side strap the points of the vents go into the rubber to snug the mount in place.  Even if by accident if the wearer opened one of the closures when turning the camera on or off the remaining strap will hold the mount in place thereby ensuring the mount and camera won't fall off. Again really happy with the product. As a few others have mentioned the product was the actual Go Pro product.</span>

<span>I was enthralled to receive my camera on a friday, just in time for a fun filled weekend. Much to my dismay after playing with the car mode feature for a few minutes, I set the date and time; and switched to the camera to still mode. Thats as far as I made it when the camera screen became snowy and jumbled. The camera was then frozen on this screen, to no avail after charging and pressing every button on the thing. Very let down, I invested too much energy into thinking I got a great deal. However, amazon fulfilled the order, so there was no issue with the return policy, and I even got my money back for the protection plan I bought along with the camera.

<span>This rating is not compared to a GoPro. This is not anything close to one.<br/><br/>It is a fine sports action camera for ~ $50.<br/><br/>It of course comes near 0% battery, so charge it first. Then make sure you get a nice sized micro sd card. I've figured the data rate to be about 9gb per hour of hd video.<br/><br/>Also the screen eventually shuts off so the battery should last a while.<br/><br/>If you're particularly adventerious , you can add or replace the batteries with hobby rc 3.2v lipo batteries for more run time.</span>

<span>So I have purchased this system mostly for safety. It does just that with some expected limitations such as battery life during video recordings. I can't think of an item that allows to record all day and have enough battery. I have similar problems on my Gopros, even Gopro 7 Black, which I own as well, on my new Sony Photo Camera and so on....So what is this system good for ? Definitely safety! This is bar none best unit for that type of thing. It is 2K, so the image quality is at least half as good as on for example my GoPro Hero 7 Black, but in my opinion they serve different purposes, and while Hero 7 can be used as safety camera, all the connections and wires definitely makes it less attractive than 10C pro in terms of being a standalone all in one unit. So the Pros are : All in one recording stand alone unit, stays on the helmet, good video and great audio quality. Cons: Below current standard recording format, only 2k, where as industry standard seems to be 4K, having to depend on WIFI for connection to the camera via app, this is old technology comparable to Gopro Hero Session first model, problem - cuts off other existing connections to maintain this one, battery life while camera is on is poor. That's all.</span>

<span> Good System, Needs improvement on the camera battery life.</span>

<span>First, the instructions for helmet installation seem way too simple, and the various YouTubes make it seem hard.  It turns out it was very easy.  I used Velcro all the way, and got the earphones right the first time.  It is pretty easy.  Most helmets at most price points have a recess/slight indent  in the padding that is exactly the size of the earphones.  I feel like the wires are pretty messy, but they work just fine.  I did not like installation instructions but I can’t really see a way to improve them.<br/><br/>The camera: it ain’t a go pro.  That said, it works just fine.  I’m getting more and more hooked on using a camera like this and will go to a go pro I think.  I wanted something that would take a snapshot and save me fumbling for my phone.  It does that, and the videos are way more fun than the snapshots.  Caution, the exposure range is very narrow.  Sunlight can easy overcome the cameras exposure range.  I can’t say anything about battery life.  For me if it lasts an hour I’ll be bored by then.<br/><br/>Learning curve.  I got the camera working on my first ride, so it’s easy to use it.  But don’t think for a minute it will overcome your limitations as a Vlogger, you tuber, etc.  I think I will learn a lot for much less money and complications than if I had just started out with a go pro.<br/><br/>Communication: it’s a Sena.  I wish it was a Cardo. It pairs just fine with other Senas, but it’s ridiculous to think these devices are so dang proprietary.  I’m going to experiment with cell phone connections to see if I can use the phone to reach my friends.<br/><br/>Sound, music, etc.:  it pairs just great with my phone.  The sound is good.  But turn-by-turn can be hard to hear.  This may be due to my hearing, since others seem to like it.  The phone works fine.  If you have good luck with Siri or “hey google” you will have no trouble making calls while riding.<br/><br/>Distraction factor: I can work the controls just fine, but I would not risk fumbling around.  Learn one thing at a time is my advice.  I’m an old fart — so what else would you expect from me?  Phone calling for anything more than a few seconds is just as distracting as it is in a car, which is 100x too much distraction for a bike.</span>

<span>Many of the reviews I’ve read lamented the performance of the camera, especially compared to the latest offerings from GoPro.  I don’t need to shoot in 4K, nor do I understand enough about color saturation, or exposure, or many of the other aspects of videography to worry about how the 10C Pro stacks up against higher-end cameras.  What I need is a camera that basically works as a dash cam and this fits the bill.  What I really like about it is the voice confirmation that plays through the headset letting me know things like that the camera is recording, or the photo shutter sound it makes when I capture a still.  Another feature I really like is that it has the ability to run on external power, so I can plug it into the power port on my bike and not have to worry about battery life.  With a 32 GB card, I can record hours of footage, as well as listen to music indefinitely.<br/><br/>What I don’t like about this helmet cam/communicator is that the speakers are trying too hard to be something they’re not: subwoofers.  This is compounded by the fact that, in order to hear the voice confirmations while streaming Bluetooth music, the volume has to be turned up fairly loud.  The different audio levels are poorly set up.  The voice confirmations are too quiet, relative to the Bluetooth streaming audio.  Further, when allowing the streaming audio or communicator to record with the helmet cam (a really cool feature, by the way), the music is recording at a much higher volume than my voice.  I wish there was a way to adjust the relative volumes of each of the components individually (voice confirmations, Bluetooth audio, communicator, microphone, etc.)  So far, I don’t believe there is.<br/><br/>I was able to mitigate some of the distortion previously mentioned by using the supplied speaker pads to push the speakers closer to my ears, thereby allowing me to use a lower volume setting, as well as turning the bass all the way down and the treble up somewhat at the audio source.  But it doesn’t fix the distortion issue entirely (and does nothing to fix the too-quiet voice confirmations) and I never had to do such a thing with the Cardo Scala Q1 I was using.  And while on the subject of the Cardo, I can’t use the Sena to communicate with my wife’s Q1; not because the Sena won’t pair with non-Sena comms, but because the Q1 won’t.  That’s on me.  I should’ve done more research.  So if anyone is hoping to communicate with a non-Sena device, check the other device’s capability first.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I’d say the 10C Pro isn’t a bad unit, but there is certainly room for improvement, especially in the audio department.</span>

<span>The camera does exactly what I was hoping it would do! I ran it on everything from 1.2m STOL airplanes to 70mm EDF jets. It worked flawlessly, got great footage, and was always easy to download from the mini SD card.<br/><br/>Occasionally, it will be finicky and not want to work properly. All it takes is a hard restart of the camera and it’s working fine again. It disconnects from your phone’s wifi as soon as you take off (to be expected) but continues to record on the mini SD. Then you just land, hit stop or turn off camera, and download the footage from the flight. Works like a champ every time for me.<br/><br/>All in all, this camera was 100% worth the money for me. For any RC flying enthusiasts, you won’t regret buying this camera. The views are cool and it’s fun to see your local area from your RC jet. All I did was use Velcro to attach it to the airplane and it worked just fine. Highly recommend!</span>

<span>This is a nice camera for the price. The only thing I didn't like about it is that you have to download the manual from their web site and it is not included with the camera. And the manual could be much better written. But the product itself is great - good video and photos. I use it on radio control model airplanes.<br/><br/>Edit 01/08/2022: One thing I forgot to add is durability. It spent three weeks in a tree attached to an R/C airplane, went through several rainstorms, and the airplane with the camera was brought down by hurricane Ida. I put everything in front of a dehumidifier for three days, and all the electronics worked fine, including the camera.</span>

<span> It sharpens or edge enhances video &amp; there's no option to turn it off. There's no playback on the video out which shows just the current view or the menu. Image stabilization is only effective with very small vibrations, it won't correct big movements. It doesn't even take out all the shaking when I hold it as still as I can in my hand. The still photos are 2304x1728. They look pretty good, but if you zoom in, there's very visible compression distortion. The manual says not to use it as a dash cam because of the heat, but it isn't clear whether this is only if you use the internal battery (poor English). It saves .mov files which are great if you use Apple but will probably add a conversion step if you use Windows. It doesn't see nearly as well in the dark as the human eye. It has a picture flip option which allows you to mount it up-side-down on the bottom of a drone or the ceiling of your car to reach the buttons which are on the top. You can transfer files to and from it by USB; you don't need to remove the card.<br/><br/>At 1080p 30fps, the data rate is 17.9mbps. So loop recording to the maximum size card (64GB) gives you 8hrs 8min recording before it starts overwriting old video segments. At 720p it should be about 16hrs 16min. There's no motion detection. The app lets you set 8, 12, and 20mbps rates. At 720p at 8mbps it could record for 36 hours.<br/><br/>On 1080p at 60fps, many frames are duplicates, in one recording it was almost every other one. (I'm using the latest firmware.) 720p &amp; 1080p at 120fps and 1920x1440 at 30fps work properly. 640x480 at 240fps allows you to make 1/8 speed 30fps videos, fun, but it's understandably dark. See my video.<br/><br/>It records PCM stereo audio at 44.1 kHz 16 bits, though it's actually mono since there's only one mic. The volume is VERY low. I guess that's good for recording a drone's loud motor noise, but it's another processing step if you're using it for something else.<br/><br/>The app works well. It has all the configuration settings the on-screen menu has and is much easier than hooking it up to a monitor to change resolution etc.. It can show a live picture in full screen, there's about a 1/3 second lag, and the range is about 25 feet through one exterior wall. The app sets the date that the camera uses for filenames &amp; the optional timestamp. It can do burst photos and 3, 5, 10, 30, and 60 second time lapse photo sequence or video. The app can play back videos from the camera. The slow-mo feature doesn't seem to shoot at high FPS and then slow it down. To do that you have to use a separate video editor that can reduce the FPS without keeping the duration the same.<br/><br/>It wouldn't turn on one time &amp; I had to pull the battery to get it working again.<br/><br/>Weight: It weighs 49g with the battery, 35g without. The plastic case weighs 14g.<br/><br/>There's no manual included. Download it at: runcam.com/download<br/><br/>The video quality was disappointing, nowhere near as sharp as my several-years-old old smartphone. I thought is was either poorly compressed or it might be out of focus. Through the power of Google I discovered that being out of focus is a common problem with these cameras. It was focused at about 2 feet. It was a pain to take it apart and focus it, but not a big deal to me since I was planning to remove the IR filter anyway. There are YouTube how-to's. Properly focused, it's much better, but still not as sharp as my phone. Due to this focus problem, I wouldn't recommend this camera unless you're comfortable taking it apart, cutting away glue, focusing it manually, and epoxying it again.</span>

This HD Digital Video Action Camera makes it easier to film action shots because it comes with a screen so you can see what you are filming. Most action cameras do not. This HD Video Camera is NEW IN BOX. This is an Emerson 720p HD Digital Video Camera with waterproof case and 2 camera mounts. Unlike other similar HD video cams, this camera comes WITH a SCREEN so you can see what you are filming. Most similar cameras do NOT come with a view screen.

<span>Definitely nowhere near GoPro quality but it is decent.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>-  $30, inexpensive and you still get 720<br/>- video quality acceptable. Just don't expect to make a nice clear video with this. Good starter for a kid<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>- bike mount is horrible, poor quality mount resulted very shaky videos. Mount broke after first use. you can spend about $20 for a decent bike mount. Unfortunately, it means nearly doubling your investment. (knockoff  K Edge mount, tripod screw and a GoPro tripod mount should remove the shake).<br/>- To change from video to stills is troublesome. It means you have to take it out of the water resistant case and click a switch.<br/>- no way to tripod mount the camera without the water resistant casing<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you have already have a GoPro want a toss around camera or getting a camera for a kid, it's not bad. However, if you want to use this as a primary action camera, be prepared to be disappointed.</span>

<span> I had low expectations for the price, but unfortunately even these were not met.  Package arrived yesterday and I immediately tested it by walking slowly outside holding it in my hand.  First off, the video is extremely shaky due to the lens, which does not capture a wide view at all which accentuates shaking and vibration.  For those familiar with 35mm cameras this lens is a 50mm equivalent, or about half as wide as a standard wide-angle lens on most cameras.  Doesn't even come close to a gopro.  Secondly, the video is distorted, and becomes stretched near the edges of the frame - so as subjects move around the frame they look like they are in a funny-house mirror.  This is probably due to a very cheap plastic lens.  After looking at these videos on my PC, and even trying to correct the shake and distortion with my pro video editing software, I declared this a failed experiment and boxed it up for return.  Not sure yet whether I am going to spring for a gopro (probably) or just use the video on my hand-held camera for now.<br/><br/>I'll give this two stars because I could see how it might work for relatively still applications such as shooting or just as a kid's toy camera.  But for any real action like biking - even road biking for which I intended to use it - I think you will be very disappointed.<br/><br/>I've uploaded the test video so you can see what I mean about the shaking and distortion.  I promise I was holding the camera as still as possible!</span>

<span>I had been shopping for an action cam for a while and didn't know which one to choose. My first thought was the Go Pro due to the familiarity of the name. But i thought there must be an alternative because I really didn't want to spend $200-$400 on a camera and this one has a screen build in. I ended up finding this. It had some mixed reviews, but for the price, I figured why not? the picture quality isn't all that great but it will do. it is easy to use and the screen is really nice. the two mounts that come with it seam to be good quality and i like the water resistant case. the only down side to this that i see is the picture isn't all that great and when i turn it on the screen it glitches for a few seconds. before you go spending a lot of money on a Go Pro you should try this out. What is there to lose? If you aren't happy, return it. but i am happy with it. For $40, you could't ask for more.</span>

<span>This would be a good starter camera for an active child wanting to record his or her activities. It has passable performance in limited light, meaning that it will produce a decent low resolution image or video in typical nighttime lighting. In daylight it is better, but is still not close to HD quality. Color tends to brighten and wash out and with zero image stabilization tends to be jerky. Panning has to be done very slowly to prevent blurring. These things mean that attached to bike handlebars or a helmet will produce video that's difficult to watch. The camera is vibration sensitive, producing almost constant "jello effect."  It's chief value is its low price, and so putting it in the hands of a seven or eight year old or hanging it from the collar of a pet isn't as risky as it might be with a more expensive unit like a Swann, a Contour, or a GoPro. I would suggest that those who want to record their adventures skydiving, snow boarding, biking or other sports spend the extra money for a higher quality unit.<br/><br/>It is easy to operate and has easy to use controls that are not at all complex. Choosing photo, video or playback is achieved by a three position slide switch on the side of the unit. The power and shutter switches are on top. It has an LCD screen that allows the operator to see and frame shots when hand held. You will need to purchase a microSD card of at least 2 gigabytes to use the camera. It will recognize larger volume cards --I used a 32GB card and it worked just fine. The camera is NOT waterproof in any way and should be kept away from water in spite of the GoPro-like "waterproof" case.<br/><br/>It does not charge quickly. The initial charging took four hours and recharging it after a half hour of video took almost two hours. Transferring files from the camera to computer is pretty slow as well: it took six and a half minutes to copy a 900MB video file to my laptop, a feat that takes two minutes with my GoPro or Contour Roam.<br/><br/>All in all the Emerson camera has features that make it useful, but its low video quality limits the camera's value considerably. It comes with a wrist, helmet, and tripod adapter mounts. It recharges and transfers images via an included USB cable.</span>

<span>Based on what’s available on the market today, this little camera is pretty awesome. The 8k 360 images are fantastic, and 4K 360 streaming is nice as well. We utilize it for live streaming round table talks at work. The software works well as well… if you can figure it out. The biggest problem with this camera are the poor English directions. It took several days for me to find the correct software for it, and the proper way to set everything up and process the video. It didn’t need to be that difficult. But it was less of a hardware/software issue, and more of a lack of support. But if you’re willing to jump in and figure it all out, it’s a great little camera.</span>

<span>This is a Great 360 Camera, Hi Resolution, Large Screen, Great Vloging (Very Stable Video), Audio Jack for pro mic, HDMI and Ethernet Ports for video village and broadband streaming. The Body is solid high quality metal. The best photo shooting mode I recommend is "Super HDR". Be sure to process ALL 6 raw and jpeg TOGETHER with Kandao's RAW + JPEG software and turn off avast, somehow Avast would close my software. I use a Brand New 2020 Windows 64bit i9 64GB Memory 8GB GPU Computer. Kandao's RAW + JPEG Software can process my Super HDR images in a flash but it sometimes is buggy and crashes, but still delivers very nice sharp clear images. Be Patient. Kandao Please Keep updating all firmware and software. I would like to see a Super HDR mode that allows you to choose more than 3 EV, like 6 EV or 8 EV, so 6 or 8 images. Live-streaming is possible out of the box, but be ware you need a i7 or i9 Computer with a $500.00 to $900.00 (RTX 2080 8GB) video card in order to use their great live streaming software. If you want to use a laptop it would be the same, a $3000.00 Laptop to run their Live streaming software. You can still live stream with out all this but at a lower resolution than 8k. Correct me if I am wrong. This is what I experienced having purchased BOTH KanDao QooCam 8K Enterprise AND KanDao QooCam 8K see photo.<br/>UPDATE 2022: The camera update is now even better with in- camera processing of your super HDR images so there's no need to do that in the computer however you still have that option if you like.</span>

<span>I received this camera from Labpano, before it was available on Amazon mid 2020. I use it mainly for Google Street View mapping, blue-line capture that is. As the camera is moving while capturing, surroundings change all the time, and it is a challenge for the camera to adapt to it correctly on the fly all the time. There will be occasional stitching, white balance, exposure, lens flare, dynamic range issues. Taking the purpose into account, nothing is a real disaster and Google's own isn't flawless either; it isn't wedding photography. Moreover, the workflow is fast and easy, which is a great advantage, as time is money. To see results, have a look at Street View or Mapillary in Curaçao in the name of 'OmniSynThesis 360 VR Promotions' or 'Curaçao by OmniSynThesis 360 VR'.</span>

<span>I am using this camera to take 360 videos of apartments. it works very well and is easy to use (once you learn the technology). the only negative is that at the moment it is not compatible with Zillow. it has been easy for me to upload to our own website.</span>

The advantage it upload to google in built into the camera and is easily managed from the phone the tech support staff is responsive.  It will hold up in a rain.  As you see it on my back packnmout for hiking. The battery is about 2.5 hrs  but can be powered by external battery also. Do keep track of your little rubber plugs to keep the ports dry.<br/>Would I buy again Yes.</span>
