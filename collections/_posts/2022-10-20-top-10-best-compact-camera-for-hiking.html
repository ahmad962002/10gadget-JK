<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this as a new everyday-carry camera after finally getting sick of the pointless madness of smartphone cameras. It's worth it, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Good stuff:<br/><br/>- Decent picture quality in daylight, but likely outperformed by a fancy phone.<br/>- Outstanding picture quality at night, way beyond what any phone I've seen can do.<br/>- Decent optical zoom, though only a little bit of it.<br/>- Easy to cram into a back pocket without worrying about damaging it. Nice build quality without being too excessively bulky.<br/>- Starts up quickly; ready to go in about one second from pressing the power button. I really appreciate this, since one of my biggest frustrations with phone cameras is how they often take insane amounts of time just to start up.<br/>- Takes RAW photos.<br/>- Takes decent video, including 1080p60, 1080p120, and 4K30. Does not take 4K60, so if you want that, you'll have to look elsewhere. Saves videos as MOV files, encoded with H.264 on the High profile with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, with a bitrate of around 50 Mb/s for 1080p60 in my tests. Audio is uncompressed PCM.<br/>- Manual focus, which I was surprised to find because I was assured by the reviews I read that it did not have manual focus. It sure does, though, and it's surprisingly good. The super-macro setting is very impressive too.<br/>- MicroUSB charging, which is less nice than USB-C, but much better than the terrible proprietary connector that the old models had.<br/>- Impressive waterproofing. Unless you're a scuba diver, this is basically a true underwater camera (and if you are, I hear there's a deep-water housing available too). It's not like phones tend to be where they claim it's waterproof, but then specify in the fine print that it's only good to one meter of depth for half an hour or whatever - no, this is a camera you can actually take swimming with you.<br/><br/>Bad stuff:<br/><br/>- There doesn't seem to be any exposure bracketing function apart from the internal HDR scene mode, which is frustrating because the scene mode processing is terrible (see next point).<br/><br/>- Seems to have an extremely mediocre image processor, maybe not even any better than the one included in the earliest models in the Olympus Tough series. The JPEGs it produces are extremely crunchy (RAW is worth using for this reason), and the scene mode filters are kind of a joke. You can't capture RAWs when using them, and it only saves 3-MP photos despite this being a 12-MP camera (which is already a little on the low side compared to what phones are doing these days, especially for a camera that costs about the same as a decent phone). If you aren't planning on shooting RAWs all the time and doing all your processing afterwards, I really don't recommend this camera.<br/><br/>- Almost every preset mode locks out most of the manual controls, seemingly for no reason. For example, if you're using the candlelight mode, you're simply not allowed to use manual focus. There doesn't seem to be any particular reason for this, since the focus is entirely independent of anything candlelight mode is actually changing (exposure, aperture, and sensitivity, I guess), so this makes no sense. Also, every time the camera silently changes your settings like this, it doesn't change them back when you return to a mode where they're allowed again, making it an ongoing hassle to go through and put everything back how you want it. The frustration of this is quickly training me to never touch any of the scene modes or other presets. It's really aggravating to go out and take a bunch of photos, only to discover that none of them were saved as good-quality RAWs because the camera silently turned off RAW capture on me.<br/><br/>- The lens accessories seem to be basically worthless. I don't know about the wide-angle ones, since all I have is the "telephoto" converter, but I can confidently say that I would never recommend this particular conversion lens. It makes the camera much bulkier, constricts the field of view so much that the camera's zoom is no longer useful, costs quite a bit, and for all that, you don't even get a factor of 2 on top of the existing zoom. At this rate, I'd rather just try to shoot through a pair of binoculars. If you're thinking that this camera's zoom doesn't sound quite strong enough for you, but are holding out hope because you heard there's a telephoto converter, then move along - this isn't a high-zoom camera, and the expensive TCON-T01 conversion lens doesn't change that.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that this is a great camera to use for basic indoor and outdoor photography, especially in low-light conditions. While it's hardly a proper DSLR, it has enough manual controls to at least not be a downgrade from smartphones in that regard, and it's a lot more likely to survive an exciting trip than either of those are. It's far from perfect, but I think I'm going to like using it every day instead of some horrendously broken phone camera.</span>

<span>Strengths:<br/><br/>Takes good high quality images for a 12 MP compact.  Pictures are bright and performance in lowlight is very good.  Macro is exceptional and underwater photos are very strong (easily the best among other compact UW cameras).  Dynamic range is very good and shadows are often properly exposed (unlike most other UW cameras that consistently underexpose shadows).  Despite this camera having only 12 MP, it frequently provides cleaner and more detailed images than its 16 and 20 MP competitors.  The custom settings are awesome...everything from the ability to shoot raw, the ability to set and stick 1 second shake reduction timers, to the custom saturation/gradation/contrast/sharpness/nr settings, and much more.  White balance tends to be good especially in indoor/macro/uw settings.  Reds perform well with this camera.  Scenes modes (like beach mode) tend to work well.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/><br/>Video stabilization is a bit below average but decent and low light videos are brighter than the competition.  This cameras is a low floor, high ceiling camera...you will need to learn how to use it to gets best benefits.  At times the produced jpgs are too saturated or undersaturated.  I find a good work around is program mode &gt; i-enhance (low) with NR (low) which works well in most cases.  If you edit raw, you don't have to worry about that.  Blues and greens are a bit weak in distant landscape shots.<br/><br/>Minor Quips:<br/><br/>A wrist strap is included...good for divers, but for paddlers, skiers, and hikers a neck strap would have been preferred.  4x zoom is a bit below average compared to other UW compacts...but zoom quality isn't bad and you can always purchased a telephoto addon to double the range.  There is no 4k 60p (just 4k 30p or 1080 60p), but few competitors for this class of camera off this.  The battery door and tripod mount are located next to each other...so if you need to switch batteries, you'll also need to remove your quick release mount which is a bit annoying.<br/><br/>TG-5 vs TG-6:<br/><br/>On paper, the TG-6 hasn't improved much, but there are subtle but important improvements.  New internal filters have been added to reduce chromatic aberration and the purple orb issues.  White balance appears slightly improved in the TG-6 and images are much less like to be overexposed (an issues with the TG-5).  The LCD on the TG-6 is much approved which is very handy when doing things like exposure compensation.  Minimum shutter speed controls, super-macro video, and the ability to use microscope focus in aperture priority are significant changes as well.<br/><br/>Purple Orb:<br/><br/>All TG cameras (and many non-Olympus cameras) occasionally show a small purple orb in the middle of the image.  This is likely light reflecting off of the sensor onto an internal lens element.  No reviewer brings it up, but it does exist.  Honestly I wouldn't panic if you see this.  I've shot 1000's of TG-6 outdoor images and maybe only 1-2 show this.  It is more apt to show indoors and in macro situations.  But...it only appears in select contexts.  Usually if you have max zoom, have a dark subject at the very center, are using a high iso, and there is a strong off-axis light source (or flat surface nearby like a wall that reflects a lot of light).  The new LCD screen makes it easy to see the orb and react accordingly...use the flash (the flash cures this in my experience), zoom out, or recompose the camera so the very center isn't on something very dark.  While many TG-5 users complained of this, I believe this has been significantly reduced in the TG-6, but it will occasionally happen...it's normal!<br/><br/>Accessories:<br/><br/>The FD-1 is highly recommended for macro and acts as a lens hood to protect the lens.  Screen protectors are recommended too (a two pack for $7 is available if you search Amazon "screen protectors olympus tough".  An external charger and backup batteries are recommend.  Li92 are better quality...but Li90 are a significantly better value.  Search Amazon "bm Batteries and Charger for Olympus Tough" for a nice charger/battery pack combo.</span>

<span>First: This seller was awesome and the camera arrived within a couple of days as advertised. Just in time for my vacation. It arrives with the camera, strap(non floating),battery, and a charging cord for this camera. It took about 2 hours to fully charge upon arrival.<br/><br/> I bought this camera so that I could take pictures/videos and not ruin my I phone/ expensive Olympus cameras.  I actually brought  one very expensive camera with me and 5 lenses to HHI, but it rained everyday and I did not even take my M1-iii camera or lenses out of the bag.<br/><br/> I submerged this camera so many times in the ocean and the pool and I was very impressed that it still took really good video/pictures .<br/><br/>The salt water and sand scared me the most, but rinsing it with tap water and not rubbing or trying to polish the lens works great after each pool/beach use. Let it dry before opening the camera as recommended.<br/><br/>People are asking if the  accessories are waterproof. The camera is waterproof, and the little lens cover is not. The camera is awesome.</span>

Panasonic lumix point-and-shoot digital cameras are known among camera enthusiasts for reliability and innovative features. The lumix dc-zs70 brings the legendary optical performance of a 30x (24-720mm) Leica DC vario-elmar lens with amazingly stable 5-axis hybrid O.I.S. (Optical image stabilizer) to a highly portable point-and-shoot travel camera. Traditionalists will love the hands-on manual feel of a lens-mounted control ring, plus the familiarity of an eye-level electronic viewfinder. The modern enthusiast will love the Wi-Fi mobile device controllability and next-generation flexibility that 4K video and 4K photo modes bring to the creative experience.

<span>I like how small this camera is and it takes nice photos.  The only things I really don't like are how small the eye viewer is.  On sunny days you need this and you really can't see well enough to take a good photo with it.  I also miss a full articulating screen.  I was spoiled with the one on my Nikon p520.

<span>Short review for the ZS70 here, my full review shortly will be published on my blog (google camera name and photographic-central). Quick rant/explanation: I'm giving it 5 stars for two reasons- One, I can't choose 4.5, and two, there were a couple one star reviews here when either the camera wasn't released yet or there was obvious user error. To me, those aren't valid reviews so the extra half point helps to mitigate them (since Amazon hasn't removed the reviews, and probably won't I'm doing my part to keep things fair). Moving on...<br/><br/>Review: There simply aren't any decent pocket-able super zoom cameras on the market that shoot raw. As a professional and enthusiast, I demand raw. I suggest readers who don't use raw learn how to so that they can get the most out of the TZ70. This camera has a very small sensor, but, it is a modern BSI CMOS, which means it's very efficient for the size of its pixels. As long as you have reasonable expectations from a sensor this size, it will probably exceed those expectations. Image quality from raw is much better than I anticipated. The lens is very sharp through the range (just don't go over f5.6 if you can avoid it, natural diffraction kicks in). Therefore the sensor and lens combo out perform a camera of this class. Even dynamic range is better than I could have possibly thought. Credit to technology moving on.<br/><br/>When you factor in all its features (a vast array from 4k video to wireless to time lapse video), it's top notch design aesthetics (minimalist, classy, utilitarian), excellent build and ergonomics, this camera is a powerhouse of a pocketable "all in one" compact. My only wish is that the lens were slightly brighter (max aperture through the range), but otherwise it's a camera in its class of sensor size that shadows all others. At first I dismissed the ZS70 because of its packed tiny sensor, but I was shocked and pleasantly surprised looking at the image quality in raw. 1" sized sensors are still going to outperform it mind you, but this sensor is much better than you might think. Once you get it set  up, it's a joy to shoot with. That lens is so versatile for all kinds of snapshot photography- from landscapes to macros, action shots to long range stills or portraits. Its fast focusing so even actions shots are within reach.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is everything  you need in a little point n shoot, and nothing you don't. The controls on the exterior are plenty and holding it is quite lovely for one handed shooting- it's slightly larger, thicker, and heavier than the ZS50/60 but that is a good thing for a camera with such a long zoom. It makes a more stable platform when you are shooting at full telephoto. It has just the right heft to it for a camera of its size and type, welcome if you ask me. The five axis stabilization helps tremendously to keep blur at bay. Most of the controls are customizeable. The LCD is helpful for waist level shots and acts as a sort of angle bi-pod when you place the camera down for more stable shots (if you don't have a tripod for example). The EVF is welcome and usable, and helps in bright light and for extra stability when you are looking through it with the camera pressed to your eye/face.<br/><br/>I cannot get over how lovely its designed- all sides are nice n flat, nothing protrudes to snag, there's no obnoxious advertising of features on the camera itself, and everything appears proportionate and cleanly organized. The front and rear grips are improved and excellent. The design looks very Leica-esque - minimalist and beautiful. Great choice in exterior materials, the blend of flat fleck paint and satin metal. The black and silver versions are both excellent and classy.<br/><br/>If you print, you can easily make lovely prints to 13x19", and if you have some talent or stack your raw images, you can raise that number substantially (30x40" perhaps!). To me this camera is the sleeper compact out there right now. And it's likely to get more reviews and fans as a result.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is the best of the newer ZS series (or TZ series if outside the USA) cameras. It's classy, versatile, discreet, minimalist, and utilitarian. I wish more cameras were designed like this. Keep it up Panasonic!<br/><br/>Edit: My full review is now up on photographic-central blogspot dot com :)</span>

<span>I have a ZS40, which I love. I sit a a bay window on my computer that looks out over my garden. I see lots of birds and use the camera to take shats using most of the time the full magnification. A couple of things don't function. The cover for the battery and SD card broke. It a really stupid design. I use some electrical tape. More critical the zoom can be sluggish and does not also extend quickly. It may just need cleaning. Its very light and small. The replacement is significantly larger and heavier. However, it has improved performance probably from the high resolution of the chip. What surprised my is that the improved screen makes it much easier to use the tiny images I am trying to find. Typically with my old camera I have to zoom in on a tiny bird from knit sat the shrub on which the bird is now perched. I can easily see the bird on the screen even before I magnify. The is very helpful when the bird is not in an easily identifiable larger object.<br/>The cover is now much better designed but ironically the cover on the side to the socket, which had an excellent design now has a staid design. It has a hinge only at the Botton of the "door", which means it twists when you swing it open. When you swing it back it remains twisted so you have to fiddle with it to get it closed. Hard to understand why they just did not use the old design. It covers the two sockets one for charging and the other an HDMI.</span>

<span>I was looking for a camera for an upcoming trip to South America. Although my iPhone 13 Pro takes great photos, it has limited telephoto capabilities, so I decided to buy a "real" camera instead, one that was both compact in size but had good optical zoom.<br/><br/>After considering both the Panasonic Lumix ZS80 and very similar Nikon Coolpix A1000, I decided to order the Lumix. After playing with it for a couple of days, I decided to return it, primarily for two reasons:<br/><br/>1. The fonts on the screen and camera controls are very small, and hard for me to read without reading glasses, which I don't plan to wear outside. That might have become less of an issue after I became more familiar with the camera, but I didn't want to have to struggle with it on my upcoming trip. Note that reading the fonts was not a problem when using the viewfinder rather than the touchscreen.<br/><br/>2. The feature that allows you to automatically transfer photos from the camera to your phone using the Panasonic app was pretty quirky. Even though the camera can connect to the phone via Bluetooth, you have to connect the phone to the camera's WiFi in order to transfer photos.<br/><br/>A couple of other observations: there are two manuals, basic and advanced. A printed copy of the basic manual is included, but you have to access the advanced online. Also, the cover over the charging and HDMI ports is very flimsy and seems like it might fall off.<br/><br/>I can't evaluate the camera's performance since I didn't use it enough. It appears well built (other than the port cover) and feels comfortable in your hand. It's pretty small, so it should be easy to pack. I also ordered a case, extra battery, battery charger, and memory cards (none come with the camera), but returned everything except the memory card that I opened.<br/><br/>Sorry it didn't work out for me, but if your eyes are better than mine, the camera is worth considering.</span>

<span>This was probably the most exciting announcement of 2018 and I was super excited when this camera was released. Unfortunately the camera has some major issues that are inexcusable for it's price range.<br/><br/>The Good: Great Central Sharpness (Equal to the Leica Q) with decent mid frame to corner sharpness. Small, Light, Stealth Body, looks like an old point and shoot. Battery Life isn't terrible for a tiny battery. Easy to hold. Very Good dynamic range. Menus are good. Stabilization works very well.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>1. Camera doesn't ship with charger. You have to buy a spare charger separately for $50. The spare charge DOES NOT come with the cable or USB power adapter to use it. You have to buy that separately too! That's completely ridiculous as everyone will order at least one spare battery for it which is another $40. How they sell you a spare charger without the cable and USB power to use it beyond me. Real cost over the Camera is over $1,025 not $899.<br/><br/>2. For a camera that has no viewfinder the LCD has to be good. It should be great on a $1,000 camera. Well it's terrible. It's extremely hard to use in direct sunlight and nearly impossible to accurately compose shots. Even with max brightness it's bad. The Canon M100 has a similar screen for $399. Ironically the areas where the autofocus works the best which is bright direct sunlight, you can't see the screen...lol (What were they thinking?)<br/><br/>3. Low Light autofocus is bad and inaccurate even with Firmware 1.1. Camera refuses to focus very often. At times the camera will confirm focus only to find out later on my computer the shot was out of focus. Worst autofocus camera of 2019 for $1,000<br/><br/>4. Lens vignetting is Terrible! Even with all the corrections in camera and photoshop you can't completely remove it. Now, I personally like vignetting on some of my images, but as a creative choice. Here, all your images will have it. Forget about putting a subject in the mid to corner areas of the frame.<br/><br/>5. After having the camera for 2 weeks I already see dust spots inside the lens. Obviously this is impossible to clean and just imagine in 1 to 2 years how bad it will get. Another issue is cleaning the front element is extremely challenging because there's a huge gap around it. It's basically open around it. So if you use a blower, you'll blow the dust INSIDE the lens. Terrible design.<br/><br/>$1,025 for a camera with all these issues is inexcusable. If the camera was $549-$599 with the charger included it would a fair price. (I don't understand how the price doubled from the GRII) The Canon M100 for $399 has much better autofocus, equal image quality with 22mm prime, a similar quality LCD that tilts (both are poor but the Canon isn't over $1,000), and better jpgs. Yet the Canon for $399 gets you a charger in the box.</span>

I am no apature, shutter, iso or white balance master. But this camera makes it easier to understand and adjust. I may upload one of my photos later.<br/>The battery does not last long so carry 3 batteries charged. I do. There small.<br/>It uses larger sized SD cards 512G and larger.<br/>No real zoom. More on that below.<br/>Theres no on board EVF. Extra cost. Expensive.<br/>I have not had any issues needing EVF including outside.<br/>But the quality photos this little camera produces is nothing short of phenomenal!<br/>I can expand my photos to very large size with incredible sharpness and clarity. I would say this camera does not need zoom but i doubt moon craters would show in a moon shot.<br/>I now use this camera instead of reaching for my smart phone. Starts up QUICK!<br/>Not for video logging.<br/>I only wish it had 4k video. But it makes up for it for street and macro shots. Wow the macro shots are amazing. Buy it.

<span>I've had the camera for almost three years, and it's been to Japan and all around Arizona and Colorado. I think it's a great little camera, and it's performed pretty well. I use it when I don't/need to bring my big camera gear along.<br/><br/>I installed the </span>

<span> kit to use CP and ND filters. Read my review of that at its product page. That is a great product also.<br/><br/>I think they could have added some textures to the body of the LX10. I added small pieces of 3M Safety Walk slip resistant tape to the front and rear of the camera. The small piece on the rear is where my thumb usually ends up. Without these, this little camera is difficult to get a firm grip because it's slippery.<br/><br/>After a few years, there's a bit of dust inside the lens, which is easy to fix in post-processing. There are some mechanical issues caused by bumping it into things, but that's all my fault.<br/><br/>The image quality is superb for a point and shoot camera, and low light performance is acceptable. The ability to control the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO is not as easy as on a big camera, but at least it's there.<br/><br/>I don't care for the controls. The button assignment is somewhat customizable, but the controls are not intuitive to me. I don't care for the aperture ring. Also, video footage from this camera isn't very impressive, and 5-axis image stabilization is disabled in 4K shooting, but for a point and shoot camera released in 2016, this is about fair.<br/><br/>The battery cover shape or placement could be improved. With the Manfrotto quick release RC2 plate, the plate covers the battery cover, and this makes it impossible to change the battery without removing the plate from the camera. Also, when the RC2 plate is on, the flip up screen cannot be manipulated from the closed position. The screen has to be flipped out of the way before putting the RC2 plate on if I intend to flip the screen up while shooting.<br/><br/>The camera cannot be used while being charged by a micro USB cable. The only solution is to power the camera using a battery adapter such as the Panasonic DMW-DCC15A DC coupler. Shortly after purchasing the camera, the DMW-DCC15A was either not available or approved for LX10 (I could not find information online as to its use with LX10), so I took apart a spare battery and wired it with the </span>

<span> to adjust to 7.4 volts, and attached a USB connector to plug into a battery pack. There is a flap for the external power cable to go through on the battery cover, which is not accessible, again, when the Manfrotto RC2 plate is on.<br/><br/>The menu is confusing and not intuitive. On one hand, it seems like Panasonic wanted to simplify things, but things are hard to find because it's scattered all over the place. The three main tabs under settings is for photography ("Rec"), videography ("Motion Picture"), and "Custom."<br/><br/>It's the existence of this "Custom" menu tab that confuses me. The "Custom" menu allows changing of 51 different settings that mostly have to do with photography like "Silent Mode," "AF/AE Lock," "Peaking," and "Zebra." These settings can be changed and also stored into three presets named  "C1," "C2," or "C3." C1/2/3 are recalled when the shooting mode is in "C."<br/><br/>When changing these settings in other shooting modes, they are preserved even when the shooting mode is changed to "C" and back. So in essence, there are four presets, which I appreciate. You cannot change and recall the 51 settings in "Custom" for each of the (M/P/A/S/etc) shooting modes though: they apply to all modes except in "C," where C1/2/3 takes over. Maybe other Panasonic cameras are set up the same way, but I think they could have organized the menu a little differently.<br/><br/>I think features like Post Focus, Focus Stacking, and all the video related features are great, but I have no use for it. If I pre-plan and shoot accordingly, I can do most of those in post-processing. Not everyone has Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, I guess. Overall, I'm not sure if Panasonic wanted a simple and easy to use camera, or confusing camera with lots of features and buttons.<br/><br/>Here's the camera settings of the attached photos. All photos were taken in RAW, and the images were post-processed in Adobe Lr.<br/>Photo 1: Adobe Lr panorama stitch of nine exposures at ISO 125, 24 mm, f/5.6, 1/800 to 1/1250 sec.

But i bought it for quick snaps at musoc venues at night, and the depth of field being not very shallow and the shake is just too much to justify keeping it for photo purposes.

<span>I am an amateur who was looking for something a step up from the iPhone.  I wanted a really good, easy to use point and shoot camera - and if I was going to shell out 400-600 bucks, I wanted the best one I could find in that price range. After much research into sensor sizes, lens clarity, fStops, etc. my head literally dizzy with information, I finally decided on the LX10.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>• Picture quality is great.  Clear and sharp.<br/>• The modes that allow you to manually adjust the aperture and shutter speed are easy to use and allow you to get some amazing macro pictures with the blurred background. (this camera has a lens-mounted control ring – super easy)  I spent one whole day doing nothing but taking close ups of flowers and bugs and got some amazing shots.  This is one thing, I think, this camera excels at!<br/>• Manual mode is good and makes it easy to use for general pictures.<br/>• The auto focus is good.<br/>• Camera is fairly light and easy to carry.<br/>• I thought the battery life was good.  I took pictures all day, and spent (cumulative) at least two hours scrolling thru the menus trying to figure out the settings – and the battery lasted all day.<br/>• Good Image Stabilizer.  My hands are rather shaky, but this camera evens that out and takes amazingly clear pictures.<br/>• Easy to connect to the iPhone via Wi-Fi and transfer pictures immediately.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>• Not easy to use.  Once you get the basic functions, those are easy to employ, but I think the problem is that Panasonic tried to pack in literally everything along with the kitchen sink and it’s just too much clutter on the screen, too many options, too many settings.  Now remember, I am saying this as an amateur.  I read reviews before I bought it saying this was an “easy to use” camera, but I’m pretty sure those were written by professional photographers.  So for amateurs looking at this camera, just be aware that you’ve got to study the manual.  Even though I wanted a camera that exceed the iPhone – Panasonic could take some lessons from Apple on making their camera more user friendly.<br/><br/>• The grip of the camera is adequate.  But there are a lot of buttons on this thing, and more than once I’ve accidentally pushed one when I was just gripping the camera.  This is a design flaw.<br/><br/>• The auto focus is good, but it’s also slower than I expected.  Which can be a problem when you’re trying to capture action shots – or moving honey bees.<br/><br/>• No zoom.  For all intents and purposes, this camera doesn’t have a zoom.  OK, it has a 3X zoom, which is not a lot.  So this camera is amazing for regular landscape shots, really good for portrait shots and freaking awesome for macro shots – but it doesn’t zoom, so don’t expect to be able to zoom and get close ups of far aways objects.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  good camera that takes good quality pictures, but definitely has some flaws that need to be addressed.  I actually purchased a Canon powershot camera after this that has a 40X zoom.  (the Canon is also a more user-friendly camera for amateurs)  So I’ll probably end up using my Panasonic for macros and portraits, and my Canon for zoom shots (like taking pictures of birds).  With that in mind, if you’re on a budget and only wanting to buy a single camera, I would go for one of the Panasonics that offers a stronger zoom, or the Canon.</span>

<span>I wanted this camera badly, so I bought it a day or two after it became available. It was through Amazon, but the order was fulfilled by Focus Camera. The ZS100 arrived in a few days (seemed a little slow on the shipping) and immediately there were problems out of the box. I got lots of error messages just trying to do the initial setup. I did get it set up and took a couple of photos, but was getting error messages and freeze ups every minute or so. So the same day I received it, I shipped it back to Focus Camera for a refund. Once the camera arrived at Focus, the refund was slow in coming and I was not reimbursed for the return shipping. I eventually got the refund and Amazon reimbursed for the shipping after I complained.<br/><br/>The camera was in short supply and I wanted it badly for an upcoming assignment (a paying photography gig), so I ordered a replacement from Adorama. That one came promptly with a carton full of accessories -- and the camera worked perfectly out of the box. On to the review of the Panasonic ZS100:<br/><br/>I like it... I really like it. I have had several Panasonic ZS series cameras starting with the ZS7, but the last one I got (the ZS50) was not nearly as good as I expected. It's photos were just fair at best, although video was pretty good. I loved the size and the long zoom (30x) but the lens added distortion and artifacts, especially when zoomed all the way in. I knew what I needed: I wanted to trade some zoom length for a bigger sensor. That's exactly what the ZS100 is, and it works much as I expected.<br/><br/>The Panasonic ZS100 has a "1-inch" sensor, which works out to a diagonal of about 16mm. That doesn't sound that big, but it has something like four times the area of the sensor in the ZS50 (which is a 1/2.3 inch sensor). More area means bigger pixels that have better light gathering ability, which means lower noise and higher resolution from less optical interference. This sounds complex, but I can tell you that it works -- the ZS100 takes much better photos and much better video than the ZS50. Of course, it costs quite a bit more.<br/><br/>What I like about photos from the ZS100:<br/><br/>-Excellent clarity and color<br/>-Much better in low light than a small-sensor camera. The ZS100 really is usable to ISO1600.<br/>-The flash on the ZS100 is excellent. It's a pop-up flash that lines up with the lens almost exactly, eliminating ugly flash shadows.<br/>-Even though the lens is f5.9 when zoomed all the way in, I still get excellent bokah. Check one of my images below.<br/>-At 20 megapixels, there is plenty of resolution for my applications, which includes magazine publishing.<br/><br/>What I don't like about photos from the ZS100:<br/><br/>-The lens is not as good as the removable Panasonic lenses I have for my GX8 Micro-FourThirds camera. Lens quality seems to be the limiting factor on the ZS100<br/>-The auto focus doesn't always find the right focus, even when the subjects are in the clear and seemingly obvious.<br/><br/>I want to re-iterate what I said about the flash on the ZS100: This is the best flash I have seen on a pocketable camera, and I have owned about 10 such cameras over the years. It reaches out 15 feet or so with good illumination and the results look natural. Because it's a pop-up flash, it is virtually impossible to accidentally cover it with a finger. (It was much too easy to accidentally cover the flash on the ZS50.)<br/><br/>I complained about the autofocus on the ZS100 and you might think that I could just use manual focus. I do use manual focus and it is easy to use, but it's just not as fast as touching the shutter button to get a focus. I love that the ZS100 has a convenient manual focus, which I find especially useful for video shooting -- more about that in a moment.<br/><br/>As for my photography assignment, I completed it with the ZS100 with good results. A couple of these photos are shown below.<br/><br/>Now onto the ZS100's video capabilities. I actually shoot video more than I do photos, so I was really excited to get the ZS100 for its 4K video capability.<br/><br/>Here's what I like about the Panasonic ZS100's video:<br/><br/>-4K video quality is excellent, and HD (1080p) is even better.<br/>-The format the ZS100 uses for 4K video (100 Mbps MP4) plays back on all my computers with minimal complaint. I can even take the raw video files and play them on my Hisense 4K TV. That has a REAL "wow" factor!<br/>-When shooting 4K video, the lens works out to be 37mm to 370mm, and I like the 370mm telephoto. Having 37mm at the wide end is not so good.<br/>-Although no one has mentioned it that I've seen, the ZS100 will record 1080p at 120 fps for nice slow motion. Yes, it will do 120 fps at 1080p -- very nice. When shooting at 1080p, either slow-motion or normal speed, the zoom range is 31mm to 310mm.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't like about the ZS100's video:<br/><br/>-Again, the lens is not as good as the MUCH more expensive lenses I have for the Panasonic GX8. As with photos, the lens quality limits the ultimate quality of the images. They just don't look quite as pristine as the photos and videos I get from the GX8, although the ZS100 does fine with both. (The cheapest lens I have for the GX8 costs as much as the ZS100 camera, so this is not a surprise.)<br/>-There's no jack for external audio.<br/>-Having the widest shot be 37mm (31mm at 1080p).<br/><br/>For a pocketable camera, the ZS100 does a great job with photos and video, although a tick below the similarly priced Panasonic LX100. On the other hand, the LX100 has just a 3x lens, although higher quality... decisions, decisions.<br/><br/>Ergonomics and handling:<br/><br/>The ZS100 is chunkier and noticeably heavier than the ZS50. The ZS100 will easily fit in a jacket pocket and will even go in a roomy pants pocket, but you'll notice it. I carried it for four days at a big convention, where I took dozens of photos for publication. It was in the pocket of my sport coat and was not a problem there at all.<br/><br/>The 3-inch touch screen display on the ZS100 is excellent, and I quickly adapted to the touch screen after not having one on the ZS50. The ZS100 also has a small but useful eyepiece (electronic) viewfinder that is wonderful when shooting outdoors or when I need the added stability of holding the camera to my face. The eyepiece viewfinder has just enough pixels to be useful -- as far as I can tell, the ZS100's eyepiece viewfinder is identical to the viewfinder on the ZS50.<br/><br/>The other buttons and controls on the ZS100 are in logical locations, although there is a knob on top of the camera that I don't really see the need for. I can probably assign it to do something I regularly use, such as exposure, but I haven't yet done that. It's just there and does nothing at the moment.<br/><br/>Overall, I like the size, photo quality and video quality of the ZS100 quite a bit. I wish the auto focus was better, but I very much enjoy the lower noise and higher sensitivity of the ZS100, as compared to the ZS50. It does exactly what I expected the larger sensor to do. And the flash -- I'm very happy with the flash on the ZS100, despite the fact that it shoots only straight forward and can't be pointed anywhere else.<br/><br/>Below are a couple photos from the ZS100. Amazon won't let me post a link to a video, but if you go to YouTube and search on my name (Bob Kovacs) and ZS100, you will find multiple videos that I've shot with the ZS100. I also have a l-o-n-g video review of the ZS100, and a comparison video: ZS100 vs. the Panasonic LX100. One nice recent video I shot with the ZS100 is on Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day 2016. Go to YouTube and search on "arlington cemetery memorial day 2016 zs100" and you'll find it.<br/><br/>I recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100, and appreciate Amazon's customer service for making right the initial problem I had.</span>

<span>The two uploaded photos are of the same section of landscape, one zoomed out (24mm) and the other fully zoomed in (360mm).<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Got this to avoid carrying my dlsr and lenses on hikes, and to do time lapse of sunrises and sunsets.<br/><br/>Step 1: Throw away the (junk/out of date) user guide in the box right after you open it once to scan the qr code to download the excellent user manual.<br/><br/>Step2:  Install (under the same cover as the battery) a 128gb or less SD card<br/><br/>Step 3: Charge the battery (charging port under the same small cover as the hdmi port)<br/><br/>Step 4: Set the wheel to iA+ (fully automatic shutter speed/exposure f stop) and if desired set the drive mode to burst with burst speed set to slow (2 shots per second if/while you hold down the shuttter release).<br/><br/>Step 5: Turn it on, point and shoot.<br/><br/>What actually prompted me to make this purchase is that I went on a great hike with views where I took a good number of pictures with my (decent) Samsung A71 5G UW smartphone Camera, but afterward found that the pictures didn't have anywhere close to sufficient resolution to want to print - or even share, *especially the zoomed in ones* - which was painfully dissapointing.<br/><br/>In comparison, the ZS200 displays markedly superior picture quality - staggeringly better when zoomed.<br/><br/>(Among other things, a good lesson/reminder on the merits of optical vs. digital zoom).<br/><br/>So far (10 days/1050 pictures later) I am overall quite pleased with this camera. The size, weight, picture quality and particularly the zoomed picture quality make the purchase price more than worth it for me. I remove the top portion of the camera case (not included, see below) when I go hiking, throw the cover strap over my shoulder and I'm finding it fairly quick to grab, turn on and shoot without having to remove the shoulder strap. After some practice, I find I am also able to do that one handed which is a plus, as I often have both my trekking poles in my other hand.<br/><br/>All that is to say I think I'll have a fair chance to get some opportunistic/fleeting shots of wildlife using this setup if and when they present themselves.<br/><br/>The camera does have a multitude of features and settings that I really haven't played with in the week or so since I got it, but it is quite a sophisticated piece of compact engineering.<br/>It's fairly deep into "real camera" territory for those who want to manage their own depth of field/shutter speed etc, so don't mistake it for the severely limited point and shoots of yesteryear.<br/><br/>One note about time lapse that I couldn't find in the user manual:<br/><br/>If you use a shot interval &gt; 30 seconds for time lapse photography, the camera will retract the lens barrel every shot, darken the display, then extend the lens barrel and turn on the display for the next shot.<br/>I had to try different shot intervals to determine where the barrel stays put for the duration (&lt;= 30 seconds) but when I originally set it to 150 shots at 1 minute intervals I observed the barrel extending and retracting each shot (150 times per time lapse series).<br/>I for one don't want to put that much wear and tear on the lens barrel stepper motor and parts, so I'll only use 30 seconds or less for a time lapse interval, but it seemed like something Panasonic should have spelled out in their manual (searched and couldn't find anything about that operation).<br/>Of note is I did have the lens set partially zoomed (~110mm) when I observed this, but I really don't believe that was a factor.<br/><br/>Also bought and reccommend<br/><br/>Mini Tripod for Camera,Zomei Travel Table Tripod with 3-Way Pan/Tilt Head 1/4 inches Quick Release Plate and Bag for DSLR Camera<br/>(THIS TRIPOD IS ONLY 20.5" FULLY EXTENDED)<br/><br/>SanDisk 128GB Extreme PRO SDXC UHS-I Card - C10, U3, V30, 4K UHD, SD Card<br/><br/>MegaGear Ever Ready Genuine Leather Camera Case Compatible with Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100, DC-ZS200<br/>(IF YOU LIKE LEATHER, RETRO STYLE COVERS)<br/><br/>For me, the only downside (more aptly the cheap side) I will mention that the battery cover latch and the charging/hdmi port cover feel a bit flimsy to me, but I couldn't possibly justify dropping my review score by a star due to to those two largely aesthetic details.</span>

<span>I was a Nikon shooter and have owned several DSLR bodies and lenses. But ever since the iPhones came out, I just wasn't using all of my "good" photography equipment as often as I should. The iPhone cameras had become "good-enough" for what I photograph (school events, concerts, vacations, family, etc...). Currently, I carry an iPhone 6 and feel that its picture quality has exceeded most 2/3" sensor point-and-shoot cameras. Still -  I often miss the detail of the DSLR sensor, clarity of true optical zoom, and the DSLR's superior low-light capability.<br/><br/>That's where this Panasonic fits in. I've been looking for a pocketable travel camera that can bridge the gap between an iPhone 6 and my Nikon DSLRs.  My requirements were as follows: small camera body, attached lens (so it can be used at concerts), 1" sensor, and a generous zoom range.<br/><br/>What's so important about the sensor size?  A camera with a larger 1" sensor is able to capture more photo detail with less noise than the usual 2/3" size.  This is most noticeable when taking photos in low light.  The Sony RX 100 III and Canon G7x are the benchmarks for the 1" sensor cameras, but I needed a longer zoom in order to shoot concerts, and sports.  As far as I can tell, the Panasonic is unique in this price range for the combination of the 1" sensor and longer-than-the-competition zoom.<br/><br/>Likes:<br/>* Solid Feel<br/>* standard micro-USB cable<br/>* Larger 1" sensor (larger than the majority of point-and-shoot models)<br/>* Longest zoom in this price range amongst its peers<br/>* RAW+JPG option<br/>* 4K Video<br/>* Touchscreen<br/>* Electronic Viewfinder<br/>* physical lens-ring control<br/>* thumb-wheel control<br/>* Smartphone integration (I can only test the iPhone app) - Live real-time camera controls, transfer photos and videos, GPS tagging<br/>* Fast menus<br/>* Fast focus<br/>* Custom White Balance<br/>* Full manual controls<br/>* Customizable Dials<br/>* Create features such as Post Focus and 4K Photo<br/><br/>Dislikes:  (these are really first-world problems)<br/>* no flash hot shoe (but its competitors may not have one either)<br/>* no external microphone option (but its competitors may not have one either)<br/>* It barely fits in my front-jeans pocket.  I have to be careful not to scratch it with the metal rivet on the jeans<br/><br/>Panasonic has this very interesting feature called Post Focus. The camera will rapid fire a series of shots using different focal points and let the user choose what to focus on AFTER the picture has been taken. Another unique feature is 4K Photo, the camera will basically take 4K video and let you extract high-quality 4K stills from the stream. I can see this being extremely useful with fast moving kids and pets.<br/><br/>I plan to add more to this review in the future...but for now, I've attached some photos samples.  I've also included a size comparison between the iPhone 6 and Panasonic.  As well as low-light comparison shots between the iPhone 6 and Panasonic in a poorly lit room. All shots including the low-light shots were hand-held without a tripod.<br/><br/>So far, every camera feature appears to work as advertised. There were comments on another website about wifi problems, I had none.  The wireless bridge between the camera and iPhone worked every time.  Note: I do have a dual-band router and although the 2.4Ghz channel was found, the 5Ghz was not. That may be why it didn't matter in my place.</span>

With thorough research I wanted to make sure I got a camera that was good and worth the money I would be spending. Not only does this camera have great zoom and focus but also the settings gives you great range. The battery lasts pretty much all day, it's pretty easy to navigate without instructions, and it's nice and compact. Love this camera!</span>

<span>Never owned a camera before but I heard a lot good things about this one. The 60x zoom on it is great for taking pictures of birds though the focus on smaller bugs isn’t that great it kind of focuses them out. It also takes  good quality videos, would be great for vlogging. For the price it’s unbeatable I highly recommend !</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ300 (FZ300) is the successor to the LUMIX FZ200 (FZ200), which amazed the world with its outstanding lens performance with full range F2.8 aperture (35mm camera equivalent: 25-600mm). Expanding on the innovation of the FZ200, the LUMIX FZ300 is also capable of 4K ultra high definition which enables 4K Photo and 4K video recording. The stunningly fast F2.8 aperture with 600mm which makes it possible to clearly capture moving subjects at a high shutter speed even at a great distance has not been achieved by any digital compact camera except for the LUMIX FZ200. The splash and dust proof capability make the LUMIX FZ300 the all-around great camera for sports, outdoor and events. The 12.1-megapixel High Sensitivity MOS sensor and the new Venus Engine image processor enable users to shoot high quality images even at higher sensitivity, recording up to ISO 6400 with higher resolution and superior color reproduction. 4K is the advanced definition of video imagery that boasts stunning detail. The LUMIX FZ300 is capable of recording smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K video in 3840x2160 at 30p (60Hz) or 24p in MP4. Taking advantage of 4K video recording performance, users can capture fleeting photo opportunities at 30 fps in 8-megapixel equivalent resolution. Three new, exclusive functions are newly integrated to capture very brief or unexpected photo opportunities; 4K Burst Shooting, 4K Burst S/S (Start/Stop) and 4K Pre-burst.

<span>The zoom, auto focus, and stabilization are great. It does seem that stabilization takes a hit on 4k. Likely turns off the software element and only does physical OIS during 4k (at least this is what I've heard around the internet and what seems true from my results). But the 1080p footage is just stellar whether you're handheld shooting action in wide and quickly following subjects... Or rigging up a tripod, zooming in, and try to dial in very specific framed shots.<br/><br/>The lens hood could use some refinement. This thing constantly wants to spin off on me. Simply brushing it with your arm can spin it off and ruin your next shot when you see a bunch of cropping from an off center hood. That said, I still recommend shooting with it on those sunny days, if not every day.<br/><br/>Overall feel is great. I do NOT drop this camera. I do use a neck strap and have a wrist strap available if need be but I could comfortably use this free hand and feel confident in its design and how it handles. Haven't quite tested its weather sealing feature but I'm much more confident near the ocean, in a light rain, etc. then I would be with a standard entry level Nikon or Canon with no environmental sealing.<br/><br/>Sadly, shutter button could use refinement. Would love to hear how others felt but the half click is mushy as whipped mashed potatoes. This can lead to various awkward moments like accidentally taking a photo while trying to set focus and then if you have photo review on you can potentially miss a shot because of it. Other buttons feel quite good. I wish video record was slightly bigger, but otherwise I've never had an issue turning it off and on correctly. Obviously I would LOVE some kind of 'fake' lens ring to replace the zoom and focus dials... Again, slight refinement here could go a long way but making imitation lens ring dials for these features would be an AMAZING improvement. Otherwise, it can take a while to adjust to these dials.<br/><br/>The tiny sensor works a treat during the day, or in appropriate lighting, but lord help you if you plan to film at night or indoors without a quality light source. It's a wrap. It won't happen. If you have a good phone camera or even a GoPro, use that. Because those dinky sensors are somehow still better (likely due to software enhancement).<br/><br/>Simply put. I knew I wasn't getting a DSLR with a proper imaging sensor. I wanted a cheap camera with a zoom lens and other common DSLR-like features that I wasn't gonna cry about if it fell down a cliff or into the ocean. Luckily neither has happened and I've just been enjoying one of the best budget cameras of all time.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is my fourth Sony camera and easily my 10th digital and roughly 20th camera (counting both film and digital). It's a beauty, and as many have commented on these pages and elsewhere (such as DPReview), a significant improvement on the earlier generations of the RX100 (better sensor in RX100ii, better lens now in 100iii plus an EVF). I thought it would be hard to top the Sony RX1 as the perfect travel camera (please see my detailed review of the RX1 on Amazon), but I think on balance, this is a better travel camera than even that brilliant piece of full frame ingenuity. Not a better camera mind you, but a better travel camera, when space and size are at a great premium. Its lens and sensor produce images that are not quite as sharp as the RX-1's - but they are not that far off either. And the RX100-III does beat the RX-1 in one critical functional area, in terms of having a useful range of wide to mild telephoto focal lengths. No more zooming with just the feet . . .<br/><br/>Although the RX-100M3 cannot beat the RX-1 or any other full frame camera in overall photo image quality, it is superior in relationship to video quality to the RX-1/A99/A77-65 (and many other APS-C and FF DSLRs), where the improved Bionz X processor in the RX100III allows for a way better sampling heuristic (instead of the clumsy line skipping approach done in the RX1, A99, and all the other recent APS-C cameras). It's also astonishingly flexible in terms of shooting modes and operational styles, and additionally, Sony's improved image stabilization gives it a ~2 stop advantage, narrowing the low light performance gap between this sensor and a full frame sensor but without image stabilization (such as seen in the RX1) to basically nothing by allowing the RX100-III to shoot at slower shutter speeds, and thus keeping ISO lower. I'm able to shoot wide open at a 24 mm equivalent in low light at 1/5 second shutter speed, often without any image blurring, keeping my ISO relatively low and basically wiping out much of the low light advantage of the RX-1 FF sensor. It still of course doesn't quite create images that are as breathtaking as full frame equipment (still less dynamic range and color depth) - that is not a hittable or realistic performance target, but it comes amazingly close, and with only slightly more noise as ISO rises compared to the APS-C Sony sensor in a Sony A65 (although that camera was clearly no low light phenom). It might be slightly less noisy in RAW than the A65 at 3200 and 6400 - but they are certainly close.  This is mighty impressive, given that this sensor is much smaller than an APS-C chip (but RX100's sensor is newer than the A65's).  It's not quite one stop noisier than the newer Sony APS-C sensor in my A77II in head to head testing (The new A77ii is roughly 1 stop better sensor in terms of noise compared to the previous generation chip in the A65). This is still a mighty fine performance.<br/><br/>What this means is that there is a (roughly) one stop noise jump from these various levels of sensor size: most cell phone sensors &gt; most compact cameras &gt; RX-100 (and several other large sensor compacts) &gt; newer APS-C (A6000/Nikon5300) &gt; full frame (FF) RX1/Nikon600 &gt; Sony A7s.  Each level is a significant jump in low light performance, and thus impacts and limits you on exposure, shutter speed, and the whole range of shooting options. While noise/high ISO performance initially sounds like a lot of techno-obscurity that only geeks would care about or understand, it's really indicative of what basic physical restrictions there are on your creative options as a photographer. Not only that, and less appreciated by the average person, as noise does up, dynamic range, color depth, and virtually every other parameter that might index picture quality goes down in a linear and direct ratio.  That's why noise and high ISO performance is so important.  All this underscores also that the size of the sensor is critical - and kudos to Sony for its continual efforts to stuff the biggest sensor it can into smaller (and smaller) camera bodies.<br/><br/>All this just means simply that this camera has phenomenal low light performance, FOR ITS SIZE.  Its low light performance is simply way ahead of every other compact its size, and is reasonably competitive with much larger cameras (such as m4/3 and APS-C where its noise is roughly one stop poorer than the best of the m4/3-APS-c crowd, and about two stops poorer than a typical FF pro-cam).  The formal noise testing that I just did (comparing this to both an A77ii and RX1 in RAW) confirms this and shows it almost exactly two stops behind an RX-1.  This is still mighty impressive, and with Sony's improved IS system giving it a 2+ stop advantage, I can do quite a bit of low light shooting, without worrying about noise (or heavy-handed noise reduction in the JPEG engine) wiping out details.  I have to really want low light performance and/or slightly more resolution to lug the big A77ii around with me, and I mostly take the RX100 everywhere.  That it has displaced as exceptional a camera as the RX1 speaks volumes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1) Simply the best photo and video image quality for its size without any question, no contest, end of discussion. Not even debatable.<br/>2) Very sharp video, rivaling Canon full frame 5DII and Panasonic GH2/3/4, and with new video codecs (XAVC-S) that will allow 50mb bit rate. Reduced moire and yet still very sharp.<br/>3) Fast Zeiss lens (1.8-2.8) with a 3X zoom range, covering the essential wide-angle 24 mm to 70 mm equivalent. Some loss of zoom reach relative to prior editions of the RX 100, but in exchange, the lens is significantly faster and goes to 24mm (highly useful), and allows F2.8 shooting at a moderate telephoto 70mm. This extra lens speed/brightness is more important for most individuals than the extra telephoto reach (but some may find this restricting and a bad tradeoff - see cons).<br/>4) Lens is sharp in the corners from F4.0 and up and is decently sharp in the corners even wide open.<br/>5) Comprehensive and flexible menu/operating system structures with considerable customizability. Way better there than previous generation Cybershot models. I'm totally baffled by the DP Review feedback that the camera is 'uninvolving' - might be the most friendly compact camera for the intermediate-to-advanced user, and can be easily pushed into many shapes and styles of operating.<br/>6) Fits in your shirt pocket.  Try that with your m4/3 or APS-C camera.<br/>7) Wifi and NFC (but see cons).  Here's a real head twister:  the version of Play Memories software that runs on this camera is orders of magnitude better and more useful than the version that runs on the A77II (Sony's flagship APS-C system).<br/>8) Excellent image stabilizing in both video and stills, with highly flexible IS in video (three levels with associated progressively larger crop factors). This also means that video can be shot at a ~ 100mm perspective (albeit with modest loss of resolution). Excellent photo IS that is transparent and highly effective.<br/>9) Terrific little EVF with decent apparent view size (~0.6 - while the flagship A99 EVF is 0.7), and with adjustable brightness and display features vis a vis the LCD. Very neat and highly useful.<br/>10) Bright and accurate LCD panel for viewing results (and shooting, if you don't like composing with the EVF).<br/>11) Many aids for the videographer, including adjustable zebra to see areas of overexposure, option to change ISO and aperture on the fly with smooth front ring control while shooting, and HDMI output to an external recorder, but see last con (omission of 4K).<br/>12) As an undocumented but very neat feature, flash head can be tilted up by hand to create impromptu bounce flash, with its usual smoothing of light and more natural appearance (but with limited range and power - see cons).<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1) Limited telephoto reach and of course no option to change lenses. Partially mitigated by modest digital zoom capacity (smooth segue from 1.1-2.0) but with predictable/proportional loss of resolution. Obviously will not compete with compact superzooms in this area. Not the camera for bird watchers and wildlife buffs!<br/>2) Cost - this might be one of the most expensive cameras on a dollar per pound basis on the market.<br/>3) Modest battery life, esp if you use the neat little EVF much, and once again, Sony did not provide a second battery. I thought initially Sony finally provided an external charger but its clear now that I jumped to conclusions. Still no option for external charging - (but check out Wasabi power!)<br/>4) Did I mention it's $800?<br/>5) No option that I can find for scaling the zoom speed, which is a bit confining and unexpected in a premium compact camera<br/>6) Audible motor noise in the video during zooming (but at fairly low level).<br/>7) Slightly hesitant auto focus in low light with some annoying hunting.<br/>8) It is so compact that those with large hands may find it hard to manipulate.<br/>9) Flash seems a bit underpowered for those coming from larger equipment. Will not adequately illuminate objects 6-8 ft away at ISO 100. No option for outboard flash, as hot shoe sacrificed for EVF.<br/>10) Real disappointment that 4K video not included, as on new Panasonic superzoom using this Sony chip. Firmware update probably can't provide this. Suspect Sony didn't want to take sales away from their new and pricy 4K camcorder.<br/>11) Sony AWB still struggles with fluorescent and tungsten lighting?  You would think that they would have this figured out by now??<br/>12) Mildly annoying automatic camera shutoff when retracting the EVF - commented on by many - probably easily fixed in firmware update as toggle function.  Also, rather short time frame to retract lens when looking at existing images. Also easily fixed with user adjustable setting.<br/>13) No touchscreen, which is a disappointment to those fond of such a control interface.<br/>14) Clickless control dial in front?  Again, a matter of personal taste and preference.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/><br/>Having as many cons as pros doesn't mean that I don't absolutely love this camera.  Most of the cons are minor, while most of the pros are big. Several are huge (great video, great photos, and highly flexible and configurable OS).  Still not perfect (no technology is without compromises), but this is clearly the most powerful photographic and videographic instrument of its size that anyone has ever made. Time will tell, but I think that this camera threatens the established order and the doctrine that all reasonably serious shooting requires big honkin' DLSR gear as much as anything Sony has done previously, even including the RX1/A7/A7r platforms (their elite FF mirrorless alternatives). And please, all you FF folks, don't get all bent out of shape - I'm not remotely suggesting that this little camera will supplant or compete with pro equipment in still photography. But it will mean that outside of the most critical and hi quality still shooting, this camera will provide a very credible alternative for those who want to travel (extra) light and still get very good stills - leaving a slim margin between this and large APS-C gear  . . . with a slightly greater margin between this and even larger FF gear.  Those modest IQ (image quality) margins now look like they have a really punitive weight penalty, still obviously worth paying for really critical shooting, but how many people want 20-30lbs of extra gear on vacation, toting it all through security lines?  Not too many who aren't shooting for a living.  And in terms of great video, this camera competes favorably with any FF system. Even those who love their big pro gear and would never dream of moving off of FF entirely are probably going to buy one for days when they just can't (or don't want to) lug the 30+lb bag of big gear and bigger lenses. This camera continues Sony's brilliant success in shoehorning the biggest possible sensor they can cram into a small body, like their fine effort in the RX1, but bests even that brilliant effort in flexibility, portability, 'zoomability' and video-ability.  Overall, this little camera is a tour de force in digital technology and is likely to represent a TARDIS-like benchmark in the evolution of digital photography. Highly, highly recommended!<br/><br/>Update Oct 2014<br/><br/>New Canon PowerShot G7X (first real competition for the RX-100 III) finally has some formal testing.  Scores slightly better than the RX100 in DxO testing (but the difference is not likely to be meaningful in terms of anything one can see in actual photos).  Clearly has a Sony sensor (Canon probably got tired of people grousing about their poor scores in DxO testing.)  Sony will sell their sensors to anyone, even their stiffest competition.<br/><br/>Advantages of the Canon G7X<br/><br/>1) $100 cheaper<br/>2) Longer reach/brighter lens<br/>3) Better IS (worth ~ 3 stops!)<br/>4) More external control options (dedicated control dials)<br/>5) Touchscreen (big for some, just not for me)<br/><br/>Advantages of the Sony RX100-III<br/><br/>1) EVF vs. just an LCD view screen<br/>2) Better movie support/video quality and shooting options (Zebra, focus peaking, 24perf, 120p, XACS codecs)<br/>3) Slightly faster focusing and ~ maybe slightly sharper lens (but not by much)<br/>4) WAAAAY better battery life<br/>5) Way better smartphone interface and WiFi functionality<br/>6) Better lens (sharper by all accounts)<br/><br/>So if you need the reach, don't need or want the EVF, and movies are largely a secondary or even minimal consideration, or want a slightly brighter lens (which combined with the better IS might give you ~ a 1.5 stop advantage in low light) the Canon looks like the better deal and the better camera.  If, on the other hand, you like composing in the EVF (I do), like to shoot lots of movies and get really high quality video (ditto), and don't care that much about the loss of telephoto reach, or you need more battery life, or want good smartphone control, the Sony might be the better choice.  It's great to have options. In any case, Sony finally has competition in this segment!  Competition is good for everyone.  Keeps prices down and quality up.  Maybe it will force Sony to lower their price, just as they had to do with the RX-10 after the Panasonic FZ1000.<br/><br/>Update:  The RX100IV has taken all of this camera's virtues and added 1) 4k in body; 2) high frame rate video; 3) slightly upgraded JPEG engine; 4) modestly improved EVF; 5) modestly improved AF, but for significantly more money ($950 vs. $800).  If those, particularly 4k, are worth it, I would recommend the RX100IV.  If you don't shoot 4k and don't plan on ever using that due to its space hogging nature, then this is still a great buy.  Most would probably value the extra functionality in the M4 version, and I plan to upgrade myself at some point.  The only bummer is that 4k is limited to 5 minutes to prevent overheating.  Not much space in this small and densely packed camera for much heat dissipation.</span>

<span>This is the professional's compact camera, IMO. If you're a photographer who wants a small camera for those times you don't want to lug all your big equipment around, this is the way to go. You give up a little, of course. But, you get a helluva lot in such a small package. You can still shoot in RAW. Fully manual capability is available as is bracketing, white balance, and most importantly, a really awesome lens. Plus, the flash is adjustable, so you can bounce it off a celling if you want! Even my DSLR can't do that!<br/><br/>It has a lot of customization as well. I think any photographer will appreciate the flexibility the customization capabilities allow. If anything, there are so many options that it may take you a while to decide how you want to customize it. I know I've tried a few different customizations already and I'm still not sure I have it set exactly how I want it yet.<br/><br/>One other feature I love is the flip screen. This is not a feature I put any weight on when I was making the purchase either because, well, photographers generally don't do selfies. But, my husband and I get almost no vacation shots, hell no shots of any type, together and this camera has changed that. I carry it with me almost everywhere I go and I'm getting into the habit of snapping at least one photo of us together almost any time we're out. I'm delighted that we're now going have memory shots from so many places!<br/><br/>It does have some cons. It's challenging to do manual focus if your subject is off center or if there's a lot in the image and you want the camera focused on a specific element that has things in front or in back of it. I'm not sure if this is a learning curve thing for me or not, but I've only found one way to do an exact manual focus and I don't like it at all. It's quite challenging making it happen and could not be done quickly. But, there may be a better way to do this that I just haven't figured out. (The user's manual leaves a lot to be desired.)<br/><br/>Other cons: The display stays on too much, even when using the viewfinder. The viewfinder is a great feature, but I find I don't use it that often, parially because there is little battery savings from doing so, partially due to the viewfinder's design. Mind you, I'm a photographer who uses the viewfinder almost excusively on my DSLR. It's my oreferred way to shoot. On this one though, I have to pop it up and then pull it out. The little pull out part can sometimes be pushed in, which is a pain and could result in a lost shot if it occurs at the wrong time. I'm also always concerned about carrying it with that pop up viewfinder out, afraid it's going to get hit or accidentally knocked into something. So I want to push it in for walking around. Well, that shuts off the whole camera. A huge pain. So, rather than shutting the camera off constantly and then turning it on again, I end up using the screen more than the viewfinder. This would have been a 5 star review if not for this one thing. That said, this is much smaller than my DSLR, so camera shake is less of a problem, even when holding it away from my face. Plus, the display is bright enough in almost all conditions.<br/><br/>But, other than those couple of things, this camera is both a dream and a beast of a compact camera. As I said in the beginning, it's really a pro's compact camera. I think it's probably a bit much both in capability and price for a point-and-shoot user though, unless you just have lots of money to spend. Then go for it. However, I will say that I've tried the point and shoot setting. It works okay, maybe better than most point and shoots. But, I'm just guessing as I have not compared it to others. For me, I find I can usually get better shots if I shoot in manual mode. Your milage may vary.</span>

<span>I bought the RX100 in its original configuration a few years ago when it first came out. I liked the camera from the outset and have taken more than a few pictures with it that I am really happy with. It is my choice for backing up my Nikon D4 or D800 when I can't deal with taking along two large DSLRs. I took a look at DXO mark and they rate the sensor the same as the sensor for my old D200 which may sound like damning with faint praise but the D200 was a workhorse and shot a lot of great stuff. I will say at the outset that I like the M3 a lot. I am happy I upgraded from the original but I think that if you have the M2 you may not need this update. The faster lens is a noticeable improvement. Indoor shots without flash at reasonable ISO's are much more feasible now.<br/><br/>Updated 6/24/14 - I thought I would add a comment about a statement from the dpreview piece on the M3. Dpreview praises the cameras abilities and then go on to say that it is not "fun" to shoot with. I guess an old SX-70 may have been more fun with all the whirring and spitting of prints but beyond that I am at a loss. I have had great creative session with both the M1 and M3. In fact, one of my favorite things about the camera is that is so easy and transparent to handle.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Articulating LCD - I think this is a huge improvement over the original RX100. The ability to easily shoot high or low angle pictures is a great advantage. I have always liked using compact cameras from the ant's eye view and this makes it a lot easier to do. Like most of the construction of the RX100m3, the articulating LCD feels well built but clearly this is not a ruggedized camera. Care must be taken with the flash, EVF and LCD or damage could result. Things don't feel cheap they just don't feel "battle ready"<br/><br/>Picture Quality - I really like the output of the RX100M3. The pictures are sharp, vivid and relatively free of noise at moderate ISO settings. One of the big improvements in the area of low light is the enhanced widest aperture of the lens. One can pixel peep any lens into a corner (no pun intended) but Sony has done a very respectable job here. I will discuss this more later but by going with a fast, modest zoom with a nice wide end, Sony has created a more enthusiast oriented camera. As Robert Capa said, "If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough."<br/><br/>Zoom - As mentioned above the zoom range is modest. I just really like the ability to use 24mm equivalent at the wide end. The zoom speed is quite good. Again, I think it compares favorably to other high-end compacts that I have used.<br/><br/>EVF - When I opened the EVF for the first time and look through it was terrible. Then I adjusted the diopter and it was beautiful. Seriously beautiful. This is my first EVF and I like it very much. I can see using it a great deal with this camera.<br/><br/>Shutter - The shutters drops very quickly without any undue lag. I really like the burst mode on this camera with the shutter sounds turned off. It is a great way to get very natural candids of friends and family.<br/><br/>Neutrals:<br/><br/>Weight - The RX100M3 is noticeably heavier than the original. Noticeably but not significantly heavier. Yes, when you pick it up you are just a touch more cognizant of gravities pull but nowhere near the point where you would leave on the table because it's too heavy to deal with. When carrying and using the camera the extra weight never crossed my mind.<br/><br/>Size - Certainly related to weight but also a function of adding goodies like the EVF and articulating LCD. I wear a lot of clothes with big pockets and I have never been one to just stuff a compact camera in a pants pocket on an ongoing basis. I have a very small Lowepro belt case for my original RX100 and the new one fits perfectly even with an extra battery tucked inside. The size and weight differences are certainly discreet.<br/><br/>Added 6/22/14 The current implementation of the Fn button is very nice. I really didn't use this button in the past but now it brings up a very clear, easy to follow UI for the some of the most commonly accessed functions. I really like this feature.<br/><br/>Added 6/22/14 I am growing very fond of the artificial horizon in the EVF. Despite 30+ years of photography I am still amazed how often in Lightroom I have to straighten the horizon. Maybe my head is just tilted. Whatever the cause, the artificial horizon really helps and as a result I am not losing any of the frame having to rotate in post.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Menus - While the menu system on the M3 is improved and certainly better than the old NEX software it could still use improvement. My biggest complaint has to do with navigating between menu categories and sub-menus. To me the UI manipulation is not intuitive but is certainly workable.<br/><br/>Functions - Marketing people are wonderful and I know scene modes and scene recognition must be important to some segment of customers but I am not in that demographic. I suppose there is little harm in all the bells and whistles but it is very funny that Sony includes both an Automatic and Superior Automatic mode. When does one say, "I don't want the superior results, let me kick this baby down to stinky normal Automatic mode."<br/><br/>Items on which the jury is still out.<br/><br/>Wi-fi - I know there are people who can't wait for the favorite camera to come out with built in wi-fi so it can't be dismissed. I would only say that thus far my experience with the RX100M3's wi-fi functions have been cursory and I will amend this review when I am able to be more definitive about my experience.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this camera?<br/><br/>For a lot of people yes I would. If you are an enthusiast this is a credible compact contender. If you are an ultralight traveller who likes good photos this is also a good choice. If you are thinking of some for an adventure vacation with water, snow, sand or surf, probably better to look at a ruggedized compact. Up until the RX100 all my compacts had been Canon's and they were great. I am happy with the move to Sony and believe I will be happy with the M3 for several years.</span>

<span>Debated whether or not to go with the MKII, MKIII, or MKIV for a while.  Finally decided on the MKIII because while the extra features like the improved slowmo capabilities at up to 1000fps, super fast shutter speed a 1/32000, an improved resolution EVF, 4k video recording, and generally improved image quality from the stacked CMOS sensor are fantastic, they weren’t justified for intended use at the cost of $200 more.  This camera is intended as a high quality point and shoot travel camera and in that realm it succeeds without the added cost for the MKIV.<br/><br/>The build quality is fantastic although from my research and what I can tell, this camera is not weather sealed which would have of course been preferred.  Other than that, the metal construction feels solid, the flip out screen feels sturdy enough, and the customizable ring is very smooth and functional.  For the most part the buttons are easy enough to press but like others have mentioned, the video record button can either be pressed inadvertently or sometimes hard to get to when you need it.<br/><br/>The menu is typical for Sony cameras and although I’m used to it having used other Sony cameras, I can understand that it would feel a bit clunky to others who aren’t used to it.  For those new to Sony cameras, it can definitely take a while to get comfortable and familiar with but it will be in your best interest to learn it and customizing your buttons well.<br/><br/>The image quality and video quality are outstanding.  I have not used other high end point and shoot style cameras besides this but I use the A6300 with some decent lenses and I can say that you can take pictures with quality much closer to the A6300 than any other $200-$400 point and shoot.  I don’t want to get into image quality too much because there are a lot of places you can go for very in depth reviews on the image quality but let me just say that it is fantastic.  If you’re coming from a typical point and shoot camera you will be amazed at what this little camera is capable of.<br/><br/>Deciding between the MKIII and the MKII was a little difficult as well.  At the time I bought the MKIII, the MKII was $250 less.  Part of the reason I went with the MKIII was because of the EVF and the fact that I didn’t plan on using the hotshoe on the MKII.  I’d say for the most part just snapping pictures, the LCD screen is fine and easier to use but sometimes there is just too much sun or you really want to look closely and review a shot to make sure you got good focus.  While I steered away from the super slowmo on the MKIV I did want the ability to do some slowmo which the MKIII seemed to have over the MKII.<br/><br/>One thing that made it tricky was the fact that the MKIII loses some zoom range going to 24-70(35mm equivalent) from the 28-100 on the MKII.  I do think having better wide angle is more important for this type of camera but it is still somewhat unfortunate for it to lose so much zoon in my opinion.  It does keep the aperture down to f2.8 at 70mm compared to the f4 at the same focal length of the MKII so it does stay pretty bright at the long end which is a major plus for me.<br/><br/>There are a few things I’d like to see a little different on this camera.  First off, the price is a little high and considering the price drops after the new versions are released, I thought this might be a little cheaper.  It isn’t a big deal and you really can’t go into the RX100 line thinking that you’re just getting a point and shoot.<br/><br/>Second, I would have loved to see a touch screen on this camera.  In fact, if the MKIV included a touch screen, I would have happily paid the $200 more for a well implemented touch screen.  The touchscreen just makes navigation on the camera so much easier as well as using it to change your focus point.  At the price point I really would have liked to see it, but you can live without it.<br/><br/>Finally, the ergonomics are secondary to style.  They continue with their very minimalist design and while it looks great, the metal clad camera is very slippery and small which makes holding comfortably sometimes a challenge.  I bought the adhesive grip sold by Sony for the RX100 and it is great.  It adds a nice bit of rubbery grip to the right side of the camera and it looks great too.  I wish the camera either came like this already or included the nearly $15 dollar grip in the box.  It wasn’t a deal breaker but it would have been a great addition considering the cost.<br/><br/>This is not a full in depth review of the camera.  If you want tech specs and a full listing of all of the features, there are sites for that because it would take me a long time to go over all of the great features and specs.  This camera is loaded with great features, fantastic specs, and it produces amazing pictures and video.  What I am trying to do here is tell you why I went with the MKIII considering the MKII and MKIV are both available and are both excellent cameras.  I wanted some slowmo video, the better low light capabilities and general image quality, and the EVF which the MKII didn’t have but I didn’t need the super slowmo, 1/32000 shutter speed, and 4k video that the MKIV has.<br/><br/>Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and am very impressed with the photos and video that the RX100 MKIII provides.  I considered giving it 4/5 stars for the reasons I stated but felt that the positives outweighed the negatives by a lot.  If you are not happy with the pictures your standard point and shoot is giving you and don’t really want to take the step to mirrorless or DSLR cameras, this is what you’re looking for and I can easily recommend the RX100 MKIII.  Be aware that there are currently 4 versions of the RX100 ranging in features and value.  I will update my review should I find anything else great or not so great about the camera.</span>

<span>We got this camera for my son to take to sleep away camp, where cameras were encouraged but he couldn't bring "electronics" and wouldn't be able to charge devices. Though I was initially discouraged by the reviews about the poor photo quality, I decided to buy it after reading the headline, "Only slightly better than a disposable camera." Our only other option was a disposable camera and this was a way better option, considering the price, the large number of photos it could hold, and its ability to also take video. It also was the only inexpensive digital camera that used batteries, which was essential in our case.<br/><br/>Sure, the picture quality isn't great but it definitely captured very special memories -- even the memory of the camera accidentally falling into the water and being perfectly fine. (He then took a video as he deliberately jumped in the water holding the camera.) When the camera first arrived we took some test pictures indoors with the flash and they really were quite terrible (a grey wall--and everything else-- appeared orange!) but at camp without a flash the colors look perfectly fine. Close-ups aren't always focused on the intended object. Outdoor, daytime, long-view scenic shots turned out best and are quite nice!<br/><br/>We were able to upload the pictures to our computers and watch the videos with sound (playback on the camera is visual only). It was well worth the price and a much better deal all around than a disposable camera.</span>

<span>This product is good for light easy use. It cannot handle daily or commercial use. It is inexpensive and is worth buying for occasional light use.</span>

<span>How does a camera, when using flash, still produce a blurry image? I wasn't shaking it around. I was standing in place. And it was daytime, near a window. I mean, it's cheap, but wow, it's just bad. Small enough, easy to use. Photos are VERY "meh." Haven't tested the water resistance, don't really care to.</span>
