<span>These are not noise canceling and the are not made to be. They block loud noises that could hurt your hearing, but you can still hear things around you when they are not powered on. Powered on, the two side mics (you can adjust the volume) pick up the tiniest noises in other rooms. They will not compete with, nor are they super directional like military grade headsets (so I have read), but I am really impressed. To cut grass, I had paid more for some av foam earplugs to hear music, but those just really sucked. You plug a male to male 3.5 mm audio cable into your phone/mp3 player and into the head set and you don't need to turn on the headsets. Again, these are not noise canceling, but you can hear the music quite well. Not as great as my Sennheiser headphones (which suck for cutting noise during yard work), but surprisingly good. I had no idea that you could get a pair of range-quality ear protection (have not tried them on the range) that has the super-hearing mics for such a price. I am highly impressed.</span>

<span>I'm writing this review after having had these for maybe two months now. I usually like to wait awhile to write reviews, occasionally I will write one after a short time, like this for instance.  I feel confident writing this review after such a short time because I've used these for everything I've intended to use them for.  So as of right now (9/9/18) this is a performance based review, if any physical/electrical problems arise I'll update. Things will wear out and need to be replaced from time to time, if these wear out from normal use I'm not going to gripe in a review about it, if something goes wrong that shouldn't, I'll add it to my review.<br/><br/>So anyways, I bought these for shooting. I got tired of ear plugs in, ear plugs out, repeat.  I got tired of shouting while wearing earplugs, and not hearing conversations that weren't shouted.  So after a little amazon research, I settled on these. It was between these and the honeywell's. I went with the walkers because the honeywell's 14,000 reviews just seemed a little fishy to me.<br/><br/>So these show up at my house. I take them out of the packaging, put some batteries in, pretty simple, put on and turn them on. I had never used any type of sound amplifying technology before. It is pretty cool. I step outside my garage and I can hear birds chirping all over the place.  Cool.  I go back inside to give the hearing protection aspect part of these a try.  I leave them turned on and fire up the table saw,  pretty much instant cut out of the speakers inside them.  So for garage applications, mainly woodworking, these are great. Comfortable to wear, protect my hearing quite well. The headphone jack is great, my garage has a metal roof, so when it rains, it's super loud. I was out there today with the muffs on and music playing through them l, couldn't hear the rain, it was perfect.<br/><br/>I use them for lawn mowing, playing music through them is again great!<br/><br/>So they're great for lawn mowing, leaf blowing, woodworking, and garage time when it's raining.  But, I bought these mainly for shooting.<br/><br/>So I've taken these out shooting twice. I have shot with these and listened to others shooting.  The sound amplification feature is a game changer. I can hear people talking without them having to shout. I can hear what's going on on the firing line without having to be right next to it.  When the shooting starts, the speaker cuts out just long enough to muffle the initial clap of the gun, but comes back in quick enough to hear the echo of the shot.  Rapid fire shooting isnt a problem with it cutting in and out quickly, it cancels out loud noise regardless of how fast it comes and how much of a pause is in between each shot.  I listened to others shooting mainly handguns and .223 caliber ARs.  More than enough hearing protection for these calibers.  When I started to shoot, i started with a 9mm handgun. Plenty of hearing protection, and with the sound amplification, I could hear my friends talking crap behind me, defenitely a nice feature.  I progressed to an AR, here is where I had my first issue with these, they did get in my way a little bit as far as cheek weld goes. Not as bad as bigger style of muffs go, but it was noticeable. The hearing protection was again adequate. After shooting my AR, I switched to an M1A scout squad, it's a. 308 caliber rifle, with a muzzle break. Muzzle break= super loud. This was the only gun I was worried about hearing protection with these muffs. I was shocked at how well these worked.  Also, surprisingly, these didnt interfere with cheek weld at all like they did with the AR.<br/><br/>Pros:  comfy<br/>Hearing protection is great.<br/>Headphone jack is a great feature and doesnt use the batteries.<br/>Adjustable.<br/>Fold up small when not in use.<br/>Sound amplification is amazing.<br/><br/>Cons: batteries tend to run out.<br/>You cant tell what direction sound is coming from. Could be a hunting issue.<br/>Occasionally get in the way with cheek weld.<br/><br/>Overall I love these and am super happy I finally got on board.  They're just so much better than ear plugs.<br/><br/>If I could do it over I would have bought the bluetooth version just to avoid a cord running to the phone in my pocket.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence. Do it. These are an outstanding product.<br/><br/>Update: I bought a new shotgun and these in no way whatsoever work with it for clay shooting. I shot about forty rounds and it pinched a part of my face to the point where I had to get earplugs because it hurt.  Does this take away from the effectiveness of these. No. I still love them. But they dont work for a gun I plan to shoot a lot. Which is a bummer. But it is what it is and in no way makes me think negatively about these.  Just remember when you're buying these that they may not work with every long gun.</span>

<span>This headset is good enough to protect your hearing against most of the loud noises out there, with a great slim design, amazing lifespan and even an mp3 port (can be plugged if using outdoors). However, I have two complaints. Firstly is that the noise reduction, while adequate for most activities, is not as good as most passive over the ears earpro you find for rent at gun ranges and the like. This is probably just a drawback of the slim design, but it’s still a drawback. The other issue I have is that the sounds produced in the headset are not directional. You can hear everything around you, but it’s impossible to tell where the sound is coming from. It’s like listening to an audio recording of yourself, it’s very disconnected and kinda surreal the first time you try it.</span>

<span>USMC Machine Gun instructor checking in. We conduct a machine gun shoot once a month, firing 5.56, 7.62, 50 cal, and 40mm grenades. We routinely shoot over 15,000 rounds per machine gun range. I have had these muffs for the last 6 ranges and they are fantastic! They work as advertised and protect my hearing from full auto machine gun fire from less than 3 ft away. The batteries last a while (I keep the volume about half-way, which makes normal conversation sound normal.) I wear them for about 8 hrs. at a time and they are as comfortable as a $60 pair of muffs should ever be. They do not interfere with cheek weld or any shooting position I have used. Walkers Game Ear Razor Slim Electronic Muff should serve any shooter well if they are looking for cheap, reliable, sound amplifying ear pro. My pair has been going strong for literally hundreds of thousands of rounds. These are a solid deal and I recommend them to anyone who inquires about them.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>  - Long battery life. Only requires two AAA batteries that are included and easy to change.<br/>  - Fantastic hearing protection. I work with several people who have more expensive, "tactical" ear-pro (Pelters, etc.) that can't suppress the .50 cal report. These Walkers muffle all gunshots regardless of how loud they are or how close I am to them.<br/>  - Conversations are distinct and easy to hear. I can hear radio traffic without having to remove ear pro. Big plus. I can even turn them up and hear conversations several hundred feet away! Great for big ranges.<br/>  - They even have a standard headphone jack if you want to talk on your phone or plug up your iPod and mow the lawn or something.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  - The fit is good, but if you are talking or moving your jaw sometimes the seal will break and allow a gunshot sound to get through. This is minimal and could be due to the shape of my head and/or the position I wear them. If you sweat much this problem is compounded as the seal is now wet and easier to be disturbed. As I said this problem is minimal and not easily repeatable, doesn't detract from the rating for me.<br/>  -They are not omni directional. It is difficult to tell where sound is coming from. The sound is clear and amplified, just deceiving in which direction it came from. For my particular job this is no big deal. If you need to know what direction the sound came from, these are not the hearing pro for you.<br/>  -THEY DO FIT UNDER THE STANDARD ACH HELMET, but not well.( I wear a Medium) It is not designed to fit under this helmet (as far as I know) and the fact that they even do with minimal pad adjustment is really more of pro. If you don't wear a helmet when shooting, disregard, they fit great.<br/>  -Thick eye pro frames will disrupt  the ear seal if placed over the frame. If you put them on over your eye pro because you forgot to remove them, the pressure feels like Leonidas trying to drive his spear through your head. You will only do this once. I have some thin frames now but I just rest the frames on top of the ear muff. If I had to do rigorous movement, they might fall off, but they haven't yet.</span>
