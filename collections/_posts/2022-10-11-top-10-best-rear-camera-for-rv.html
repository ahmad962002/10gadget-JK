<span>I added one of these to my travel trailer as I couldn't see behind the trailer while on the road and while backing up into campsites.  The field of view is great and I'm impressed with the night vision illumination.  Signal integrity is flawless.  I have zero complaints so far!</span>

<span>Very easy to install on pre wired RV.  Picture quality is good as well as sound. I like seeing the road behind me. If I bought again, I would get a larger monitor. The 4.3 screen is a little small but still good.</span>

<span>Bought this because my travel trailer was pre-wired for the Furrion backup cameras and included a sharkfin mount pre-installed. I've always had trouble seeing where I am backing up but this cures this problem. The package arrived and I went about installing the camera. First, I checked the monitor/camera pairing with the monitor power cable (it included a pigtail for the camera power cord). Paired perfectly! Picture was crystal clear. Next, I removed the cover plate to the pre-installed shark-fin mount on the back wall of the trailer, plugged the camera wire into the pre-wired power jack dongle, and ...... nothing. No power. Checked voltage and there was power there, but the camera didn't function. Hmmm! So I pulled the shark-fin mount and discovered the power dongle had been wired in reverse (hot [red wire] to ground [white wire]; ground [black wire] to hot [green wire]). On RVs, the trailer's white wire is the ground and the green wire is the power for the running lights. Rewired the dongle so it was correct, powered on the running lights and checked the camera. Success! Camera worked just fine! Remounted everything, installed the camera and everything was fine. The camera also has a microphone and the monitor a speaker so if someone is guiding you while backing into a slot, you can hear their instructions clearly. A very nice touch, indeed!<br/><br/>While towing, I used it as a rear-view "mirror" that worked day and night (the camera also has night vision and IR lights for illumination). Nice! The running lights must be on for the camera to function. You can turn your headlights on to activate the trailer's running lights. This is essential with the GM automatic headlight systems. But, if you have factory-installed fog lamps, turn them on and your trailer running lights will turn on as well. The camera works just fine. If you use the camera to assist with passing or lane changes remember thing are closer than they appear, so be sure to check your mirrors as well to check the clearance of the back of the trailer with the passed vehicle. The monitor and mirrors compliment each other for clearance issues.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent and very useful accessory for any trailer owner.<br/><br/>Highly recommend!</span>

<span>After I saw a neighbor easily back her travel trailer in, I mentioned how impressed I was. She and her husband said it’s really easy now with our backup camera. I added the Furrion system to our trailer and love it. We got a 2nd trailer and this camera add-on was the first thing I bought as an upgrade. I was able to sync it to my other system so we have one monitor that will work with both trailers. Installation was simple. Knowing that you can turn on grid lines on the monitor is critical AND that you can tilt the camera up/down to adjust the distance from the back of the trailer to where you want is critical, especially if you use it like I do for determining when it’s safe  to pull back into a lane after passing someone.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace the one that was installed on my R V after the picture got to fuzzy to make anything out on the screen. Turns out the camera lens was bad on the old one. The outside surface of the lens somehow lost it shine, and clarity. I only bought this to replace the old camera. if the new camera goes the same as the old one, I will defanatly be replacing the whole system next time. There are much cheaper alternatives out there, some with better picture quality. Why spend alot of money for something thats only going to last a few years.</span>

<span>BLUF: I've been using this setup for 5 months and, without including its cost, overall I rate it as just "ok". Factoring in the cost I don't think this system is worth it.<br/><br/>I bought it because my new rv was "pre-wired" for Furrion and for marketing purposes that's excellent but in actuality it amounts to not much more than having power which is not much of an advantage over using any other brand. The picture resolution is average/suitable but the refresh rate is not very good, the video lags and pauses a lot while on the highway. That, I find, makes this system fine while going slow/parking but very unreliable for changing lanes at highway speeds. In addition to poor video quality, the windshield mount suction cup already failed and will not hold its own weight let alone the monitor's too. For the price tag of this system we should be getting better quality equipment.<br/><br/>On a positive note, their support is extremely responsive and knowledgeable. They helped me identify a wiring problem with my "pre-wired" rv's side marker with just a few emails back and forth in one day. (The rv manufacturer "pre-wired" the turn signal wire to an always hot wire so the furrion monitor kept auto switching the view to the passenger side camera...) Good help is hard to find, and isn't cheap, maybe that's why the system is priced the way it is?</span>

<span>I bought this model because I didn’t want to run wires to connect to power sources or monitor  to camera. I charged the camera and monitor and it worked perfectly. The magnetic or suction cup Mount is easy to adjust and then the camera gets put away safely in the car.<br/><br/>I tried the camera on the back of the 18 ft trailer we pull and the view of the road behind was very good. The connection cut out a fair bit but I’m testing different places to mount the camera to reduce the disconnects. If it weren’t for the disconnect I would have given it a five star.</span>

<span>Giving this item 5 stars. Makes backing up and hitching to my trailer easy. It also serves as a back-up camera that can be attached to the rear window of the trailer via the glass suction cup attachment (I wouldn't travel with it attached to the back of the trailer to use it as a rear view camera, as it may get knocked off if you go over a pothole or big bump on the road, but it is useful for backing into a site when you arrive at your destination).<br/><br/>Video quality is good enough for the task at hand. The FOV is narrow, but probably should be when viewing the hitch (which is the primary use of this camera). I haven't experienced any issues with signal, even when the camera is attached on the back of the trailer (about 30+ ft from the drivers seat). I think the set WiFi signal is an excellent solution, and better than bluetooth because you don't have to turn off a bluetooth device that may be in use while using this camera system. The video monitor is small, but effective. Frankly i like the compact size of the monitor as it doesn't take up much space. Comes in a nifty case. A solid product that does exactly what it is suppose to do.</span>

<span>I have a Swift Hitch SH04. I am happy with that. However it needs to work with a smart device. For my cousin who is not very good at the smart phone, the company recommended this SH02D. I got it for him at the lightning deal for $191.20. It is digital and comes with its own monitor. The picture is clear.  He enjoys using it. Only hopes the screen could be bigger :).</span>

<span>As I went to assemble the cables to bench test the setup I found that one of the connections on the extension cable had a bad end to it.  On both ends there are chrome connectors with lock nuts. I pushed the camera connection part into the cable and it had a typical resistance to it. Locked it down with the nut. On the other end when I push the cable plug in there was no resistance. If I let go of the cable it would just fall out of the socket. I did put it in and tightened the nut but if you wiggle the cable the picture would go off and on. The only way to fix would be to cut the cable and solder the wires.<br/>One other thing to mention was in the description it mention something about reverse parking. "created to make parking, reserve parking, truck docking," it would be my mistake but I thought that you could reverse the image, you can not. I misunderstood that but I am letting people know that it is only for placing in the back of your vehicle not forward facing.<br/>Being the cable was defective I sent it back.</span>

<span>I thought this would be an improved camera but should have looked more closely at resolution spec, 480.  The camera is probably too large for a car; I found a place on my Tahoe.  I'd also like to have had it only go on and off with reverse, but that doesn't seem to be possible.  That said, it's an incredible value for the price and I trust that it will last at least the 5-years that my last one did (also Pyle).  PS:  I found a way to have it work in reverse only; power it from the reverse circuit only (reverse circuit to red wire instead of green).</span>

Hopkins Manufacturing Corporation makes your towing experience simpler and more rewarding through innovation and value. Hopkins offers a variety of towing solutions including vehicle wiring kits, adapters, vehicle and trailer connectors, breakaway systems, and much more. Today, more than 40 percentage of retail category sales are generated from Hopkins innovations. Hopkins' Smart Hitch Backup Camera System eliminates the frustration of hitching up a trail by yourself, with a patent-pending hitch camera mode which easily aligns ball to trailer every time by placing an extra set of eyes where you need them, and SmartZone sensors which utilize ultra-sonic sensing to detect objects up to 5.5 feet away and provide an audible alert when an object is present. It has three detection zones which alert you to distance and direction of objects when hitching and towing a trailer. Great for everyday use, this system easily allows one person to hitch by themselves. Camera mounts behind the license plate and installation requires no splicing: simply plug in behind tow package connector. Includes a 3.5-inch crystal clear color monitor with static-free image. Some vehicles may have a hole available to pass the wire through where the license plate is mounted or you can drill 11/32” hole close to where the power cable is attached to the mounting bracket

<span>I bought the camera for hooking up to a bumper pull travel trailer.  It works great for that and for backing into parking spaces.  The night vision isn't bad and normal picture quality is excellent.  I've had it now for 1 year, 4 months.  The guidelines have just recently started disappearing on me after I put it in reverse.  It comes with a 1 year warranty, so I'm just out of that.  Even without the lines though, the camera quality is still good and it has a wide angle view so I can easily see cars coming from the side if I'm backing out of a parking spot.  I would buy it again. I installed on a 2012 F150 Super crew 4x4 using flex tubing to protect the wiring.</span>

<span>Easy to install, unbolt tag and bolt this on. Run wire to monitor, this can tricky but if your mechanically incline then that easy, the only issue was getting it adjust right for my application. Had to cut wood, even used a stick once in a pinch so camera and sensor match what you were seeing on the monitor hitch to trailer distance. But once you get that work out it great. Never had to rely on wife to back into the trailer to hitch up. Still working after all these years.</span>

<span>Technical questions answered quickly even though I sent the email to customer service not to tech support. I was concerned about the length of 2 cables in the kit. I contacted Emma with customer service she was extremely helpful and knowledgeable ,offered to ship replacement cables asap at no cost to me. The  camera system was a easy install . I like the trigger wire option for the side and back up cameras to full screen. The 10 “ monitor is also a plus . Great warranty.  Great price and I would buy again . I have not rated night vision yet will update once we drive at night.</span>

<span>Product did not come with the length of cables I needed for install. Emailed them and received what I needed quickly. First trip was 5000 miles through 7 states, cameras worked perfectly. Side cameras take some getting used to but that is a brain issue not a camera issue.</span>

<span>Great picture but Parking mode vids are corrupted and unable to be viewed. Warranty says Customer Service response in 24 hours ... not true at this time (55 hours+). Three emails sent and no Phone # to contact them. And our return will now mean a lot of holes in the body and interior with a lot of wire taps to repair under the dash of the RV. Again Avoid this product it does not work as stated.<br/>Update 6-1-2022<br/>Customer Service responded and suggested a 256 G Ultra 4K card and that fixed the issue . Working perfect now ! But that was an extra 60 bucks... However worth it ...The Image and 5 camera recording Awesome!</span>

<span>Much safer maneuvering our travel trailer with great camera angles now providing coverage n both sides.  I think the instructions could have provided clearer wiring diagrams and should have included the necessary butt connectors.  Regardless of this minor shortcoming, it is a definite by!</span>

<span>The price and quality are great.  I like the second generations slim look and they work great.  It’s nice having your blind spots revealed while driving but even better while backing into a tight spot or into a bend or corner.  Some camp spots are notoriously complicated by growth or natural features.  Having side cameras makes that less of a hazard.<br/><br/>I’ve had no problems with the cameras but I have called Furrion for other product issues in the past and they’re always friendly and helpful.  I have no trouble buying from them because of how satisfied I’ve been with other products they offer and the service they follow through with.</span>

<span>I added these side view cameras on my new 44’ 5th wheel toy hauler and I love them<br/>Great knowing what is on both sides while driving , parking, turning etc.<br/>They are clear and even work well at night.<br/>Very easily swapped out for a standard marker light.<br/>I highly recommend this product!!<br/>I have the furrion cameras on the rear of the toy hauler as well as on the back of the cab of my truck. So it’s easy to back in and hook up. Watch the 5th wheel plate while driving and to know what’s behind the 5th wheel when traveling or backing up..</span>
