<span>This display is amazingly clear and bright and it is light weight, until the battery is added. Other than power on-off, monitor adjustment menu button, two programmable buttons, and a thumb wheel for screen brightness that also contains a button switch to make selections, there are no other controls. It is not a touch screen, so the menu button and then the wheel and it's contained push switch in the wheel are needed to do all adjustments. When reviewing videos, the camera buttons are needed for any selections required. You can't do this on the monitor. This is a little frustrating at times, but I still love this monitor and I know that I'll get more comfortable with it after using it for a while.</span>

<span>I've been looking for an inexpensive ($250 or less) field monitor for checking exposure and focus on my GH5.  I first tried the Andycine A6.  I loved the price (around $190), small size, image quality, and light weight.  However, the lack of audio meters bothered me and I found the amount of lag distracting.  I also had occasional connectivity issues, so I returned it.<br/>I next tried an Ikan DH5e, which I found used for about $200.  The DH5e addressed the issues I had with the A6 and seems to be a better-designed piece of kit in general, although it definitely feels fragile.  My copy seemed to have a weird bug, though – when switching camera modes, the screen would momentarily go blank (which is normal) and come back on with completely screwed up colors – almost as if all of the red channel was gone.  I could get the monitor back to normal by switching it off and on again, but that slows me down enough to make me worry about missing shots on an important shoot.  So, I returned that monitor as well.  It's a shame, since I really like the DH5e otherwise – although at $300 new, it's not all that much cheaper than the very well regarded $500 SmallHD Focus or BlackMagic Video Assist.<br/>I finally picked up the (ridiculously named) Lilliput A7S largely because of its positive reviews and very low price.  I really wanted to stick with a five inch monitor, to keep things as light and portable as possible.  That being said, the A7S is quite light for a seven inch screen.  The display is very good, the lag seems minimal (although I never tested all three head to head or at all scientifically), and it has the features that matter to me.  I have not yet tested it on a professional shoot, but – so far – it is the best-built, most reliable, and most thoughtfully designed of the three cheap monitors I've tested.  I wish it had more customizable buttons and I prefer inputs on the back of the device instead of the side.  Lilliput's Q5 checks off more of the items on my wish list than the A7S (smaller, more features, inputs on the back), but it is also more than twice the price at around $400.<br/>For the money, I think the A7S is a steal and I'd easily recommend it over the other monitors I've tried in this price range.  If you want LUTs, external recording, or other advanced features, you'll need to spend more.  If you just want to be able to compose your shots, check your exposure, and nail your focus on a larger screen, this is a great, inexpensive option.</span>

<span>I bought this display to use with my Nikon D300s, hooking it up to the HDMI output on the camera. The intention is to view still photos on the larger 5" screen immediately after capture instead of the 3" static display on the back of the camera. Why? because it is easier and quicker to assess the quality of a still photograph on a larger screen than it is on a smaller screen. I wanted 7" but decided to try the 5" Sony.<br/><br/>For hand held still photography, the display can be rotated to lie parallel to the lens. It does not have to stand vertically as in the photos of the gear. However, with it vertical or flat and parallel to the lens, it did not get in the way of shooting. I soon got used to it. One drawback, to fill the 5" screen when mounted on Nikon D300s, I have to press the the D300s enlarge button once. You can use the D300s enlarge button to full extent if you wish (13x) but to fill the screen you need to push it once.<br/><br/>Anything you can display on the D300s rear screen is displayed on the Sony 5" screen but not as the same time. It is one or the other. The 5" screen improves using live view on the D300s.<br/><br/>Was I able to assess photos more easily and quicker than on the 3" screen? Definitely!<br/><br/>I also used the 5" screen with the D300s on a tripod. I am pleased with how it works in both the landscape and portrait mode on a tripod. I do a lot of portrait shots using a tripod, much more than landscape.<br/><br/>Construction is Sony quality.<br/><br/>I am happy with the purchase. Any questions, just ask, I will see if I can answer them.</span>

<span>I've had the CLM-V55 for only a few hours but I'm totally impressed.<br/><br/>I was able to visually calibrate and get good color and contrast quickly. The presets of 9300K, 7200K and 6500K are readily tweeked with the Color tone (Phase), brightness, contrast and backlight adjustments. Popping in and out of the menu for these is quick and deliberate. There were no surprises reviewing footage on a fully calibrated editing monitor.<br/><br/>Peaking works like it should and if your res is 800X480 or higher you can go 1:1 and check focus at the center of the image quite effectively.<br/><br/>The preset 16:9 or 4:3 guides can be set at 80% or 90% to allow plenty of safety.<br/><br/>The pop up hood is sweet. It gives good shading in the full sun while never limiting a quick glance from off center. It snaps back down easily and becomes a good travel protection. The included soft cloth drawstring bag can easily hold the CLM-V55 with the hood and a battery attached.<br/><br/>The Auto-Lock shoe mount swivels and tilts easily with a good amount of resistance to keep it right where you put it, no creeping or sagging after you take your hand off. It's light and easy to work handheld with the CLM-V55 on top of the 5DII and 7D.<br/><br/>Battery life is very good. I ran it for a couple of hours and popped the battery back in the charger where it fully recharged in about an hour. Batteries are light and cheap so I don't feel a need to tether it to another battery system.<br/><br/>The included mini-HDMI to HDMI cable feels very solid and has a just the right amount of flexibility so that it stays put.<br/><br/>SONY has brought a great little 5" display to the market at a competitive price.</span>

<span>I have the CLM-V55 mounted on my Sony NEX-C3 mirrorless camera via the tripod mount. While I tell people that I got it for video, the truth is I have a hard time manually focusing with the 3" built in screen. I love to use my legacy Canon FD glass, and achieving a good sharp focus, even with MF Assist, was a challenge. While the field monitor is bulky and adds a lot of girth to my small camera, I find the trade-off to be worth it. The 5" screen displays a nice clear image with good color. It has built in focus peaking, though to me it is inferior to the color peaking on the NEX itself. With that said, I don't find the lack of color peaking to be an issue. The MF Assist alone on the 5" screen is more than adequate.<br/><br/>As far as the battery situation, I suppose I would have been more irritated about the lack of a power source had I not been able to purchase a double pack here on Amazon for a reasonable price. Though for $350 you'd think Sony could have thrown at least one in.<br/><br/>Here is how I would breakdown my rating:<br/>Ease of use - 5 stars<br/>Build quality - 5 stars<br/>Screen quality - 5 stars<br/><br/>The only issue I have with it is that I haven't been able to locate a battery meter for the screen itself. If anyone knows, please leave me a comment!</span>

<span>Great product but they should include a battery. I've read multiple reviews that say the same thing, and it's quite difficult to get a battery - unsure why they continue to use such an outdated battery?<br/><br/>Otherwise a great product! Quite small and light but durable. Bright and I really appreciate the shroud that pops in and out.</span>

<span>I am a noob in photography, was lucky enough to have some money and I decided to go for this camera to start with astrophography.<br/>Out of the box, all things included as stated, battery works, lens (28-70mm) included, usb cable, adapter for battery to charge and obviously the camera, all of them arrived in what seems to be new condition, though the box did not had a tape seal (usually electronics have a small transparent seal on top of the segment of the box you use to open it)<br/>Upon using the camera I noticed an issue, with autofocus mode on, sometimes when I tried shooting with lens at 70 mm at subjects at bout 9 - 10 feet away indoors, or even stars at night outdoors with crop mode, autofocus would get me out of crop mode, if I activated crop mode again, autofocus would stop working altogether and then the function would no longer "exist", if I pressed the shutter release button halfway (all of these with camera place on auto mode), to try and get the autofocus to do its job, nothing would happen, then on the screen I would see the ISO at 12800, if i released the shutter release button the iso number disappears, if i press the release shutter half way again, the iso number 12800 appears again and it stays there until i release the shutter button, if i take a picture it is all blurry. I then tried to use the manual focus but nothing happens, I remembered I had to turn the manual focus option on, so I get into the menu and the focus mode option is greyed out, if I try get into the option an error message "your lens is not supported or its installed incorrectly" shows up, only way to go is to shut camera off and turned it on again, which will return autofocus to work, but if i repeat the exercise it just stops working all over again, sometimes even without crop mode/zoom mode on, just by going from 28 to 70 mm on the lens, or even mid way, maybe 40 mm or 50 mm. Sometimes even the camera would pull me out of menu screen, I would click menu button, I am trying to navigate menu, then you can hear the focus mechanism moving and camera pulls me out of menu screen o regular screen, I have to press menu again, sometimes to be pulled out of the menu repeated times<br/>I re installed the lens (white dot with white dot, turn until click noise) golden plates on the lens are clean, did this 3 times, nothing.<br/>I called Amazon service, friendly person who quickly contacted me to Sony, and this is the part I did not like. We went through basic things to try and fix the issue, including resetting the camera, after which the issue presented itself quite quickly, so the person at Sony (again, a very friendly and helpful person) told me I needed to send the camera back to Sony for service. I asked him if that given this was a brand new camera (I received this this past Tuesday Feb 9th 2021, today is Sat 13th Feb 2021) I would get a new camera (replaced) he actually told me that at Sony they only offer repairs, and if the cost is out of the warranty I would be charged for the replacement?!<br/>I am not entirely sure if this is true or not, but if it is, this very bad business practice to say the least, so I pay for a brand new camera, which comes defective, so I am not getting what I payed for in the first place, and they then tell me that there is the possibility that I would have to pay EVEN MORE to actually get less (it would not be a new camera now right? it would be basically a refurbished one with all the risks that implies) than what I ALREADY payed for in the first place! I payed for a new camera that is supposed to have all the features and functionality advertised by sony/amazon on their webpage, and I did not got that, and again, I might be forced (because if I do not pay I would not get a working device.....so basically I would be forced to pay if I want anything ressembling a working camera) to pay more (you pay for a new working product, you dont get one, and then to get a working "not new anymore" product you sometimes have to pay more than what you already payed in the first place) .  I would strongly recommend to stay away from this brand, who knows, in the future I decide to buy an expensive lens from them, and then if something is wrong, they only "repair" a lens, maybe even after asking for more money from me. No Sony/amazon, shame on you, bad business practice.<br/>Again, I want things to be clear :  they HAVE NOT asked me to pay anything YET, as I just send the camera back to Sony, but the Sony person I spoke to made it very clear that they do not replace cameras with new ones if you receive a faulty one, they only "repair them" and that I MIGHT even be charged in some cases.<br/>This is my experience with the Sony a7III, and Amazon - Sony regarding this product, not good, not happy.<br/><br/>Update 2/19/2021:<br/>1. I spoke with the same Amazon representative who was present the day I spoke with Sony, and he assured me that I CAN return this product to amazon if not satisfied (which I most likely will immediately do after receiving it back from tech service).<br/>2. The camera did not went to Sony directly, it went to a tech service that from what I understand, is the one Sony works with to repair/service their cameras.<br/>3. So far, no one has asked for any extra payment.</span>

<span> I have been a user of both Nikon and Canon over the past 3-4 years and made the switch to sony in August of 2017. The a7iii is by far the best camera I have used on these three platforms. I previously owned and still use the Sony a6300 which was great for a budget camera but had tons of issues for someone who shoots professionally. I primarily shoot weddings and sports but also do commercial level work on the side. The photos I have provided are my first test of the a7iii in a somewhat warm climate doing both photo and video.<br/><br/>Improved Features:<br/>1. IN CAMERA PROXIES... no one talks about this on youtube!!<br/>2. dual card recording ability, dual writing ability<br/>3. HLG color space, no overheating<br/>4. Bright and Beautiful monitor, focus peaking, customizable buttons, uncompressed RAW photo capability, a large buffer depending on card size, and great autofocus with eye AF and face tracking... plus better "color science." Color science means absolutely nothing unless you are delivering a final image or video straight out of the camera, its all subjective and if you want Accurate colors Sony is the way to go. I could rant for pages about "color science."<br/>5. Headphone Jack... Monitoring external audio is absolutely important if you are running wireless mics. I will use this to monitor my wedding ceremony Audio.<br/><br/>Things that could be improved:<br/>1. The EVF is not calibrated color wise to match the display screen on the back of the camera... not a huge deal for video but it can get annoying for photo. Know your settings well enough to get you close in photos, and the RAW capabilities in Lightroom will give you some leeway.<br/>2. No face tracking while using an external recorder AND recording in Camera. If you record solely on the external recorder you can still retain face tracking which is not a huge deal, there is an option in the settings but it turns the external screen black.<br/>3. only 1 UHS-II slot. I would love to see two of them.<br/>4. no 10-bit color depth... this is probably coming on the a7siii which I understand, but it would be incredible to get a firmware update on the a7iii, a7riii, and a9 to allow 10-bit color, making SLOG  and HLG way easier to expose for and work with in post. Also, it allows creators to keep their a7iii and purchase an a7siii to match perfectly with it.<br/>5. The shutter button is a little spongy... not a huge complaint here because I am being rather critical<br/><br/>The a7iii has improved almost all of the issues thus far I have experienced with Sony APS-C Cameras. In my example photos and videos, I used the 70-200 f/2.8 GM (incredible lens). The a7iii lasted 4.5 hours of continuous video and photo shooting to two different SD cards with a completely bright viewfinder and screen with 20% battery to spare... something I could only dream of on the 6300. This is absolutely a professional camera and is reasonably priced for the features it has.<br/><br/>if you are looking for a prosumer camera with pro features... you can't go wrong with the a7iii. It definitely is not a cinema camera but will absolutely serve me well until I need to upgrade in the future for both photo and video.</span>

<span>After using this for a couple of videography projects and gigs, there are a few problems I encountered. First, this thing is not reliable for filming anything longer than 30 minutes. You could probably push it to an hour but anything longer, you risk the thing auto shutting off due to overheating. I quickly learned this painful lesson during an award ceremony gig I did. It was indoors in a AC room. Room temp did not get hotter than 70 degrees. The thing kept shutting off due to overheating after continuous filming in 4k, 24fps. I bought a dummy battery for future gigs like this but I have yet to test it out. Secondly, the auto focus on this sometimes zooms in and out repeatedly while it tries to focus on something. I have found I either have to turn off auto focus or move the physical camera location to get it to stop trying to focus repeatedly. It makes for really bad looking and unprofessional footage. I have 3 different lenses (two G master and one G Sony lens) and this has happened with all of them (although far less often on the 24mm). Now for the good. Once you get used to the menu system and set up the buttons to your preferred configuration, the camera can be a great intro to mirrorless videography. I am learning a lot using the camera before I move on to the fx3 at some point. Definitely look on YouTube to find the best settings for night shots. The PP2 works well with a few modifications. Overall, a good beginner mirrorless for video.</span>

<span>I'm using this with a Sony camcorder (CX430v) to shoot my daughter's soccer games. The camera is mounted on a 10' pole, so I needed a field monitor to frame what I'm recording. I also needed a monitor that could display the camera screen indicators (recording status, camera settings, camera battery life, etc.). It was surprising to me that many Sony camcorders won't display the indicators on most monitors. Sony support said it wasn't possible. When I contacted field monitor support or the sellers, most said their monitors will display this information or they didn't know. This meant that I had to test for myself. So in addition to this monitor, I tested the following (all of which were under $200): Aputure VS-1 FineHD, VILTROX DC-70HD, Neewer NW759, and Feelworld FW759. I settled on the Lilluput A7S primarily because it was the only one able to display my camera screen indicators. It was also one of the brighter displays, which I needed because I'm usually filming outside.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Able to display screen indicators from Sony Camcorders ("control for HDMI" must be set to "on" on the camera)<br/>Comes with a silicon rubber case.<br/>Comes with a power cord. Most don't in this price range.<br/>Battery life indicator on the screen (most in this price range don't have this)<br/>Tripod mounts on the top and bottom<br/>Pass-thru hdmi port if you want to hook up a 2nd monitor<br/>Really bright and good contrast.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>velcro for the sun shade doesn't stick well to silicon case. It started peeling off after the first use.<br/>No battery included (common for these monitors)<br/>No micro HDMI cable included (It comes with a mini HDMI, but my camera needed a micro)<br/>It's a glossy screen, which isn't great for outdoor use. I purchased a cheap anti-glare screen protector, which helps.<br/>It drains the battery even when turned off, so you have to remove the battery after use. Strangely, this is common with these cheaper monitors.<br/>It's a little hard to secure the tripod mount through the silicon case.<br/>No firmware update capability.<br/><br/>Since I'm using this for videography, I don't use most of the functions, but it has some nice features (peaking, false color, exposure, histogram, volume level metering, etc.). There are also 2 buttons that you can assign to commonly used functions.<br/><br/>The first time I used the monitor, it powered off and restarted twice. I switched the HDMI cable and it hasn't happened since, so I hope it was the cable and not the monitor.</span>

I have yet to remove screens plastic protector when mailing...dont want to risk scratching yet.

NO tethering to laptop...especially when in the field. Worth its weight in gold!!<br/>Lastly, issue IS battery consumption-HATE IT!!!! I placed a FULLY charged battery and even bought a genuine Canon battery, fully charged, to see if it was just the battery that was faulty, placed into the monitor, verified it was OFF. Turn it on few hours later when needed-completely dead!!!! What??? Frustrating!! Tested 3 more times, different batteries. ..same result.  Past my return date for an exchange by 3 days, so...guess I'm stuck with it. Love the unit...just wanted an exchange to see if it was just a "lemon" unit. Now I have to carry batteries seperate if I want assurance. With that said, cannot qualify how good battery functioning life is. Oh well!</span>

<span>I, like others that have reviewed this, had an issue doing the initial Bluetooth connection. Don't waste time or frustration, go buy a new 2032 battery and hold the device so that it's along side the phone. Connected right away! Works great after that. Good luck!</span>

<span>I bought this to use with my Sony rx100 for a 2 week trip to Europe.  At first I couldn’t get it to connect to my camera until I realized after days of trying that you need to select “Rmt Control” in addition to just the Bluetooth connection.  Once I did that it worked perfectly with zero connection issues from then forward.<br/><br/>It is very comfortable and fit my hand well.  Controls were all easy to use.  For a smaller camera it was so much easier to hold onto with the grip than holding the camera itself.  The grip made it much more secure of a grip so I was able to take different angles, hold it out windows, and other positions I couldn’t do with just the camera.  Also the grip made holding the camera while carrying it more secure and less likely to drop it.<br/><br/>The tripod was great for pictures, especially low ones where I just set it on the ground.  Also good for just setting the camera on a table or wherever without laying the camera down.  My only wish is that there was a tether point for a strap or something to secure it to my hand.  I generally had a strap around my neck for security but some shots required me to take it off.  I could use a tether point on the camera but the it conflicts with the jacket.<br/><br/>I am addicted and almost hate to shoot without it.  Highly recommend it, particularly for smaller or medium cameras.</span>

<span>Sooo I had an old FEELWORLD monitor that was actually 5 inches for the viewable screen.  While the atomos is awesome in that it records raw and has some other bells and whistles I find it a bit misleading to say it's 5 inches of viewable picture because it's in reality only 4 and a half give or take.  That extra half inch makes a huge difference when pulling focus and so forth.  I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this.</span>

<span>First let me say that this is an amazing product! I have NO regrets investing in the Ninja V, it has put my Sony A7iii on steroids. Not only that but my work flow is so much better. I'm usually a gorilla style type of shooter so if you know, it is very important to be in complete focus and to be able to know what's going on when you're running and gunning. I haven't even tapped into all of the features yet but am excited to do so!<br/><br/>So now for the VERY IMPORTANT TIP. I found this out the hard way so hopefully this will help others to not make the same mistake I did.<br/><br/>I usually shoot 4k on my A7iii with a Crane 2, the Ninja V outputs fine with no issues at all, but when I shot in HD for slow motion, there was a major problem! Now I'm not sure if this is the case for other cameras but if you're shooting with a A7iii this is for you (I would still check for other cameras as well). When shooting HD and recording on the Ninja V, the Ninja will actually record the cameras Screne Meters into the footage you are shooting! This caused me to lose all the footage I shot for the day, thank God I was backup camera.<br/><br/>The FIX is this: go to Menu / Setup / HDMI Settings / HDMI Info Display and turn it OFF! I may be completely ignorant to this but I had no idea the Ninja V would have recorded the Screne Meters on HD only. Hope this helps someone!</span>

<span>I purchased one of these and did not use it right away. The only time I had it in the field, the HDMI input was intermittent showing “no input”. No matter what camera (a7r4, a7r2) or cable combination. I RMA’d it and Atomos service said they could not replicate the issue in an 8 hour “bench” test. A bench test does not account for movement on a mobile camera system. Very disappointed that I have to put energy into this. I expected to pay good money for a good product.</span>

<span>Whether this is a fault of the monitor or simply HDMI or not but there is a significant lag between what you see on the camera's (G85) flip out screen and what you see on the A5. It's minor but there. As the G85's do not have a headphone port (grrrrrrr) I wanted a monitor that did so I can monitor the input from the Rode Go and or Sarmonic pre-amp device.<br/>First time I used the monitor I kept hearing an echo, then realized it was a delay from the speaker (person) to what I was hearing on the headphones. Most disconcerting at first, after a while I got used to it. Much better noise cancelling headphones (MPOW THOR -is what I was using) are in my future.<br/>As to picture quality and functionality all are good to very good but it does not seem to hold a customized color balance once the battery is removed. Speaking of which get the bigger Sony NP style batteries. I was using a standard size and when it quit the camera stopped recording -this happens with the older 7" monitor I have too- so it is either a camera problem or another HDMI anomaly. Feel free to weigh in on that issue.<br/>The buttons are small -it is a small monitor so no surprise- and can be frustrating to make adjustments without looking at the buttons. Frequently turned it off while trying to set a menu item.<br/>It does get very warm, to the point where the glue holding (insert guffaw here) the thin strip of velc - sorry "hook and loop fastener" to the hood starts coming off. Try using a more than warm iron -be careful not to over heat- to make the h&amp;l fastener bond better, it worked for me. Again be careful. The hood is ok, and somewhat functional once you overcome the h&amp;l problem.<br/>HDMI 4k will go in but when I tried looping to the older monitor I had to switch the camera to 1080p in order to use both. Make sure the cables are 4k compatible too.  Speaking of which the A5 comes with a full size to mini HDMI not a micro - I have yet to find a device that has a mini HDMI port. As I stated earlier 4k goes in but 4k is not displayed it is downsized (hmm delay due to this? Nope delay is there even when camera is in 1080 mode). but the image is crisp and once you get beyond the lag problem...<br/>I'm tempted to give it 4 stars but as I rarely if ever give anything 5 stars, this monitor is not quite at the 4 star level for me.<br/>Would I buy again? Price was a factor and at a buck fifty, it's not outrageous, so possibly I would buy again but will take a long look at other field monitors first. Being aware that the A5 does come with other name plates is important, just because one brand is selling the same device for more does not make it a better model.</span>

<span>SO much about this cage is excellent. I just wish they had not listed it as compatible with the original A7S because that's what I have, and now the HDMI port is busted. There is not enough clearance above the metal frame at the bottom of the cage, where the HDMI port is located. The plastic door on the camera that needs to be opened to access those ports is difficult to open with the cage attached. The HDMI cable goes in, but there is upward pressure on the connection. After using this for a few weeks, my HDMI port on the Sony A7S is now broken. Other than that, the cage is robust, light, has plenty of attachments and is really well made. Please change the description to exclude the original A7S or at least add a warning about the HDMI.</span>

<span>Being that this is my first cage I don’t really have anything to compare it to but I LOVE IT! Being able to add a lot of different gear to the cage is the best.</span>
