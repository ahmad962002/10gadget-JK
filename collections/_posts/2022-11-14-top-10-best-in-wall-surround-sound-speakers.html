<span>Sounds amazing after minor repair. One of the subs came with a rattle, after taking it back down found the back to be loose, epoxied it and now sounds really good. The only other bad is the grid kept falling off the other sub when playing it loud so put just a little clear silicone on it and stuck it back on which has held. Has good base with a 2000w amp and pretty good vocals with being driven by a mid grade Onkyo receiver. Great system for the price for action movies in a 14' x 20' theater room.</span>

<span>Well worth it.  My only complaint with the order, and you likely will not be as lucky, is I ordered the 6.5" speakers and received the 8" speakers.  Other than that, these are great.  I did have to confirm with Amazon that I wouldn't have an issue with returning prior to installing because I would be cutting bigger holes in my walls than what my order reflected.  Customer service from Amazon was top notch and reassured that if there was an issue within the return window I would receive the correct replacements for what I installed.  On to the product review.<br/><br/>These are not audio aficionados top selection; they don't drain your wallet enough for that.  With that said, I am very happy with these as a replacement for the basic surround sound that was in my theater room originally.  Please excuse the incomplete installation process in the pictures (not sure why the one is upside down either, sorry);  we're in the midst of remodeling this area currently.<br/><br/>The installation process was fairly straight-forward.  The speakers came with templates to be traced around so the cutouts in the drywall are the correct size.  One complaint from the installation process:  The clips that hold the speakers into the walls did not always tighten up as one would expect.  I had to tighten up the screws on the installation clips until it became a bit harder to turn, then back off a half turn or so until the clip made a 'click' noise, then continue to tighten.  I may have broken a couple before figuring this out but it doesn't seem to have impacted the installation.  Just keep it in mind as you are going through the installation of each speaker.<br/><br/>Performance after installation:<br/><br/>I think that actual results will vary depending on what you are using to power these speakers.  I'm using a Denon AVR-X3400H, which is about 95 watts per channel, and they sound good to me.  One complaint that is common in reviews for this speaker set is the sub woofers are not powered.  None of the speakers are powered.  The power comes from your audio source.  If your audio source has a line-level output for your sub-woofers you are going to need an external amplifier to power the sub-woofers.  You actually need some type of amplification for all the speakers.  In short, know what your receiver is capable of doing before expecting it to do it.  My receiver has line-level outs for the sub-woofers so I purchased a Gemini XGA-4000 to power the sub-woofers.  They work fine if you power them correctly.  Acoustic Audio recommends some little amplifier they sell for each sub-woofer.  It was cheaper to purchase the Gemini to power both of the subs instead.<br/><br/>Also of note in my particular installation, I took the ceiling / wall round speakers and placed them in a second zone.  These are located ~ 15 meters from the AVR and sound just fine.<br/><br/>My one complaint for these speakers is I wish there were baffles available for the backside of the speakers.  When turning up the volume they will absolutely rattle your walls.  I may pack the interior walls with more insulation to help reduce this.  Again, this issue is more related to the environment they are installed in.<br/><br/>Overall, I was skeptical at first with purchasing surround speakers that were so reasonably priced.  In the end, I am very satisfied with not only how they look in the walls after installation, but their sound is exceptional.  There is a high likelihood that I will purchase another set for my main living area in the future.</span>

<span>This is a proprietary product meaning the subwoofers each will need a their independent amp to provide power to each subwoofer.<br/><br/>Depending on your AV receiver setup for these speakers, make sure the AV receiver is able to provide Pre Amp Outs to connect to an external amplifier. We put 2 front speakers along with the LCR and a subwoofer facing the listening area. Behind our listening area we installed 2 rear speakers, 1 sub, and one round in the ceiling for Dolby Atmos. We installed the other round for Dolby Atmos above the other seating area. Because we didn’t  hook up the subs to the AV, we were able to use the AV receiver YAPO to generate tones and verify the ceiling speakers and the remaining speakers were working properly.<br/><br/>I would think twice about purchasing this product. It does look complete and the seller does indicate that 2 amps (products they recommend and sell) are the only ones that will work and make this system work. The issues surrounding proprietary speaker package like this would be the use of passive subs. The majority of the AV receivers you will encounter has Pre Outs for active subwoofers only.<br/><br/>I purchased a Rockville RPA9 amplifier that I felt should provide enough independent power for both subwoofers. After reading previous product reviews and questions about other buyers concern for amps for the subwoofers, and after purchasing this product, I was not able to verify if other users were able to use other amps besides what is recommended by this seller.<br/><br/>I am out of the return period for both products because I waited until our living room was remodeled before installing the speakers and running wires to our AV media location. I was not able to get any reply or support for this product as I left questions from other buyers and their reviews.<br/><br/>It turns out that a purchase under good intentions caused buyers regrets. It’s very embarrassing to show friends and family what you purchased and only able to enjoy tones from all speakers and have no subs as they remain in the wall as “Display Only”. I’m depressed that the money, time, and research spent before purchasing was not what you expected.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that for a 5.2 or 7.2 speaker configurations for home theater is to NOT BUY from this seller and build your own. Unless you understand passive and active speakers and subwoofers, this purchase isn’t meant for you. No matter what speaker system you purchase from the seller, they will want you to purchase their own Amps for each sub. You can shop for 2 front speakers, LCR, 2 matching rear speakers, 2 additional wall or ceiling speakers for surrounds  and most important, 2 ACTIVE subwoofers that can be hooked from your AV SUB PRE OUTS.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, the tech support you expect is very poor. Reviews from other buyers are more than 3 years old and not really relevant to your needs today.<br/><br/>I can’t give an honest review because I don’t feel this was an honest purchase. The product may fit your needs if you understand passive and active subwoofers. I did not so this purchase wasn’t for me. I spent extra purchasing an external amp which wasn’t recommended by the seller, so I probably wasted money on that purchase as well. I did ask the seller that why is the WS105 are the only amps that will work for this speaker set and not others such as the Rockville RPA9. Afterall your basically using the PreOuts from your AV Receiver with a “Y” with RCA cables from the receiver and the amp then your subwoofer are connected to the amp outs.  Let me know if others are able to have this work.<br/><br/>Please do more research before buying.<br/><br/>Update-Just finished hooking up the 5 man n speakers to a Yamaha TSR-7850 and the Pre Outs of the Sub 1 and Sub 2 to the input of the Rockville RPA 9 Amp. The sub woofers ran out of the ROCKVILLE, Stereo, Low Pass, turned the system on and was completely blown away by the performance. They were so loud it felt I had stage presence.<br/><br/>I would recommend buying it.</span>

<span>Thus far, I have purchased two sets of these speakers, and am delighted. The second batch actually included manufacture templates, so it's nice to see they've listened to customer comments. Albeit I have combined each speaker with a Dynabox system, the detail produced by the speakers is surprising. Installation is fairly straightforward, though when screwing in each speaker, I would suggest using a cordless drill until all be the final turns (otherwise, I was manually turning a screwdriver over 75 times.) The circular speakers were the most difficult to install, and it seems its a design flaw more than anything else. Certainly not a deal breaker, but an inconvenience nonetheless. With the subwoofer, I highly recommend using some type of enclosure system (I purchased a 6" Dyna En-Wall system, and this helped.) The bass could be much better with a sealed box, but for the clean appearance the in-wall sub provides, the trade-off is worthwhile for me. All in all, a great system at a very reasonable price.</span>

<span>These speakers are super easy to install and sound incredible but only AFTER you add a sub woofer. I have (4) 2 way JBL studio monitors on our main floor with a Klipsch sub as my comparison. I was hoping to not need a sub as the 265's have a woofer built in. After installation I hooked them up to my Yamaha receiver to see what they sounded like. Very tinny at lower listening levels. As I increased the volume they began to clear up and come into their own. At levels that my neighbors likely wouldn't enjoy they sounded REALLY good. I went downstairs and grabbed my Klipsch sub and added it to the mix, problem solved sounded INCREDIBLE!! Knowing what I know now I would have just bought their 2 way speakers, saved a bunch of money, and added the much needed sub to the system. Grilles are super clean but I think I'll leave them off. These look REALLY sexy without the grilles on them and even the wife agreed.</span>

<span>I installed these with the matching center channel. Hooked up to my old Yamaha home theater it sounds great!  I had similar floor standing Infinity towers and matching center but these blow it away. Also 10 to 20% louder at same power level than the infinity. Template provided to cut out the hole was perfect. My only comment would be to make sure you’re 1/2” to 1” away from a stud so that the clamps that old it in place can flip out and grab the backside of the drywall.</span>

<span>Spent probably too many hours researching speakers for the new home theater setup, but knew I wanted in-wall / in-ceiling speakers.  Used the 265s for front (left, right &amp; center) channels and the sound is amazing.  Not tinny at all as others have said and produce decent bass a subwoofer.  Extremely happy with the sound and product quality and the included templates make it impossible to not cut the openings correctly. "Vanishing Series" is a great name because you hardly notice they are even there.  I think that most people that were not happy with the sound didn't put any baffling or boxes behind them to contain the sound and keep it from "leaking" into the wall cavity.  These speakers are deep and will fill a standard 2x4 depth wall, so plan accordingly and carefully and you won't be disappointed</span>

<span>I really love these speakers.<br/><br/>I replaced 2 really good Polk tower speakers with these so I could utilize a projector screen in my man cave. I'm using them as my Front L &amp; Front R speakers behind an Amazon purchased Elite Screens audio-transparent screen (model ER100WH1-A1080P3).<br/><br/>However, I wouldn't buy these if you don't plan on getting a sub.<br/><br/>I've paired these with a Polk Center Speaker, Polk Sub, 2 Polk RC85i's as my rears, &amp; 2 Polk RC60i's in my ceiling.<br/><br/>Even though these will be hidden from view, I was amazed at how tight to the wall the actual speaker/cover was.  They look amazing. It has an extremely low profile, even less than the other wall/ceiling Polk speakers I have. And the magnet covers are so easy to take off compared to all my other in-wall speakers.<br/><br/>Installing them is easy (running the speaker wire can be the tricky part).<br/><br/>What you'll need:<br/><br/>Tape measure<br/>Stud finder (highly recommended)<br/>Level<br/>Pencil<br/>Laser level (optional)<br/>Sheetrock saw (can get for like $4 @ a hardware store)<br/><br/>*make sure you don't cut into any electrical, plumbing, cold-air return, etc. I installed these in the only room in my house that has a drop ceiling, so I was lucky and had a better idea of what I was dealing with. Still there are no guarantees you won't find any surprises until you actually cut the hole.<br/><br/>If you're not comfortable doing this, I would recommend hiring a professional.<br/><br/>*make sure to stay  1- 1.5" away from any stud. You want the tabs to fully install so you get a good hold.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>We installed 6 of these speakers in the ceiling a couple of weeks ago: two in each of three rooms that are approximately 15'x15' to 15'x20'.  We have them hooked up to a multi-room receiver for playing music.<br/><br/>They sound great, especially the set in the kitchen.  Part of the reason may be all the hard surfaces in that room, but part is probably because the cabinets narrow the room.  The dining room also has a hard floor &amp; surfaces, but has less furniture.  Anyway, the point is that obviously every room is going to have its own acoustic quirks, so consider the size, contents, and materials in the room.  These sound great even in our living room, which is the larger room with carpet, not a lot of large furniture filling space, and has softer materials like curtains &amp; sofas.<br/><br/>A few years ago, we bought Micca ceiling speakers for our family room, which is very large and required 8 of them.  They're good, but I like these Pyle speakers better.  And again, maybe it's got more to do with the particulars of the rooms, but these sound better to me.  So, I'm glad that when we went to make our purchase for this project, there was a quantity limit on the Micca speakers that prevented us from getting them.  At the time I was p*ssed - why limit people to 4 speakers?? - but that led us to find these, which were cheaper and turned out to sound better.  I'd love to have really high end speakers and system, but I've got a budget.<br/><br/>Context: I'm no audiophile, but I love my music.  I'm used to the Bose in my car and high quality Bose &amp; Sony headphones.  These Pyle in-ceiling speakers are quite nice - no disappointment - in 2 of the rooms and compare favorably in the kitchen.  I hope that helps.  If we ever need more, I'll definitely look for these again.<br/><br/>Install: these were pretty straightforward.  We took the advice of another reviewer to pre-drill the plastic clamps before mounting (carefully screw them in to get it properly threaded, then remove for install) and not to over-tighten.  We had no problems and it went pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Durability: it's only been a few weeks, though we use them pretty much every day.  I don't generally crank it up high, but the day we were setting up the system, we accidentally sent some very loud feedback through.  We were concerned that we might have blown the speakers, but they were just fine.</span>

<span>I was skeptical, but wow I'm happy with the purchase. I bought 4 sets to put in our new house. These are inexpensive speakers that actually sound pretty good! They are plenty loud, and have decent range for a cheap speaker mounted in the ceiling. I am cheap, so I am using only 1 speaker per room. They sound just fine in this configuration. These are at least as good, if not better, and cost about half compared to the speakers I put in my last house. Yes, there were no mounting issues, and the build quality was much better, but honestly, these sound better than the old ones!<br/><br/>First, be very careful when mounting these! If you follow these directions, you should have no problems with mounting, if not, you will probably break every mount and be very angry at your speakers.<br/><br/>1a/3a. OPTIONAL: I highly recommend getting some small washers that fit the screw and are about 3/8 inch diameter. If you are super worried about how these look when installed, you can spray paint your washer black. I didn't, and unless you study the ceiling carefully, you don't notice the silver washers (homemade washers from an old piece of metal I had laying around, drilled with drill press and cut with tin snips).<br/><br/>1b. Unpack the speakers.<br/><br/>2. Get your favorite electric drill or screwdriver (I'm calling it a driver from here on out to avoid confusion).<br/><br/>3b. Remove the screws one at a time and put a washer on the screw.<br/><br/>4. Place the white flip out clamp in it's spot and start threading the screw in with your driver. After it is started, carefully align the flip out clamp so that it can easily be pulled into the track. Continue tightening the screw and watch the clamp carefully so that it does not bind on any edges, if it does bind, stop tightening at once and back up, or it will snap the brittle plastic. You might have to spin the screw back and forth a bit to get it to start down the track. In my experience, once it started down the track, it was able to make it all the way.<br/><br/>5. Once the clamp has been brought down the track by tightening the screw, reverse your driver so that the clamp travels back up the track. Stop as soon as it clears the edge and swings out of the track. Repeat the screwing and unscrewing one more time, being careful to make sure the screw does not bind when you first swing it in place by tightening the screw. Once the clamp has traveled down and up twice, loosen the screw until it once again JUST swings out of the track. If you did it right, the clamp has a small amount of tension on it, and will hold itself in place and not flop in the way when you tilt the speaker.<br/><br/>6. Repeat each step with all the mounts. You can do one speaker at a time, or unbox them all and get it over with. I did each one before I mounted it in the ceiling.<br/><br/>7. Cut your holes using the template as a guide, hook up speaker wires, push speaker into place, and tighten the screw that swings the clamp into place.<br/><br/>8. DON'T OVER-TIGHTEN the screw! If you over tighten, it will break the track guide at the base, which renders the mount point useless. If you didn't choose to install washers, you can easily pull the screw through the opening, which means that the clamp does not work. For me it was easier to use washers and set my drill to a very light clutch setting. Snug is way to tight, what we are going for here is just enough to pull the speaker up to the ceiling, and no further.<br/><br/>I would buy these again.<br/><br/>**If you found this review helpful, please mark it as helpful by clicking "Yes" below.**</span>

<span>Fitted in-wall. These were hassle free to install. the quality is so much better than I expected. I couldn't use the sub woofer as  my AV receiver doesn't amp it's sub output.

<span>I installed these speakers in a home theater room I made for a customer and they sound amazing, you can crank those cones up and they will take the abuse, the quality of the materials and components are superb and they are very easy to install. The only 2 problems were that their wasn’t a lot of punch on the woofer with it being installed on the wall alone, I’m probably going to have to seal an enclosure inside and put a vent on the front. Also that when I cranked to woofer up, the vibration kept knocking the grill off, I just put a bit o’ crazy glue on that sucker and that did the job, but unfortunately you need to make sure your done messing with it because that sucker will be stuck for good.</span>

<span>I just recently finished my basement and in the middle of the project, I decided to go with in-wall speakers.  Why not right?  I had the opportunity to run the speaker wire and had access to the frame work, so it was a no brainer.  Plus, these speakers are a great price compared to some of the other non-wall units.  The only complication was the passive subwoofer and figuring out a way to prevent the sub from shaking the wall.<br/><br/>I had to buy a separate subwoofer amp (Bash 300S also sold on Amazon - great amp!), no biggie.  Problem #1 solved.<br/><br/>Problem #2 was a little tricky but luckily with the help of my contractor, he suggested building an enclosure to be installed inside the wall as well.  He looked at other 300W active subwoofers and took an average on there internal volume, bought some MDF and built the enclosure using an internal volume of 1.56 cu-ft.  Remember that number if you want to do the same.  The enclosure is ported with the opening at the bottom of the front of the enclosure (I'll get pics attached to this)<br/><br/>The install itself was a piece of cake, with the exception of the sub enclosure.  I highly recommend either using heavy insulation around the sub or doing what I did and building an internal enclosure.  Otherwise I can only imagine how badly your walls will shake.<br/><br/>The speakers are being used on a Denon AVR-1613 receiver and it sounds great.  I'm not an audiophile by any means and this is my first surround system ever, so I really have nothing to compare the sound quality but many people who have come over to check out the basement have said good things about the sound.</span>

<span>At first my opinion, 5 speakers and 1 subwoofer for this price must be total garbage. So I did what most online buyers do and read reviews, and I'm glad I did. Some people love the product, other people hated it. I figured worst case senario, I could always return them. I was skeptical due to the fact that 95% of all the speakers I've seen were a minimum $800 or more!<br/><br/>I ordered the speakers; Package arrived, I inspected the quality and build of each speaker and was impressed. I then tested the center speaker and was impressed! At this point I knew the surround sound system would be at a minimum decent.<br/><br/>Based on reviews almost everyone recommend thicket gage speaker wire and a subwoofer. I ordered 16 gauge speaker wire and ran that thru out the basement. I ordered the 10" Polk audio sub and I'm glad that I did. The subwoofer that comes with the set is not powered so it lacks the bass needed to complete this package. Other than that everything was great! 4 stars until they work on the subwoofer design.<br/><br/>My specs;<br/>20' x 12' ft section in my basement<br/>Denon 5.2 surround sound receiver ($289 - bestbuy)<br/>10" Polk audio subwoofer ($99 - Amazon)</span>

<span>I bought a house with a normal-size living (okay...it's small).  The house was pre-wired for surround-sound and a co-worker of mine who used to perform as a musician for a living recommended these speakers.  He stated that you cannot beat the sound and quality for the size and price.  He was absolutely correct.  These are perfect for my living room that is approximately 12x15.  I have this center speaker and two Polk Audio RC65i 2-way and two Polk Audio RC80i 2-way in ceiling speakers.  By the way, I am so glad that I had someone put them in the ceiling.  I had several people tell me that it is okay to mount them on the wall.  I didn't want crap hanging from my ceiling.  I have higher ceilings, but they certainly aren't 20-foot ceilings.  I whole-heartedly recommend the speakers - and putting them in the ceiling if you are able to.</span>

<span>Looks good, sounds good, but the grill rattles and mine speakers disintegrated after a short period of using.<br/><br/>I was very happy with how they looked and sounded after initial installation though there are definite issues with the 255c-RT. For thesix month of listening to my Polk Vanishing services 7.1 surround system), I had an annoying rattle during bassy parts of movies (and all through music though I rarely listen to music in my theater room). At first I thought it was pictures on the wall, or small items near my subwoofer was rattling but after a while I took the covers of my front 3 x speakers off and realised it was the grilles that were making the rattling noises. The speaker covers are magnetic and although they look nice, the magnets are not strong enough to stay on flush and securely; they are loose and vibrate causing unwanted noise.  However once I removed the centre cover to finally determine the root cause of the rattle I discovered a second problem; the tweeter cap thingys (not sure of the technical name) fell to the floor. They had obviously broken off at some point during the first six months of use and were just sitting there waiting to fall out once the cover was off. I contacted Amazon as well as Polk who informed me the warranty was for a year only and that I need to pay to get these fixed. It doesn't appear to be the manufacturer's problem that I'd only used them for six months; that the speakers disintegrated between 2 and 6 months of use, and that the only reason I discovered it was talking the grilles of to find the cause of the rattling issue; it is my problem!  It would be cost inhibitive to send them back for repair from New Zealand to the USA so I may wait until the next problem before replacing it though I am unlikely to buy another 255c-RT obviously. I am disappointed that after buying dozens of Polk speakers that Polk will not send me a new one. So now I have to use my speakers with the covers off, can see the faulty centre and if you look closely around the speakers, paint has chipped off the wall in places from taking the covers off on on; these could be designed not to damage walls IMO</span>

This carbon fiber in-ceiling speaker is the perfect combination of performance and style. The use of carbon fiber for the woofer means that the speaker can hit harder, go lower, and handle more power with significantly less distortion than conventional drivers. The silk dome tweeter produces clean, crisp, and clear highs and mids. You can fine tune the blend of sound using the built-in high frequency attenuator in case the sound is too bright. The metal grille can be painted to match your ceiling and attaches easily using magnets.  All Alpha series in-wall and ceiling speakers are sonically matched to provide a uniform sound stage across you entire listening area. Simple two channel listening rooms to full screening rooms with 7.2.4 Atmos and DTS-X immersive cinema systems will benefit from the matched components of the Alpha series carbon fiber installation speakers.

<span>I had an 8" angled speaker for a while, but it wasn't directional enough.  It was a great speaker, but I had to install it a pretty good ways back from the listening area due to a ceiling fan in the middle of the room.  Even with the center channel cranked up it was hard to hear dialog very well.  From the kitchen, which is behind the living room, you could hardly hear dialog with the TV at a reasonable volume.  This is the only way to go for a an in ceiling center channel!  Great sound and the dialog cuts right through even at lower volumes.  Can hear it very well from the sides of the room and also from the kitchen now.  The grill isn't magnetic, but the trim around the edge is very thin and it almost looks like the magnetic ones.  I do wish it was a magnetic grill, but it sill looks nice.  Can't go wrong with this speaker.</span>
