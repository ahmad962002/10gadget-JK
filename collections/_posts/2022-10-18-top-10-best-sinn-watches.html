<span>I can't say enough about this piece. I'm super into watches and own many vastly ranging in monetary value. I enjoy automatic watches and sometimes as a watch collector or even very low key watch snob, feel as though I should have gone that route instead of this quartz. However after a bit of research, this watch is right up there in capability with more expensive divers. If not more so.<br/>As much as I love to tinker with watches, I value accuracy a bit more. I haven't touched this watch's setting since I got it early July (it's Aug3) , and it's only -2 seconds off. I've read in forums where other's have had perfect accuracy after a month or two, but I can't vouch for that. Still, 2 seconds isn't too shabby.<br/>What's more, is the second hand hits EVERY SINGLE marker perfectly. I love that.<br/>Nothing worse than a quartz watch not hitting the indices. Another bummer about quartz, especially with dive watches, is having to replace the battery. That means you're opening up the back of your watch, essentially changing the water resistance rating from factory specs.<br/>Probably nothing that will affect what most people use the watch for, but still.<br/>It's great knowing this watch with the Eco Drive will probably out last me battery wise, and the case will never need to be opened. As long as you keep Eco Drives charged, they really should never need servicing (unlike automatics).<br/>The band was definitely a bit stiff when I got it which is no big surprise, but after a couple weeks of constant wear, it fits my wrist like a glove and feels plenty broken in.<br/>I also love how the case and bezel are both brushed steel as opposed to some divers that are polished and shiny. The case and bezel just have a real sleek cohesive look and feels a little less flashy, yet the trim around the minute markers gives it that subtle bit of flash when lights hit it a certain way. Very classy imo.<br/>Speaking of lights....the lume on this thing is absolutely insane. I love Citizen for their lume lol. I can seriously wake up at 4 in the morning and read the watch easily in complete darkness. Just walking in the house after being in the sun for a minute, you'll catch that beautiful blue lume in complete daylight.<br/>What else? Screw down crown. More water resistance than you'll ever need. Honestly the only thing that upsets me about this watch, is that after seeing numerous YouTube videos on it, learned it once sold for around $150usd about a year ago!! That's insane to me. People will even buy from you that little scuba tank the watch is packaged in, further offsetting the cost of this beast!<br/>So in conclusion, I love this watch. Do I still love the legendary Seikos...the 007, Sami, Sumo etc?.....sure. But for half the cost with better accuracy, I have zero regrets with this purchase. And to be honest, being in a few different FB watch groups....EVERYone has one of those Seikos and it gets plenty old seeing them daily. This is the watch for the dude that's into watches and knows how good the specs are, and only needs to impress himself.<br/>An underdog watch and easily worth the $200 price tag.</span>

<span>Exclusive fan of: Seiko, Citizen &amp; Casio ProTrek, and not really much else.<br/><br/>Illumination<br/>Competes very well with Seiko's Lumibrite. In fact, I'd say it's just as good. Because of the white-ish indices, the fact that they are surrounded with a chrome border, and the nighttime illumination, I haven't found any level of lighting from sunshine to pitch darkness where the time is unreadable. I find that very impressive.<br/><br/>Solar Power<br/>Imagine a quartz watch that, once fully charged, never needs a battery. Give it some healthy sunshine every day and it'll run "forever". I bought two Citizen Eco-Drives in 2004 and when I handed them down in 2016 they were still running perfectly. You can leave them in a dark drawer for up to 6 months and they still run when you pull them out. If not, a 30 minute charge in bright light kick-starts 'em again. (I don't recommend running any rechargeable battery down to zero, as it shortens the life of the battery.)<br/><br/>Accuracy<br/>Owning no less than 12 Seiko automatics, I am constantly tracking their accuracy with various devices and applications. Using an atomic time application, I have tracked this watch's quartz accuracy for 10 days and it is running fast by 1/4 second in 10 days. (1 second = 40 days. 365/40 = 9.125.)  Just over 9 seconds fast per year. Since you'll be resetting this watch twice a year for Daylight Savings Time anyway, accuracy is a non-issue.<br/><br/>Strap<br/>OMG, the rubber strap is hideous, and it's the entire reason why I took off 1 star. With the included rubber strap, the watch constantly rides up my arm and gets stuck so that I have to keep dragging it back down into place, and when it's in place it always wants to roll forward toward the 12:00 position. You might ask, "why don't you just tighten the strap a notch"? The answer is because I don't like my wrist to be strangled. I prefer a looser fit, more like jewelry, and even Casio has this working well because their ProTrek's have "wings" under the strap which force the strap into a proper circular formation. I replaced the rubber strap on mine with an appropriate steel bracelet and the watch looks so much better now. I wish Citizen didn't discontinue the steel bracelet on this model, that's rather tragic.<br/><br/>Water Resistance<br/>I'm not a diver or even much of a swimmer. So the only thing 200M water resistance means to me is that I'll never have to worry - no matter what I do - about my watch filling up with condensation and dying on me. A+ for that! Just make sure you SCREW DOWN THE CROWN PROPERLY, or you may end up with a micro fish tank on your wrist. This is just common sense.<br/><br/>Crystal<br/>Mineral. Meh... Sapphire is not as expensive as they say, it even comes on some $70 watches. Whether mineral is more shatter-proof than Sapphire in diving situations... first of all, how many people are really diving with a "diving watch" these days? Not many, because divers use computers now. Therefore most of us are "desk divers", pool swimmers, or snorkelers at best. Therefore, the benefits of Sapphire are undeniable. The crystal does seem to have some type of anti-reflective coating, and whether that's true or not it certainly is far from the "light reflector" that dome crystal watches are. (Dome crystal watches are a deal breaker for me.)<br/><br/>Visual<br/>It's unique. It's a little love/hate for me. I don't care for the bottle cap design and it would have been so much cooler if this were a typical diver style shape. It's like if the watch measures 44mm, there's an awful lot of space between that outer size and the actual dial size, and I kinda don't appreciate that. Overall though, it still looks great.<br/><br/>Overall Value<br/>For the price, I haven't seen anything that comes close. Citizen nailed it with this one (except for the rubber strap). The price has gone up, but whatever you pay for it, you're getting a highly accurate quartz watch that never needs a battery, has incredible lume, looks great, includes a date complication, etc. For the money, you're getting a great watch that will last you indefinitely.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Cheers!</span>

<span>Just some words of wisdom to those who don’t know and the bad reviews.<br/><br/>This is a great watch.<br/><br/>First, let’s clear the air on the bad reviews. This is an eco-drive watch. No winding, but not an automatic. It’s powered by light. Either artificial or natural light. When you first get the watch, you will need to place it in the light mentioned above to charge it up. Otherwise it will be on power reserve and the second hand will APPEAR faulty. It needs to be charged up first. Placed mine near window for a day, then it’s good for six months (in complete darkness). As you wear the watch, and it gets light day after day, that is what charges the Eco-drive system. Think of it as a solar watch.<br/><br/>Many reviews express aggravation and returns, it just needs light at first to charge.<br/><br/>Go to citizenwatch/support to verify your model and directions.<br/><br/>Lume is great, brightest Lume of all my collection.<br/><br/>Watch comes without plastic peal off covering because it’s in a plastic display container that resembles an scuba tank. (This is another gripe on reviews) just an issue I wanted to clear up.<br/><br/>Amazon is an authorized Citizen retailer and I caught this watch on Amazon Prime Day for about half off regular price.<br/><br/>Please go to citizenwatch/support on your model before leaving a bad review. This in an excellent dive watch that can be worn with shorts, jeans or a tuxedo.<br/><br/>I love the crown at the 4 O’clock position so it does not pinch your wrist.<br/><br/>One way rotating bezel is tight and clicks well.<br/><br/>Band is rubber, which I prefer on all my watches for comfort.<br/><br/>Solid watch. I would compare it with Seiko, Orient brand watches. It will be one of my favorite quartz watches which keep better time than the expensive and costly to maintain automatics.</span>

<span>I want to talk about the buying process first: This is the JDM version of the Alpinist, model number SBDC091. As a new watch collector, I was hesitant to buy from an international seller. But all the papers are included, the box was correct, and it has the hang tag. Also, I live in the southeastern US and shipping was fast. FedEx shows that the watch shipped from Mishima-Shi, Japan on Thursday 7/16 and it arrived to me on Tuesday 7/20. I would not pay for expedited shipping.<br/><br/>As for the watch, I’m just now getting into watch collecting, and up to now I have only had dive watches. All of them are 40mm or larger. When I opened the box the first thing that struck me is that this is a small watch. Too small, at first. But I’ve been wearing it all day and it’s growing on me.<br/><br/>The strap is fiddly. I felt like I needed a third hand to get it on the first time but once you have it adjusted, the clasp works just like a metal bracelet. The only other thing I noted is that the leather is stiff near the lugs. It needs a break in.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m very pleased with the seller and the way the watch was shipped. The size is growing on me. I may switch to a bracelet at some point.</span>

<span>Time will tell if this watch lives up to my initial rating. I am liking everything about it so far. The main reason for this very early review is to tip my hat to the seller. Premium Japan Got the order on 6-28 and I missed the FerEx driver for sig yesterday 7-1. I picked it up at the local FedEx office this morning 7-2. Folks, this watch came from Tokyo Japan, cleared customs and was out for delivery on 7-1. Premium Japan and FedEx are getting it done!!!!! The packaging was first rate and everything arrived in show room unopened condition. All special plastic bags and documentation were in place. So, my first impression of the watch is excellent. My experience with the seller and delivery is over the top!</span>

<span>This Seiko Alpinist is the 2020 version of one having a near 20-year run, but this one has a new internal  6R35 movement with a 70-hour reserve.  You can read the reviews for the SBDC091.  It's a beautiful watch with an eye-catching emerald face, a new cyclops magnifier for the date at 3 o'clock, excellent luminescence, and it is simply attractive all around.  And, if you get lost in the green forest, you can use this watch as a crude compass!  I really like it.  Here is the 'however':  I do wish Seiko would have included a longer band - say another half inch to an inch is all it would need.  As it is, I have a 7-1/2 inch wrist and it's comfortable on the last hitch mark.  Flexing the leather a bit near the spring pins seemed to help, but length would have made a bid difference in comfort, as I like to wear my jewelry watches over the wrist knuckle (which is more that 7.5 inches around).  All in all, this is a bargain of a watch, a diamond in the rough!  Build tough with screw-in crown, it's good for 600 feet of H2O.  Get one, and you will be part of a cult following this Alpinist movement from the '60s.  Love the looks of this watch!</span>

<span>This is Seiko’s heritage for a field/tool watch.  This is a can’t miss everyday watch.  The Alpinist with a 6R caliber will give around 72 hr.  The green dial pops with the gold Arabic numerals gives you lots of options for this strap magnet.  I bought this because it was a limited edition Japan model and the price was the best I had seen less than the usual $725+ a great value. The vender was prompt less time than I expected.</span>

<span>Overall this is just a fabulous watch that you won't get tired of wearing. Everything from the quality of build to the finishes to the leather band which smells of real pure leather and is thickened near the lugs while thinned near the clasp. I was sent the NEW version with the 80hr reserve (you can tell by the rotor weight on the back if it has cutouts in it vs a solid weight) and am absolutely loving it. The ONLY gripe I have with the watch is that when midnight rolls around the weekday and date complication change exactly at 11:54 rather than 12:00 but this is super common amongst Hamilton watches and in my opinion is excusable because of how fast the change is. When you watch it change over it's INSTANT with such a satisfying small mechanical noise that is overall just really impressive. The only thing that I can think of that others might not like is the somewhat reflective watch face since there is no anti reflective coating, but honestly I kind of like it like that, you can always tell the time that's never a problem even with the reflections, but it just gives it a really nice glossy look. Winding the watch is not as easy as other watches but still very enjoyable and the overall size/dimensions of the watch are very good not too big but not too small. Also to clarify , I've been seeing many comments about if this watch HACKS or not, and I can confirm yes it does which makes setting the time VERY easy. The old version may not have hacked but if you get the new one it will hack. I've almost never written a reviews on Amazon so this just goes to show how great of a purchase this really was!</span>

<span>A nice, solidly built watch. I love the history of the Hamilton Watch Company and this is my first Swiss Auto and I couldn't be happier. Very accurate, sturdy build, and love the day/date complication. I know the way it is set up isn't for everyone but i love it because it's different from the standard day/date on most typical watches. Only two real gripes i have is there is no AR coating on the crystal and for some reason the standard Khaki auto has 100m water resistance but that didn't carry over to the khaki king line. Aside from those minor complaints, this is a beautiful watch!</span>

<span>The problem with the common man, as I chronicled in my extensive memoirs, is that there are so many of them.<br/><br/>And they all want to know what time it is, "what time yah got, Ol' Timer," as if they were actually uncommon and were working a deadline.  Some seize the day, proactively visiting the Walmart jewelry counter and buying a fine timepiece.  But constantly asking the local elderly man for the time so that you can constantly reset your fine jewelry counter timepiece just adds an extra step, in my opinion.  Some, seizing the day more securely, visit the local jewelry store and buy the same fine timepiece for three times the price.  This is why we call them the common man.<br/><br/>When the fine timepiece finally stops, the common man A) takes it to the jewelry counter/store to get a new battery, or B) tosses it in the kitchen drawer.  You know, THAT drawer, which will prove so fascinating when archeologists dig it up a thousand years from now.<br/><br/>The honest-to-deity really gosh-darn proactive seek a timepiece, then, that requires no battery.  Thus, the "automatic" timepiece, which promises never to stop as long as you keep juggling those bowling pins.  The deities, responding to the common man, promptly roll the first Seiko down the mountain.  The common man, seizing the moment yet again, encourages the Seiko to reproduce, which it does, in prodigious quantities.  Such quantities, in fact, that the common man can afford to know what time it is while sacking burgers.  Do you need ketchup?  That will take exactly five seconds.  You're welcome.<br/><br/>The Seiko -- cheap but not cheap.  Timely -- is that a pun?  A fine timepiece for the common man.  Now, enter the Uncommon Man, desiring a more luxurious timepiece, but not too fancy or expensive or with a fancy name and not carved out of a block of gold or platinum and not TOO pretentious when the cuff is pulled back to check the time at the bistro oh my god we're going to be late for Tina's party and that ticks really fast so the second hand doesn't make those obscene jerky movements.  Oh, and not radioactive.<br/><br/>Thus, for the price of five Seiko's, the deities roll the Hamilton timepiece down the mountain, where it is seized and blah blah blah.  The Uncommon Man rejoices, for now he has a truly fine timepiece that is beautiful, accurate, rugged and, well, just slick.<br/><br/>If you want to know anything else, just ask.</span>

<span>This is not my first mechanical movement watch.  I've got another one that's far more expensive but bought this one because I found myself doing things like mowing the grass or working in the garage, with my other one on.  I wanted something nice enough to wear to work or out, but not as expensive, but I have to say, I really like this watch so far.  I've been wearing it just over a week and its very accurate.  In fact I have not noticed any deviation off the clock I set it to, which is my phone.  The case appears to be roughly the same size as a typical Rolex, such as the Day-Date or Milgauss - it says it's 40mm - I'm not sure if that's the case diameter or if it includes the crown guard in that measurement.  There is no Swiss Made marking on the dial, only "333" at the 6 o'clock position, which I believe is the depth it's certified to be worn at under water - I may be wrong however.  Engraved on the case back and on the movement itself, there are Swiss markings.  Upon further research, I found that Hamilton was purchased by Swatch LTD, which owns several high-end brands like Longines and Omega, and also is a huge manufacturer of watch movements.  The movement in this watch is a 25 jewel ETA 2834-2 movement, with 28,800 VPM.  The bezel is polished stainless steel and the rest of the case is brushed stainless.  The case-back is crystal (probably mineral crystal, but I'm not sure), so you can see the movement.  From what I read, the crystal on the front is a sapphire crystal, which is crucial, ensuring it will not be scratched.  There is no anti-reflective coating on either side of the crystal from what I can see.  I wound it to get it going on the first day and have not wound it since, but I have worn it daily since I got it.  I do not know what the power reserve is if you don't have it on for a day or 2.  It's got a nice, soft leather strap and after a week is breaking in nicely.  I'm looking forward to seeing what this watch looks like with a Nato strap on it.  To switch out the strap, you'll need a spring bar tool, but they're cheap.  I paid much less than the $550 sticker in a retail store and for what I paid, it's an extraordinary value.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I have on this is the lume.  It's pretty weak, and unless you go from bright sunlight to pitch black environments, it's not very effective.  I may have to ask around and see if there are any watch makers that do lume upgrades.<br/><br/>I was a bit concerned with the warranty at first, but read Amazon's policy and am comfortable with their 2-year warranty (I do not believe, but may not be correct about it, that they are an authorized Hamilton dealer, which means Hamilton will not warranty the watch).  Comment if I'm incorrect though!</span>

<span>Overall great watch. A lot of reviewers say that it is very large, but that is mostly the width. It certainly sits slightly wide across the wrist, but I found that the thin profile reduces that feeling. The only downside to it is how reflective the glass is, something I didn't hear about in reviews prior to purchase. Using the watch at work surrounded by shop lights, I've found that it slightly reduces the readability.</span>

<span>This watch works great and also looks great. It's really fun to have a watch that was featured in one of my favorite movies, Interstellar.<br/><br/>Also the bracelet is super comfortable. Out the box I bent the bracelet in just a little to get a good shape around my wrist. Also people seem to complain about no AR on the crystal but it's not even noticeable until you are maybe trying to take a photo of it. Beyond that you don't notice it. Even Rolex only has I think 2 watches with AR crystal. So it's nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>The lume is also really nice and can even hold its own to watch lume like Citizen watches have. Lastly, it's hard to argue with how great the cathedral hands on this watch look. Great watch, absolutely great purchase.</span>

<span>I absolutely love this watch. It’s gorgeous in an understated way.  It is pretty much spot on accurate. I’m running about +1 second per day compared to the atomic clock. Drawbacks? Well it is water resistant to 10 bar = 100m = 330 ft. But, the crown is not screw down. And, there is no AR on the crystal. If Hamilton fixed those things, this watch would be absolutely perfect - at least to me. Please note that these are minor drawbacks. Overall, this is an awesome watch.<br/><br/>Also, please note that my photo does not picture the factory strap. I love the factory strap but wear this watch every day. To preserve the original strap, I bought a similar aftermarket strap for everyday wear.</span>

<span>Fantastic watch, and beautiful packaging. BUT, the strap leaves something to be desired. I gave it 5 stars because its such a phenomenal and gorgeous looking timepiece. The strap is HARD, thick and plasticky feeling and not comfortable at all. It is leather and takes time to break in, but for a $500 watch I would expect a better strap. The strap is a little on the short side, but I still give this hammy 5 stars because a strap is fairly inexpensive to replace. Cheers.</span>

<span>I'm going to admit right away that I'm an Omega snob.  I've been collecting heirloom quality watches for over 20 years now, and own many $10K+ timepieces currently, and have bought/traded/sold at least $250K worth of automatics in my lifetime.  Omega's are my favorites by far (currently wearing a Dark Side of the Moon edition), although I generally wear a Zenith as my everyday "beater" auto.<br/><br/>This may change now.<br/><br/>I have owned several Hamilton's over the years.  They are reliable watches with good complications that offer high accuracy on a budget.  This is a very good example of their value line of automatics.  The sweeping second hand appeals to the OCD in me that likes to have something visibly moving all the time on the face of the watch.  The markers are clear in daylight use.  The polished bezel on a brushed case and lugs gives this a dressy casual look.  And the black face with brown bracelet (the raised white stitching is very nice!) offer a very good look with jeans or suits alike.  The case diameter isn't so obnoxiously thick as to cause a problem with dress shirt cuffs, and the overall appearance offers the best of all worlds as an everyday, reliable timepiece and mens jewelry.<br/><br/>This would make an excellent gift for a new graduate entering the job market, or for any man/young man that enjoys subtle fashion accents with their practical accessories.<br/><br/>One complaint....the bracelet is very small and starts out very stiff.  While it quickly become supple after a few days wear, I think those with thick wrists may want to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>**Update 10 months later of everyday wear**<br/><br/>As I stated originally I purchased this to be my everyday "beater" automatic.  It's just too risky to wear some of my heirloom watches on a daily basis.  This watch....perfect for the job.<br/><br/>You don't see many reviews of how well a watch ages.  I'm posting a couple of pictures to show you that this Khaki is durable and up to the task.  The bracelet is showing sweat/water staining but I can fix that with some leather care solution to even it out.  The stitching has held up nicely and the bracelet is now very supple.<br/><br/>The face takes a beating without scratching and the bezel shows only minimal wear.  I've worn this 12-15 hours per day in all kinds of weather, performing every task from daily computer work to repairing a lawn mower.<br/><br/>I have noted that this watch tends to gain about 30 seconds per day.  I have to set it back every few days.  But for the money, it's the best automatic I've ever owned below $2500.<br/><br/>Great watch, great value.  I'm raising my review to five stars.</span>

<span>42 mm is about the smallest watch I can wear given I am a big guy.  But this watch works!  I was thinking about sending the watch back and buying the 44.5 mm version but I am glad I kept it.  The dial is easy to read, the watch is accurate to about + 4 seconds a day and is very light on my wrist.  All in all, a good purchase.  Additionally, the watch arrived on time and the merchant did what he said.</span>

<span>Full disclosure before writing - even though I consider myself a budding watch enthusiast, I don't have a watch collection or any other dive watches to compare this one to. In fact, this was the very first watch that I decided to purchase after doing my own research. And so I will mostly be talking about how the watch is like on its own merits instead of comparing it to other watches simply because I don't have much other watches to compare it to.<br/><br/>A little context, I own/have owned:<br/>1) A cheap Casio quartz watch that I used during high school (I am an undergraduate student right now);<br/>2) An Apple Watch;<br/>3) A Longines automatic dress watch that was gifted to me from my relatives.<br/><br/>I knew I wanted to get a dive watch because I consider it a really versatile design, and I don't mean versatility in the spirit of the Apple Watch, which I would be comfortable wearing in both casual and formalwear, but at the end of the day is a downsized phone on your wrist. Why wear an Apple Watch when you can wear a classy watch?<br/><br/>This Orient Kamasu dive watch exceeded my best expectations and I'm really satisfied with my purchase, and I encourage anyone else out there who needs a dive watch or just wants a non-expensive watch that really delivers value to consider buying an Orient Kamasu. I think the value you get from this watch is amazing.<br/><br/>First off, it looks fantastic, both up-close and from a distance. I think that's mostly emblematic of all dive watches, though. If superficial looks was my only concern, then I would've just gotten an Invicta. I know it's a hideous thought for many, but Invictas do look (big emphasis on "look") fantastic for a cheap price.<br/><br/>However, I really like how well it is performing so far. I estimate that in a 24 hour period, my watch gained about 2 seconds, which is well within what I hope for with an automatic watch, and is notably better than my Longines watch. I am not an expert on the different automatic/mechanical movements of the world, but I did notice that the automatic movements for Orient watches are produced in-house. I've always thought it was kind of weird that a lot of high-end Swiss watches all use the same ETA movement, so I appreciate that Orient is not outsourcing their movement technology to another company. Nothing against the ETA movement, of course - it is a fantastic technology.<br/><br/>There are other characteristics that I like as well, such as how it glows quite well in the dark (though occasionally, it "glows" in the daylight and that makes the watch dial look a bit weird with all the "teeth" appearing yellow instead of white), how it uses a synthetic sapphire for the crystal (a step up from cheaper Orient dive watches using mineral), and how there's a nice, functional day/date complication.<br/><br/>But what really drives home the deal for me is how I'm able to get all of this for a really affordable price. Performance and feature-wise, this Orient Kamasu punches far beyond what its price point would suggest. I believe that with both Orient and Seiko (both are part of the same parent company but are functionally independent), you really get excellent value for your money. As an undergraduate student, I do not think it's a prudent financial choice to spend my money on luxury Swiss watches, though I hope to start a respectable watch collection in the future. I think this Orient Kamasu is an excellent place to start, and I have no doubt I will be wearing it many years into the future.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on the waterproofing aspect of the watch as I don't really swim nor dive and I do find the stainless steel bracelet a bit boring, but I don't have much to complain about it either. All in all, I would highly recommend buying this piece, especially if this is your first dive watch.</span>

<span>Orient is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seiko, but their watches have better movements, better bracelets, better dial/marker/bezel alignment, and just feel like a higher quality product especially at this price point.  Of their four main dive watch models, the Mako, Ray, Kamasu and Kanno (enthusiast nicknames, not Orient's naming convention), the Kamasu is in my opinion the best value as the second priciest but with a sapphire crystal and the only one with the burgundy dial.  Which pops, by the way.  If you're a watch collector/enthusiast and you do not yet own Orient, you're missing out.  It's the best $200 you will spend.</span>

<span>Great piece! Lots of compliments, but the bracelet scratches very easily after just a few times wearing it to work. I’ll be getting a leather strap.</span>

<span>Pros: The green color really pops. Unique retro looks. Good quality for the price.<br/><br/>Cons: Large and heavy - doesn't feel very elegant. Not easy to read the time even in bright light, and impossible to read it otherwise.</span>
