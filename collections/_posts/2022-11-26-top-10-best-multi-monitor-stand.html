<span>I ordered 2 of these. Very sturdy and well designed, little leveling feet underneath if you need to adjust. The only reason for 4 stars is one of these had a chip out of it, and I could tell it chipped in the manufacturing facility, and they just fire glazed over it. Not too big a deal, as I just put it to the wall, but it was annoying to have one slightly defective, but no sense in going through the hassle and waste of returning it. It's probably a very rare situation.  The cool thing is that I use a magnetic mount in my car windshield, so I ordered another one. I have to authenticate from a phone app, so I just mounted one on the glass, now my phone is set to authenticate easily while I'm working, and I can see other alerts and popups when needed, but it's still below my line of sight.</span>

<p> </p><ul>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> TRIPLE MONITOR STAND: The DM253 is a triple desk mount that holds three computer screens. Made of strong steel and finished with a matt black effect, this single monitor stand allows you to adjust both screens’ height, tilt, swivel as well as allowing you to rotate the screen from landscape to portrait. A great space saver, this desktop stand will elevate the screens off of the desk surface, which will free up space that you can utilise for other equipment.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> HEALTH BENEFITS AND INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY: Most stand-alone monitors and laptops are low-levelled and as such they can cause a problem for most people as they are positioned below the user's natural line of sight. When a screen is not positioned properly it can have a negative effect on the user's posture, wellbeing and productivity. This ergonomic office desk mount allows the user to adjust the stand and arms based on their own height and position enabling them to work in comfort.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> ADJUSTABLE MONITOR ARM: This triple monitor stand is adjustable, both in height and in the position or angle of the extendable arms. The 3 arms can be moved up or down the pole, swivel from left to right, and can rotate around the pole 360°. This model has an extendable arm that has three joints that can each swivel 180°. The VESA head brackets can also swivel left/right and can rotate 360° allowing you to view the monitors vertically if you preferred.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> VESA COMPATIBILITY: This three-screen monitor arm is suitable for most major brand PC monitors on the market (i.e. Samsung, LG, Dell, to name a few) who adhere to VESA compatibility. This computer screen mount will support 2 screens 13"-27" in size and with a maximum weight of 8kg each. Each VESA bracket will hold monitors with VESA 100 or VESA 75 mounting holes; this means that the holes should be either 100mm or 75mm apart from each other when measured.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> FEATURES &amp; SPECIFICATIONS: Arm length: 2x 33cm, 1x 8cm. Pole height: 40cm. Weight capacity: 8kg per arm. Colour: black. Material: cold-rolled steel. Fixings are included along with an easy-to-follow instruction manual. It can be fixed to the desk with minimal assembly using the desk clamp included, or it can be installed using a grommet (sold separately: DM-GR-01). We sell a range of accessories for this pole to allow you to customise your set-up including spare arms and VESA brackets.  </span></li>

<span>So I actually loved this mount, and it was really easy to assembly. The only reason I returned it is because I had two monitors that had different heights for their mounting location. I originally had one monitor, and then bought a second one years later because of work. They are different types and brands, so the mounting screws on the back are different (one monitor has it near the bottom while the other has it right in the center). All to say, the arms of the mount don't move up or down, so make sure you check that the mounting locations are pretty similar.</span>

<span>This monitor stand is actually pretty great. I bought it in early 2022 and the product I received didn't have any of the issues other reviewers mentioned. It's super solid. The desk clamp worked fine for me (it's super tight and will probably leave an indent on the desk's surface) and I'm using a single 27in 4k monitor with plans for attaching a wacom cintiq pro to the other arm thanks to the option of doing 100x100 Vesa or 75x75 with both sets of holes predrilled (right now it just holds my keys and sticky notes and stuff). It's also on an adjustable height desk that wobbles a bit when adjusting, but the monitor stand stays in place with no problem. It's rigid enough that tilting the monitor up and down takes some effort but not enough to feel like damage will occur over time with regular use. The arms fold and extend with no problem at all. I was able to loosen the bolts just enough to slide the arms up and down on the column without removing the monitor, which was great because I was pretty nervous about it crashing down to the desktop. The product is pretty much perfect for my needs, but I guess I would've liked a little more height on the column. I like to look straight into my monitor (not tilted up or down) to try to maintain the best posture while i work. And even with my desk at full height and if I'm standing up straight the center of the monitor doesn't sit square with my eye level, even though I measure everything. That's something to consider because the display arms basically sit above center because the monitor sort of hangs at the Vesa mount and the monitor is screwed on after. There's a vertical threaded screw there but the travel is like 0.25in each direction so not a lot of variation. And one thing to note in case it's not totally clear before purchase is that these arms will always be at the same height. They both attach to the same collar that sits around the column so they move together vertically. You can bend, fold, and tilt them separately but they will forever be at the same height vertically. All things considered that's not even close to being a deal breaker for me. In the end this is a great piece of equipment for my office setup and there's really nothing bad to say about its quality, functionality, or description on the Amazon listing. Ot even has a nifty toolbelt on the collar for storing the alan wrenches if you need to adjust them and a set of clips for cord management. I found this thing to be tip top 👍</span>

<span>The arms are sturdy and hold on great even to my thin desktop (about 3/8"). I use it to hold a 27" (D2719HGF landscape) and a 24" (Acer, not sure portrait). The clamp mount is secure and wobbles very little. It also allows for movement with a motorized sit-stand desk with no problems. I do wish it went a little farther back though, since now my monitors are right in my face as opposed to before.</span>

<span>This looked to me to be a very sturdy mounting system, so I bought it, despite the very high price.<br/><br/>It ended up working well for me, but there were two issues I encountered during assembly:<br/><br/>1. The main vertical post is welded to a mounting flange that has four mounting holes for screws to the base plate.  The issue I had was the flange was not square with the post.  I had to insert a 1/16" metal washer under one pf the mounting holes in order to get the main post to stand up straight (measured with a level).  The manufacturer needs to tighten this weld assembly tolerance up from 1/16" to no worse than 1/64".<br/><br/>2. The locking set screws on all joints are adequate but not great.  Most of the joints m use only one locking screw.  You can tighten them until you are blue-in-the-face but you can still articulate the arms with some effort.  There is no way to lock this whole thing down so that it will never move.  That said, it if very difficult to get all four monitors positioned perfectly during assembly; you always have to force them a bit for final cosmetic alignment with each other.  Perhaps this is what the manufacturer intended; I don't know.</span>

<span>My package arrived on time and was well packaged... when I put this together, the instructions were mostly clear and easy to follow.  The only issue I had was figuring out where to adjust the tilt.  There are removable caps to reach the adjustment nut that took me a few to figure out.  I love that it is sturdy and heavy duty.</span>

<span>Working from home with two 24" monitors sitting on my desk has not been optimal. My home office desk is much smaller, so these giants were sitting on the desk, leaving me very little room to work. I received this dual monitor stand last week and can't say enough good things about it! It's extremely sturdy (had just one monitor mounted for a little while while getting ready to mount the other one and the stand never moved). It looks great and is really solid. The only thing I would like a little better is the cable holders attached to the stand - they're a little small and flimsy. Nevertheless, I'm glad I spent the extra $20 on this monitor instead of the other ones advertised on Amazon!</span>

<span>I just purchased two of these stands, currently using one with a pair of 23" Acer S231HL monitors and one with a pair 24" Acer G246HL monitors, and am very pleased with my purchase. These stands are well built and easily hold my monitors with plenty of room for the 24's. They have a nice sturdy design and are built with quality components; these stands look like they would cost a lot more than the $63.00 I paid.<br/><br/>Contrary to some of the negative reviews, these stands are fully adjustable and all pivot points can be tightened/loosened as desired (the adjustment bolts are simply concealed by plastic caps for aesthetics) so there are no fears of loose, sagging monitors. The mounts can be aligned for either vertical (9:16 ratio) or horizontal (16:9 ratio) use, pivoted for both horizontal and vertical movement, and adjusted for height by sliding along the vertical pole. The vertical height adjustment is probably the biggest reason to buy a stand such as this. Most monitors nowadays have simple, nonadjustable baseplates that force the monitor to sit super low on the desk. This stand allows you to get the monitor up off the desk and at a far more comfortable viewing height. This also frees up a lot of desk space, especially if you ditch the baseplate and opt for the drilled install.<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>1) The included screws for the VESA mount were too long for my super thin Acer LED monitors, requiring me to purchase washers to use as spacers (I also could have purchased shorter screws). Not a big deal, but worth noting.<br/><br/>2) The base plate is quite large. This isn't unique to this particular stand, as pretty much all dual monitor stands have large baseplates to help offset the weight of the screens. Again, not a big deal. They also include the hardware so that you can mount the stand straight to the desktop by way of a drilled hole, which isn't an option for everybody, but would certainly result in a cleaner installation and lots of freed desk space.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and would certainly recommend this mount to anybody in the market for a quality dual monitor stand.</span>

<span>I've installed about fifteen of these in the past two months and we are going to get more to finish outfitting the entire office.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>• Affordable price<br/>• Easy to assemble with just a phillips screwdriver and the included tools<br/>• Solid construction, no flimsy parts or pieces<br/>• Manufacturing QC appears to be good, I've seen variances in neither the construction nor the quality of the materials<br/>• Supports at least dual 24" displays<br/>o I’ve only installed 19-24”, it may work with larger ones<br/>• Includes allen and combo hex wrenches for adjusting the tension on all the swivel points<br/><br/>Cons (and these are minor):<br/>• There should be two wire clips on the horizontal bars, one at each end instead of one in the middle<br/>o To keep the wires cleaner (less drooping, less corner cutting)<br/>o To allow the monitors to swivel to the side without binding on the wires<br/>• The base is deep front to back, taking up a fair amount of desk space<br/>o I know this is required for stability, just be aware that the dynamics of your desk will change in an unexpected way<br/>Neither of these are worth deducting a star.<br/><br/>Things you need:<br/>• A phillips screwdriver<br/>o To attach the post to the base<br/>o To run the screws into the VESA mount<br/>• Black Velcro wire ties, qty 2<br/>o To tie the wires at the hinge closest to the monitor<br/><br/>Be aware:<br/>• If you try to use non-matching monitors the VESA mount might be in a different location, making the monitors not aligned<br/>• You would benefit from getting longer cords<br/>o Not required, but when you route cables cleanly be aware that they don't reach as far as they did when running a direct path<br/>o I have had to relocate several workstations to either on top of a desk or onto a pedestal beneath the desk in order for the cords to reach<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you are running dual monitors then this is an excellent solution to not have paper reams or old textbooks stacked up.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>What is the best dual monitor stand?</h3></h3>
    


There are a few factors to consider when looking for the best dual monitor stand. The first is size - make sure the stand can accommodate the monitors you want to use. The second is flexibility - you'll want a stand that can adjust to fit your needs, whether that means change the angle or moving the monitors up and down. Finally, price and quality are important considerations - you'll want to find a stand that offers good value for your money.
<h3><h3>Is a triple monitor stand worth it?</h3></h3>
    

It depends on your needs. If you need more screen real estate for tasks like gaming or graphic design, then a triple monitor stand is likely worth the investment. However, if you don't need the extra screen space, a triple monitor stand can be unnecessary and expensive.
<h3><h3>What is the best 3 monitor setup?</h3></h3>
    

A 3 monitor setup can provide a wealth of screen real estate, but it can also be expensive and require a powerful graphics card. Some considerations when setting up a 3 monitor system include the resolution of each monitor, the distance between monitors, and the type of connector used to attach the monitors to the computer.
<h3><h3>Which monitor stands are best?</h3></h3>
    

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best monitor stand for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. Some popular monitor stands include the VESA mounting adapter, the dual arm desk mount, and the CROSLEY Furniture bamboo stand.
