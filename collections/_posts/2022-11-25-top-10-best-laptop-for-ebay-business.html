<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>Overall, this is a great laptop for its intended purpose, but DO NOT ORDER 64GB!!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The OS takes around 20-30GB (I can't remember specifically how much), default programs (i.e. MS Office) easily eat up another 20GB, and after everything is accounted for you are left with10ish precious GBs remaining--and you'll learn very quickly that whatever you use this thing for will chew right through that space. The Windows updates alone will eat up your GBs, Windows' caching will passively eat up more GBs when you aren't looking, and in less than a year you will be wasting hours deactivating hidden folders, deleting everything you can find, Googling what you can/cannot delete, perpetually slow-loading from a USB stick, and budgeting the remaining GBs between 2-3 programs.<br/><br/>Soon, you won't be able to download Windows updates because you're literally juggling 200MB of HDD space and the system says you don't have enough room to download the next patch. At least you don't have to worry about it sneakily upgrading to Windows 11 one day, because there's literally no room left for it to do so.<br/><br/>And that was to save a trivial amount of money (&lt;$50) on a bigger HDD. I feel pretty stupid for being so stingy now, but at the same time I can't help but blame the manufacturer for not putting a disclaimer that the OS consumes HALF of the HDD, and Windows' default programs eat up *almost* the other half, and realistically you are left with 10GB of HDD space.<br/><br/>Perhaps the other INCREDIBLY annoying thing about Windows 10 is that it will eat up HALF of your RAM just by existing. I never really gave much thought into how much RAM the OS eats up until I found myself staring at Task Manager wondering why Windows 10 needs 4GB of RAM on a laptop that only has 8GB to spare. Absurd. If you can order one with more RAM, then do so, otherwise just know that you'll need to keep this thing running light.<br/><br/>Also, the awesome mousepad with the toggle number pad was super cool, until the poor thing stopped working after several months. It now requires a wireless mouse to function. Oh well. Still not nearly as aggravating as the HDD/RAM situation.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Aside from those issues, for $110 it was a fantastic deal, I would highly recommend it for developers and students who want a light, portable, and simplistic device for text editors and running basic programming projects on. It is preferred by techies who need to move and connect to company devices for troubleshooting, updates, etc., and I think it would be an excellent tool for that job. Obviously, this is not a gaming laptop, and I don't think anyone who buys it is under the impression they'll be running Unreal Engine 5 on it either, but it would totally work for freeware games and simple games that could work on dinosaur computers.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This laptop is a work and school laptop primarily, and it is a wonderful and nifty tool that excels at that role, just be prepared to deal with a broken touchpad potentially, and know that half of your RAM will be eaten up by the OS.<br/><br/>And please, for the love of your sanity, DO NOT ORDER 64GB HDD! Get the larger HDD, you'll severely regret cheaping out on less than a $50 price difference.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>When you buy this, just know that you won’t have a lot of internal storage to work with. I bought an sd card to handle my storage effectively. When you get close to having the internal storage met, expect performance issues. The computer will work slower and just seem to struggle with keeping up.<br/><br/>This is NOT a gaming laptop. Please consider buying a different laptop if you wanted to game. It really doesn’t have the frame rate to handle games that are large. I used this laptop to play Roblox with students of mine and 9/10 this laptop could not keep up.<br/><br/>As for a work laptop it’s lightweight and easy to use. I use this laptop for zoom meetings(with an external camera, not the internal one), homework, writing and casual browsing. It does this job well. I generally won’t watch anything on it because the audio quality isn’t great, but if I had to use this laptop I would play the audio with headphones or a speaker.<br/><br/>Overall for school, work, or causal browsing Id definitely recommend this laptop.<br/><br/>PS this is not a backlit keyboard.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>Aspire 5 with 4gb RAM 128gb PCIe NVMe SSD drive notes (long, so you may want to skip this review):<br/><br/>Aluminum cover, plastic housing.<br/><br/>Left side ports - Ethernet cable, HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Headphone jack.<br/>Right side ports - Kensington computer lock port, USB 2.0.<br/><br/>Notably missing - no port for SD cards at all.<br/><br/>Not a touch screen, but nice in color and clarity. (Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).<br/><br/>The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.<br/><br/>Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port.  Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).<br/><br/>Windows "S" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home.  It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to "S" version.<br/><br/>To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry.  You may want to Google instructions to verify):<br/><br/>Go to Settings.<br/>Then select Update &amp; Security.<br/>In the left sidebar, click Activation.<br/>Then click “Go to the Store.”<br/>Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.  These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.<br/><br/>The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).<br/><br/>If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS.  Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify.  See below on how to get into BIOS.<br/><br/>The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5).  You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade.  A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected.  If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.<br/><br/>The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes.  Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.<br/><br/>The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing.  Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word.  YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord  at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.<br/><br/>The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.<br/><br/>The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with "5.94gb usable".  The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display.  If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed).  16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed.  For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable.  YMMV.<br/><br/>How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers.  I found them quite simple.  Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover.  Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar).  Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.<br/><br/>"Bloatware" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk.  The "Microsoft Office" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.<br/><br/>After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications.  I have 78gb of free space left on "C" drive.<br/><br/>The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb).  I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface.  If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line.  I also found the "Full 1080 HD" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off.  So I did.  If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker?  THAT one I would leave in place.  As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information.  (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).<br/><br/>A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off.  If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles "Airplane Mode" on/off.  Note that the "function" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.).  To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the "Fn" key simultaneously.  Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open.  If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS.  To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).<br/><br/>For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14" range (11" for road trips).  That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop.  At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad.  Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers.  YMMV.<br/><br/>If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ce<br/><br/>HTH<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Jim</span>

<span>I bought this laptop as a replacement for my old Toshiba laptop from 2012. The Toshiba one was starting to show its age by failing to pass POST and thus failing to boot. I had used it almost every single day since 2012 after all, as it was my college laptop and even helped me launch my career as an engineer, so it has served me well. But the OS failures were getting troublesome. They were happening increasingly often, so I decided before all my data was lost (which wasn't really that much, since I keep all my actually important data on a home file server), I decided to shop around for a nice, reliable, not-too-cheap laptop I could use to replace it, and this is the one I chose to buy.<br/><br/>For the non-Linux enthusiasts, feel free to skip this paragraph, but a kernel panic is basically the Windows blue screen of death equivalent on Linux. My old Toshiba was having kernel panics all the time starting with Kernel 5, so I thought maybe it was my old hardware which has having trouble with the brand new kernel. I tried an LTS version of Kernel 4.19, thinking it was going to solve my kernel panic issue, but nope. I still had kernel panics all the time, and it was starting to get worrying how often it was happening (multiple times a day near the time I got this new Acer laptop). So I feel like I got the new Acer laptop just in time before the Toshiba hardware became unbootable. Now, I'm an electrical engineer, but I'm a lazy engineer. I didn't feel like dissecting the Toshiba to try and pinpoint what the problem might have been. I use Arch btw (best meme 2k19)<br/><br/>So back to regular English. I'm thoroughly impressed with the hardware that AMD has developed with their Ryzen lineup and their Vega graphics. Sadly, with all the cryptocurrency mining happening nowadays, it's actually hard to find any AMD graphics card for use with actual graphics workloads like gaming. But that's beside the point. This Acer laptop, with its Ryzen 3 processor and built-in Vega Picasso graphics is almost overkill for what I use it for. I haven't tested any games on it, but I imagine it would run Minecraft well enough. Maybe not 60fps, but still enough to play. I use this laptop mainly for just web browsing, and occasional coding when I'm feeling ambitious with some sort of personal software project I want to work on.<br/><br/>In the time that I used Windows 10 S Mode... it was just plain dumb. Not being able to install software from non-Microsoft sources? Really, Microsoft? What are you doing? You can easily opt out of the S Mode crap, but it warns you that you'll never be able to go back to S Mode in the future if you ever change your mind. Like that'll scare me into keeping S Mode! I'll show you how much I care about S Mode. I only spent about a half hour tinkering with it before I just blasted the whole NVMe M.2 drive clean and installed good old Arch Linux on it with a fully encrypted filesystem, so ain't nobody getting into my data. And I can say, this NVMe M.2 drive is freaking lightning quick. Compared to the old HDD on my Toshiba, this new laptop boots in like 15 seconds, if even that. My main PC with Godly specs (Intel i9-9900K + RTX2080Super + 1TB Samsung NVMe M.2) boots in around 10 seconds, so this little laptop is definitely keeping up with the speed.<br/><br/>Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic computer; probably the best laptop I've ever owned at this price point. It's perfect for basic usage, and I recommend it to be used for light workloads like checking email, browsing social media, editing office documents, coding, and other basic tasks of the sort. The Ryzen + Vega chip will definitely last several years, and I'm happy to finally support a quality AMD product. Ultimately, it's up to you as the customer to decide if this is the right computer for your needs. Evaluate why you need this computer and determine whether or not the price of this laptop would best suit your needs. I needed something I could rely on with streaming, decoding, and rendering video data from YouTube, Twitch, and/or Netflix which is actually a bigger task than people give it credit for. If you don't intend to watch many videos or do anything more resource-intensive than that, then this laptop might be a touch too powerful for your needs. With all that in mind, it's safe for me to say that this Acer laptop is perfect for the moderately light workloads I intend to use it for.</span>

<span>This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several "premium" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.<br/><br/>With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly "hot". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.<br/><br/>I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.<br/><br/>This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.<br/><br/>The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.<br/><br/>It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.<br/><br/>For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.<br/><br/>As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the "lite" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.<br/><br/>Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.<br/><br/>I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.</span>

<span>This is my first laptop, so keep in mind that I know nothing about laptops.<br/><br/>However, I got this laptop for animation purposes. A creative whim to see if OpenToonz is as great as two hundred Youtubers swear it is.<br/>I was worried that it might not be able to handle such complex programs, since it is in fact a budget laptop, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does it effectively run OpenToonz, it also handles rendering in Blender and other programs that I thought might be too much for its processing capacity. I've played a few high resolution games on it without any issues, as well.<br/><br/>I saw another review from a wonderful human being who knows a lot more about computers than me, and he left in depth instructions on how to turn off S Mode as well as how to upgrade your computer with a couple additional parts to expand its memory and processing. I did not utilize any of those recommendations (yet) and the laptop works amazing!<br/>It's got super fast internet, downloads everything quickly, amazing resolution, and like I said, it can handle some pretty tough programs. Some of my friends can't run blender on their own laptops, so that speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Still, there are two issues I've found so far.<br/><br/>Issue 1, the most obvious:<br/>The volume on this laptop is crap. It can be sitting right in front of your face and not be loud enough for you to hear the quieter sounds in a video. This is easy to fix with a speaker, so it's not a big deal, but I'd recommend getting a speaker at the same time you get the laptop just to avoid the disappointment when movie time comes around.<br/><br/>Issue 2:<br/>It overheats very very VERY easily. Don't set this laptop on any blankets or pillows, or anything other than a hard surface.<br/>I noticed quickly that it gets warm basically as soon as you set it down on your lap, so I've been pretty careful about that. But just earlier today, I fell asleep with it on my lap (oops) and when I woke up about an hour later, it was off. It would not turn on. The charging light was blue, meaning that it was charging properly from the cord. When I pressed the power button, however, the power light flashed blue one time very briefly but the laptop didn't even try to turn on. No fans, no clicks, nothing. I waited an hour and tried again, but it still wouldn't turn on. Needless to say, I was horrified!<br/>If this happens to you, please don't panic, it's very easy to fix.<br/>Windows laptops have this handy dandy feature where they shut themselves off if they're at risk of overheating, to prevent any damage from happening. They also prevent themselves from being turned back on, apparently, but you can fix it in three easy steps.<br/><br/>1: Unplug your computer from the power cord.<br/>2: Flip the computer over, and use a needle to press and hold the battery reset button located on the bottom for 5 seconds.<br/>3: Wait ten full minutes, plug in your computer, and turn it on.<br/><br/>Mine booted up instantly when I did that, and I was deeply grateful for the feature that saved my laptop from my own relentless stupidity.<br/><br/>With that said, this is a fantastic laptop and it works great, but there are two purchases you should make right off the bat: buy a speaker/headphones, and buy a cooling pad. I also highly recommend buying a mouse; the track pad isn't bad or anything- mine works as well as any track pad I've ever used- but computers are always better with a mouse ;D<br/><br/>If you're considering this laptop, I'd say go for it. Just make sure that if you're buying it for a kid or anyone who has a habit of laying in bed with the laptop in their lap, you get them a cooling pad. Windows will probably prevent it from being damaged from overheating, but you can spare them the panic of a laptop that won't turn on and the struggle of finding a needle that fits the reset hole.<br/><br/>Happy browsing, everyone!</span>

<span>I really want to like this laptop and give it good marks, as it's one of the few Thunderbolt 4 Laptops on the market and without all the "flip screen" type extras I didn't want to pay for, but the little details are a concern. For a start the outer box this came in was absolutely abused / destroyed, with one side almost completely "punched in". The inner box was OK with one minor puncture but otherwise intact, the only reason I did not reject the shipment.<br/><br/>Once I got it open everything went pretty smooth with the setup until I realized at least one of the keys so far, is partially dead. The Delete key does not have the same feel or travel distance as the others, or the same sound, and if you press it in the middle / normally, it does not work. It only works if you press down hard or on either edge. Thought it might be popped off it's mechanism so tried the old trick of slowly pressing it down all the way and holding it there for a second or two but doesn't help. May return unless ASUS support has an easy fix that doesn't involve disassembly / removing the entire keyboard. The trackpad also has a somewhat flimsy feel like if you press it too hard it's going to break.<br/><br/>Based on the System Info and CPU (11th gen) I do think this has Thunderbolt 4 but even after updating the system and bios it reports as Thunderbolt 3, which is a concern because some TB3 PC laptops were known to be limited to 20Gbps instead of 40. Other aspects like screen quality and responsiveness of the system seem OK so far.<br/><br/>I'm not totally disappointed but this was my first ASUS and I can't say I'd be comfortable buying another one for the amount of money paid here. Barring an easy fix for the keyboard or a replacement I will probably buy Razer next time. Their only TB4 laptop happened to be 13" for now so didn't go with them here.<br/><br/>[Update - not exactly sure how but the delete key seating aspect has resolved itself somehow, possibly after closing the lid during a prior manual fix attempt. So moving up to 3.5 stars for now. I have used this computer more extensively now and can say for all but the most resource-hungry apps it does pretty well; I think it's reasonable to call this a true all purpose computer (sans gaming) with the new Xe graphics and 32GB of shared memory it seems to handle different kinds of apps including Photoshop and others pretty well. Doesn't do as well as a video editing platform especially if you're working with 4K or raw footage, but if you work with mezzanine formats as intermediary you should be able to get decent RT playback in a lot of scenarios.]</span>

<span>I bought this from Amazon Warehouse and it may have never been opened and used.<br/><br/>The laptop is exactly what I was looking for. Long battery life, great processing power for Excel spreadsheets, and USB-C charging (I use my 65W third party phone charger and my third party cigarette light car charger).<br/><br/>I was also looking for a screen that wasn't glossy so I could work outside and watch YouTube, etc. This is excellent in the sunlight (I used to have a Dell XPS 13 and the beautiful glossy screen couldn't be used outside).<br/><br/>The laptop case is very thin, and it's so lightweight.<br/>I also appreciate the additional features of a built-in Webcam physical block out switch for privacy/security and an integrated numeric keypad that appears under the touchpad at the push of a button.<br/><br/>The ONLY negative I have on this is that the Delete key is adjacent to the Power key and I can negligently put the laptop into sleep by pressing the incorrect key.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>This is an incredible laptop (especially if you can find it on a discount) that meets all of my needs and then some.</span>

<span>This PC is very light, very thin, and fast.  At 2.7 lbs. I can hold it easily in one hand.<br/><br/>ASUS has polished its Windows 10 distribution - not a lot of bloatware so no hours spent removing useless software. Using Onedrive and Microsoft 365 allowed me to configure it in an hour with all my documents, pictures, and downloaded setup files. Developer software has to be individually installed and configured but the time to do that was reduced as well.<br/><br/>I wish that it had a touch-screen and backlit keyboard but having 32gb for running VM's, compilers, and multiple development environments takes first place.<br/><br/>Nice screen and keyboard feels good for speedy typing.</span>

<span>I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it.</span>

<span>I don't understand all the negative reviews about the screen. It's not the BEST laptop screen I've ever used, but FAR from the worst. And for less than $250? Are you guys kidding me? Are you expecting an ipad pro level screen?<br/><br/>The laptop is solid even though it's plastic, I'm not worried about putting this thing in my backpack. While the keyboard is a little stiff for my taste, it works well. I'm just used to my mechanical keyboard on my desktop. I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:<br/><br/>Perfectly fine.<br/>Solid.<br/>Reliable.<br/>Lenovo-quality.<br/>I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.<br/><br/>The negatives?<br/><br/>The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.<br/>PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.</span>

<span>Update: After a second email, the Seller finally responded to me. Sad to report the laptop keyboard is now not even typing when the key is pressed and continues to shut down or stop working without cause. Under a year since purchase date it's evident I was sold and purchased laptop junk from the Seller. And Seller is not willing to assist with the laptop purchased less than a year ago. It's not normal for a laptop to stop working like this. I do not recommend purchasing from the Seller without doing due diligence and shopping around and thoroughly reading customer experience and reviews. I learned my lesson.<br/>Purchased this computer on April 5, 2021. Not even a year later laptop is freezing, keyboard buttons are popping off, shuts down without known cause or actions. Very disappointed. I will contact the seller to see if there is a warranty on the device since it hasn't been a year since the purchase date. Hope Seller is responsive and provides good customer care post purchase. Fingers crossed.  i typically don't have problems with HP products so this is disappointing, especially since the laptop has been cared for and never dropped or mishandled. Sighhhh.</span>

<span>I personally love this laptop, in fact, I'm writing this review on this laptop, but that's only because it's the right laptop for my needs. This laptop is not for everyone, because I don't believe it's all that practical to be used for multimedia purposes, AKA, gaming and streaming, etc. There are specific reasons why I say this, and one of the reasons for that, is yes, just like the other reviewers say, the screen is a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to say that the screen isn't bad, it's just not great. It is a full HD display, but you do pretty much have to look straight at it to get a clear picture. You can see it okay from certain angles, but nothing too fancy. That's why I don't think it's good for multimedia, for example, if you want a laptop to stream movies and watch shows with friends and family, I would not recommend this laptop. It'll stream it just fine, because this computer is very fast, but the picture won't give a clear picture to a group of people watching it. However, if it was you, then I'd say go for it.<br/><br/>The other reason why I don't think this laptop is good for multimedia use, is because of the audio. I am going to be brutally honest when I say that the audio on this laptop is absolutely horrible. I put max volume on my Spotify, and it the volume was so unimpressive, that I could comfortably hold a conversation with someone next to it. So, not only will the screen give a person issues, but unless you have a good speaker connected, you're not going to hear any music, shows, or movies very well with this one.<br/><br/>I also don't recommend gaming on this laptop, not just for the reasons already stated above, but because of performance. This computer can perform very well at several multimedia tasks in terms of processor and memory, and you could play some simple games. But the moment you talk about WoW, or Overwatch... well, let's just say I don't believe this laptop was designed to be a gaming laptop.<br/><br/>That all being said, I love this computer because I don't need a laptop for gaming, or for multimedia purposes. I am a writer, and I also love doing research, and doing basic stuff like checking email, or Reddit. For those basic tasks, this computer is actually quite phenomenal. Because of the SSD (Solid State Drive for those that don't know), it boots up very fast. It could be completely off, and from the time I push the button to turn it on, to the time the computer is ready for whatever task I want to do, barely 4 or 5 seconds have passed. That is not an exaggeration!<br/><br/>The battery lasts for several hours, as long as you're smart about it. Like making sure the light on the keyboard is either off or low, when using the battery, and turning the screen brightness down. You can google tricks like that to extend battery life on all kinds of electronics, but as long as you do those basic things, the battery should last at least 6-7 hours.<br/><br/>The processor is super fast, and I never have to wait more than seconds, if that, for the computer to act on anything I do. The moment I click on Google Chrome, the browser and my personal front page is up in less than 2 seconds. This computer is very fast, and despite what I've said before about the screen and audio, it actually does stream Netflix and all the other streaming apps pretty well.<br/><br/>To anyone wanting to play games, watch movies with friends/family, or listen to loud music, I would not recommend this laptop. However, if you want a laptop to do everything else, I would not only recommend this laptop, but I would even go so far as to say that it's the best one on the market, for its price.</span>

<span>First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!<br/><br/>This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.<br/>2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.<br/>3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.<br/>4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.<br/>5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.<br/>6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.<br/>7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been less<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.<br/>2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.</span>
