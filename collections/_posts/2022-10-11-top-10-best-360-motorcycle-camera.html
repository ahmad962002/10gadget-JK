                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The GOOD:<br/>This camera alone is a fun camera to use and play with.  I love the fact that you can record all directions without worrying about missing a shot (but you still need to be mindful of the direction you point your camera).  To get the best video quality  without giving yourself or the viewer a headache you need to actually point and record with the lens facing the subject (if you're taking clips from a weird angle the video doesn't look that good.)<br/>The battery life for the most part is pretty good considering it's supposed to be waterproof (haven't dared to test it in water yet).  I find the battery outlasting the gopro and also the dji osmo action.<br/>Price vs video quality is not bad, I would say it's very competitive with gopro and dji BUT still not as good as my phone (S22 Ultra) video quality.  I mainly choose this over my phone as I wanted to have a camera that acts like a cameraman for me so as I'm doing activities this will be able to capture myself.  (very capable).<br/><br/>Now... The CONS:<br/>I really hate that there are no good lens protectors (well they have a premium protector that is like $50, but even that can get scratched or cracked and you're out $50) that are cost efficient and don't hurt the video quality.  I've read many reviews that any lens protection available still depreciates the quality.  I've opted to not get a lens protector yet but just the rubber lens cap for now.  I'm extremely worried for the lens getting scratched or worse cracked.  I don't see this as an action cam and the GoPros and DJI osmo action definitely has this beat as far as durability.<br/>I do find that the camera does heat up pretty warm when recording for awhile, I haven't got any errors in regards to overheating but have had issues with the micro SD card not being able to record fast enough (even though I'm using a 128GB Sandisk Extreme 160MB/s card.  The camera just ends recording and shuts down.<br/><br/>Video/Data Transfer to Phone &amp; Mobile App - A HUGE NEGATIVE and<br/><br/>Potential Deal Breaker:<br/>First off, the Insta360 app is a pretty decent app which allows editing to be fun and intuitive BUT... I find the process EXTREMELY frustrating, time consuming, and not efficient.<br/><br/>The ONLY way I currently can transfer the recorded videos from the camera (micro sd card) to my phone (S22 Ultra) is via wifi connection with the camera and only through the Insta360 app.  (I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY OTHER WORK AROUND).<br/>I've tried via USB cable - USB C to USB C does not work (I read on forums that ONLY THE INSTA360 USB C cable will work, I haven't tried yet because it was not provided with the camera and can only be ordered through the Insta360 site for $8 + $18 shipping and tax?)<br/>I've tried taking the micro sd card out and using a card reader - DOES NOT WORK, the app doesn't load any of the files via card reader.<br/><br/>I don't mind taking the time for post production editing the videos (ie adding keyframes, exporting, adding music).  Took a few hours just to edit a 7 minute clip, and I still needed to import the clips into another video editing app, BUT the end product is awesome.<br/><br/>THE ISSUE - they advertise that you don't need to download the clips in order to edit in the app BUT if you choose not to download and edit straight from the camera you are consuming the camera battery as well as your device battery (the camera itself also gets very warm, also the video clips lag when editing).<br/>If you decide to download the video clips from the camera to edit it TAKES FOREVER! and on top of that you still need to spend time to re-frame then export which also TAKES FOREVER!  During the download and export times, your phone or device is pretty much unusable because you have to wait for the processing to complete.<br/><br/>If I had to reconsider my purchase this big issue would have changed my decision... Hopefully this information helps others to make up their own minds.<br/><br/>If Insta360 would of just provided the USB C cables (USB C to USB C) this issue probably wouldn't have been a deal breaker.</span>

<span>I am having a lot of fun with this camera. There’s a lot you can do. The mobile app is great and adds to the fun factor. It is great for preserving precious memories and it is fun going back to the 360 videos and relive the moment.<br/>Battery life is not great but good enough for normal length videos. I got 2 extra batteries just to be on the safer side but so far I only came close to draining 1 battery once so I still have not switched batteries in the middle of an activity.<br/>Overall, this is just a very fun compact 360 camera that makes preserving precious moments easy.</span>

<span>I've ONLY played with it, didn't use it for any real work, but man is the APP just the worst. I'm on android, and my phone luckily supports the app and whatnot, BUT it requires access to "PHONE" aka your calls which gives them access to your logs, phone number, etc. Can't use the app if you don't activate it. Also since Android updated I think 10 and later versions, app permission names are all different from the permission names in the Insta360 app, so it's a real guess and check to see how many permissions you can leave off since, inside the app settings in "system" it truly asks for EVERYTHING; contacts, mic, camera, and the usual you expect like Storage. Also, YOU HAVE TO HAVE location on to use this app. Which has me looking for "spoofing" apps to spoof permissions turned on for security reasons. SORRY, just not in the most trusting mood with China these days, can't explain why, cough cough.<br/><br/>As for image after the DEMANDS it asks you for, it's not bad, though the image quality on screen is weirdly better looking than it is on my monitor. And no, it's not my PHOTO REFERENCE GRADE monitor that covers 98% of the Adobe RGB spectrum and is 500 Nits bright making it HDR500 compliant. Paid 900 for this monitor. It's not the issue. It's a neat device. Just hate the permissions it asks of you. It can perform at GoPro Max levels, and I was testing its capability in lower than desirable light. WHICH I did go into settings and adjusted the EV, ISO, Shutter and whatnot so it looked GREAT on the display, but for whatever reason, when I transferred it to the PC, looked  WAY DARKER AND WORSE. HMM. Also, Insta360 likes hiding features behind "PRO" mode, like 4K60 and the 5K settings. So, if you're wondering where those resolutions are hiding, it's there.<br/><br/>!!!HUGE TIP/WARNING!!!<br/>I bought this camera from AMAZON. I bought their other lineups from their site. DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR SITE, BUY FROM AMAZON. It takes forever to get to your house from China, and 90% of their items don't offer expedited shipping. Even if offered, it's disgustingly expensive like $50 to $100 per item expensive. Items come whenever and rarely together. So you might get one accessory one day and then the next month get another and after that 2 weeks for another part and so on. COMPLETE mystery as to the logic why that is.<br/><br/>Also, the Insta360 site tends to have worse pricing, not terribly worse, but when you factor in shipping, then it's way worse. BUT if you go free shipping. I find their site has a $50 to $100 premium to their items sometimes there's a deal, but also most of their items are RARELY kept in stock WHICH IS FRUSTRATING.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>Don't buy, yes it's one of the best ones out there and can easily go toe to toe with GoPro Max, without any struggle in a better form factor which means the stitching is better, as well. BUT the whole NEEDING AN APP ON YOUR PHONE to even USE this is disgusting and annoying. THEN there's a weird anti-HDMI out this company seems to have. NONE of their cameras support it, which at the price range of these cameras is inexcusable. YOU can kind of make the argument this camera can't find room for it, fair enough. BUT their OneR cameras that are modular DEFINITELY have room for it.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera specifically for its ability to live stream in the 360 degree viewing angle (uses lenses on both sides of the camera) when it worked, it was great, however, over a short time period, it became inconsistent and then stopped live streaming in 360 degree view altogether. I contacted customer support which if I understood correctly, one person works in customer support that is able to communicate in english. This means leaving a message and they will call me back as soon as they can. I was getting error codes on the insta360 One x2, often. When I read the codes to customer service, they said their engineers had not ever received these error codes before but that they would get back to me when they had a solution. I also sent (by their request) video of the malfunction (I screen recorded the error codes and what would happen when the camera would not allow me to live stream in the 360 degree viewing angle). Tech support and the engineers did not ultimately offer a solution and I did not hear from them again. Because all of this happened within the thirty day return time period, I was able to return the camera but had to wait two weeks from the date they received the camera, to receive my refund (this was highly frustrating) and I also was not given the choice to exchange the camera which would have allowed me to be sent a replacement, right away, and return the malfunctioning camera. But this option was not available to me. A highly frustrating experience. I give the camera five stars because I really like it in every other way and it’s a great idea, great build quality, and if they can fix the live streaming in 360 degree viewing angle, would be a masterpiece. I still like the camera but will wait until they offer a solution to the live streaming in 360 degree.<br/><br/>Also, to clarify, the many times I called and spoke to customer support (I would be required to leave a message) the same person (I recognized her voice) called me. So I asked if she was the only one that works in customer service and she said no, but that she was the only english speaking person that worked in customer service. Stating that if I knew their language, they have many customer service I could speak to. She was nice except when a couple of times she told me I asked too many questions. I’ve never been told this by any customer service, before. To me, it’s normal to ask questions when I’m trying to understand something and especially when I’m trying to find solutions.<br/><br/>Also, it would be wise to mention, I had purchased the additional warranty offered on the insta360 One X2 website, I think it cost 39 dollars and provides a one year free replacement (one time only). This warranty at the time of purchase, was not available here on amazon. It appeared I was required to purchase this warranty from the insta360 one x2 website. Which it says one has three days maximum to purchase this free replacement warranty, from the date of camera purchase. I purchased the free replacement warranty and when I returned the camera, insta360 customer service told me that the free replacement warranty is not returnable, even though I clarified that the camera was still within the thirty day return policy and is not working properly.<br/><br/>All that said, I still like the camera very much and hope to one day own one again. I will watch closely to see how the live streaming feature in 360 degree viewing angle is working for everyone on their YouTube videos and social media videos altogether. Thank you for reading my review! I hope you have a wonderful day!</span>

<span>I use this camera for listing rentals on Zillow etc  It works great for uploading to their website. The app is easy to navigate and the photos make the places look awesome. Really gets those 360 shots and panoramas that your cellphone won’t get. Seems pretty durable. The price? It’s a little high but it’s money well spent if you get your place looking great and it rents fast right? Don’t forget to purchase a tripod at the same time. Pretty hard to use without one.</span>

<span>It does not take stunning HD photos like some of the more expensive options, but it works great for it's value. We use it at our construction sites for documentation in each room/area and it has been super useful. Be very careful with the lenses though as they stick out proud of the camera frame and can be the first thing to touch other surfaces if not handled carefully.<br/><br/>The only negative for the camera, and hence the 4 stars, is that the camera's base firmware out of the box does not work well with iOS 14 and up. It will have a spotty connection with the iPhone and will constantly say cannot connect with camera even though it is. The camera needs to be updated to it's newest firmware in order to work with iPhone's iOS 14 and up. If you are lucky enough to get the camera to connect to the phone long enough, then the camera can be updated from the phone. Otherwise, the updated has to be done from your computer. It is not Ricoh's issue per say since it was Apple's upgrade that caused the issue, but it would be nice for Ricoh to at least explain that or make that clearer to customers as I would have never known that solution without Googling the issue.</span>

<span>With the standard settings on this camera I can still see blurring and JPG compression artefacts in both the front-facing stills and 360 images and videos.<br/>The worst thing is the intrusive software.

<span>After some time of learning how to use this. Picture quality is good, not as good as a gopro. Having said that, this camera take a 360 picture and video. Which uses a lot of pixels. Not like a, I think it's a 180 degree picture/video like a gopro. When you take a picture that is not up close the picture/video is better. Also when you take a 360 picture/video. When you look at the picture/video you took. When you zoom in you can see a line where the two cameras can barely see. All and all would I tell a friend to buy this. The answer is Yes.</span>

<span>I got second try package. It had no box but everything was in plastic and didn't seem anyone even tried anything. Hand grip is nice but every action camera you got has one. I just use selfie stick on my Canon video camera. So all you need is 360 camera. Get 1.41 firmware update. This has made the wrist remote work. I went to 20 ft and it turned the camera on and start the video. I don't need that much reach. I got camera mount on the roof of pickup. I didn't trust the wrap around case and it has no point to it.  Gopro videos is the best of any thing I have. This camera video is ok. I turned it down because size was almost 4 g and  it was only minutes long. It also doesn't play nice with PC getting video off mini cd card. I bought a 360 camera and don't plan to ever use other views. I have 2 action cameras and a person could mount Canon outside and it get some kind of view. . Also I had order some 2 prong mount that fit the camera. The mount is different than the other brands. For price this is 360 camera to try. After turning video down it seems to render the video better. It is confusing how it puts video together.  Get spare batteries if mounted outside. Walking around this might not be the camera to use.</span>

<span>Purchased for experimenting with 360 video from quad prop drone. Didn't expect perfection for the price. Not really suitable since it has virtually no stabilization resulting in "wavy" videos due to drone motion. I like the easy of moving video from card to computer and VR headset using the Mac App. Took a while, probably more due to the micro SD card I was using.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, the "stitch line" is very noticeable.</span>

<span>Not especially easy to use. My advice is to get the better remote that allows you to switch from video and still camera along with choosing lend. Hard to see display to make mode selections. It does take nice pictures. I like the removable battery so you can have spare  batteries with you. I use it more outdoors which makes the display hard to use. I have not taken many videos with it but what short ones I have taken look great.</span>

<span>It can take stills and movies. It works well and is reasonably easy to use. I haven't mastered it yet. The one downside is it makes one want super high resolution images that one could zoom in endlessly. The resolution is pretty good but not as high as if the image were on a more restrictive area. The way to explain this is simply that the HD image is spread over half a sphere, so the pixels are spread out across the entire half sphere. The second camera covers the other half sphere. So instead of a normal camera which concentrates the image resolution in a small area, this camera uses them to cover the entire 360 spherical space. If you want super high resolution of a small area, this is the wrong camera. If you want a spherical image of the entire environment that you can look around, it is great.</span>

<span>Insta360 ONE RS<br/><br/>After having this camera for a few days. I can say I am impressed. I own the ONE X2 and the GO2 from Insta360. Both cameras are nice but I wanted something to compete with my GoPro Hero 9. Looking at the ONE RS and this Twin Edition it makes perfect since to go with this camera if you are looking for a 4k action camera and a 360 camera.<br/><br/>The two lens allow you to be so much more creative. Getting normal action camera shots and the wild 360 shots all from one camera. Here are my pros and cons so far.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>-Multi lens compatible<br/>-compact size<br/>-amazing stabilization<br/>-easy to use<br/>-nice tough screen<br/>-great case design, easy to take the camera in and out of it<br/>-amazing app for editing<br/>-No memory card errors like GoPro has all the time.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-sound, this is a downfall of all action cameras<br/>-low res 360 when exported<br/>-no ens cover for the 4k camera<br/>-4k Lens is not replaceable like the GoPro 9 and 10 are<br/><br/>For the week that I have had this camera I am impressed with it. After using 3 different GoPro’s over the years, and also using the ONE X2 and GO2 cameras I feel Insta360 has a great camera with the ONE RS. The new 4k boost lens is nice since it has in camera flow state stabilization. This will save time if you don’t want to use the app and go right to your favorite video editing software.<br/><br/>If you have used the GoPro Hero 9 and 10 you will know the touch screens are not as good as they should be. The ONE RS seems to have solved this issue. The screen feels more like a phone screen and response to your touch quickly and accurately.<br/><br/>The number of accessories that are out already is really nice. Most of the ONE R accessories will work with the ONE RS. Also if you have a ONE R you can upgrade batteries, the Core or Lens if you want. No need to buy the whole camera. I hope that Insta360 sticks with this design for years to come.<br/><br/>Having a Insta360 camera now that can recored in 4k is a really nice add to my camera collection. I feel in the months to come I will use this camera a lot more than some of my others. Having the two lens and the ease of use really helps with that.</span>

<span>The camera itself is competing with GoPro and many others - but it stands out of the crowd.<br/><br/>Beside having a 48MPel sensor + 360 dregree full sphere view + gyro stabilization + ... the camera has also great editing software for your phone and your PC/Mac which allows to e.g. create a spectacular video very quick " *post* production".<br/>Capturing the video couldn't be more easy - and the selfi stick doesn't even show up on the final video. Thanks to the gyro, the camera knows always the direction and lets you edit the camera movement easily later on when using the 360 camera. You can do things quickly what usually requires pro equipment.<br/>The result is really good!<br/><br/>The 4k burst lens has then (only) one lens reaching (less than) 180 degree - but a really high pixel density of 48 mpels to get high res shots.<br/><br/>Again - the built in software has lots of programs / settings to utilize the power of the camera.<br/><br/>So how does it work? You pick the lens you want - so 4k burst or 360 degree lens, take the camera base (computer) plug them together, take the battery and plug it on, then you take the bracket frame and click it around. Done. You might want to also add a selfi stick. Now you are ready to use it even within salt water to do some snorkling!<br/><br/>The phone can be used to control the camera - or the built in screen (even though the many swipse need to get used to - but a built in first use help is getting you on the way.<br/><br/>So this sounds all great! Are there also downsides?<br/><br/>Well - yeah.<br/>- You need to decide before you do your shoot what you want to use - 360 or 4k burst. Changing the configuration does not work in some environments. If you like one over the other it is easy! but then there might have been cheaper choices?<br/>- I was using the 48 mp mode in brightest daylight in Hawaii. I was quite surprised to find some noise in the pictures. I would have expected that to be nearly not noticable with that resolution. But - I suppose that many people do not go so much into details. So call me a pixel peeper.<br/>- If you are into quality you will notice the slightly blurry seam between the two 180 degree sides of the 360 camera after stitching. However this is of course expected if you have only 2 cameras. So this isn't really a surprise, In fact the surprise was that it was better than from other cameras I have seen before.<br/>- I tried to download a 3 minute video to my phone - and it worked for ... 20 minutes? without finishing. [Note: this might be because of the next point - so your experience might be better there than mine.]<br/>- Well - after exchanging the 360 lens with the 4K lens the wifi connection to my phone died. I pinged the customer support which was surprisingly online at a late hour - but the ping pong between messages was about 30 minutes - so after 40 minutes you got instructions on what to do next. In the end it turned out that the Wifi was apparently broken and I was asked to send the camera back. As I just got it a day before and I have barely used it (8 minute of recording) I did send it back for a refund.<br/><br/>So in short:<br/>+ I am really impressed by the camera and the included software - really excellent!<br/>+ Lots of use cases which allow you to create spectacular content of your hobbies!<br/>~ Do not expect the quality from a good camera only because it is 48mp. However it is decent.<br/>- (For me) the wifi died within 20 minutes of overall use.<br/><br/>Would I have kept the camera if the wifi would have not died? Heck yeah!</span>

<span> My experiences with action cameras have been with inexpensive off-name brand knock-offs, which, while they do get the job done, they’ve always fallen short on performance.<br/><br/>Pulling the trigger on buying this camera was at first a gamble for me, but the payoff was quickly realized literally right out of the box. The included video was the first footage I shot using the 360 lens, capturing the night sky, and using a template from the mobile app brought. More stunning footage has come from other uses of the app’s templates which instantly produce results, but also teach you tips &amp; tricks on using the camera. There’s so much more that this camera offers than any other action camera. It’s well worth its cost.<br/><br/>It’s not without a couple of nits however, it’s given heat warnings while shooting on a hot summer day, and not coming with a separate battery charger makes fiddling with a USB access cover a nagging chore. Both of these gripes are easily correctable.<br/>Beyond the beautiful imagery and awesome functionality, Insta360’s design path of modularity has made this camera a GoPro killer. You need two GoPros to equal this one, and don’t count on the camera to be yesterday’s news later on. You can count on more lenses, &amp; upgraded firmware to extend its live &amp; your investment. I’m glad I waited to buy big, with the arrival of this camera.</span>

The ONE X2 is Insta360's pocket-size spherical VR solution with dual- and single-lens modes. In dual-lens mode, also called 360 Cam Mode, the camera uses both its front and rear lenses to capture immersive 360 5.7K resolution video with automatic internal stitching, and then using the companion iOS/Android app, you can navigate through the shot and select a specific angle and share it directly to social media. Single-lens mode turns this 360 camera into a standard camera that you can capture regular shots with. This mode, also called Steady Cam mode, uses FlowState Stabilization with an advanced scene-detection algorithm to digitally smooth out your shot so it looks more steady. The ONE X2 is designed 33' waterproof as is, without any waterproof housing required, so you can take it underwater with you as well as use it in the rain. The camera also features a round touchscreen on the front for framing and monitoring your shots.Type-C * Note: This version only supports wired connection to Android devices (via Micro-USB or Type-C). It does not support wired connections to iOS devices.Compatible Devices:iOS mobile devices with chips A11 or above and iOS version 10.0 or above, including iPhone SE 2, iPhone 8, iPhone 8P, iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone X, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 12 mini, iPad Air(2020), iPad Pro and newer iPad models. Android mobile devices that meet the following capabilities, including: Android devices with Kirin 980 and above chips, including Huawei Mate 20, P30 or newer models.

<span>it took me awhile to figure out the interface on the little screen. Other than that camera is pretty good. I have already experience with Gopro Fusion, and I can tell that this one is much easier to work with. Not sure what's with the invisible stick.

<span>I really wanted to explore 360 videos &amp; photos.<br/>This camera is really the best choice currently - but it has some issues.<br/>Pros: small, easy to use.<br/>Cons: Expensive (they all are), mediocre image quality, hard to use small touch-screen for controls, the editing app on PCs is very limited, one would have to use the phone app instead.<br/><br/>What?? Use a 7" phone screen for video editing instead of a 30" computer monitor? For the most basic exporting of photo &amp; videos, that works OK. But for all of their other "fancy" effects, not possible on a PC.<br/><br/>And it has 5760 resolution, but that is spread out over the whole 360 sphere, so any individual viewpoint or image is fairly low quality; certainly way below HD. Even the exported videos look fine in a small (~YouTube) window, but if you enlarge to full-screen, they are very grainy.<br/><br/>And while some 360's are pretty neat for things, it certainly is not up to standard photo quality - (yet?)....<br/><br/>It won't replace any camera (or phone camera!); an interesting toy.</span>
