<span>I have an 10+year oldtv and had difficulty figuring out how to hook the head phones to it.  Contacted their customer service and the woman I who answered  had me provide the information on the back of my tv. She contacted samsung and then sent me a picture of the back of my tv with perfect, easy to follow directions. I have some hearing issues but the quality of the sound eiliminates those problems and I can wear them throughout my apartment as clearly as I can in front of the tv and they automatically connect instantly!</span>

<span>Perfect sound out of the box.  Overall sound is extremely full.<br/>I can walk all around my house and not have static or loss of signal.<br/>The top dial can optionally steer the onboard EQ more bass-heavy or treble-heavy.<br/>The mode button increases vocal clarity for TV shows or Music for an even more full sound if you want to disregard the musicians mastering (Music is obviously the listener's taste afterall)<br/>Very little latency - I performed a latency test and couldn't tell the difference vs wired headphones.<br/><br/>Only two cons for me are the earpads and price.  I had to replace the pads with velour, the original ones made me very hot within a few minutes.  As for the price... you get what you pay for I suppose.<br/><br/>Thank you Sennheiser!

<span>I needed to replace my Sennheiser RS 180s, which finally gave up the ghost after 6 years … so came to Amazon to find (of course) that they have been discontinued.  Well, that's okay, I figured ... after all, the sound and comfort of those 180s were great, but the volume controls were hopelessly difficult to operate by feel.  I assumed the redesign would solve this problem, and it has.  The new controls on the phones are easy to find and distinguish by feel .. a real improvement.  And the ear cushions on the 195 model are much easier to twist off for battery replacement (without breaking the hidden and very fragile/brittle plastic clip) than they were on the 180s.<br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>So far, the deal-breaker for me is that I find the overall sound to be a significant downgrade ... tinny, somehow compressed, not nearly as rich/full spectrum, somehow.  This model offers multiple listening “modes” … some seem designed to cut out certain frequencies and thereby suppress “background” noise (e.g., music, environmental sounds) with the intent of making dialogue clearer.  This works insofar as cutting out the extra sound prevents some inevitable masking of dialogue.  However, the quality of what remains sounds itself thin and reduced.<br/><br/>I tried all of the modes available and found that the “music” mode sounds the fullest … but even that mode does not produce sound quality that compares to that of my previous Sennheiser model.  If you have some trouble hearing and are looking for phones that will allow you to isolate and increase the volume of dialogue, these may help you.  If you don’t have a hearing problem and are looking for headphones that will provide rich, balanced sound, you may be disappointed in these.<br/><br/>In other aspects … to me, the replacement of my earlier model’s velour cushions with leather (or leatherette, not sure which) is surprisingly less comfortable, particularly in the head band.  Moreover, the phones are much bulkier, on and off the charging stand, than the 180s were, and they don't slip on and off the stand at all easily, as the 180s did ... this headset takes up much more room, and some serious finagling and wiggling is required to get the phones sufficiently seated on the stand to make charging contact for the batteries.<br/><br/>I'll play with these some more tomorrow, and update my review if my second impressions are more favorable than the first ... but so far, I don't like these nearly as much as my 180s, in spite of the control design improvement.  Unless I stumble upon some secret to better sound tomorrow, I'll be returning these.  The sound quality is just not worth the downgrade in comfort and charging convenience, and the improvements in control placement/design aren’t sufficient to make up for these minuses.  I've already gone to eBay to track down a "new" set of the discontinued 180s and purchased them, since I assume they'll only be harder to find from this point on.<br/><br/>On a final note, I hope Sennheiser hasn't given up permanently on its very comfortable velour ear cushions, which I've enjoyed in many of their professional monitoring headphones over the years.  I'm a long-time Sennheiser fan and customer, and my less-than-enthusiastic feelings about these headphones won't prevent me from trying more Sennheiser products in future.</span>

<span>I would like to start by saying that I have been an audiophile and videophile for over 10 years now (since I'm only 31).  I have a 15,000 system (not including the upgrade that is about to come for the HI-FI loudspeakers for the audio which will prolly run me about another 10k) comprised of about 4,000$ in AQ cables 3,500 display, oppo 203, three panamax 5300's.....these headphones at best buy are 500$ I bought them on amazon for 295$ along with the ASUS 5300 triband router also a 500$ item at best buy for 295$ on amazon; keep in mind that you must ask best buy to price match otherwise they will not even attempt to look and if the item is sold by amazon they must price match.  The headphones are the Sennheiser's top of line when it comes to tv headphones.  The dialog and noise dispersion are top notch you can hear things that you typically wouldn't hear on other models such as the RS 175's which I also have using a AQ cinnamon Toslink.  I have the RS 195 running thru a vodka AQ Toslink which may provide my set a better listening experience however it is doubtful that you would hear a notable difference with use of another cable. They work great for late nights or if you want to jack up the volume without disturbing the neighbors.  I will say that for me the RS 175's were not loud enough so I made the upgrade to the 195's and I paid about 200$ for the 175's at best buy.  I haven't heard the 185's but the 195's are definitely the best set you can purchase at this time.  There was a significant difference between the sound quality between the 175 and 195 and these are well worth the money.  Any magnolia system designer will tell you the same thing and say that this set is the best of the best and as they say if your going to do something or in this case buy something do it right the first time and don't make the same mistake that I did.  You don't want to compromise your sound.  I would highly recommend them to any audiophile that is looking for a tv headset of this nature.  Hope this helps for those who don't know as much as others about this kind of thing.  Also they are much better then the SONY's which will run you about 300$ for their top of the line model, although I'm sure they are a nice set any audiophile will tell you that Sennheiser's are the best!</span>

<span>The headphones were easy to set up. We absolutely love them. We got them so as to not disturb others in the house, but got some unexpected benefits. The speaking voices stand out so much clearer now and we can even hear the birds in the background! Every now and then one headphone doesn't want to connect. Just turn both off, connect #1, then connect #2. It's worked every time for us.</span>

<span>I got these when a noisy neighbor moved in above me. The noise cancellation was good, but would be better if I could adjust the fit smaller.  You can also only turn the volume down to a certain level before it simply mutes.  It crackles and squeals occasionally when I turn them on, but fixes by disconnecting and reconnecting the transmitter to the tv.<br/><br/>Overall a very good product considering most of the others are double the price or more.</span>

<span>I work remotely.  My earbuds have been irritating my ear skin after long hours of use.  My headset is big and flattens my hair.  These headphones are a great in-between compromise.<br/><br/>I am an audiophile.  If listening seriously to music and wanting the best audio quality, I won't use these.  Otherwise, the audio quality is good enough for any other purpose, including background music while I work.<br/><br/>One quirk, I've been swapping them out between my work laptop and personal desktop PC.  I've noticed that sometimes when switching what device they're connected to, the audio quality drops significantly.  Also sometimes if I move too far away from my computer while they are connected.  In these situations, I have to remove the bluetooth connection and reconnect to reset back to the normal audio quality.  It's similar to what happens with bluetooth headphones with microphones when you switch from listening to music to taking a phone call, there's a shift in the audio frequencies.  Except that these don't have a microphone so it's just kinda odd.  Keep them connected to one device and relatively close (~10 ft), and you probably won't experience this much.</span>

<span>If you are aware that these are bone conduction headphones and therefore they produce sound differently!!<br/><br/>That being said, they are also headphones and if purchased new, should be broken in properly. They are very good at what they do which is allow you to listen to music in stereo while being completely aware of your surroundings.<br/><br/>People that think these are just wireless earbuds should realize that they won't hear the bass notes but will feel them 'tickle' their ears.<br/><br/>I went with Shokz (formerly Aftershokz) as they have been in the business of making this type of headphone for a while. They feel great, are lightweight, and are comfortable for wearing while I am at work.<br/><br/>I currently work in a machine shop and have to keep one ear open if listening through earbuds or headphones. Using these for the first time today, I was able to listen to music in stereo for the first time since I started at this job. The quality of stereo sound is really quite good and they are a very good purchase for me.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that these are an investment and should be taken well care of. I will be using these for my biking rides as well as walking.<br/><br/>I value them very good for stereo sound and feel.</span>

<span>I am thrilled with this product! I give it a five star overall review, though I've given it lower stars on some of the subcategories like noise canceling for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>The nature of the aftershokz allows sound to pass to your ears. THIS IS A GOOD THING! So obviously noise canceling doesn't happen with these unless you choose to wear foam ear plugs in which case the headphones work and you can't hear anything else.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say the sound quality is the best with these, but FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY DAY I would rather wear these than a high fidelity set of headphones or earbuds because of how easy they are to handle and they don't get in my way.<br/><br/>I asked for these on a whim initially, and now I find that they are such an important part of my day that I feel naked without them.<br/><br/>I am a dentist and wear a mask daily and have even before it was common due to the pandemic. Many of the masks I wear behind my ears and I get pain due to that. Now I hook my mask to these headphones and my ears feel so much better! I also do surgery at the hospital every other week and have been noticing other health care workers like nurses and anesthesiologists wearing aftershokz as well.<br/><br/>The one area I feel disappointed with is that the battery unexpectedly failed after 9 months of use. However, with as much use as I got out of them in that time, I would consider it very well spent money! To be honest with you I don't know whether it was battery related, or some other hardware failure. I don't believe that they were impacted or mistreated before failure, so I don't know why they failed. However, this time I am going to PURCHASE TWO to have one and reserve just in case the first one fails.<br/><br/>I am considering buying the aftershokz that come with the swing down microphone for my staff that use the phone regularly and still need to have conversation with those around them.</span>

<span>if your looking at this you already know the sound quality isn't as good as regular headphones they don't have a ton of bass, sound quality is good enough to listen to music enjoyably, volume does not go super high but is loud enough to be considered loud, if your in a noisy environment it could possibly become an issue, but if your in a noisy environment music probably isn't your priority.<br/>these are extremely comfortable, although the way they wrap around your neck does get bumped a bit when sitting on chairs with backrests<br/>they allow you to be aware of your surroundings<br/>i haven't had them long enough to test battery life but it seems adequate<br/>sound quality is not amazing but they are adequate<br/>perfect for the gym, podcasts, anyone on the go.<br/>microphone is not as good as a regular phone due to the distance away from your mouth<br/><br/>for what it is, it's a great product. music at the gym, podcasts. i use them to listen to school recordings while working on an ambulance. i get in and out of vehicles often and am on the go.  i wouldn't purchase these if your primary use is music unless at the gym.</span>

<span>After six weeks, one of my two HT2880 head sets stopped charging. I sent an email to Avantree support and received a reply within five minutes.  At one o'clock in the morning!<br/><br/>Their email listed several possible problems with links to each, one of which was "Headphones can't charge".  That took me to a sort of Q&amp;A list of things to try.  They were organized in "Try This. If that doesn't work, try this" and so on.<br/><br/>The fourth item on the list were instructions on how to access the batteries and how to rotate them to make a better contact. In less than ten minutes of receiving their email, I had solved the problem.<br/><br/>The next morning a received an email from an actual tech support person offering further support. I replied that, using their guided trouble-shooting materials, I was able to fix the issue.<br/><br/>I am thoroughly impressed with the promptness and usefulness of the support I received. The product itself works wonderfully well and I give the whole experience five stars.</span>

<span>I use these to enable hearing of quieter dialogue found in some TV movies, or to cancel more background noise so that I can actually hear all the dialogue. I have some hearing loss, so the volume control on the earphones is more than adequate if you turn it up. Control is touchy, so be careful you don't set it too loud and hurt your ears. I wish they had larger ear pads, because I can only wear them for a short while without starting to feel considerable discomfort. But better than missing important parts of the movie dialogue, which is often critical to the plot. I bought these "open box" so the cost was less, but function is okay and they charge nicely on the stand. Again, remember... small ears only.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> PERFECT FOR WATCHING TV: Works with all TVs on the market, easily connect to your TV for shows, movies and gaming. Our headphones deliver high quality sound in perfect synchronization with on screen video. The headphone features 3 EQ presets to enhance your TV listening experience. Choose from 3 different equalizer presets to emphasize speech, music for a balanced sound or an extra burst of bass.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> ENHANCED VOLUME: Loud and clear volume for hard of hearing to watch TV at higher volumes. Our over the ear headphones allow you to turn up the volume without disturbing others. Ideal for those with hearing impairments or hearing aids to individually enhance TV volume. Also, great for situations while watching TV late at night without disturbing a sleeping partner, children or people in other rooms.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> AUDIO BYPASS: Why is this useful? Many TVs only have one optical output - if this is being used by an audio device (like a soundbar) it's often difficult to connect another device. The Opera however, can be connected to play audio from the soundbar and stream to your headphones simultaneously! This is a great way to enjoy TV together even if a family member has hearing issues as the headphones and soundbar volumes can be adjusted independently.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> EXTENDED PLAYTIME WITH EASY CHARGING: Simply place the headphones back onto the charging stand (that is also the transmitter) to recharge after use. Also features a USB Type-C quick charge port for an optional use with a Type-C cable. Unlike many 2.4GHz headphone sets on the market, the Opera is designed to last all day. Featuring an extended long lasting battery for up to 35 hours of play time!  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> COMFORTABLE &amp; LIGHTWEIGHT: The headphones are designed with an adjustable headband, swiveling earcups, incredibly soft protein leather earpads and are structurally lightweight while still being highly durable. Made with the adjustability to perfectly fit your head size for comfortable all-day use.  </span></li>

<span>I would buy these over and over. They paired with my flat screen 2021 TCL Roku like a dream. Also, customer service was so easy to work with when I had not turned the headphone on and couldn’t figure out why they weren’t working. Duhhh. At least they didn’t laugh at me. Ok, she laughed a little. Anyway, the headphones are super soft on my sensitive ears and I can watch tv for hours at a time in total comfort. The battery lasts a loooong time and the charging stand is Stylish. You won’t regret this purchase.</span>

<span>Sennhieser RS135 has a good sound for what I use them for. The problem I have is it like having two pieces of wood against head, not very comfortable. The price was so good I was going upgrade to padded earmuffs. But they do not have any upgraded earmuffs. It a great product just not comfortable.</span>

<span>Like you would expect these Sennheiser headphones produce a pleasing sound.  Easy to wear with good flat on the ear layout. A brilliant physical design, the batteries (AAA nickel metal, hydride are perfect for these long lived rechargeable cans)  Audiophiles won't like these, just based on price.  All 1% er's spend all you want ~ you can spend as much as you want on headphones ~ with diminishing returns.  I usually wear them for 4 hours listening to an eclectic mix on Spotify with comfort.  I love that these phones have 3 analog adjustments on the earpieces themselves.  Bass headed rappers will not like these, as these are not tone colored at all. Buy the RS-135-9 model.  The chrome bar that holds the phones on the base acts as the wireless antenna and supplies the batteries with a nice trickle charge while they are not in use.  Not blutooth, analog... remember?  One warning is that these headphones rest gently on your head, so if you're up and dancing you will dance the phones off your head.  So just don't...</span>
