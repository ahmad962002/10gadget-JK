                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have had my Powerbeats Pro for about a week now and after a bit of a rocky start and an adjustment period, I find them to be almost perfect headphones. When I first put them on, I was wildly disappointed. They were uncomfortable and sounded tinny with no bass at all. I genuinely believed I would be returning them and getting second gen Air Pods instead. But, given how excited I was for the Powerebeats Pro to come out and the cost, I decided to put in a little effort and give them a chance. It wasn't until about 3 or 4 days in that I decided to keep them.<br/><br/>So, if  you are like me and think your new Powerbeats Pro sound like garbage when you first put them on and you wonder if all the positive reviewers are high, experiment with all the tips before dismissing the headphones as crap. In-ear buds need a good seal to sound good. I have freakishly small ears so I always start with the smallest tip available when trying out new headphones which usually works for me. Not this time. It sounded awful and I was briefly outraged that I had paid $250 for garbage. It was counter-intuitive, but I finally tried the biggest tips instead which gave me a good seal and let me wear the headphones without having to go as deep into my ears which made them more comfortable too. Once I found the right fit with a good seal, I discovered that yes, in fact, these things do actually have some nice ear-thumping bass. I think the bass is better than original Air Pods but also not overwhelming as Beats products have a reputation for being. It's satisfyingly skull shaking without being distorted and is balanced out nicely by clear highs. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I won't listen to any old crap either. I like a little bass and good clarity and the Powerbeats Pro deliver.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with these is comfort. As I mentioned, I have freakishly small ears and while I have been using Air Pods for a couple years, I was doing so with discomfort. I put up with a little paind because of the convenience of function. I love the automatic connection, the ability to use one bud at a time and charging on the go in the case. So, when I first read about the Powerbeats Pro, I was expecting something that would have the convenience of Air Pods with better comfort and something that wouldn't fall out of my ears all the time. Generally, I do okay with headphones that have different sizes of silicone tips so I was expecting the Powerbeats Pro to be a comfort upgrade. Initially, they actually hurt my ears more than Air Pods, especially my right ear. I fully blame this on my freakishly small ears. I'm one of those people who often finds "one size fits all" to be laughably ridiculous. Again, I was determined to love these things so I tinkered a bit to find an acceptable level of discomfort. The largest tip allows me to get a good seal without having to put them in so deep, relieving some pressure and cutting down on pain. When I first tried them, I could only last about 20 minutes before the pain forced me to take them out. After adjusting to find a good angle and replacing the silicone tips with Comply Sport tips, I'm a lot more comfortable and can last 2 or 3 hours before I feel discomfort. Even then, I would call it discomfort and not outright pain. It's discomfort I can live with and not any worse than what I experience with Air Pods. Also, my discomfort is only in my right ear instead of both like I get with Air Pods. Since I go with one bud a lot of the time, I'll just use the left one. No biggie. I can't blame the manufacturer for my tiny ears which is why I'm not taking away a star.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the fit is very secure. I have worked out in them several times and they don't budge. I never could work out in Air Pods because they fell out all the time. I can also wear these while laying down which I couldn't do in Air Pods without them falling out periodically. Also, the connection is great. Original Air Pods used to randomly lose connection or not connect when they were supposed to. The chip upgrade in the Powerbeats Pro seems to have resolved this little annoyance. They connect faster and after a week, I haven't experienced a drop or glitch once.<br/><br/>The Powerbeats Pro do come with a tradeoff when it comes to the size of the case. If you are used to carrying around Air Pods in your pocket in their tiny case, forget about it with Powerbeats Pro. The case is significantly larger. It goes in a bag or purse without taking up a ton of room but it's too big to fit comfortably in a pocket. The extra battery life for Powerbeats is nice though. I frequently use one bud at a time and used to drain an Air Pod and have to switch ears regularly. I'm using the Powerbeats Pro the same way and haven't drained a bud yet. I'm okay with the bigger case since the better battery life makes me feel secure about leaving the case at home when I need to go bagless.<br/><br/>So in summary, these are the best sounding buds I have used. They are super convenient, easy to connect and won't fall out of your ears. If you have normal human sized ears, they will probably be comfortable and the battery life is great. You have to deal with a bigger case but the positive improvements over Air Pods make the size trade-off worth it. If you don't hear the bass, try different tips and twist them around a bit before you give up. Hopefully you won't have to work as hard at it as I did to find your happy place with Powerbeats Pro but the effort has been worth it. These are really great headphones and worth the price.</span>

<span>Thoroughly impressed with this product. For years I have avoided mainstream electronic brands like Beats, but now I am a believer. These things just work. They way that they're supposed to. 90% of the time, which is good enough for me. I have used wireless earbuds from other brands, like JBL, Sony, LG etc but none lasted very long or if they did, they did not work correctly most of the time. All had issues like connectivity, battery life, being plugged in but not charging for whatever reason.. issues of which do not exist with these buds. I was fed up and went back to wired earbuds for awhile.. until I "upgraded" to smartphone with no audio jack. I got these specifically because they have a loop that goes around the earlobe so it can never fall out. This was important to me since I am a cyclist and bike for long distances at times, so need something that will stay in my ears. The audio is good enough for most people. Not quite audiophile level, but im sure they do not expect that from Beats. Strong bass, crisp mids. Works very well for phone calls and people can usually hear what im saying, and I can hear them.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish I could change is the size of the case, its kind of big and bulky. if it was half the size that would be more ideal, especially for traveling, but honestly cant complain since the case actually charges the buds a number of times (not sure how many), and once they are full the battery can last all day long. Get them !! They are worth the money</span>

<span>I upgraded to these from my Airpod Pros. My left Airpod was cutting in and out, and sometimes turning off completely, so I donated them to my husband. I often had difficulty with the Airpods staying in my ears, no matter which set of adaptors I used. I'm happy to say I finally found a good pair in the Powerbeats that not only sound great, but fit perfectly in my ears. And, I've tried other earbuds prior including Bose and Samsung. I didn't have good luck with them staying put. But, these do! The ear wrap-around feature seals the deal.</span>

<span>I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.<br/>I'd give these a "4 1/2 stars out of five"<br/><br/>On the good side:<br/><br/>1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone.  I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want.  Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional.  But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/>2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.<br/><br/>3)  As for the fit:  these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out).  The fit is perfect.  (See my notes further down for the "comfort")<br/><br/>4) I've rarely had problems pairing.  I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone.  I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.<br/><br/>OK, the "not so good" side:<br/><br/>1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.<br/><br/>2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life).  You "can" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.<br/><br/>3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure.  Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.<br/><br/>Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears "breathe".<br/><br/>Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5.  The three things I mentioned are not "deal breakers" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours.  As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Also, there is no ANC.  Yes, there's "noise reduction" but not cancellation.  I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC.  However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.<br/><br/>So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them.  I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking).  I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.<br/><br/>I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if "the grass is greener" with another set.  I have to be honest, after buying these,  my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.<br/><br/>Most reviews I've read are positive on this product.  Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive.  I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.</span>

<span>I purchased these to use when running and riding my mountain bike.  I've had zero issues with them and I'm quite impressed with the battery life.  The sound quality seems excellent to me, an average person with no musical skills.  My ONLY complaint is the charging cable, which is kind of a big deal and caused it to lose a star.  It would be nice if it were the standard USB connection instead of this weird thing that it is.  I can only plug in to charge if I have my laptop with me.  This is a huge annoyance since I also have no technical skills and don't know the first thing about what kind of adapter I might need.</span>

<span>The cool thing about these Earbuds is the fact that the back of the earbuds are magnetized so they click together, then automatically disconnect the bluetooth and shutdown.  Then you can pull the earbuds apart, put them in your ears and they will reconnect to whatever you're listening to at the time. Nice feature. Sound is good, not amazing, but good.  The ear buds fit my ears, I can lie down on a pillow with them for 30 minutes or so with them on and not have any discomfort.  Past 30 minutes and I need to lie on my back. I have used them for about 6 hours without a charge, they recharge in about an hour.  They connect quickly.  There is no built in noise cancellation, but the ear buds do block most sounds, including in a aircraft.  This is one of several types of earbuds that I have and I like this sort of necklace format, because they are easy to use and keep track of unlike the separate earbuds with a case.  Happy Trails.</span>

<span>Oh my gosh--- first of all I have some hearing loss and it can be hard to clearly hear (as an example) in a zoom meeting or such.  I attend court via zoom fairly often and the sound quality is not great.  But, since I've gotten these I don't strain to hear or understand --- outside noise is not cancelled but it is also not intrusive--- it's hard to describe but you are aware of sounds outside of the headphones but it's subtle.<br/>But, maybe even more importantly (at least for me) is that they have different sized earbuds!!-- I have tiny ear openings and any of the earbuds that come with say your iPhone or on the airplane, don't fit me.  These have a small sized bud and I love the fit!!<br/>The sound quality is great.<br/>Last but not least, you can walk away from the computer for some distance and still hear and be heard!!  Several feet at least.  I absolutely love them!!!!!!</span>

<span>I have had these for about a year now and unlike my many other pairs of earbuds from other companies these have lasted and still work! Battery life is decent as well. After a year I charge them every other day or so and if I use them constantly all day I will have to do it daily.  They don’t have the quality of sound that my over the ear phones do with noise cancellation, but they are decent. I use them mostly for work meetings and listening to books/podcasts so the bass and music isn’t a priority. If it is for you these are OK. I am really glad I bought them since they’ve lasted this long.</span>

<span>As a big audio fan.. the buds are good, they seem to catch all sounds from the music with out canceling out any frequency of sounds. As for the bass, it has a good bass nothing that's going to be like wow but it has good bass. Down side the fit is a bit bulky and you really need to get them in ur ear for the bass to react right.

<span>Beat buds I've tried for bass. Overall sound is great. Have had some connectivity issues but it could be the apps I use and not the buds. Usually resolves with putting the buds back in the case and taking them out again.<br/>Not sure if they're labeled as water proof but I dropped the right bud in the toilet, used a plastic bag as a glove and took it out, washed it off and put it rice overnight and it never stopped working. Not even sure if the rice was necessary.</span>

<span>This is the first set of earbuds that actually stay in my ear with my piercings. I have a big conch piercing as well as both tragus and I have tried to shake the buds out. They're not budging and I don't have to constantly readjust them. This alone is enough for me to give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>I am super impressed with the sound quality. Listening to O Fortuna was an epic experience. Noise cancellation provides for a great isolating experience and transparency is a welcomed option as well. Listening while being aware of your surroundings is always important and these do the job as long as you don't raise music level above maybe 75%.  I haven't had it long enough to know how good the battery life is so I can't really speculate on that just yet but the ease of pairing actually shocked me.<br/><br/>I will say I'm not that fond of the casing. It feels a tad flimsy and it doesn't handle well. It is that type of material that could easily slip from your hand so I highly suggest a silicone case cover. Also, fitting the buds into the case is almost like playing Tetris to me. Figuring out the orientation it should go in as well as trying to get a good grip on it to remove it from the case can be somehow daunting.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. It was on sale for $89 so this was a steal for such a great product.</span>

<span>I use my ear buds mainly at the gym to get lost in my workout. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but love my music. In my opinion the sound quality is excellent with deep bass and clarity. I have been buying cheaper ear buds ($35 range) for years not wanting to spend the money that higher quality ear buds demand but I have to buy a couple pair each year with nothing but issues. These were on sale for $90 so it was a no brainer. I can't compare these to air pods or any expensive ear buds but the difference from the cheaper ones is unmistakable. Should have done it years ago.</span>

<span>I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:<br/><br/>Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.<br/>Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.<br/><br/>Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.<br/>Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.<br/>Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.<br/>Cons – Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.<br/><br/>Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.<br/>Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.<br/><br/>My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.</span>

<span>The sound quality of these ear buds is excellent, as with other Beats products the bass response is superb, which is lacking in the AirPods, IMO. Understandably, it's difficult to pack a lot of bass amplification into a tiny set of wireless ear buds, but Beats managed to do so. They also work with my iPhone 12 Pro Max as seamlessly as the AirPods.<br/><br/>The fit is nice and they stay in my ears better than AirPods; however, I do NOT like the physical buttons being directly on the outside of the buds, opposite your ear canals. I often have to adjust my ear buds and push them back in my eyes to optimize sound because they tend to move around, and this pauses the sound every time - SUPER annoying and dated design flaw. Also, the noise cancellation is pretty lame - not nearly as good as the AirPod Pros. I can hardly tell the difference with it on/off. Lastly, I'm not a fan of the lack of magnetic charging - it is USB-C only. As much as I would love for everything to switch to USB-C, Apple seemingly refuses to let go of their Lightning port, so I still have mostly Lightning cables and thus it would be nice to have magnetic charging instead of just USB-C.<br/><br/>All in all, this a great product at a good price, but if noise cancellation is important to you, you might want to spend the extra $ on the AirPod Pros.</span>

<span>I've bought a few different variations of these Panasonic earbuds (both ergonomic fit and not). I've been happy with all of them. The sound quality is excellent for what these are and they fit well. Each time I've had to buy another set has been due to self-inflicted reasons (the first pair broke, I forget how but not due to construction quality, due to mishandling on my part; the second pair I left out on the couch and our dog decided to chew on them, breaking one of the buds beyond repair). If you're looking for a good set of basic earbuds, these are the way to go.</span>

<span>Before you read this review I can save you a lot of time.  Buy these.  However if you want more info than that you can read on, but keep in mind this is not an in depth review on how these buds are technically.  I could get into frequency range before and after break in with pink noise and all kinds of other crazy crap, but I'm not going to bore you with that.  You might be able to find that type of review in one of the other 1900 five star reviews.  I'm just going to give you, what I hear, aside from the voices.  But seriously, you can save yourself a lot of time by just buying them.  C'MON THEY'RE ONLY $6.  Okay, waste your time if you want.  Read on if you must.  But you'll probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>I normally don't write reviews because English is not my first language... bad English is, but on these I just had too.  Let me start out by saying before these I had an awesome pair of Bose In Ear Headphones, the old ones.  They cost about $100.  I did not pay for them.  Someone else who is dumb did, and then further proved their lack of intelligence by giving them to me.  Actually, they were a, very generous, Christmas gift I got a few years back from the company I work for.  Those ear buds were awesome, but like everything else I love, they died.  I did manage to get several years of good use out of them, and I treated them like a red headed step child.  The fact they lasted as long as they did only goes to show that Bose makes quality stuff.  Well, now that I think about it, for $100 maybe they should have been impervious to damage by human means, or possibly even mythical means.  I'm going to say it, they should have been Centaur proof.<br/><br/>So after what I refer to as the "Great Loss of 2010."  I then went on a search for a decent pair of replacement buds, in the $20 range; because as is proof by how I treated the Bose ear buds, I shouldn't be allowed to have nice things. I tried many different types of replacement buds from different manufacturers.  I'm not going to list them all because I don't have that kind of time.  I will say through all my testing that 50% were just okay, and the other 50%... well I would rather have listened to the final death rattle of a puppy.  A really cute and sweet looking puppy.  You know, the ones you see on the TV that make you feel guilty for not donating to the ASPCA.<br/><br/>Well, after losing yet another pair of the okay ones, how I had those Bose for so long I have no idea, I needed a replacement and decided to try a different brand.  I went again to the internet and performed the search, "good cheap headphones for someone who should not have good things."  I hit enter, the search results came up, and clicked on a link that appeared to be a tech review site and let me tell you... they are really good at disguising porn sites to look like normal sites in search results these days.  So after seeing something that I will never be able to unsee, I came across the Panasonic RPHJE120S and figured for $6 on Amazon I'll give them a shot.  I've wasted $6 on far worse.<br/><br/>They arrived the day before I ordered them, as Amazon has awesome shipping, especially if you are a Prime Member.  I grabbed my Zune, no I don't have an IPOD because I believe Apple, and the late Bea Arthur, are trying to kill me.  I put in the buds and selected a track to play, expecting either okay sound or sound so bad that I would black out and wake up naked in a quarry with a dead rodent in my mouth.  The latter has only ever happened to me twice in my life... three times tops... four at the most... possibly every Friday.  Once my selected track started playing I was just amazed, to find my neighbor on his roof trying to fix his satellite dish in a t-shirt, pair of boxers, rubber rain boots, and a tool belt, with no tools in it, unless you count him.  The sound out of the ear buds was awesome too!  Clear highs, nice bass, just great frigging sound.  It sounded like the puppy was right in the room with me.  Then I turned on some music and was further impressed.  Initially the highs in certain songs seemed a bit, too high, but over time the buds broke in to be just pure awesome.  A $6 dollar pair of headphones that competed with those $100 Bose buds I had.  Don't get me wrong, Bose is Bose, but to even approach sound quality on par with those Bose buds in a $6 pair of Panasonic's is damned amazing.  But be warned, these buds ARE NOT Centaur proof.  I checked.  They are fairy resistant though.<br/><br/>I have also found them pretty comfortable, and they stay in my ears pretty well.  I have fallen asleep with these things in.  I did an experiment in which I tried to give myself night terrors using audio.  It worked, I have never felt the same since.  I may have also released something that can only be described as pure evil into the world.  But like I said they were real comfortable and stayed in my ears even when I woke up screaming and thrashing about.<br/><br/>Maybe if you are insane, or a complete audiophile, or both, because they usually go hand in hand, you can pick apart these headphones.  I have friends who are audiophiles/insane/schizophrenic and they can find issues with even the best audio gear.  If you are looking for a good set of buds to use in everyday use that have great sound you really can't beat these.  My first pair of these I had for about year, and then I lost them.  I actually think I know where I left them but promised I would never go back... DAMN YOU NEBRASKA!  I just bought 2 more pairs and just got done making sure the they worked and thought to myself; "I have to review these, they deserve it.  Also, I need to teach Amazon a lesson for giving me an outlet to share my opinions."  I believe this is the first product I have ever reviewed on Amazon and if you have read this far you can probably see why.  I'm an idiot.<br/><br/>If you need ear buds... get these.  If you don't need ear buds get them. Hell, if you don't like them you are only out $6.  With almost two-thousand 5 star reviews, including this one, it's a pretty good sign that these are in fact good buds.  If you don't buy these it's a pretty good sign that you are in fact an idiot.  I would know, we can spot our own.<br/><br/>Yes, I have read the bad reviews, that's what I do.  I research a product to death and then look only at the bad reviews to see if the complaints really seem valid or sane. This may sometimes scare me away from perfectly good products like the Nokia N-Gage, HD-DVD, and reusable toilet paper.  But sometimes, especially with bigger purchases, I really want to feel sure after ordering the product, that I have made a huge disastrous mistake.  However, that being said, I have no idea what happened to some of the people that left bad reviews for these.  Maybe they got defective buds, or they are really picky audiophiles, but having heard them myself I can't agree with those reviews.  I also don't agree with the law of gravity or that 9/10 of the law involves possession.<br/><br/>I have also beat the hell out of my first pair of these buds.  I used them for everything, airplane, car rides, while I was cleaning around the house, and in the gym.  Occasionally I have used these as a leash for my dog, and in two instances these saved my life from demons, that live in my head.  Apparently head demons hate death metal, but absolutely love smooth jazz.  Strange, I know.  Seriously though, in the gym these things got ripped out of my ears a whole lot of times and they still kept working.  Like I said, in the end I lost the first pair, but they still worked great when I lost them.<br/><br/>I'll finish on a serious note and stop joking around for just a bit by saying this, at the end of the day everyone's hearing and preferences are different.  You can hate something that I love and vice versa.  That's just how it is.  So in the end there is no guarantee, but if you do the math and you even count the 3 star reviews as bad, only 19% of everyone that bought these did not like them.  The other 81% like me... nothing but love baby.  These things sound great, fit in my ear comfortably, they stay in my ear pretty good, even when I am at the gym, and seem pretty durable.<br/><br/>See, I told you could have saved a whole lot time if you would have just bought them, but you needed to keep reading.</span>

<span>Of course what sounds good is very subjective, so just because I am very pleased with these does not mean you will be....<br/><br/>In the past I have been pleasently surprised by the sound quality of Panasonic headphones.  I was therefore hoping these would be much better than the price would suggest.<br/><br/>These earbuds did not let me down.  They sound great.  The highs and mids are clear and the bass sounds natural; that is, the bass is not weak or overpowering, and is not muddy or thumpy.<br/><br/>Better still, they fit in my ears!! They are comfortable, secure (don't feel like they are going to slip out), and do a very good job of blocking (not cancelling) ambient sounds and noise.  This is a pleasent added surprise for me as most earbuds I have tried did not fit securely nor comfortably.<br/><br/>I do not care for earbuds.  I much prefer closed ear headphones but there are times when I must use earbuds instead.  I would never spend a lot for earbuds but I want value for what I do pay.<br/><br/>These Panasonic earbuds deliver a lot of value for the price.  Even if I had paid more for them I would not be disappointed!</span>

<span>If you've been wondering how such a highly-rated product like this can also have one-star reviews stating these earbuds have "absolutely no bass whatsoever" and sound "horribly tinny", I'd like to offer an explanation.<br/><br/>These Panasonics are not designed to be placed in the ears and worn like classic earbuds.  If that's how you wear them, you'll get nothing but tinny sound at relatively low volume (think 1960's pocket transistor radio.) These earbuds are specifically designed to fit snugly into the ear, forming an airtight seal.  If you choose too small of an earpad and/or don't push them in far enough, you won't hear any low-end frequencies. It's only when you get an airtight seal that the earbuds will instantly come alive with full-range sound and volume.<br/><br/>Here's a quick analogy: Tightly plug both ears with your fingers, close your mouth, and hum the lowest note you can.  Now take your fingers away, and notice how almost all of the low end and volume drops out.  That's the difference between a proper fit and an improper fit with these earbuds.  Although the acoustic principles are different, these earbuds must literally plug your ears in order to give you the full frequency spectrum.  Otherwise they'll sound horrendous.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Panasonic wasn't very forthcoming on their product's packaging about how to wear the earbuds, and I'm certain some unwitting consumers are throwing away perfectly good pairs.<br/><br/>As an audio engineer, I can assure you these earbuds, when properly fitted, sound excellent for the price.  They're not audiophile-quality earbuds with the sonic transparency of a $200 pair of studio-reference headphones, and they're not as ergonomic as a $150 pair of Westones, but for the price, they are an exceptionally fantastic bargain.  Do they have a lot of bass?  They're not deficient in any of the low frequencies, but they're not bass-enhanced earbuds, either, which some of you may be used to.  They have a relatively nice, flat bass response as is, but if you want extra bottom end on your music, you'll want to boost the low end of your MP3 player's EQ.  Fortunately, boosted lows, even the deepest of lows, are handled very well by these Panasonics.<br/><br/>As a result of how these earbuds are designed to be worn, they could be uncomfortable for some people to wear for extended periods of time.  The earpads are very soft and pliable, though, and I personally don't experience any discomfort wearing them.  Since these earbuds are designed to be wedged into your ear, there are two unique, negative issues to point out:<br/><br/>1. Be very careful not to drop your MP3 player, because having earbuds ripped out of your ear canal is not a pleasant experience.<br/><br/>2. These earbuds may amplify the sound of your heartbeat when it's racing during an intense workout.  The incessant "tick tick tick" is loud enough that it becomes extremely annoying during quiet passages in the music you're listening to.<br/><br/>In summary, the audio quality of these earbuds, when properly fitted, will satisfy 99.9% of the general population.  I would not recommend them for bike riding or street running since they block out ambient noise, and if you're an audio engineer, you may find them a touch brittle on the high end, but if you need some quality earbuds to tune out the world for a while, these Panasonics are an excellent choice and a phenomenal value.</span>

<span>These headphones are comfortable to wear. They stay in place well. Great sound quality for an affordable price. My only complaint is the touch control surface is made from a material that coming into contact with produces a sound and feeling that makes my soul cringe. It’s a personal texture problem that in no way reduces the performance of the headphones. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone with an active lifestyle. The battery life and ease of charging is amazing and helps complete this five star review.</span>

<span>These are the best budget earbuds I've  ever had. The sound and bass quality of these are astounding just under $25.00. Though, I recommend that you use the volume control between 60% and 75% as some music soundtracks from YouTube and other applications are quite loud especially when you're not expecting what the soundtrack decibels are. The Sephia SP3060 is also my favorite model from the manufacturer.<br/><br/>First of, I got these back in September, 2021. With all the harsh things I've done to it like hitting them on the wall and dragging them, the first pair only lasted 6 months! Specifically, one of the earbuds stopped working. If one earbud is dead, therefore the pair is dead.<br/><br/>Near the end of March 2022, my second pair of Sephia SP3060 arrived, and had the same quality like my first one and was doing the same routine with them. Nothing change except that they are still working as of October 16, 2022 (nearly 7 months ago and is currently operating strongly)!<br/><br/>I suggest you reading this to give the SP3060 a chance in your collection. It's worth every penny.</span>

<span>These have adequate sound quality (I'm happy with it), I'm using them as in-ear monitors when I play guitar. I tend to drop them and step on them, so I look for the cheapies. The housings around the drivers are super heavy-duty for earbuds, very impressive. They distort quickly if I turn up our bass player, so gotta keep him down in the mix. I run the cord down my back under the guitar strap and plug into a larger monitor cord on the stage an usually put that connector in my back pocket. The cord on this earbud set is just barely long enough to accommodate this, so I'm ok with it, but sometimes it can feel a little tight. I would probably still get them again next time. LOL</span>

<span> After hearing the buzz and seeing the leaks on these over the last few months, I was anxiously awaiting their release.<br/><br/>Now, with them in hand (or ears, rather), I have some serious concerns.<br/><br/>I wanted these for the use of listening to music and equally, if not more importantly,  for hands free phone calls.<br/><br/>For the record: I have paired these with my Samsung S8 phones. I have alternated between two S8's and have found identical results<br/><br/>Being a 100% Android and anti-Apple consumer, I can honestly say that Apple got it right with the AirPods.  Not only for sound but for call transmitting and receiving audio quality.  The Galaxy Buds Live may not be up to the same level in the call quality department.<br/><br/>Call Quality:  From my first call, the audio I heard from the caller sounded quite good. Then the audio I was hearing began to sound a bit distorted and I kept experiencing a lot of digital noise. What I found is, if I put my phone in my pocket, or I'm holding my phone and I put my hand down by my side, it almost seems like I lose connection or there is interference. As if the signal is poor. But, if I'm holding the phone upright, or almost right near my face, the sound seems fine. Shouldn't be like this.  On the plus side, in comparison with my Bose headphones, multiple callers said these sounded equally as good on their end.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to rate the call quality as Very Bad at this point. After being sent a second pair, same exact issue.<br/>I am curious if this is some form of a software incompatibility issue with the Samsung Galaxy S8.  Because the call quality is so poor, and I intended on using these heavily for calls, these are now likely to be returned.<br/><br/>The Fit:  Very interesting but nice. They're light, comfortable and once you trust that they won't fall out, you really feel like they're not even there.<br/><br/>Music/Audio:  Sounds great. I'm not a $1000 headphone audiophile.  It needs to sound clear with your highs and mids defined and just good in general. Sound quality is very good. Here's the catch was that though. I started noticing the same signal issue that I was noticing with the call quality. While I was watching/listening to a YouTube video and I put the phone in my pocket or I walked away from the phone, mind you only a couple feet away, it seems like there's interference or the reception is bad. It cuts out constantly. Again, this shouldn't be happening.<br/><br/>Active Noise Canceling:  I'd have to say that my Bose QC35ii's are my benchmark for ANC. That bar is pretty high.  The Galaxy Buds Live disappointingly offer little in terms of ANC technology.  If you're looking for the same level if ANC that you get from a good pair of over the ear or in ear silicone tip ear buds, this will not measure up.<br/><br/>I experimented with this.  While sitting indoors, in a relatively quiet setting, you almost feel like you notice the ANC effectiveness.  Walking down the street with moderate car/traffic noise, I noticed absolutely no ANC effect. Merely an automatic battery drain at best.<br/><br/>Wearable App:  Good.  It would be nice to have a more dynamic equalizer option rather than the "canned" sound profiles.<br/><br/>Overheating:  I've yet to actually find information on this in the manual, but I believe that they have an overheating prevention feature where the individual earbud will begin beeping continuously in your ear. The audio playing, in my case a podcast, doesn't stop but a continuous beep begins. Not being able to figure out why, my best guess is that this is an overheating warning. I had been sitting outside and my left side was facing the sun. It was not excessively hot out and the actual left earbud did not feel warm or get warm in my ear. However, it repeatedly kept beeping.<br/><br/>General Performance:<br/>- In the home office and around the house: Not bad. I enjoy the lightweight design. As long as my phone is in front of me and not in a pocket, audio and call reception and quality are good.<br/>- On the elliptical: Nice. Comfortable and stay in place. Slight movement as you build a bit of a sweat.<br/>- Outside for a walk: ANC is non-existent. I also notice wind noise if it's a little breezy. By breezy, I mean a very light and intermittent wind. Not a hurricane.<br/>- On a bicycle ride: Crazy wind noise. Very off-putting, unfortunately.<br/>- Online Microsoft Teams Meeting (Android App on S8): I was told that I sounded distant and the audio was thin. As soon as I disconnected and called the person directly, they said I sounded great.<br/><br/>Summary: Very disappointed at this point. This is primarily due to the reception issues.  The price point is great for what I had expected. However, for what they are, I'd just as soon spend much, much less for a set of wireless headphones since making calls with these simply doesn't seem to be a good feature, out of the gate.<br/><br/>After running through all of the same with two separate sets of GBL's, using two different S8's, I've gotten identical results. I'm hoping that perhaps this may just be an S8 compatibility issue, as indicated earlier. I would enjoy editing this review to be nothing short of incredible, in the future.<br/><br/>Because they are so new, Samsung telephone support couldn't be all that helpful. With these being, literally, on the market for only a couple of days, there wasn't a whole lot of trouble shooting assistance available.<br/><br/>At this point, I've gone through two sets of these and have not seen a difference between the two. I'm torn whether or not I should return them. I so badly want them to work out. But, I'm finding that they're just not measuring up.</span>

<span>I don't usually write review on amazon,<br/>but I was just really not happy with what samsung is doing here.<br/><br/>First of all, let me introduce myself, I am a audiophile that has experienced and owned quite a lot audio equipment from extreme high end ones (the $50,000 hifiman Shangri la system), to flagship overear/in ear (beyerdynamic T1, xelento) that cost around  $800 today, to extreme cheap ones like the under $10 ve monk.<br/><br/>But I am NOT the type of audiophile that only nitpicking sound quality in his/her subjective way and care nothing about comfort, longevity, good features etc.<br/><br/>Far from that, I value a good fit and comfort over many other qualities. and for certain type of headphones, I value  features like convenience, noise cancelling over sound quality.<br/><br/>But I have a MINIMUM BAR of sound quality of course.<br/><br/>HERE COMES THE REVIEW of the galaxy buds live:<br/>OVERALL:  2/5<br/>I give it overall 2 out of 5 because there are products (namely galaxy buds+) that's better then this in nearly every way and has lower price. And buds live has its own issues.<br/><br/>COMFORT and FIT:  3/5<br/>IN SHORT, need some work to adjust the fit, some parts irritates skin after long wearing.<br/><br/>If you absolutely can not wear in-ear earphones, then this is not bad and this is pretty much your only choice for  true wireless headphones along side the original air-pods.<br/>But the issue is, everywhere this little thing touches your ear is hard plastic except for the tinny little rubber tip that sits in the upper part of your outer ear. And that rubber part has a pretty small contact area, your ear will be irritated for usage over 30 min or so.<br/>And it's not the easiest earphones to adjust its position correctly and securely, you'll find yourself adjust it quite a lot before you can finally enjoy your music. And the fit affects the sound quality a lot, by a lot I mean if you don't push down the lower part to ensure the speaker is as close to your ear canal as possible, this thing would sound bass light, and if you push it down all the all, it's absolutely bass heavy. I can imagine different people hearing quite different sound from it because of there ear shape. There's a reason for high-end ear-buds all using in-ear design.<br/>ADD: the case is among the smallest, which is a plus. but it's not a standout quality in 2020<br/><br/>FEATURES: 1/5<br/>IN SHORT: noise isolation is worse then regular in-ear headphones without active noise cancelling feature. and touch controls are usable but nothing special.<br/><br/>The buds live should NOT be advertised as a noise cancelling headphones, this is one of the two reason I'm writing this review. In fact, the noise cancelling level is substantially worse then the galaxy ear buds+ which has no noise cancelling feature.  pretty much ANY in-ear headphones will isolate better then buds live.<br/>The touch control and all other small feature set are nothing special, usable and usual is the word I would give.<br/><br/>THE ESSENTIALS for true wireless headphones 3/5<br/>IN SHORT: good battery life, unstable connection, short connection range.<br/><br/>the good thing is the battery life is good, not the best, but good for most. around 6 - 8 hours without noise cancelling on.<br/>The connection however, is not good. a lot of the time it has syncing issues when connected to my windows computer, usually put them back in case would solve the problem, this problem is quite frequent that it would annoy you quite a bit. And non of my other true wireless headphones have this issue, at least not to the extent that it annoys me. Connect to my galaxy s10 have much less issue though, only have sync issue when switching from device to device occasionally. The connection range is not good too, the signal cuts off completely when I walk from my desk to the bathroom, and for the reference, at the same spot at my bathroom, my airpods pro works normally without any signal loss, my galaxy buds+ would buzz in and out a bit.<br/><br/>THE SOUND:<br/>IN SHORT: acceptable,  3/5<br/>The sound I would describe as V shaped, somewhat muddy in low to mid frequency. average resolution, a better then average sound stage and imaging. I feel the driver in this has potential, but it's restricted by the ear bud design choice, since this thing has no seal, they have to adding quite a lot of bass by eq/dsp to compensate for it. And I think they overdone it, and ironically, the bass is certainly plenty in terms of quantity, but it doesn't have the smooth, fast and deep extension quality that comes out of galaxy buds+ from samsung themself.<br/>The mids are overshadowed by the lows. simple as that.<br/>The highs are average, nothing exciting about it.<br/>The sound stage are good for in-ear, imaging are above average too, but the lack of detail (which is understandable for a bluetooth heaphone without aptX or LDAC support) means you can't really pinpoint, and the muddy bass is not helping.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>this is a complete downgrade from the galaxy buds+ I have. It's harder to wear, less comfortable except for people who cannot withstand in-ear design. It has shorter battery per charge, from around 12 hours from buds+ to around 7 hours from buds live. It has worse noise isolation, which is unacceptable since it's in the advertise. The sound quality is average, not nearly as good as galaxy buds+ in terms of bass and mids, somewhat at the same level in highs and soundstage. And buds live has a higher price tag. And these two product come from the same company, which annoys me quite a bit. What's the thinking behind it, samsung and your AKG department? advertising? something new? "the new open ear noise cancelling?" it's just wrong in my opinion.<br/><br/>My recommendation for true wireless headphones as in time of writing this review:<br/><br/>The utility beast:  airpods pro<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Probably the most stable and furthest connection from named brand, for ios, or for android and windows.<br/>Very good audio/video latency, which makes it very usable for mobile/casual gaming, or even just watching video.<br/>2. A solid noise cancelling and transparent, natural sounding is the word I would call the feeling of both noise cancelling and transparent mode. The mic quality is also among the best if not the best in true wireless.<br/>3. A comfortable fit. less pressurized feeling then most in-ear headphones. a bit chunky, so not the most comfortable for your long session listening, but if you don't jam it too hard into your ear, you can listen to airpods pro for quite a long time, over 2 hours I would say.<br/>4. A relaxing and enjoyable sound. it's doesn't have much detail/resolution, lack some high notes in particular, average sound-stage, not very pin-point in imaging, too. But I gotta say, it sounds good enough, even for audiophile like me. Part of the reason is the noise cancelling helps to make sure you can hear as much performance as it can offer. The other part is that the tuning is just easy to listen to, a good bass extension without too much mid-bass, a bit mid-forward makes the vocal stand out, which is good for a lot of the mainstream pop music, a reduced high makes it easy to enjoy your music for a long period of time during travel. And the sound is also very consistent,  a deeper or shallower insertion doesn't affect it much.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>less then 5 hour of usage per charge might not enough for some.<br/>and really, besides not "great" sounding for those who can not withstand anything less then true audiophile quality, that's the only shortcoming I can think of.<br/><br/>A taste into audiophile world: galaxy buds / buds+<br/>Yes I have own both buds/buds+<br/>Pro:<br/>1. good fit and comfort, low-profile looking. You may feel a little pressure when you first put them like most in-ears. But they are by far the most comfortable true wireless earphones for long listening sessions.<br/><br/>2. Great sounding. I challenge you to find in-ear headphones that sounds significantly better then these, wired or wireless. Especially for the original galaxy buds, As they are under $100 today and honestly, besides bass not as deep as buds+, I prefer the sound of the original galaxy buds since the mids are not as recessed and highs are more smooth comparing to buds+. sound stage and imaging are both very good in buds/buds+;<br/><br/>3. Great battery life per charge and good mic quality. over 12 hours of battery life per charge and a good enough mic quality is the reason you buy buds+ over buds<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>connection and range are not the best (but totally usable).<br/>battery in case only provides one more charge for both buds/buds+. so if you forget to put your buds/buds+ in the case once over night, you might lose half of your total battery life.<br/>For people need active noise-cancelling for travel, these don't offer the feature, (but it still block quite some noise for everyday use).<br/><br/>For those considering sony and sennheisers's true wirelless, Consider the large size of them, they might not fit you, and the cases are quite large too. So I just don't bother trying them.</span>

<span>If you are too lazy to read my essay then I will give a quick rundown:<br/><br/>REAL Product - They are real apple earbuds, durable and people are lying<br/>Fit / Comfort - They will fit small ears amazingly and feel like nothing is there, big ears not so much<br/>Sound - Low end and mid is great. Nothing special, high end slightly lacking but its barely noticable<br/>Durability - Lasted me for 1.5 years so far, tough and will survive water (swimming, washing machine)<br/>Damage - None. They were perfect and still are right out the box<br/>Mic - Dont get for a mic. Its in the speakers themselves and are too quiet, but they are in 2 channels ig<br/>Tangling - They do get tangled but they are easy to untangle<br/>Overall - 9.5/10, get if you have small or average ears, they feel like nothing is in your ear<br/><br/>FULL DETAILED REVIEW:<br/>Im writing this to discourage the negative reviews that I see way too much about these things. They are REAL apple made products. They did not come used, broken, or anything. I bought these as I wanted some actual good earbuds that would last. I have used the samsung ones for about 2 years when I broke them, so I tried apple. I found some laying around in school (ik its gross) washed em, and they worked great. Sound quality is actually very good for earbuds, however I havent used any super expensive headphones that would blow me away and make these sound terrible in comparison. The low end or "bass" is very important to me and thankfully it is pretty loud, nothing outstanding or anything though. The High end is kindof lacking but not much, still sounds great. Mid sound is loudest, not overwhelming though, pretty good. Anyway, I lost those, so I ordered them, on Amazon. They came early, unused, undamaged, and they sound great. No complaints and they have lasted me for nearly a year. Now an issue you might have with these buds if at all are 2 things: Fit and Comfort. These will not fit everybody's ears, escpecially big ones. However, they fit in mine perfectly and within a minute I forget I even have anything in my ear, but thats just me. 2 is comfort, which some people have issues with. I think these are incredibly comfortable with the non-silicon tips. They dont hurt, but maybe thats just me. I hate the silicon tips, but some people dont. Either way, you can get used to them. Other things to mention; you can drown these in water or leave them in the wash accidentally and they will work fine. As long as their not in deep water for like over an hour, they should still work. also, Tangling is not a big problem with these. They definetly do get tangled, but they are very easy to ungtangle unlike other buds. Lastly, Microphone. I would not recomment these if you need them to have a good mic. I was surprised to test these and find out the Volume controller that has a mic label on it isnt actually a mic, the phones themselves are. And they are weird. They are wayyyyy too quiet and each but has its own channel, so you can talk into say the left bud and whoever is recieving your mic signal will hear only out the left headphone. You also have to have it so close to your mouth that you are pretty much making out with it. Besides that, they are amazing. Some people with love them, others will hate. If you have small ears, I recomment these. They come in a nice little box too. They will feel like nothing is there. 9.5/10 earbuds in my opinion. Best earbuds I have ever used. GET THEM</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Why do my earbuds not fit in my ear?</h3></h3>
    

The earbuds may be too large for the ear canal, the ear tips may not be seated correctly in the ear canal, or there may be wax build-up.
<h3><h3>Are there any earbuds that don't go in your ear?</h3></h3>
    

Yes! There are earbuds that attach to your temple instead of going in your ear. They are called "Bone Conduction Earbuds."
<h3><h3>What earbuds stay in your ears the best?</h3></h3>
    

The best earbuds for staying in your ears are the ones that fit your ears the best. If the earbuds are too big, they will fall out of your ears, and if they are too small, they will be uncomfortable. You should also make sure that the earbuds seal in your ears so that the sound stays in and the noise from outside is blocked out.
<h3><h3>How do you keep earbuds from falling out?</h3></h3>
    

There are a few ways to keep earbuds from falling out. One way is to use the right size earbuds for your ears. Another way is to use the right size ear tips. You can also tighten the cord around your neck.
