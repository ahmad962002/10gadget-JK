<span>The 3 best things about this is its major selling points so imo its worth the $300.<br/><br/>1) a lot of projector style headlights....well suck. Look great but usually sacrifice nighttime visibility. Not with these. You can see crystal clear. You will need to adjust the beams, mine were way too high right off the bat, but that's simple to do. These come with halogen bulbs though. I HIGHLY recommend getting a set of LED bulbs for this. If and when I get a chance I'll take a picture at night with them on. They look better at night than they do in the daytime I think. Super modern, crisp and clean.<br/><br/>2) Those sequential turn signals, are awesome. The first time I saw them in action I couldn't help but grin ear to ear. It's a very nice touch. I've had these for about a week and I still get out just to see them in action.  This is a 2004 F150 so it's pretty neat to see it on such an old vehicle. Small issue, they did not work straight out of the box. However I did NOT need to do any additional wiring. I got the sequential turn signals to work by a fluke. The hazards worked sequentially,  but the turn signals did not. Weird right? I decided to buy a matching set of tail lights that happened to have the cannbus pre-wired in as well and for some reason(I'm not electrical wizard) my turn signals started working properly. Before they only went half way across causing my dash indicators to flash like crazy like when a bulb goes out. There is an extra pair of wires that aren't going to directly plug into anything. So I would assume you would need to wire that in to the other pair of wires just like it in order to get it to work properly, idk. I'll let you figure that out unless you already know.<br/><br/>3) as you see, those DRL look awesome as well in the daytime. Day or night these lights just look incredible. It just flows with the body lines of that F150 like this was how it was supposed to come out of the factory if this truck was made today.<br/><br/>Now a word of advice. I recommend sealing up the holes in the back where the wires come out of the headlights.  There's open holes in the back and that just seems like a bad idea especially in the rain. I sealed all of them up the best I could and I drove around 200+miles in the rain today and had no issues with them. Would I have had I not sealed them? Idk. It wasn't a chance I was willing to take. Driving with non functioning lights in the rain is dangerous so I did what I felt was necessary.  Some are sealed with rubber covers, others have just some flimsy stickers over them. Nothing a bit of good super 33+ electrical tape that has a high heat rating seemed to solve.<br/><br/>Other than a couple minor drawbacks that are easily remedied,  I am very pleased overall and have gotten a ton of compliments in the short amount of time I've owned them. Another nice thing is, I've yet to see another F150 with these on them.  I've seen a ton of F150 with aftermarket lights but these being newer, and pricier, it's going to set your truck apart from the rest.<br/><br/>*update* so I see someone said LED bulbs don't work. Or fit. As you can see, that's not true. They do fit and are very bright. Also I did have an issue with one of the DRL but I just disconnected everything and reconnected it. I ran into that issue when swapping out the bulbs for LED. Not saying it couldn't be defective if it happens to you, just don't immediately assume it doesn't work. Play with the wires for a minute and reconnect everything and see what happens. I haven't had any issues besides that and so far everything is still working as it should.<br/><br/>This is the LED bulbs I bought for these headlights and fit. Got lucky 1st try bc it is a tight space to work with getting these in. A lot of aftermarket LED bulbs are probably too big for this set up which is why I spent hours looking for the best smallest ones when I did this. Got them on Amazon and they're not expensive.<br/><br/>Brand: Youxmoto<br/><br/>2Pcs H1 Led Headlight Bulbs Upgraded CREE Chips Extremely Bright 12000 Lumens IP68 Waterproof All-in-One LED Headlight Conversion Kit 60W 6500K Cool White Fog Light</span>

<span>I replaced my factory headlights with these and what a difference it made! Not only in the looks but I can see again at night.<br/>They have a good color temp and cast well to the sides for seeing critters coming at you. I live in the middle of the woods, deer are an issue, Actually, I<br/>hit one without damage to my new headlight!!<br/>Wiring the light bar was a little tricky, but nothing too difficult, just follow the directions carefully.<br/>Make sure you have good, level area with at least 25' to get the correct adjustments on the heights, a good dark shop with a white wall would be perfect.<br/>No more automatic brush car washes for these new beauty's!</span>

A Headlight (headlamp) is a lamp attached to the front of a vehicle to light the road ahead. Headlight performance has steadily improved throughout the automobile age, spurred by the great disparity between daytime and night time traffic fatalities. Headlights are one of the most important components of your vehicle; they allow you to see the road in front of you clearly during the night and in any bad weather that may arise. Our headlights upgrade the face of your vehicle with clear style and extreme range.

<span>The one star was just for the good looks. Having same issues as all the other reviews about adjustment. Poor visibility, have to run by high beams to see anything. Wish I read reviews before purchasing</span>

<span>These are absolutely horrible headlights!! Yes, they look sleek and aggressive, but long term I don’t believe these will hold up. These are my second replacement lights and they have the same issue as the first. There is condensation and built up humidity within the headlight fixture. Not only is this a huge eye swore, but it well eventually short out the electrical over time. Now I have no idea what to do, I would love to just flat out return these headlights and put the stock oem light back in, but it’s friggen winter now and it’s a 2 hour process to take these lights out and replace and put the old ones back in. If you have a zr2 you have to drop the front bumper to remove them. The company itself is pretty useless, there customer service was god awful!! I tried to contact them to tell them the reoccurring issue but because I purchased these through amazon they said I have to contact them and that there was nothing that they could do.</span>

<span>These headlights replaced my stock headlights on a 2019 Chevy Colorado. I am not shy using tools. I am thirty six years old and have maintained every vehicle I have owned and am an electrician by trade, turned engineering technician. I installed these flawlessly. The lenses scratch very, very easily. Light scratches that 3M buffing compound MIGHT smooth out. As far as adjusting..... forget it. These utilize a plastic gear, turned with a P2 screwdriver. I  was lowering the projection beam to match a 34” mark on a wall, I ran out of adjustment before they got there. Currently, my beams are at around forty inches. That is unacceptable. I am stuck with a pair of 320 dollar headlights, in a brand new 29,000 dollar truck that are effectively broken. The projection beam leaves a lot to be desired. It is very scattered. I even bought Sylvannia Ultras to put in them hoping to even it out. There’s another hundred dollars to pour salt in a wound. The high beams point low, dead center of the truck, straight to the ground. To say I’m sick at this point is an understatement. Such an expensive mistake. I don’t generally leave reviews, but I had to this time. If I save one person the mistake of buying these headlights, writing this review was worth it. BUYER BEWARE! DO. NOT. PURCHASE. THESE. HEADLIGHTS.</span>

<span>I bought these even though others rated them poorly assuming they must not have installed them correctly. Nope.  They just won’t adjust low enough.  They were about 5” high in 15’.  And that was adjusted as low as they would go.  They adjust kinda on a pivot from the inside. Meaning they start like this \ / and when you crank them down they get closer to this — —. But they need to be like this ___ ___.  They just can’t adjust low enough.</span>
