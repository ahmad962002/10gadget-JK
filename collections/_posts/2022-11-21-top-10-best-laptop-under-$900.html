<span>For the money this is a great buy. Don't expect too much. I made the mistake of upgrading to Win11 and lost about 5GB of built-in hard disk space (so now I'm down to 25GB). That's not a prob for me since I never keep anything critical on my built-in HD anyway - nor should you :) BTW I always use an external keyboard + mouse (consider a USB hub that will cost you all of $10  I DO appreciate the 2 built-in USB ports.</span>

<span>As my first gaming laptop I couldn’t be happier. I bought this on sale for just under $600. 8gb ram, I added a 4gb stick I had in a damaged laptop and now have 12gb ram (which has worked just fine and I have noticed the increase in speed). 500gb SSD that I just upgraded with another 512gb SSD for $43. I have played halo infinite and it looks great. Looks as good as it did when using the Xbox series S. This laptop upgrades easily. I put the ram in and then the SSD in under 5 minutes. Seems solid, not flimsy. Haven’t noticed screen brightness issues. Have used for job interviews using Microsoft teams and the camera and speakers and mic work great. Overall very happy. You don’t need to spend thousands to get a good gaming rig and work/education rig.</span>

<span>For clarity, this review is for the 15.6" GTX 1650 version, not the 17.3" GTX 1650Ti version.<br/><br/>Positives!<br/><br/>This laptop is perfect for me and what I need right now. I am currently in between homes, over the road a lot for work and have all of my stuff in storage, including my main PC, so I bought a laptop so I could continue doing work and gaming while on the go.<br/>This laptop is not top of the line by any means, it's no $2,000 laptop with an RTX 3080 or anything like that, but if you want a good mid-range laptop that can get 60FPS on some everyday gaming, this is as good as mid-range laptops get in my opinion.<br/>Even on my main, much beefier PC, I've never been one to crank up the settings and enable raytracing, 4k etc. I'm more of a framerate type of person and this laptop does a great job getting high frame rates if you're willing to adjust the settings accordingly. The screen is a clean 1920x1080, lovely quality (though the brightness isn't that great), comes with an NVME 512GB hard drive which is not a bad start if you're not trying to install a Call of Duty game with 100gb patches, but that leads into another glowing positive - this thing is upgradeable and I love it! One of the hardest things about picking a laptop for me is the eventual obsolescence, so in the few times I've bought a laptop in my life, I prefer ones you can upgrade which will allow you to skirt by the expected lifespan for a bit longer.<br/>Overall, my complaints a few, but I will point them out.<br/><br/>Negatives!<br/>Honestly, 8GB of RAM is... well, it's not enough for any modern PC that you want to do more than browse the internet, but this negative hardly counts against it because once again, it is upgradeable! I added 32GB to mine and it runs like a dream now. The fact it ships with such low RAM is forgivable because that's probably why the price of entry is as low as it is.<br/>I also had a few problems with the Wi-Fi antenna at first, which I know is not unique to my laptop, but after a few online searches, troubleshooting and settings adjustments, it hasn't dropped the connection for a couple of days, so I think I'm over that hump.<br/>My last complaint and honestly maybe the only one that could be considered "major" is the screen brightness. To be clear, I'm talking about BRIGHTNESS, not QUALITY. The resolution is wonderful and the screen is a clear HD experience, but keep this thing away from the sunlight if you want to see it easily... I took it to the park one day and while I could see the screen, I felt like I was squinting, and I had to change my preferred dark mode to light mode just to see the Windows UI better. Once again, I consider this a minor gripe and won't take a star off, because if you're using this thing indoors or in appropriate shade, the screen is beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for an affordable, upgradeable, laptop suited for everyday gaming (as long as you're not trying to push max settings, 4k or raytracing), you won't be disappointed!</span>

<span>I got this product on sale for $599, and it is more than worth the price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Battery life is fairly decent. The only time the battery would burn itself was when I was using additional monitors and graphic intense activities at the same time. Even when the battery may be low, the charge speed is very powerful, and you should have full charge in an hour even if your using the laptop.<br/>-Processor is a beast. i5 10300H has the firepower to run some games that normally require high specs. Dark Souls III runs very smoothly on normal settings, haven't been able to test Elden Ring yet. (This may require more ram.) I'm also able to hook up a monitor, among other peripherals, as well as have other things open, like Discord, without a problem.<br/>-Screen. With 144hz (or 144 visible frames per sec.), you don't need additional monitors to see just how good your games are running.<br/>-RGB Keyboard. Can change how the lights appears, as well as their intensity, or turn them off if you don't need them.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-RAM. With only 8gbs of RAM, you may yourself upgrading to something more using the extra empty RAM slot. Luckily, this laptop is designed to be easily upgraded with a poppable bottom. All you need are screwdrivers that fit and a RAM cartridge of your choice.<br/>-Storage. Again, with only 512gb of space, you may find yourself upgrading using the empty extra M.2 SSD spot. One thing to keep in mind is that this laptop will only support up to Gen 3, so make sure to save some money and not but a Gen 4 SSD, as you will not get the full power out of it.<br/>-Graphics Card. The GTX 1650 isn't exactly the best graphics card out there, but it gets by for meeting recommended settings on older games, while meeting minimum requirements for newer more graphic intense games.</span>

<span>The keyboard is easy to see - in daylight. I specifically ordered one with a backlit keyboard thinking they all stay on, like my wife's. This one goes off after 30  seconds, leaving the keyboard dark. For me that is a problem. I'm 73, have very bad vision in one eye and floaters in the other. It breaks up my concentration when I'm writing. The light goes on with a slight touch, but it's distracting.<br/><br/>From what I can gather reading the net, this is a budget computer and Acer does this on lower priced machines because of a government energy saver mandate  - the more expensive machines get to guzzle energy.<br/><br/>There is nothing hinting at this in the advertising. There is nothing hinting in advertising for their other computers that the keyboard stays lit as far as I can tell. Why leave the consumer in the dark? (Yeah, I know.)<br/><br/>Some machines have a work around - you can alter the bios if you are technically able. (It is a chancy thing to do.) But not this one. There's a list - my wife looked it up.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's a good little computer, though my demands are pretty small.  I would return it but it seems like there may be a restocking fee. Amazon needs to make the language clearer.  I'd suggest to Amazon that they offer this alternative - if within 10 days you trade in for a high priced model they'll credit the entire purchase price of the lower priced one.</span>

<span>I don't know who designed to install the speakers underneath the laptop, but that was beyond stupid. The sound quality is horrible, especially if you don't have it sitting on an elevated surface. Other than that I'm happy with it, but if you plan to listen to a lot of music without a headset, look elsewhere.</span>

<span>This is a good computer and it was the best I could find for my purposes. The only thing I was unimpressed with knowing what I was buying was that it comes with Norton Antivirus. Every windows computer since windows 8 has come with windows defender. Once you uninstall Norton windows defender will kick in. From my experience windows defender is the best antiviral program for a windows computer. It also comes with firefox which I dislike but that's a personal preference. Since its a windows computer it also comes with Edge, another program I dislike. I've never been a fan of windows default browsers.<br/>My other complaints aren't about the computer itself. The screen is much larger than I was looking for and it doesn't detach. The only computers I could find with the detachable screens were chromebooks. Yuck. I'm disapointed in Acer that they don't have the smaller computer with a detachable screen but I'm more disappointed in Windows that not all 11 computers have the touchscreen but with a 15.6 inch screen being detachable and using it as a tablet would be highly uncomfortable. To make a long story short I still use my Acer Aspire with the detachable screen and windows 8 touchscreen to do a ton of tedious stuff I can't do on the new computer. Windows 8 touchscreen was the best program microsoft ever created because it has the capabilities of doing all the stuff I need it to do. Its versatile. Sigh...the computer is nice but I need both computers to do my job.</span>

<span>I'm far from a computer expert. I bought this computer for work because my job requires me to use a couple of different specific software programs. I needed a computer with a lot of storage, a fairly large screen, a numerical keypad, and most importantly, a cheap price tag. This computer has all of those things. I don't do any gaming or anything really sophisticated on it. Just work and some internet browsing. It boots up quickly and has been running smoothly so far. My biggest complaint is that it came with a lot of Microsoft bloatware that I hadn't experienced on my other laptops and by default it uses your Microsoft OneDrive for storage instead of the computer's SSD. The first time I logged onto the computer it asked me to either sign up for a Microsoft account or login to an existing one. My job requires me to take a lot of photos, so I was saving my photos to the computer without realizing it was uploading to my cloud storage account. That was an annoyance because I had to figure out how to switch that off. I unintentionally used up all of my cloud storage space because I didn't realize the system was set up that way. Once I figured out how to fix it, I was good to go. Also, the computer essentially comes in a "safe mode" which limits a lot of what you can do. It is designed for you to only use apps from the Microsoft app store and not download any software from any other source. It can be turned off, but it is another annoyance. I feel like they were trying to make it like their version of a Chromebook, but that makes it just as annoying as a Chromebook. Overall, it is a great computer once you get past all the Microsoft stuff.</span>

<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>I've had several technology fails this year, including my gaming laptop and my Linux laptop breaking down. My budget is not what it was when I bought the gaming laptop, and the other one was a hand-me-down from a relative. So, I needed a cheap laptop to do basic typing and web browsing on until I can afford something to game on. Finding a non-Chromebook under $300 is tough these days, so I took a chance on this model.<br/><br/>This laptop is good for very basic functionality. It's small, lightweight, and runs quickly enough (granted you buy a separate hard drive and don't overload its very small memory). I have the feeling that it would run better with an older OS: Windows 11 is not only awful on its own, it's terribly bloated for a small-memory machine like this one. I won't go into all the reasons why I hate W11 here, that would be a whole other review. I would recommend installing another OS on it if you have the know-how to do so. I may eventually install a Linux OS on it if performance ever decreases. So far, it's quick enough for me. Don't expect lightning-fast loading, though. Another tip: look up ways to unload extra programs to free up space and don't have any programs run on start/continuously in the background if you can help it (OneDrive really bogs the system down).<br/><br/>The screen quality is middling but it displays videos crisply enough. I wish it would dim a little more, since I often type in low-lighting. This leads me to my biggest complaint: NO KEYBOARD BACKLIGHT. I suspected it wouldn't have one since it wasn't mentioned in the product description, but since it's such an important feature, I'm mentioning it in all-caps here. I use a low-wattage lamp to type by and I can see the keys (the white keyboard helps with this), not to mention I can type without looking at the keyboard often, but be warned about this! I know a keyboard backlight is a must-have for anyone that may need to type in extremely low/no-lighting situations.<br/><br/>I'll also mention that this is not a touchscreen laptop. I never use touchscreen laptops, but I know some buyers may expect this feature. The touchpad mouse has no buttons and can be a bit wonky; I highly recommend buying a separate mouse.<br/><br/>I tried to run Steam and some games on this machine out of curiosity. Don't do that. Even pixel art games with low-demand graphics will skip, sometimes freeze, and put too much demand on the system. I haven't tried streaming video from this machine to my TV yet. This is not a media or gaming laptop, though. You can stream any service on its native screen (YouTube, etc) easily, play music streaming or old school mp3s (you'll need a separate drive for CDs/DVDs), but I wouldn't push it beyond that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's what I expected for the price. I wish it had an older version of Windows and a keyboard backlight, but neither is necessary for my needs. I use it for listening to music while typing and sometimes streaming YouTube, it works fine for those things. I've un-bloated the system as much as possible and done some tweaks to get it to run as fast as it can, but not every buyer may know how to do this and especially running OneDrive all the time can bog the system down considerably. It definitely needs a separate flash or hard drive to extend its memory. I will update this review in the future if any issues arise.</span>
