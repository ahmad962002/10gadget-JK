<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is a great little chromebook for the price.  My only issue were no touch screen and wasn't loading apps I need for school and work.  Would recommend though</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>This laptop is pretty good. Keypad has a weird layout, and the keyboard lacks proper Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown keys. Oddly enough, Shift+Home works if you do LShift+RShift+Home, while LShift+RShift+End does not work and is just treated as End.<br/><br/>Probably the most baffling spec about this laptop is its 4 GB of memory. I highly advise to spend an extra $15 on a SODIMM DDR4 chip (preferably 2667 MHz), because 4 GB is nothing nowadays, especially with the increased minimum requirements of Windows 11. Everything was loading pretty slow and programs like JetBrains Rider could barely function because they're constantly fighting for the physical space. Once I popped off the bottom cover and doubled the RAM, everything started going pretty fast afterward. Probably increased its impressive battery life even further.</span>

<span>Ive inly been really using this laptop for like a month and a half but Its a good laptop. For rreference though My last laptop I had was used when I recieved it and "on its last legs" and started having noticible issues once it turned 11 years old...I enjoy doing video editing and that over a decade old laptop was no longer covering it so I decided to inest in this laptop. With its core I7 processer of 16gb of ram its doing really well amd seems to not struggle at all for what I do and or need. Its a good computer cabale of doing lots of work and the battery life is superb. I ran a couple of stress tests on it and it preformed well. The one downside is that because its windows 11 alot of stuff that was free and or included on windows 10 or lower is not included , most of the software thats available on this laptop is consistent of free trials or trying to get you to make a yearly purchase to use the programs such as the microsoft suite ( which will run 99$ a year or the price of like 9.99 a month). And the free trials are short lived or require you to put in credit card info...so I would suggest anyone who gets this laptop to be ready to either pay for what use to be free or start doing research on free open source software that is comparable to whatever programs you may want to use that are no longer free on the windows platform. Windows 11 isnt really bad its just different. As for the hardware I suggest doing your research before buying this laptop, and make sure you get the correct processer type for what you do, core I3 or below will not cut it in most cases try core i5 or higher and get atleast 16gb of ram aka memory to be on the safe side for anything other then really light light computer use. Also since this is a thinner laptop it has no cd rom and can in some cases overheat a little as it needs some ventalation when in use if doing heavy duty work which is to be expected for its thinness, and my very slight complaint is that while doing heavy duty work it can get to humming a bit too loudly for my taste but nothing that is too terribly concerning. I reccomend this laptop and I love it thus far.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop just to have something "mobile" when I want to get online or do some "light work" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)<br/><br/>I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.<br/><br/>The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GB<br/><br/>It does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.<br/><br/>It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothly<br/><br/>It came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).<br/><br/>It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!<br/><br/>I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!</span>

<span>I’m an elementary school teacher who uses google drive for planning &amp; bought this chromebook to function as my planning tool, for email communication, internet surfing, and to transport back and forth from school/home. I’ve only had it a few days and it’s great!! I never write reviews and I was hesitant to buy because of some of the negative comments about the “tech specs” of this chromebook (idk what they mean anyway). Honestly, it’s great. I can make my slide shows, view videos, and work with all my TPT resources in my drive. Mine was carefully packaged and in perfect condition. It was so easy to plug in and start working! In my opinion- it looks great too! My boyfriend didn’t know I bought it and when he walked in the door and glanced he said “Wait did you get a new MacBook?” Before he saw the “HP” lol! It’s a great little chromebook if you’re looking to do similar day-to-day things for your classroom! I can’t speak to its Zoom capabilities though I haven’t tried it (and hopefully that’s all behind us now).</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>Overall, this is a great laptop for its intended purpose, but DO NOT ORDER 64GB!!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The OS takes around 20-30GB (I can't remember specifically how much), default programs (i.e. MS Office) easily eat up another 20GB, and after everything is accounted for you are left with10ish precious GBs remaining--and you'll learn very quickly that whatever you use this thing for will chew right through that space. The Windows updates alone will eat up your GBs, Windows' caching will passively eat up more GBs when you aren't looking, and in less than a year you will be wasting hours deactivating hidden folders, deleting everything you can find, Googling what you can/cannot delete, perpetually slow-loading from a USB stick, and budgeting the remaining GBs between 2-3 programs.<br/><br/>Soon, you won't be able to download Windows updates because you're literally juggling 200MB of HDD space and the system says you don't have enough room to download the next patch. At least you don't have to worry about it sneakily upgrading to Windows 11 one day, because there's literally no room left for it to do so.<br/><br/>And that was to save a trivial amount of money (&lt;$50) on a bigger HDD. I feel pretty stupid for being so stingy now, but at the same time I can't help but blame the manufacturer for not putting a disclaimer that the OS consumes HALF of the HDD, and Windows' default programs eat up *almost* the other half, and realistically you are left with 10GB of HDD space.<br/><br/>Perhaps the other INCREDIBLY annoying thing about Windows 10 is that it will eat up HALF of your RAM just by existing. I never really gave much thought into how much RAM the OS eats up until I found myself staring at Task Manager wondering why Windows 10 needs 4GB of RAM on a laptop that only has 8GB to spare. Absurd. If you can order one with more RAM, then do so, otherwise just know that you'll need to keep this thing running light.<br/><br/>Also, the awesome mousepad with the toggle number pad was super cool, until the poor thing stopped working after several months. It now requires a wireless mouse to function. Oh well. Still not nearly as aggravating as the HDD/RAM situation.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Aside from those issues, for $110 it was a fantastic deal, I would highly recommend it for developers and students who want a light, portable, and simplistic device for text editors and running basic programming projects on. It is preferred by techies who need to move and connect to company devices for troubleshooting, updates, etc., and I think it would be an excellent tool for that job. Obviously, this is not a gaming laptop, and I don't think anyone who buys it is under the impression they'll be running Unreal Engine 5 on it either, but it would totally work for freeware games and simple games that could work on dinosaur computers.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This laptop is a work and school laptop primarily, and it is a wonderful and nifty tool that excels at that role, just be prepared to deal with a broken touchpad potentially, and know that half of your RAM will be eaten up by the OS.<br/><br/>And please, for the love of your sanity, DO NOT ORDER 64GB HDD! Get the larger HDD, you'll severely regret cheaping out on less than a $50 price difference.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop after my old one died on me. In the beginning, this was a great replacement laptop and since I had so much of my files in cloud storage, it was very easy to restore and download them to this new laptop. I was back up and running fairly quickly. However, this past week (Week of September 6, 2022) I've had issues where after shutting down the laptop, it wouldn't come on after pressing the power button(power adapter was plugged in). Or the power light on the side of the laptop was blinking after putting it in sleep mode and then it won't "wake back up" after tapping the mouse or quick pressing the power button. I end up having to do a hard shut-down by holding the power button until it turns off. Then after a few seconds press it again to turn it back on and then it'll start up.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 6 months in, and I'm already looking for a new laptop. I might just go and get a Chromebook and then get a new desktop computer. HP laptops and I are clearly having a run of bad luck.</span>

<span>This my second 17" HP laptop.  I have been happy with it.  It is much faster loading and the display is better than my previous one.  My only complaint is there are only two USB connections.  If you are like me, you will need to purchase a USB hub to supplement.  Also, you will need a separate CD/DVD drive.  But with such a low price, I can't complain.</span>

<span>I don't understand all the negative reviews about the screen. It's not the BEST laptop screen I've ever used, but FAR from the worst. And for less than $250? Are you guys kidding me? Are you expecting an ipad pro level screen?<br/><br/>The laptop is solid even though it's plastic, I'm not worried about putting this thing in my backpack. While the keyboard is a little stiff for my taste, it works well. I'm just used to my mechanical keyboard on my desktop. I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:<br/><br/>Perfectly fine.<br/>Solid.<br/>Reliable.<br/>Lenovo-quality.<br/>I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.<br/><br/>The negatives?<br/><br/>The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade.</span>

<span>I got a Chromebook to replace my Macbook because I wanted a decent laptop without having to spend hundreds of dollars.  So far, this fits the bill pretty well, with a few minor differences from the Macbook.  It was really easy to set up and import my passwords, bookmarks, etc. which was really convenient.  Charges quickly and pretty much does what I need it to.  I miss not having AirPlay to mirror stuff to my Roku tv and have sound included.  I also miss having iTunes (now Apple Music), but I switched to Spotify.  There are a few little things that are different that I've had to get used to, but nothing too major. I prefer laptops to tablets or having to do everything on my phone, because I like having an actual keyboard and a decent sized screen, not a touchscreen (tablet) or a little tiny screen (phone)  All in all, it's a great little laptop for the price.</span>

<span>Update Below...First I should say that it's not the Chromebook's fault.  It works fine as it was built.  It's not the machine's fault that its model was built without a touch screen.  I am a bit cranky with HP for making something of a big noise about their new 11a economy Chromebook with a touch screen... and then building a model of the 11a without one.  If you go to the HP site and enter all twelve characters of the model number and ask for specs the specifications displayed won't mention a touch screen because the 11a-na0010nr doesn't have one.  (The 11a-na0040nr does have a touch screen but the ...0010... does not.)<br/>None of this changes the fact that the product is misrepresented.  The listing describes the machine as<br/>"...The powerful MediaTek mobile processor, full-size keyboard, and 11.6-inch touchscreen can handle it all. ... With an anti-glare, high-definition, 11.6-inch touch display, you can stream..."<br/>So at two places in the "About This Item" text it promises a touch screen which the item does not have.  Initially I thought about returning the machine but, on reflection, the lack of a touch screen is not a deal breaker.  I decided that instead of returning  the machine I would leave a one-star review instead.<br/>UPDATE: Too many problems.  Sending the Chromebook back.  Problems that emerged since my previous review -- I can't make the SD card reader work.  I can activate the device in the device settings but most of the apps don't see it.  The settings for the individual apps don't show the card in the External Storage Preferences.  Notably, Netflix can't see the card.  You can't download much video to watch offline if you can't get to the SD card.  Also, although the item was sold as new with a one year warranty, when I presented the serial number to the HP support page it informed me that the warranty was started in April of 2021 and expired this April just passes.  So there is no warranty.  Googling the support communities found only one thread discussing a similar problem (last month) but the only participant who resolved the problem did so by returning the machine.  Starting to sound like the machine needs to go back.</span>

<span>If you don't mind looking at a small, iffy quality screen, then this Chromebook is fine for you. If you increase the letters on the screen too large, then it negatively effects your webpages and how many tabs you can have open.<br/><br/>It is fairly quick for it's price point and allowed me to get schoolwork done when needed. I wouldn't feel bad if I cracked the screen or broke it a few years from now since the price isn't bad.<br/><br/>If these types of screens bother your eyes, I highly recommend IPS displays. You can get this same exact laptop but with an IPS display for only a few bucks more.<br/><br/>All in all, I decided to return it after my eyes were hurting from squinting at the screen. I went with a Lenovo Chromebook C330 11.6 inch ($180).</span>
