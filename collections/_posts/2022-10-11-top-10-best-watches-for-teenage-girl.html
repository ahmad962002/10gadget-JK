<span>Just bought three for my triplets' 9th birthday and am returning.  This is a great smart watch, but for much younger kids.<br/><br/>In our suburb kids are allowed to walk alone to/from school as of 3rd grade.  Our guys just started it and we want to end our chauffeur service and have them walk.  My wife thought they should have watches if they are on their own so they know if they are running late.  I shopped Amazon and bought these due to high ratings, abundance of features, and low price.<br/><br/>Got them last night and during set up found that VTech's marketing and engineering people aren't on exactly the same page.  Phone has many fun settings on it including easy to use camera for still and videos, lots of wallpaper options, and 8 or so games.  My guys, if they wear these watches to school, are going to be distracted by them all day long.  Watch has parental controls but [1] only thing that can be turned off are the games (all other distracting features are always on), and [2] the parental controls are easy to defeat by anyone who can read (that is: most kids in first grade!)  How the marketing people can say "parental controls" are a feature, but the engineers didn't design with at least a 4 char PIN password is beyond me.  You don't find out the parental controls are so weak until you open the package and dive deep into the owners manual.<br/><br/>The owners manual also informs that the pedometer is a toy and shouldn't be considered accurate--nor can it be set to remain on in background, it must be used as primary feature in foreground to work at all.  Granted, at this price point it may not be reasonable to expect a pedometer like one would have on an iPhone or FitBit, but it would have been nice had the marketing materials made that clear prior to purchase.<br/><br/>So, we can't use the watch for our intended purposes and will return them.  From my limited time setting up the watch I can say the following.  It appears to be solid.  Interface should be easy for young non-reader to use.  Features will probably appeal to both younger and older (7-10) kids.  The cameras (there are 2) are easy to use for both still and moving pictures.  The cameras are about iPhone 1 quality and storage capacity is limited.  It does not appear difficult to upload images to a PC or Mac (but I haven't tried).  Once uploaded, it's likely beyond skill set of most younger kids to manage the media on the computer.  They say more games are downloadable to the phone but I did not explore.<br/><br/>For a reason they don't explain anywhere, they say you can only recharge watch battery using power from a computer (not a wall outlet charge port).  So, this watch will spend lots of time tethered to a computer--make sure you have one available for that purpose.  And for the few of you like me with triplets, make sure you computer has 3 USB ports available for charging.</span>

<span>I got this watch as a gift for our granddaughter, it is very cute; but the packaging is horrendous.  There is no way to even make it look presentable in the box that is provided.  The watch was not attached to the plastic stand and the box itself doesn't even seem to belong with the watch.  Like, look at the box, what the heck is that.  Clearly these are boxes that belong to some other item and were altered to send these watches out in.<br/> I am still trying to decide whether I should keep it.  If you are going to sell an item, at least make sure it's presentable...</span>

<span>I originally bought this for my 8-year-old but I found that it worked great for my 4 year old as well. I really like that it's a cloth elastic band because it doesn't cut into them, sweat etc.. I think I'm going to have to do my own adjustment to keeping the band in place though by doing a small Stitch or something because the clas doesn't keep locked tight and it keeps falling off. The face of the clock is great in the girls love it and are learning time with excitement!!</span>

<span>I’ve had several of these over the years. They hold up well with heavy use at a barn, soaked in water buckets and sweaty muddy horse debris. Have a ton of functions, are water proof and you can actually read them in the sun unlike all those expensive fit bits and apple watches.</span>

<span>I've bought multiple of these watches which should tell you two things. One, they break. Two, I like them enough to keep buying them anyways. They are easy to use with a backlight, optional hourly beeps, optional alarm that is loud enough to wake me up, and two times which can be set to AM/PM or military time. I've never had to replace a battery, I usually break them before that. Lots of stylish options is always a plus.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I've had is with the face cracking. After a couple months, this led to visible water getting into the clock. To be clear, I have never submerged my watch but I do leave it on when washing my hands and it gets wet. Once water-logged, it put up a valiant effort, with various digits going out over the course of a few days. Eventually the water-logged, half broken watch started making a horrible, constant, high-pitched sound and had to be disposed of. Overall, the original watch lasted 10 months with daily use. I bought a new one the same day.</span>

<span>The Armitron watches are good looking and work fine but the resin strap is bad quality.  My strap broke and the worst part is they do no have spare straps to buy, so I lost the watch.  This is not fair.</span>
