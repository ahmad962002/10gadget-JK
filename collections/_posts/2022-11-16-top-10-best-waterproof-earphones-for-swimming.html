<span>I usually don’t complete reviews and honestly I only complete them when I hate the product.  The H2O Audio Interval really beat all expectations. I bought this because it was cheap, and my IPod was fizzing out and I could not find a new one. So I was hoping for the best but was not expecting much.  When I got it and started using it, it was better than my iPod, was easier to update songs, plus you don’t have to buy new music to play it on your watch.  I change my songs every time I go swimming (do it in the car before a go in the gym). With my IPod, I changed my music once a month a best because it was such an undertaking.  I am so happy with the item I really think that I should buy another before they raise the price.</span>

<span>I swim 5-7 days a week. I was contemplating this or the Delphin. Decided if I was going to spend a couple hundred dollars, I should get an SE Apple Watch and this headset for more functionality outside of the pool.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- when it works, it’s really cool and definitely enhances my swim experience<br/>- amazing bass so even when water gets in your ears, you can still hear the beat<br/>- great battery life<br/>- Simple set up and use...just not for very long<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- I have Spotify. Something just doesn’t work well enough between the various components for H2O Audio to say this is Spotify compatible at this point in time<br/>- after several emails back and forth to troubleshoot, I was told to switch to Apple Music because it should work then. I have thousands of songs and dozens of playlists on Spotify with a family subscription. Probably not gonna happen<br/>- You lose all functionality with your Apple Watch for Fitness/Move rings, heart rate, oxygen measurement, etc, because the watch is on the back of your goggles<br/>- The app provided is wildly off on lap counting and will only close out your Move ring when synced<br/>- the headset feels incredibly cheap and I feel a good drop would possibly break it<br/>- there is a component on the headset that completely comes off which happened to me in the pool while I was trying to get my watch face in it. Tiny blue pieces and a metal bar. Not sure why it’s separate pieces. Not ideal for wet hands<br/>- You have to turn your Bluetooth off on your phone, turn off the feature which locks and helps keep water out of your watch face, turn off all other apps<br/>- I knock out the earbuds during my backstroke<br/>- It can slip off your goggles which isn’t a big deal in a pool but I probably wouldn’t be as comfortable using it in open water as a result<br/><br/>Malfunction Issues:<br/>H2O said it’s just Spotify and in some cases, yes, I can totally see that like when Spotify plays 2 songs and just stops. But this cuts out mid song as well. Sometimes, it says it’s all working but it’s not. Sometimes my watch tells me “something went wrong” but doesn’t specify what, sometimes the watch just disappears as on option, sometimes the watch says the connection was handed back to my phone (hence turn the Bluetooth off on your phone). I have to take off my goggles, close our Spotify, reopen Spotify, reconnect to the headset. Sometimes I’ll get 20 minutes out of it. Sometimes I’ll get 5. It seems worse when I’m at the crowded gym pool vs the swimming club pool I use during the week. It cuts out both while submerged and above water.<br/><br/>I’m going to test the Bluetooth function of Spotify with something other than this headset to see it Spotify is solely to blame. But...I’m think it’s not *just* Spotify having the issue. And at minimum, if Spotify is the issue, they shouldn’t advertise Spotify as an option.</span>

<span>I’ve tried almost all underwater audio products. The old iPod shuffle made waterproof, the delphin Android tablet and this. I just bought a new Apple Watch and tight i could use my old one to listen to music and audio books while swimming and can retire my delphin. Experience want great.<br/>1) this thing is clunky. Without proper case (no case provided) it’s a hassle to carry, the headphones get in the way and get caught on everything.<br/>2) it’s a hassle to clip it to the goggles. Since you will need to charge it often you will need to take it off on and a lot. Sometimes it falls off, outs just not thought through. The clip on the delphin is simple and works<br/>3) The earphones don’t form a good seal. This is a biggie. Just a little water and you can’t hear anything anymore in one or both ears. There are really good underwater earphones available that all have the same design (they look like a Christmas tree). The maker is clearly not a swimmer. Also the earphones need to be removable in case they break. Fixing them to the case is a huge design flaw.<br/>4) you have to charge the case and the watch. Might sound not like a big deal but it is.<br/>I really wanted to get rid of the Delphin since it’s cumbersome to use the touch screen but it’s so much more convenient since it’s smaller, easier to attach to the goggles, you can choose your earphones and it’s way more robust. I guess I will keep it a while longer until a better replacement comes along. This one is not out and will be returned.</span>

<span>After doing a little research on waterproof headphones I was very skeptical because of the varied results from users. However, as with anything, I decided to pick the item I thought to be the best and go with it to see for myself. The H2O Audio Surge 2 headphones worked as advertised and did not disappoint. It took me no longer to get setup than it did putting on my goggles. I wound the excess cord around my goggle band and clipped my waterproof iPod shuffle (another outstanding purchase!) to the band as well and off I went.  The clarity was perfect for about 35 minutes when I got a little water in my left ear and the sound went out on that side, but the sound and clarity were still there in my right ear (which is the reason I gave only 4 stars). I did stop to clear the water from my left ear and the sound came back. I don't know if that is typical of all waterproof headphones, but I was happy just to hear music while I was submersed!  It made my workout ten times more enjoyable than ever before and I found myself wanting to swim for another hour!  My recommendation is to try out all the ear buds that come with the headphones to see which is the best fit. Typically, I wear a medium size earbud with headphones but decided to go with the small bud because it seemed to be a better fit and provided a better seal.</span>

<span>Wanted waterproof ear buds for swimming laps, had tried bluetooth ones previously and they were awful. Got these, along with the waterproof case for my phone, for "wired" approach, and its awesome-- good sound quality, did have to "blow out" water from ear bud a couple times but for most part was totally able to enjoy my workout tunes while swimming. Great selection of ear bud sizes/shapes to allow a good fit that stayed in place. I was worried the case would be too bulky with my 5'2" frame (and short arms), but it didn't impede my stroke at all. Great product!</span>

<span>I have used many, many different MP3 players for swimming. I swim one mile a day and could not get through the boring cadence without the help of music and I have found that these are the best ear buds I have ever used. I have found that the biggest weakness for any underwater MP3 players are the ear pieces. If you are kicking against a wall when making that reverse very few ear buds can take that pressure.<br/><br/>The H20 Sure 2 ear buds are good but pricey, but in the latest version the rubber ear pieces have become thinner and therefore collapse easier against the pressure of the water. My advice is to get some other rubber ear pieces with more durable rubber and substitute that rubber with the rubber that comes with these ear piecese. I have several of the older pairs that had the more durable rubber and have been using them in place of their newer thinner rubber pieces. But it's still a decent for use on your waterproof MP3 especially since many of those ship with even crummier ear pieces that are not very good at keeping water out.. Also the thinner ear buds are probably fine for most people doing light activity in the water but if you do a lot of lap swimming than follow my advice re the rubber portion. A couple of key items to remember when using these:<br/><br/>1. The cord is long so wrap the cord around the connector at the top where you plug it into the player.  Use a bread bag tie thingy and wrap it securely. Don't use a rubber band as the pool water rots if fairly quick. You can also wrap the wire around the goggle bands as well. Despite this nit, I still recommend this product wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>2. Start with the larger ear bud rubber ends first then work your way down to the smaller sizes if that doesn't fit. If you use the larger sizes, you get a tighter barrier against the water. But again follow my previous advice on the rubber ear piece<br/><br/>3. You should consider wetting the ear buds lightly in the water before you place them in your ear, it seems to keep them more secure in your ear for some reason.<br/><br/>4. When you insert them in your ear pull back the top of your ear with your opposite hand, that will stretch it and allow the ear canal to gently wrap more snugly around the ear bud.<br/><br/>It is rare when the water enters the ear canal if you take these three steps and you will enjoy the music much better. Once water gets in your ear you are hosed for the rest of the swim and that goes for any ear piece. Happy swimming!</span>

<span>These ear-buds are so good that I gave them a five star rating even though one of the pair that I received (I’ve bought several pairs), was defective. However,  the company took care of this right away, and I was back with a new pair in less than a week. The quality of sound of these is astonishing. I have been a swimmer for years, and have tried all kinds of water-proof MP3 players. I found one which is also the best on the market called the Diver, also sold on Amazon,, but as is the case with even the best players, their ear-buds were just okay, and a bit uncomfortable. So, I splurged and bought these ear-buds, and after hearing them for the first time,  I felt like Dorothy walking through the grim black-and-white Kansas into the Technicolor Oz. It also showed off just how good the player was, since the sound quality was as HD as you can get. Full range, crisp highs, clear middle range, and real “woofer” type base. And of course they are water-proof as well. Because of the sound quality and comfort of these buds (they come with half a dozen different ear bud sizes, but the one supplied fits perfectly), I now can easily swim two or more hours, since they put you into another world, where you forget time and place. I have tried over a dozen other types of water-proof ear-buds, and again, none of the others come even a third of the way to the quality of these gems. They are worth every penny, and best yet, this company truly cares about their product, and are right there to help you, and take care of any problems, and totally back their products, not only through the warranty period, but way, way beyond. If you are looking for water-proof ear-buds… look no further. There are no others of this quality on the market!</span>

<span>Great quality for the price. I've had FAR more expensive ones that didn't sound nearly as good. Remember that you are not going to get GREAT sound quality from waterproof earbuds- This is about as good as you can expect.<br/><br/>One tip- DO NOT pull the wires to get them out of your ear, it will shorten their life considerably. Also, the tips do tend to come off on occasion in the ear, it's a result of a very tight fit that keeps the water out. For this reason, I carry a pair of tweezers in my swim bag so I can get them out of my ear.<br/><br/>The only thing that I hate about these is the cord length- It's way too long for swimming, so you've got to coil it up somehow... I have fixed that with mine by shortening the cord, it only takes a couple of minutes and a bit of solder and shrink tubing. There are PLENTY of tutorials on the web about soldering headphone cords if you don't know how to do it. It makes a good pair of headphones GREAT.<br/><br/>The white 'ear thingies' are removable easily, I take them off as I find that I don't need them.</span>

<span>I felt the need to chime in here since there was only one review for these when I was shopping and I took the plunge (so to speak) based on the one review. I'm not trying to steer anyone away, just wanted to offer another opinion based on my experience.<br/><br/>I had purchased a Speedo Aquabeat (which I really like), but the earphones that came with the Aquabeat where causing me some difficulties. I saw these and figured for eleven bucks, what the heck.<br/><br/>Compared to the Aquabeat's original earphones, these defintely do NOT sound as good. Given that these are for swimming and workout conditions, I don't expect Shure or Sennheiser quality reproduction, but these are fair to poor by comparison to the Aquabeat originals and the difference is easily discernible. The sound is useable, but it's ten dollar sound, period.<br/><br/>The comfort level was OK for me and I have very sensitive ear canals. I have not as yet used these in the water, but I'm sure they will do - as a spare. I'd rather put up with my originals for the sound quality difference.<br/><br/>The problem I have with the Aquabeat originals happens when I'm done. When I try to take them out, the rubber end pieces frequently detach from the earphone leaving them lodged in my ear and quite literally a pain to get out. These Pyles phones do not seem like they will have that problem, but again, the sound is ten dollar sound. My search continues.</span>

<span>I bought this: </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Lewis-N-Clark-WaterSeals-standard-Waterproof-MP3-or-IPOD-pouch/dp/B0032UYHFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lewis N. Clark WaterSeals standard Waterproof MP3 or IPOD pouch</a>
<span>. I've read reviews for all of the waterproof headphones available on Amazon, and I was unsatisfied by what I could obviously see were design flaws in other headphones, even in the $50 and up range. I took a chance on these, and I'm glad I did. I'll break it down by waterproofing, comfort, and sound.<br/><br/>The headphones come with four sets of in-ear cups. Three of those are small, medium, and large triple-sealed cups obviously for in water use. There is also a pair of regular in-ear cups for listening outside water. I used the small cups, which still seemed a little big, but they made an excellent seal. Doing things I normally did in water that might dislodge them, I was surprised to find that they stayed put and stayed sealed. Even moving my jaw, or lightly pulling on the cords, I didn't unseal them. The over-ear bendable plastic helped significantly - the phones were not pulled by drag or anything else away from my ear. I'm sure if I were to tug on them, I would dislodge them, but I try to avoid this with any waterproof headphone because doing so often compromises their waterproofing, and they can get permanently damaged in the water.<br/><br/>Another difference between these and the standard triple-seal phones is comfort. You can't really call anything comfortable that's lodged in your ear canal, but these come close to comfort. The plastic is soft and near-malleable, and the edges are thin, instead of thick and blunt. There are slightly noticeable mold lines (where the seam of the two molds used to create the cup come together), but these did nothing to irritate my ears. By comparison, the design of the Lewis &amp; Clark earphones is downright sadistic. There is only one size of ear cup, and the plastic is harder and excruciatingly painful in the ear.<br/><br/>The sound, I was happy to find, is quite excellent. Because of the seal, I couldn't really find a perfect balance of highs and lows in my ear (I suspect it has something to do with the air pressure), but it's a price I'm very willing to pay for the great seal. I set my equalizer on my mp3 player, and everything sounded great.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very satisfied with these earphones. The value for the price is amazing. Don't waste your money on those $50 and up earphones; these ones do fine. The only thing is, they're not perfectly comfortable. I can't give five stars for something that still hurts my ear to use, as I have a pair of non-waterproof Panasonic earphones that are like wearing nothing on my ears. Comfort is a big deal to me, and these are slightly painful to wear. But I suspect that the cups are shaped the way they are in order to make a seal, which they do very well.<br/><br/>A few words of caution: I have not taken these to any depths. I usually swim on the surface of the water, and my last pair of headphones did not respond well to being taken even three feet underwater. Because I am so satisfied with these, I didn't risk going lower than the surface. If you're a diver, or an underwater swimmer, I don't suggest listening to music underwater with any sort of earphones.<br/><br/>Secondly, you'll want to rinse anything you use in chlorinated or seawater thoroughly with distilled water after every use, to prolong their lifespan. Make sure they are unplugged, and make sure they are fully dry before their next use.</span>

<span>Bought these to go with a waterproof MP3 player I purchased. While they sound fine, I should have read more of the reviews. Yes, these simply do work as advertised. I removed them from the molded clips and found them to fit tighter and better in my ears that way. Also exchanged the ear pieces for a set of sturdier (harder silicone) pieces from a old waterproof headset I had lying around - resulting in much better sealing and no worries over them coming off too easily and possibly getting stuck in the ear(s) - it seems the ones included with the headset are simply too thin/soft. The biggest gripe I have with this product is the cable is just too long! Even if it were made at half the length, it would be pretty generous for swimming/surfing. I have to stuff the excess length under my rashguard when I go surfing and it is quite a hassle when making adjustments to my MP3 player or changing tracks/radio stations - end up fumbling around with the cord's excess length. I can only guess how much more humbug it is for those who try swimming with these. Also do not like how the ear buds are not labeled left or right - kind of nit-picky, but it makes a difference to me even if the sound and listening environment are not optimal. The only redeeming quality about the length of the cord is when I fall asleep listening to my MP3 player - I can keep it a good distance from me and don't have to worry about smashing it or dropping it on the floor. The earbuds also fit close enough to my head so they don't irritate me when I sleep on my side. I pretty much don't use these for my watersports activities although I may modify these (shorter &amp; change plug) so I can use my old waterproof MP3 player again.</span>

<span>The set is functional it works while I swim laps everyday. My issue is sound consistency, when I start my swim you hear music clearly in both ears. As time goes on during the swim one ear bud sound level drops considerably. It does it every time I swim. After I get out of the pool in a few minutes the sound level is the same in both pods again.

The tip and fin combination worked best for me I now have little issue with water seeping in.<br/><br/>The sound is a bit tinny but actually improves under water  I would also recommend buying the version with the shorter cord and I unfortunately found it impossible to use with a swim cap that goes over the ear.</span>

<span>I was given this as a gift 4 yrs ago. I am a daily lap swimmer and swim 1 1/2hrs a day. This is great when it works. My experience has been that it works about 6 months then either I can’t charge it, turn it on or the sounds goes away. It has a year warranty and I’ve sent it in when I have problems and it’s fixed, replaced and sent back. I have purchased 3 more by myself over the past 3 yrs. Each has lasted 5-8 mos but is frustrating when it won’t work. The earplugs that come with this are very cheap and don’t last long.

<span>I purchased these to replace an old underwater iPod that had recently died.  After swimming 30 laps and diving to 8 feet with these, they crapped out on me.  I went for a replacement through Amazon and got a new one within 7 days.  I sent the damaged product back to H2O per the return instructions.  The new one definitely has a better seal for the earbuds jack than the original, almost a suction-like feel to it when plugged in.  And I now avoid diving.  I've used these now for 6 trips to the pool.<br/><br/>What I like about this product: 8GB of music (wow) and larger battery.  It tells me the battery left with each power-on, in increments of 25%.  I just dragged-and-dropped my music onto the "drive" when I connected it to my Mac.  And the various controls are easy to find even when it is on the back of my head when swimming.<br/><br/>What I don't like: the cable for the earbuds is a bit too long and drags on my neck as I am swimming.  The earbuds themselves are short and take some work to jam into my ear canal.  I recommend dunking your ears first before putting in the buds...provides for a better fit/seal.<br/><br/>I am neutral on the Bluetooth aspect.  I don't use it and wish H2O had a non-bluetooth model (to get the price down as well).  And I don't think Bluetooth in the water works very well.<br/><br/>Update: I have now used this for 7 weeks.  For me, that is 21 uses and the battery only went down to 10% (34 laps per use).  I have found that many of my M4A Apple formatted files do not play, since they were purchased by me and therefore copyrighted.  I converted them to MP3 format and recopied them and all is better.<br/><br/>This is not a fast USB drive, and it takes quite a while to perform the copy of all music to it.  Be patient.</span>

<span>I purchased these to use while I am out on the lake to listen to music and make and receive phone calls. I have not used these submerged, but so far these are holding up well to splashes and soaking from jet-skiing on the water.<br/><br/>It comes with multiple choices of ear cups so these seal in your ear well for the most noise isolation and least water intrusion. With these inserted firmly in my ear they definitely did a good job of reducing noise and keeping water out of my ears. IMPORTANT: If you use these for an extended period of time or use these while submerged, I would periodically remove these and drain the water out of ears to prevent an ear infection/swimmers ear.<br/><br/>I must say these are excellent. These stay in my ear even while going 60+ miles per hour on my jet ski. They sound great too and have decent bass. I also did not experience any connectivity issues. I used these on my jet-ski with my phone buried in a waterproof box in the front storage compartment, and the Bluetooth signal never cut out or dropped out even while bouncing around on the waves (although it was only about 6 feet away).<br/>I also used these on a phone call, the audio was crisp clear and loud, and the person on the other end had no trouble hearing me at all, despite being wet.<br/><br/>These are definitely worth the money and they seem to be the only true waterproof earbuds (many others are just water resistant, and will fail when completely submerged).</span>

<span>I thought the sound quality was on par with normal bluetooth headphones, and they come with about 7-8 different sizes of buds with various different shapes. The upside to this is that they prevent from any water getting into the ear, a must for someone who does watersports in places where the water quality can be less than ideal.<br/><br/>I had an issue initially with the charging port, but was sent a replacement without any hassle or extra charge, so thumbs up for the customer service. Overall very happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>As an aquatics and paddle craft instructor and guide, I needed ear buds I could comfortably wear and use for hours. The Surge BT headphones are doing the job. The fit and sound quality are excellent. The maximum volume is louder than other bluetooth ear buds I have or have tried (waterproof or not). The controls (only 3 buttons) are easy to locate and use while wearing and they allow for pause, skip track, rewind, reject call, answer call, and end call in addition to volume adjustment. They come with a compact hard case that can also hold the USB cable and spare tips and tree plugs. These are pricier than some and I hesitated to purchase them for that reason but I've not been happy with other WP headphones and these are serving me well; worth every penny.</span>

<span>I have been swimming with these headphones for about a month and they are absolutely perfect. I swim for about 70 minutes three times a week and so far have only had to charge them once. They were fully charged when I received them. When you turn them on it will say whether the battery level is low, medium or high. The last time I swam with them I got a "low" reading and charged them when I got home.<br/><br/>Copying and dragging MP3 files is easy breezy even for a non techy like me. I have the SYRYN as a back up but will probably only use it to keep the battery sound. I highly recommend this brand and have a pair for walking as well. Five stars!</span>

I swim 1 to 2 hours at a time and haven't had to charge them yet and the battery is still on high after at least 10 hours of use. The only downsides I have with them are having to convert audiobooks to mp3 files to play and there is no way to fast forward or rewind so if I hit the wrong button I will have to start the book back from the beginning.

The challenge, that many of us now have, is that you can't charge and listen to the iPhone at the same time unless you have some sort of wireless way to listen or charge.  Because of the great deal recently posted, I decided to give these a shot and I was really impressed with how they integrate with the iPhone, the sound quality, build quality, and just how easy they are.

<span>Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip &amp; runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.<br/><br/>Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability &amp; tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.<br/><br/>Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's "universal" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation &amp; wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.<br/><br/>Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware &amp; tare might diminish that over time.<br/><br/>Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.<br/><br/>AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.<br/><br/>AppleCare tips:<br/>You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.<br/><br/>You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.<br/><br/>You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.<br/><br/>Using AirPods with Android:<br/><br/>Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.<br/><br/>If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find "AirPods" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.<br/><br/>FAIR WARNING:<br/><br/>You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.<br/><br/>I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called "AirPopUp". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT &amp; RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.<br/><br/>For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.<br/><br/>Galaxy Buds features:<br/>Made by Samsung<br/>Audio powered by AKG<br/>Rubber ear bud tips<br/>Pair with Samsung device to get the most<br/>Wireless charging case<br/>Active noise cancellation<br/>Comes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red &amp; black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)<br/>Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.<br/><br/>I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled "Galaxy Wearable". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT &amp; RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.<br/><br/>Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.</span>

<span>I bought these my senior year of college and I am so happy that I did. Going to the gym and dealing with the chord from the older iPhone earbuds got pretty annoying. These were super easy just to pop in without dealing with any chords. I also love the ability to double tap to skip a song while in a workout or if I’m not near my phone. I’ve owned these for about a year now and they have never fallen out of my ear unless I accidentally knocked it out by hitting it. The battery life is amazing! One day I realized they were dead, plugged them in before I took the trash out, and they were just about up to 70-75 when I came back. It charges super fast, but the case does die fairly fast when not plugged in. The ease of use for answering phone calls, being alerted for texts, sending texts, accessing Siri, and so much more definitely make this purchase worth it for me. I used these almost every day in college and definitely feel like I got my moneys worth!</span>

<span>I been buying these cheap sports ear buds every year for the last 4 years. I work maintenance so they usually last a little over a year before I do something and break them. They have never been the same brand, yet I feel they are all made by the same manufacturer. Honestly, I just find this style for under $30, make sure they have the water resistance and press buy, but they are all look and operate the same regardless of the name of the brand. I think one manufacture makes these and then just lets other companies toss their brand on it and that's fine saves me from trying to find exactly what I purchases the year before.<br/><br/>So this review is for every headset that looks like this pair and has the same features.<br/><br/>With that said, they keep getting better every year. They have always been comfortable and come with 4 total size ear moldings for a good enough fit, I get ear fatigue very easy and highly dislike earbuds in general, but the ear band keeps them in so I can worry more about comfort than them falling out.<br/>The initial connection to my phone has gotten so quick, the mic quality has become better where my contractors don't even know they are on a headset (compared to my first pair where I had to turn it off to talk) the battery life has always been amazing for the price, I get a full 8 hour day worth with plenty of juice left to spare. I wouldn't go for 2 days though unless they're only in use half the day. They aren't the loudest but you'll hear your music while using power tools, you'll just also hear your power tools also. I do get "jump scared" a lot if someone comes up behind me and doesn't yell. These also have never failed me in the rain either.<br/><br/>All in all if you want a cheap pair of "throw away" headphones and you like the "sports loop" and the wire that you can drape them over your neck while not in use, then these are 5 stars. Just don't overpay, as I said, you can find these same pairs from $20-$50 all over Amazon and I fully believe they are all made by one manufacture regardless of the brand. I pay (on average) $25 for these.</span>

<span>My mom is old(er than me, leave it at that) and even though she loves gadgets, she is about as tech savvy as a caterpillar, and the caterpillar could prob out-type her too.  She asked me, "I need new BT headphones, what should I buy?"  I told her, "You should buy the type where the two earbuds are connected, since you're old(er than me) and you lose stuff so if you get the true wireless it's possible you'll lose one.  Also, they're a little less reliable since either or can lose connection...and it's kinda weird if only one is the phone earbud, if you're not used to it."  These are legit complaints I have with my Bose Soundsport Frees which is apt, since I got them for free from my brother-in-law who didn't like them.  But man is it annoying when I'm out for a run and the left says, "Nah, you're on your own" and disconnects itself).<br/><br/>She says she'd think about it...then goes and buys some Skullcandy True Wireless ANCs from the store for $80....like, "Really mom??  Why you need active noise cancelling, you don't go nowhere!"  She tries pairing it and is having all of the issues as the Skullcandys won't pair and the battery life when they do pair isn't what she's looking for.  Bare in mind, my mom is NOT tech savvy nor does she have the best memory, so she'll just forget electronics need to be charged and leave them wherever for who knows how long.  So I jump on Amazon and buy her these, since they're cheap and look exactly like a pair I have that are my BT back-ups whenever my Bose irritate me too much.<br/><br/>She gets these in the mail and after remembering to charge them, they pair immediately and she's ecstatic.  They also last forever since she only charges them maybe once a week, when she remembers to, but regardless, the Skullcandys are collecting dust somewhere in her house.  When my dad got a new phone (no 3.5mm jack) and he also needed BT headphones, mom suggests, "You can have my $80 headphones", dad says, "No, son, buy me the same ones mom has."  So now dad also has a pair (and since he's a guy they're in a darker color).  They're also a diff color than mom's cuz, yeesh, I just picture them using the wrong ones and, blech.  Even long-term married couples don't share Q-tips.<br/><br/>I did dock off a star since although they pair immediately and their sound quality (listening to them) is fine for the price range, when mom calls me with them she sounds very quiet compared to her old Plantronics set.  I can still hear her but I doubt I'd be able to still hear her if I was anywhere remotely loud.</span>

<span>I definitely recommend these earbuds to anyone not wanting to break the bank. I've had these earbuds for quite some time now and I must say they are VERY durable.<br/><br/>I've slept in theses earbuds more times than I can count and they have yet to break on me. I've also dropped them a few times as well and they hold up to this day. I take these earbuds with me to work due to me not wanting to lose the individual true wireless earbuds, I normally loop the earbuds through my bra strap to keep up with them when I'm no the go.<br/><br/>The sound and base quality are not bad at all for affordable earbuds. I have bought certain name brand earbuds that do not sound nearly as good as these. The nose canceling is definitely not bad as well. So, if your looking for some affordable earbuds that give good sound, base and noise cancelation quality, for an affordable piece, look no further these won't disappoint.</span>

<span>I have purchased a similar pair of Bluetooth headphones from another company that was at the time considered an “Amazon Choice” because of their high ratings and economical price point. I have actively used them for the last few months and was asked by Otium to try their product.<br/><br/>Shipping was fast (I received the headphones in two days), and the next morning opened up my shipment to try the headphones out.<br/><br/>Packaging was simple to get into—no tape or plastic wrap covering the product; only a cardboard sleeve with the box that contained the headphones. Upon opening, everything was neatly packaged, and there was no damage to any of the inner contents.<br/><br/>The zipper case containing the headphones displayed the Otium company logo on the outside of it, was black in color and had a carabiner attached to it so you could carry it on a backpack, purse, belt loop, or anything that you could think of to connect it to. Inside the case was the headphones, and two additional sizes of earpieces and a plastic cinch to keep the wire between the right and left side of the headphones from flopping around. Also, in the box was a USB cable to charge the headphones, a warranty card that gives the customer an additional 6-month free warranty for buying the product and an instruction manual explaining the use of the headphones, including troubleshooting, and also what is allowed and not allowed with the waterproof feature of the headphones, which I will get to later in this review.<br/><br/>The first thing the instructions suggest is to charge the product entirely, which takes 1-2 hours to charge. When I plugged the USB into my laptop, it only took a little less than an hour to charge the headphones fully. The one thing I noticed immediately about the headphones that the ones I had purchased a few months earlier were that the part that wraps around the ear to keep them in place was stiffer than my previous ones. I liked that because the other headphones had a very flimsy ear wrap.<br/><br/>Connecting them to my iPhone X was simple and easy. You hold the power button down for a total of eight seconds to pair to your phone. Then, you go to your Bluetooth settings, and either the name “Otium” will appear (depending on your phone), or you will need to type in a password for it, which is “0000”. After pairing your headphones to your phone, you are ready to go. You also have the option for “multi-pairing” to two devices, which I thought was a cool feature!<br/><br/>As far as the buttons, the power button (located on the right side) turns on/off the headphones, pairs the headphones to up to two devices and answers/ends/rejects phone calls/redials the last number called. You can also transfer/pause/play audio with the power button. The volume controls allow you to mute the microphone/turn up and down the volume and move forward/reverse audio tracks that you are listening to.<br/>You can talk up to 8 hours, which I will admit I have never tried, and they state that the standby time is close to 220 hours, which is all dependent on usage.<br/><br/>The headphones sound great! The voices come in clear, and there is a decent amount of bass, which I tend to like. The earphones stay in my ear, which is another feature I appreciate, considering that the Apple earbuds and other headsets I have tried in the past have not fit well in my ears (I must have a larger left ear canal, because that is the side that all of my earphones would fall out of!). The wire connecting the earphones stays out of my way, and I usually don’t use the cinch, because I am a bigger person in size, and do not like having something constricting in the back of my head. The ear wrap is comfortable around my ears, the only downfall is that they are not adjustable for different ear sizes, but they are flexible to fit around different ear sizes of most people. The earbuds allow a for some noise isolation – another great feature! The volume sounds pretty good at different levels; it becomes just a little distorted at higher volumes. I’ve seen a few negative reviews that have mentioned that they have difficulty pairing to their phone after a period using the Bluetooth headphones, but I have not used them long enough to experience that problem. The box does give information on how to contact them if there are any technical problems, so if anything does happen in the future, I will try to reach out to them and see how they handle customer service issues. Finally, the price point is perfect! With other higher-end headphones on the market, for an economical pair of headphones, these are great!<br/><br/>The only negatives are first, the volume buttons. I’m used to holding down on the button on older earbuds due to my age (LOL!), and I keep forgetting that it will skip to the next song or go back to the previous song. However, I’m slowly getting used to repeatedly clicking to turn up/down the volume, so it is something that is a minor complaint that I can quickly get over. Secondly, I was listening to Amazon Prime Music on my iPhone through these headphones and paused the music to hear what my wife was saying at the time. When I went to play the music as instructed in the manual, it would not restart the music. I had to open the app and manually press the play button to continue listening to music. That was frustrating. If I was driving down the road while listening to music, it is inconvenient to go to look down at my phone and keep driving down the road and risk having an accident happen. I did try listening to a podcast and tried pausing and playing using the same process, and it worked, so it is a software issue, which I hope Amazon would fix in the future.<br/><br/>Now, I told you that I would mention what you can get away with when it comes to water. The instruction manual states that you can get away with splashes, rain, snow, incidental exposure to water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes, and believe it or not, showering! Seriously! Who showers with headphones on?! I am nervous to try that, but it would be interesting to see if it would actually withstand a shower!<br/><br/>Situations it cannot withstand when it comes to water is swimming or any type of watersports, which makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>I would honestly recommend these headphones for the ease of use, quality and price point! I gave my wife the headphones I previously purchased and have used these full-time! These are great headphones! Buy yours today!</span>

<span>I was so curious how these worked and what they would be like so I ordered them. Best choice I’ve made because these headphones are fantastic. The only real complaint I have about them is they can be uncomfortable at higher volumes because the vibration tickles your ears, but other than that the sound quality is great. They’re easy to clean because there’s no little crevices that stuff gets caught in, they’re so comfortable I forget I’m wearing them most of the time, the controls are simple when you need to pause/lower or increase volume, and the battery life lasts days. I’ve forgotten to turn them off some nights and the battery was still charged the next morning. Great headphones I can’t stop recommending!</span>

<span>I'll preface this with the following: I'm completely deaf in my left, from birth and there isn't anything I can do about it. It's not cochlear bone deafness, it's a stupid rare kind where I have no nerve connection to my brain. Anyways. These things allow me to listen to music, and keep my one good ear open to the world. Total, and absolute game changer. But no, it doesn't "allow me to hear" out of the left. I honestly don't know why people claim that they can suddenly "hear the music" while being deaf. But hey, as stated, I got the rare kind of deafness, so what do I know about the common types?<br/>I use them for, listening to music, podcasts, or watching a movie at work. I work overnight security, and it gets dead at night. We are allowed to use one earbud so we can still hear our the phone, radio, people, etc. But that means I can't hear anything at all if I do that. Took em for a test drive same night I got them in the mail, and MY GOD! Absolutely INSANE! For once in my life, I felt like someone who pops a single earbud in. I could hear my music AND have conversations with multiple people all night long. Absolutely beautiful!<br/><br/>As far as the quality of them goes. It's great. Cranking it up to max isn't something I suggest because it sounds grainy. But for an application like mine, anywhere for 25-75% volume is PERFECT!</span>

<span>I got these for my wife as she is in a supervisory role in manufacturing setting and cannot wear TWS earbuds or anything that interferes with her hearing. I didn't know much about bone conduction or the available options. My obsession with headphones never extended to this arena as I never needed anything like them. After reading extensively and finding Shockz are universally regarded as the best option across the board I went with these because of the battery life and option for the smaller size. She's 5'5 and has a smaller head, I didn't measure 1st just went with my gut and remained hopeful. I was surprised by how much she loved them and how impressed she was with the fit, finish and build quality. Apparently there are many styles of these types of headphones and many other brands are aesthetically unpleasant. She mentioned getting multiple compliments on how nice they looked and how subtle they were compared to many pair her colleagues are using. She loves them and said the battery is as good as advertised and she is happy with the sound quality.  They charge very quickly and the magnetic cable is secure and super easy to use. If I had a suggestion it would be to find a slim hard or at least somewhat substantial case of some sort as the included pouch, bag w/e offers little to no protection at least in my mind while in her pocketbook. For ~130 and what they are I don't think it's unreasonable to expect something more than a . 25¢ fabric drawstring bag. I'd almost rather buy a ⅕ of Crown Royal and use the bag that comes with it, that way you get whiskey too but I digress. For form and function these headphones are very good for what they are. Do they sound like HQ over the ear cans? Not even close? Do they compete with higher end earbuds M&amp;W07, Klipsch T5ii? Not if you have functioning eardrums. Are they great for activities where hearing ambient noise is imperative? Absolutely 100% and that coupled with the build quality and design makes these awesome if you need them for the specific reasons mentioned above, or as I read for running, biking, swimming (some models), anything where safely is impacted by obstructed hearing. I'd recommend them to anyone needing something to fit those use cases without hesitation.</span>

<span>This is by far the easiest and most comfortable headset I've ever used.  It charges quickly and the battery lasts a VERY long time.  I like to listen to podcasts at night when I go to bed and I often fall asleep faster.  These headphones don't go into your ear, so they are very comfortable for a side sleeper like me. When I wake up in the morning, the headset still has a "medium" charge.  When you power it on, it tells you it's connected and what the charge level is.  That is very helpful for someone like me that uses my iPhone for my business and personal use and the headset doesn't interfere if I need to answer my desktop phone, because it doesn't go into your ear!  Perfect for those, like my husband who has a deformity in one of his ears, making traditional "plug" earphones impossible for him to use.  Highly recommend!</span>
