<span>I have an old projector PJD5533W with 1080P and 3500 lumens for years and now have a new protable projector M1 mini plus with 720P and 120 lumens.<br/><br/>The 1st thing you need be careful is that the remote of mini projector is very easy to be interfered by my old projector or even the TV... I see some other user mentions that the remote malfuctions. I believe it is the interference. I have two projectors. And their remote work on each other. When these two projectors power on or in standy mode in a same time, the large projector receives all signals from two remotes, and the M1 mini plus hardly receives any signal and gives response. In this case, you have to use mobile apps or USB mouser on the mini projector to avoid remote interference. Viewsonic have to give solution on this issue.<br/><br/>The M1 mini plus have excellent color in dark, good color under inddor lighting (brigtest of Philips Hue), acceptable in indoor half daylight. Of course with only 120 lumens, this mini projector is not recommend for full daylight or under sunshine. If you want a good color in daylight, go to buy a projector with 3500 lumens or more.<br/><br/>For the resolution, 720P is good enough for video, presentation with large text front, or sync the ebook on mobile screen. But if you use it to project normal text from 1080p source of PC, it's hardly read.<br/><br/>M1 miniplus can project a small screen of 13" or smaller like 10" in a short distance. Due to 720P resultion only, if the project screen is over 30", the resolution drop is significant but still good for video. When it projects a 60" screen, it's very different compare with my another 1080P projector. I prefer to go back to my old 1080P projectior in this screen size.<br/><br/>The automatic keystone correction of M1 miniplus doesn't work all the ways. Expecially on uneven project surface, with something blocks in the middle, or in over light envirement. The problem is that when the auto keystone correction doesn't work, here's no manual keystone correction as backup...<br/><br/>The mini projector M1 mini plus is quite hot. My old projector PJD5533W is very hot too when working.</span>

<span>It is a very nice little projector, very portable but you need to consider a couple of aspects before you buy it. First it is not a real Full HD 1080p of projector, it's native resolution is WVGA (854x480), when projecting from your PC in 1080 the image gets downscaled and loses quality which is very noticeable, so make sure you adjust your PC to the right resolution if you want to get a clearer picture, especially when showing text in the screen. The other thing to consider is the power source, this projector consumes 10W which equals 2A at 5V, most of the usb ports in a PC can't give 2A but just 0.5A,  if you have usb 2 or 0.9 if you have usb 3 ports. The same happens with most of phone chargers. I made the mistake to plug the projector to the PC usb port and turn it on without letting it charge first, as the port couldn't handle the amount of current, the projector would turn on and off intermittently every few seconds, when I found out what was going on I turned it off and kept it plugged to let it to charge, that made it work. The projector doesn't come with a charger but only a usb cable, I suggest you get a proper 2A usb wall charger I got the Amazon Basics one, it works well.</span>

<span>For the price, it’s a decent projector. I bought it for outdoor use (backyard/campout). The speakers are not powerful enough for outdoor use - seems to be ok indoors. Can add separate speakers. Focus is off - can focus the middle of the picture but the outer edges are out of focus and vice-versa. But it does the job.</span>

<span>I bought this as a treat for myself as well as for use at monthly meetings that I attend and conduct where we could conduct Zoom meetings while combatting the COVID viruses.  I researched quite a few projectors but finally settled on this model due to previous reviews as well as the features offered on this unit.  for my brother as he wanted a projector for a while and glad I did as he loved the gift.<br/>This being my first personally owned projector but familiar with other units while employed (happy retiree now 😊) I am very, very impressed with the video quality which in my opinion is impeccable when I compare it to those units used while employed.  I can definitely see the difference between the antiquated models I was previously used to vs. this 1080P model.<br/>The CLOKOWE 9600L 1080P HD 5G WiFi Projector was extremely easy to set up. In less that 10 minutes I was able to start watching a movie on this projector. Once I got comfortable with the unit, which took very little time, I tried USB port &amp; wireless casting via iPhone &amp; windows laptop for playing movies.<br/>One of the other selling features for me was the fact that the unit comes with a 100-inch projection screen, but I also experimented and found that it works quite well with no blurriness when projecting on a white or very light-colored wall. The unit did an excellent job in both a darker room as well as an illuminated room.<br/>I found playing a 1080p movie to be very smooth, without any distortion or lag. I was also impressed that the pictures were clear and sharp when I tested at a screen size larger than the 100 inch screen provided. In the event that one needs to focus and make the image sharper/clearer, you can rotate the adjusting focus knob that is conveniently located on the side of the unit. I was also impressed as to how easy the menu options that are provided on the screen were very easy to navigate and use.  The built-in speakers provided more than adequate sound.<br/>To recap, I would highly recommend this unit.</span>

<span>After adjusting the picture and rearranging the movie room to get the best picture possible I was very excited and that's where the two stars come from.  Nice clear screen and good color detail. Got it to hook up to the soundbar by bluetooth and there was about a half second delay in the sound which completely ruins the experience.  I bought an analog to digital converter so I could plug it directly into the soundbar and the sound was so quiet that with the volume turned all the way up you could barely hear it.  I'm pulling my hair out at this point.  I had a cheap projector with poor picture but the sound was ten times better.  Not sure what to do.</span>

<span>I’ve had my eye on this product for some time now. I love the idea of it- all the features sound amazing and a perfect way to being in the summer. I bought this projector for something fun to do with my kids- especially in the summer watching movies outdoors and so on. It’s a pain to set up, had to download new software a few times, delete Disney+ and reinstall, I still can’t get Amazon Prime to work… let’s just say it’s a pain. I’ve spent a few hours trying to get it set up for a big movie night this evening that I am now thinking probably won’t even happen. The remote app disconnects and stops working without notice. It won’t connect to our Bose and it’s impossible to hear anything unless you have one silent child and sit right next to the device (not our case). I can’t talk about quality of the image yet because it’s still daytime and the brightness is ONLY seen if you are in a DARK setting. (I had to do the set up in my closed laundry room). Even with all the blinds closed the only way you can see the image is if you have it 12 inches from the wall to watch a mini projection- again cute but not what we purchased it for. Once you get 3 feet from the wall/screen the image is too weak &amp; dim to even see. I will try again tonight but so far this will be going back first thing in the morning! Way too expensive for what it provides. This should be $100 max.</span>

<span>cinemood is a product/company I've had on my radar for a long time. I actually was given a previous version as a gift back in the day, and left a review on that. I ended up giving that one to my cousins about a year ago (since they loved it so much).<br/><br/>But, I digress. I ended up missing the little thing so much, that I decided to buy the newer version. Ah it takes me back. This one has a lot more integration, in terms of streaming services. It used to be a much more child oriented product, and while it still is to some degree, I can watch jurassic park on it without uploading a janky file to the internal memory (thanks, nettflix!). A big plus is that the light feels different than on my laptop, like, when it isnt as bright it still looks good, and not just dim like on my laptop.<br/><br/>It has a headphone jack and you can connect it to a bluetooth speaker in addition to the built in speakers, it's very flexible in terms of audio playback. I prefer to use headphones, but when i play a movie on the ceiling at night, I'll use the on board speakers so i dont get all tangled up, with the projector sitting on the bed.<br/><br/>Anyway its lots of fun and all kinds of nifty. The price tag is steep but at the end of the day, the bottom line, buy once cry once, this is a quality product. It isn't just another gadget to be used for a week then completely forgotten about. I had the other one for a few years and I still think about it enough to buy a new one haha</span>

<span>Read it first because it has nothing to do with the seller not being nice or the product not connecting to the home wifi.  Things like that have zero to do with the product itself IMO.  Not connecting to your home wifi may or may not have anything to do with the product.  My assumption is generally that "it doesn't work on my wifi" really means "i'm a techno-novice and i couldn't figure out how to add it to my wifi".  If you generally know what you're doing then this review gives you what you really need to know.<br/><br/>1. There's a remote that generally works as expected and has basic features you'd expect.  It has an optional mouse feature you can turn on.  That can be helpful depending on which app you're using.  What it CAN'T do is turn ON the device.  The power button is only there to turn the projector off.  Turning it on can only be done on the device itself by holding the power button down for a few seconds.  Likewise, there's no restart option.  Turn it on from the device, or or turn it off from the remote.  That's it.<br/><br/>2. It's a very basic Android OS, so don't expect all the features your average smartphone has.  The app store is likewise very basic with a limited number of apps available.  Mainstream streaming apps (Netflix et al) are there, which i suppose is more than enough, and appropriate, considering it's a projector and not a tablet.<br/><br/>3. We've been having trouble with the YouTube app.  It locks up and crashes.  A lot.  Pretty obnoxious considering we use it frequently.  Once it starts crashing your only option is to power it off (from the remote) and then power it back on (from the projector).  Frustrating.<br/><br/>4. The battery life is terrible, even with the lamp brightness on the dimmest setting.  You'll generally get about 1/2 an hour of use on battery only.  We had hopes of taking it on camping trips to watch scary movies in the woods. What a bummer that was.  Plan on keeping it plugged in most of the time for everyday use, like watching movies and the like.<br/><br/>Overall i think most people will be happy with it though.  The picture isn't super high def, but it ain't shabby either.  Plus you can purchase a (up to) 150" projector screen and the image will fill the whole space. Pretty cool for a mini projector at this price.</span>

<span>I bought this projector about 6 months ago and it has been a good buy for my family. I live in a very small apartment with my small kids and husband and we never wanted our family living space to feel like it was centered on a tv. We also bought the case and a foldable screen (highly recommend).<br/><br/>For the most part it’s been an excellent solution, especially for pandemic life. I like that it’s easy to set up and take down and then it’s portable to travel with. The picture is good enough for my family and meets our needs. We mostly just use an external hard drive with movies and shows on it and that is so easy to access and use.<br/><br/>Here are the cons: after 6 months of being moved around everyday from set up and tear down, it doesn’t focus fully anymore. The right side of the image is tinged with yellow. The volume is sufficient but really you need an external speaker in many cases. I use a blue tooth speaker. Disney + is a nightmare to use on this. I’ve had to download and uninstall several times, currently it’s not on the device because it keeps telling me it needs to update and no update fixes the problem. Most times Disney+ will stop streaming, I’m sure this has to do with licensing. We’ve learned that if you download the movies from the app instead of streaming it doesn’t shut down on you. The remote is fine, but there’s certainly things that are frustrating. Some of the apps just don’t seems to want to work well/intuitively with the remote or mouse function. It’s nice that it has a phone app option for the few times that we’ve briefly lost the remote, but the app isn’t that great.<br/><br/> So, overall this is a clever little device that meets our family’s needs, but it hasn’t  handled the wear and tear of my family that great. For the cost, I wish it would stay focused!</span>

<span>This projector is absolutely brilliant. I've had it for s few months and had it practically every day.<br/><br/>It performs better than the other projectors in the $150-200 price range. It works perfectly at night and fairly well during the day with the blinds up, which is unheard of for a projector in this price range. The color contrast and to tonality is also spectacular.<br/><br/>The speaker is good but not the best. I strongly recommend hooking up a streaming device (fire stick, Apple TV) and connecting that device’s audio to a Bluetooth speaker. I currently have a fire stick connected to the projector and a Bluetooth speaker connected to the fire stick and it’s a perfect set up. I’m upgrading to a Bluetooth surround sound system next and it should still work fine.<br/><br/>The projector fan is a little noisy but not intrusive when you’re watching something. You will only notice it when nothing is playing.<br/><br/>The projector is also super light and easy to mount using a shelf or a projector bracket.

<span>Nice picture with decent settings and controls offered for a low end projector.<br/>Brightness is also decent for the price. Dim or dark only. No direct light or it'll wash out.<br/>Wifi connected fine and Netflix started right up. Chromecast execution worked perfect as well.<br/>People complain about the remote and crappy speaker but I think both are acceptable, given what this product is. It's not going to come with a back lit remote or surround sound...<br/>I use a small speaker with a cable and it sounds cool if you're just sitting there watching a movie.<br/><br/>Now for what I don't like:<br/>1. Battery is weak. Very weak. However, using a powerbank plugged into the USB C port, I was able to run the projector (fully charged) for 3 hours before both the projector battery and powerbank were both dead. That's a 12,000 MHz internal battery plus the 20,000 MHz powerbank I used. So....be prepared for this to suck your batteries dry. I had it on medium power. On high power, I'm guessing 2 hours for 32,000 MHz. So the 2.5 hour claim is maximum battery saver turned on and basically not using the projector, haha. Be prepared for 45min to an hour use for a full battery with no powerbank, on medium or high power which is almost required. Low setting in a dark room is still pretty dim looking.<br/><br/>2. If you bought this to watch videos/movies where there's no reception or wifi (camping for example) you should first confirm you have a device that supports a video out signal.<br/>Airplay isn't going to work, nor would chromecast as they need wifi. If you have an iPhone, I believe you can buy an adapter that allows you to plug in your lightening cable and have an HDMI out to the projector. That would work. I have a pixel 3 and none of the pixel devices (even the 4) offer video out, from USB C. So, you can't use a cable, nor can you use Chromecast cause there's no wifi to bridge the signal. There are some Android devices that allow video out from their USB c ports such as the Samsung 8. There's maybe 20 Android devices that allow it, so check that out. Maybe you're lucky and have a phone that'll do it. Also....the LG plus mobile app will also not work because it will also require wifi. TBH, the LG plus app is useless unless you really hate the remote and want to control the projector with your phone instead, but again... you'll need that wifi if you want to leave the remote at home. Better bring it.<br/>3. That gets us to usb/hard drive support. Yes....if you have movies, music, and pictures on a hard drive, it'll work and I'm pretty impressed by the amount of different files and codecs it supports. I have a bunch of movies in different formats: wmvs, Avis, mpgs, mkvs (Blu Ray) ECT. So far... everything plays. So now you're thinking, cool! I'll bring the projector, Bluetooth speaker, powerbank, and mini hard drive and watch movies off the drive. Not so fast! There's a bug with the projector where when you access the hard drive using the on board navigation buttons on the projector because you left your remote at home, surprise! There's no way to scroll through your movies! Once you access your folder directory on your drive with the on board buttons, the scrolling and selection don't work. The only thing you can do in this view is raise the volume up and down. So you'll need that remote when you go camping.<br/>4. Wifi direct does exist which should solve the lack of wifi issue but whenever I pair my phone with the projector, nothing improves or happens. Perhaps it's my phone or I'm doing something wrong....<br/>5. No lens cap. (?!?!!) Why the f not? It's a portable projector so that increases the likely hood of it getting scratched or dirty. I rubberband a plastic bag over it and keep it in a travelbag.<br/>6. I use YouTube TV of which does not come pre installed. Only Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu. There's an on board browser but it blocks YouTube TV when you try to login. So if you want to watch yttv or Amazon prime, you'll also need to pack that Chromecast....<br/>7. On the highest settings a few mentioned the fan is not loud but I think it is. I get 38db on my sound meter which I find distracting. Medium and low are fine and medium is usually bright enough. Small issue.<br/><br/>So....if you really want this to work in the woods with no cell reception or wifi, first confirm you have the ability to video out, from your device and see it work on something. A tv, whatever. Another option is to bring your laptop. You can do HDMI out from your laptop to the projector and use it that way. Just remember the battery issue. You're burning the laptop battery, projector battery, and the powerbank all at the same time...lol. Seems like too much effort. Or bring a generator and plug everything in! Lastly, don't forget the remote cause you'll need it for navigation based on the LG needing a firmware update to fix the lack of controls. Also, downloading Netflix movies won't work cause you'll need to run those off the USB drive but those files require the Netflix app to play. If you're someone who knows how to rip Netflix movies, of course you can go that route but you're still going to need to bring that extra stuff.<br/><br/>What this projector still needs in order for it to be a great portable projector:<br/>1. Battery power that's quadrupled (or more...)<br/>2. More on board apps preinstalled like YouTube TV, Amazon prime, and Disney plus reducing the need for Chromecast.<br/>3. An internal harddrive, allowing you to load movies, shows, documents, photos, PowerPoints, ECT onto the projector itself. Then you wouldn't need to worry about the lack of wifi and just play/display what's on the projector.<br/>4. Zoom<br/><br/>So...if you have connectivity, eithernet or wifi you should be good.<br/>If you're planning on running it with no connectivity, be sure to do a test run to make sure you have everything with you and that you'll have enough battery to pull it off.<br/>I spend my time currently staying at different places of residence so because of that, this projector works perfect for me, as opposed to dragging around a tv.</span>

<span>First time purchasing a projector. Got this, along with a screen, to set up in the backyard for movie night or events. It works great, the fan is pretty quiet, and the app options are decent. This needs to be used in a very dark room, or outside after it is almost completely dark out. This mid-level projector is not bright enough for anything else. Now, once in a dark place, the picture is great and pretty easy to bring into focus with the sliding lever. You will want to get external speakers for a good experience. The on-board speaker is probably meant to be used for a short office presentation, not movies or sports.. I tried to hook up Bluetooth speakers for stereo sound, but I couldn't get the sound and video to link up, even when using the delay feature to try to help. It is a cool feature they included, and maybe it was just my speakers as an issue. I just hook up a Bose speaker via 3.5mm connection and it works perfect. The USB and HDMI options are nice. The on-board apps are nice, but I like to hook up my FireTV stick to have all my streaming options available. The USB slot will power the FireTV stick fine. I have not tested battery length, because I use it for long periods that I know I need external power. Overall, very happy using this as outdoor entertainment or as a 2nd TV projected onto the wall inside the house (in a darker room) to watch more than one game.</span>

<span>If you want to show movies outside and not have to be tethered to power outlets, power cords, network, this is the projector to get!<br/><br/>Starting with it diminutive size, true 1080p video, ample brightness in dark settings, included battery with up to 2.5 hours of runtime (can attach power bank for even longer runtime), bluetooth audio out and USB drive input (supports most video file formats and codecs) and tripod mounting hole, this projector checks off all the boxes!<br/><br/>There is a USB port on the back of the projector, load some movies onto a USB flash drive, insert into projector, then bring up the included file browser from main menu, choose the movie to watch and that is it! Also, there is a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) port on the back of the projector, so if you have a power bank that support USB-C PD, simply connect it to the PD port on the projector, it will continue to charge the onboard battery to give even longer runtime. I found a 26,800 USB-C power bank on sale for $40 at a local big box electronics store and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>Pair this projector with a good, easy to set up portable screen and a powerful bluetooth speaker, you have your dream desert island movie theater!<br/><br/>I recommend spending a bit more to get a quality screen, and one that is super easy to set up and break down. Remember, portability and ease is the key here.<br/><br/>I found a great portable screen that has a square tubular aluminum frame that is cleverly hinged, the sturdy screen snaps onto the frame, then simply insert foldable legs Into screen and you are done. With 2 people the screen goes up in about 10 minutes or less and comes down and stowed away even quicker.<br/><br/>Also, pair it with a powerful bluetooth speaker and you truly will have a full theater experience outside under the stars. I have an Aiwa Exos-9 bluetooth speaker, it pumps out theater quality sound to go along with the vivid image from the projector. And, once paired with the LG projector, I can control the volume from the included LG projector remote, great for upping quiet parts and lowering extremely loud parts of the movie, especially if playing outside close to other homes.<br/><br/>There are other features like built in wi-fi support, Netflix, Youtube apps, but none of that concerns me as they will not be available where I will be playing my movies, on my private desert island!<br/><br/>So, if you want a truly portable projector that checks off all the boxes, get this, you won't be sorry!</span>

<span>This is my first projector experience. I had a Wowoto H9 for a very short period of time and returned it because of a critical focus issue and bought this LG PF50KA instead on flash sale. Its been about 10 days since I received it and I am generally very happy with it. No issues with uneven focus on this one. **Updated on 4th week and very important. You can adjust display option. My mistake.**<br/><br/>Pro<br/><br/>1. Its a major pro. The image quality. To begin with, 1080p (LG PF50KA) is way better than 720p (Wowoto H9).<br/>  Pixels are easily spotted on the 720p screen but 1080p is smoothly faded with no obvious pixel presence in close inspection.<br/>Brightness is really good too. Even in low light settings (in the morning with blinds, in my case when the sun is shining to the opposite direction of the projector screen from around 7am to 3pm), the image is still very bright. But when the sunlight is coming toward the screen (4pm to 7pm), it is not so favorable while still watchable. And obviously, a full light on room is not working for this projector at all and a complete dark room setting at night is the best.<br/><br/>2. Smart TV capability. Hulu and Netflix are pre-installed and available on the go. LG contents movies and dramas are easy to navigate too.<br/><br/>3. Battery capability. I haven't moved the projector from its set position yet, but I certainly think I can carry this to another room for movies or<br/>  outdoors. Not a pocket sized projector but still very much carry-able in your backpack or small designated carriers.<br/><br/>4. Wireless connectivity. Works well with my bluetooth headphone. No hassle. Haven't tested other bluetooth connections like smartphones but there are many more connectivity available via wireless.<br/><br/>Con<br/><br/>1. No longer a Con. You can adjust display such as contrast, brightness, etc. So disregard this section. **updated**<br/><br/>2. Amazon Prime video is not available on the go. The pre-installed Internet browser (Chrome)  works well but it does not support Amazon Prime video streaming. Amazon fire stick will probably allow you to watch Amazon Prime videos. I haven't tried it yet, but it should work.<br/><br/>3. Remote control could get better. I got used to it in 2 days but it seemed complicated at first. Too many buttons. Also, the buttons feel a bit too dull, making the whole menu navigation experience feel less crisp. Durability looks good instead.<br/><br/>4. No zoom in out or position change. I knew about this before the purchase and it didn't cause too much trouble, but I'd much prefer to have the feature.<br/><br/>Okay<br/><br/>1. Fan noise level is okay. When there is sound it is barely noticeable. When there is no sound, it is quite noticeable. But, it did not bother me much for 8 hour straight use even though my projector is placed right next to me. With headphones on, the fan noise is unnoticeable. You can hear the fan running on open can headphones, but only when theres no sound. Not a big problem for me.<br/><br/>2. Sound quality and loudness from this tiny projector is actually not bad. It depends on what source you are playing, but with Nintendo Switch hooked on, it gets pretty loud. The projector is set right next to my bed and if I put it over 50% loudness, I lower it down to 35% to 40% in less than 10 minutes because it hurts my ears. Nothing special but clear enough sound. Left right recognition is there, too but not great. Bass is not really there and I did not expect it to be. I think overall sound quality is okay for a small projector. Definitely acceptable. However, the internal speaker won't be good for Bluray audio or other multi channel support audio media. I played a 12GB movie and the internal speaker just sounded jammed. Foggy and very unclear. I suspect it is due to the amplified bass signals the input source is sending out. Otherwise, everything else worked just fine so far.<br/><br/>3. Built-in TV interface. Its alright. Pretty fast to go through menus. Click response time is very short and the operation software  has never been slow or draggy for me. Menus look clean and easy to navigate. Fast enough to change through differenct sources, too. Takes only 3 seconds to change from HDMI port#1 to port#2. Have not noticed any lag at all in terms of software interface. Also, the menu orders are customizable. For instance you can put Youtube 1st, HDMI#1 2nd, HDMI#2 3rd, Netflix 4th, etc. You can change pre-set display mode with short key button on the remote control. However, as I mentioned, there are too many buttons on the remote control and the buttons feel dull, rubbery, and somewhat hard. I believe it is made this way for durability, but the fast interface feels slower due to this not so snappy feeling remote control.<br/><br/>Final thoughts **updated**<br/><br/>**I could give this projector 4 stars for not having the display customization**&lt;&lt;NOT TRUE. You can adjust display attributes all you want&gt;&gt; but decided give it a 5 stars because of the flash sale (about 100 off). The preset modes aren't bad either except for the two expert mode for different room situations which I think are pretty useless. The remote control gets on my nerves but its not like they feel cheap or don't  work properly. Just lack some finesse. Overall, I am really glad I bought this 1080p projector over the 720p Wowoto H9.<br/><br/>**update**<br/><br/>I read someone's comment and realized you can adjust Contrast, Brightness, H Sharpness, V Sharpness, Color, Tint, Color Temperature, Dynamic Contrast, Super Resolution, Color Gamut, Edge Enhancer, Color Filter, Gamma, White Balance, Color Mnagement System. Wow.</span>

<span>I love this thing...  i use as a 4k pc monitor.  in game mode.  the mouse is a tiny bit laggy i get 60hz and its good enough.  Its runs hot, long throw,  but you can mount in on the ceiling.  Great remote..  I had an LG OLED tv and the remote of that also works with it.  Both are wonderful for films too.  Put a wet cloth near the fan to help use evaporative cooloing to sweat out the heat and try to vent it out somewhere.... supposedly it used 300 wattss but i blows alot of heat.  Less power  than a gaming PC and reportedly less than comparable projectors.  For the cost its really good.  im using it as 4k montior  an i can read the text even wht its tiny with glassses on...  Maybe the black levels arent great but i havent noticed that.  An OLE tv is a fixed size im getting a bigger screen and its portable.  Sure OLE is probably the best reproduction ( i though i was loking out a window once looking at an HDR film on OLED) , but i burned it in  already with edges of windwos.  you cannot move an OLED tv thats 50 inch aroudn and barely lift from room to roomm.  So highly recommended.  HDR tho is there but with windows and certain hdmi wires it seems to no have any good effect..  So im not gettign gleaming swords in newer tv products  but this is a low end device and its great.  The sound isnt half bad for a tiny speaker in there somewhere but you will need a sound system i  recomment Audioengine if you want small and clear sound.  but speaking for the brand the OLED had amazing sound i diddnt even use my studio montiors i preferred the TV sound.</span>

<span>Originally I rated this a 3 star projector. But, the execution here is truly phenomenal. The complete package comes in at one extra star. And, I've updated my prior review. After even more testing I found that the black levels are... acceptable.  It has good traits. It has bad traits. The good do outweigh the bad.<br/><br/>In short: if you intend to replace a TV with this projector, then by all means pick it up. I was sporting a 10ft screen (120" diagonal) and at first glance, with some ambient light, I was very impressed. The color is truly excellent, as others have noted. It is so excellent it shines in bright ambient light, catching the eye and filling in the image. The color is what makes this LED projector shine (pun intended). It is lovely.<br/><br/>The problems begin when you lower the lights for a bit more clarity because... well, there isn't any. The exact same image you saw with ambient light? That's nearly what you are getting when the lights are low. There isn't any extra dark hiding in the shadows. It's going to be good color and only acceptable dark forever.<br/><br/>In its favor this projector sports 30,000 hours of lamp life. This is near-TV levels of lifespan for the light source, normally the trouble area for projectors. It touts being rainbow-effect free, though I oddly thought I caught some here or there. Did I mention it has magnificent color? It has LG's WebOS built in and can capably stream many, many wonderful apps in full 4k (not Disney+ or Hulu at this time). It is light. It is svelt. It has the back-lit magic remote.<br/><br/>But, it has poor, poor black levels, requiring you to wash out the picture to bring them up in HDR (far better performance in SDR). It has decent, but not great, input lag for gaming (40+ ms for 4k, 50+ ms in SD). It isn't the greatest optically (mine had minor focus uniformity issues). It isn't truly all that bright, despite the incredible color brightness. Strangely, that will affect you more in the dark, it seemed to me, than in the daylight. Also, the brightness is more an issue with the desired size of my screen (120"). At a smaller size the brightness may be far more tolerable.<br/><br/>Like I said, it has good and bad traits. This projector is good. I preach the black levels, especially with HDR content. But, it is by no means the worst projector I have ever used.<br/><br/>4 stars,</span>

<span>Love the color, the image, the easy set up. Only had it for a week but so far so good. Hopefully it is as durable as is colorful. The only gripe I have is with the remote control. it doesn't have a way to select the Bluetooth device to connect to external speaker. It could not be done from the unit itself either. Not sure how to do that. Area of future improvement: 1. attach a handle to the unit for easier carrying. 2. provide carrying case for portability 3. have a manual 1.7 magnification adjustment knob to zoom in/out 4. built-in microphone on the remote control to do voice command instead of blutooth connect to an external google or amazon speaker/mic device 5. increase lumen to 2000 instead of 1000. 6. bult in battery to make this truly portable that could operate this device for 4 hours. I would pay $300 more for all these improvements. For now I 'm happy about this unit's picture quality and hope for a version 2 of this great projector.</span>

<span>This projector had everything that was advertised and works really well for a small apartment. The speaker system is pretty decent and with additional bluetooth connectivity, there is the option of switching to wireless headphones. There is great portability so it makes it easy to move this unit between rooms and the installation is hassle free. The picture quality is pretty great and the viewing experience is very nice in low light conditions. The intensity is 1000 lumens and that affects viewing as one would expect in moderate to well lit viewing conditions.<br/>However, what prevents me from giving it a 5-star are the following two aspects-<br/>1. There is no Netflix! That is a big minus as the purpose of having android TV is moot if you cannot access all apps that a conventional Fire stick or Roku device can do. Amazon Prime, Peacock, ESPN, Hulu, Disney+ all work really though.<br/>2. A zoom function would have been really useful, as currently, the best way to adjust picture size is by adjusting throw distance.<br/>Other minor aspects-<br/>1. Lack of lens protection<br/>2. Keystone function is average at best<br/><br/>This is my first projector so I don't have a lot of experience in this field, but the overall viewing experience has been better than what I had envisioned.</span>

<span>The sound from this system is very good given its size.  However, I connected a Home theater Dolby surround sound system to it with great results.  For a system that can be easily moved from room to room and even to the patio or garage, it produces sharp and clear picture.  The best part is that it automatically focuses when turned on.  I stream a lot of content with my FireStick on one USB input, and my Xfinity box on the 2nd USB input.  Because of its Android OS, we easily CAST what’s on our iPhones and iPads to it.  Who needs a fixed TV when you have this versatile projector that can display regular to a giant picture? Only caveat is that because it is a projector, you interrupt the picture when you walk in front of it and it is not rain-proof.</span>
