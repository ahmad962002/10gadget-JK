<span>If you are looking for a good camera this one has a good resolution, the exact quality you need in this type of viewing. Easy to use and fast on the pinpoint targeting. One future it could use in next models is an auto shut off. Battery lasts descent. Wouldn't be hard to solder in a new 18650 lithium cell with the time comes to replace the battery.</span>

<span>I am a solar consultant and battery system designer and installer for the renewable energy industry and my main purpose for purchasing this tool is to ensure there are no terminations of wiring in any of the  AC and DC sections of the equipment I install that will show an elevated temperature due to resistance at terminations or to improperly sized conductors (wiring).<br/>The HTI-19 should also be valuable to test the operating temperature of inverters, converters, and charge controllers based on the ambient temperature of the installation site.<br/><br/>I have just started my own beta-testing for the product to ensure it will meet my needs.<br/><br/>In my first test, I aimed the camera at a panelboard to determine if there were any hot spots (indicating excessive temperatures due to loose connections on the bus bar or wiring on an attached breaker).  I did find a loose AFCI breaker attachment to the bus-bar that resulted in tempertures that were 21 degrees fahrenheit  higher than any other areas in the panelboard.<br/><br/>The second test I did was in a junction box that houses control circuitry and a contactor that feeds a 2000 watt heating element in a hot water heater.  I was surprised to find that the camera was able to detect temperatures in the 140-144 degree range in this junction box.  The HTI-19 was detecting the temperature of the coil which is below all wiring on the contactor.  The coil is responsible for the electromagnetic field the allows the contactor to be energized to allow 240 volts to the 2000 watt  hot water heating element.<br/><br/>The third test I did was to see if I could locate metal trusses that are in the ceiling above my office that serve as both floor and ceiling joists.  It was rather easy to differentiate the metal studs from the rest of the structure due to the temperature differential (the studs were 9 degrees cooler that the rest of structure).<br/><br/>My only issue that I have encountered so far is the lack of the ability to attach a lanyard to the actual camera (not the case) as I will be using this camera on rooftop installations and in commercial panelboards where I do not want the possibility of inadvertently dropping the camera.<br/><br/>The HTI-I9 will also be valuable to assess a site prior to commencing work to ensure their are no thermal issues in existing equipment before work is started.  A famous adage in the electrical industry is the last electrician in to a site will get blamed for the sins of previous installations.<br/><br/>FYI, I have been looking for an IR Camera for the past 2 years and the cost of the usual suspects (Flir, Fluke, Etc.) has led me to acquire the HTI-19.<br/><br/>So far, so good, but I will update this review if I encounter any issues that make my use of the HTI-19 limited due to deficiencies.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Matthew Corona</span>

<span>I gave it all 5 stars because for the price the hti-19 is as close one could get to a 1000-2000$ unit;<br/>I know very well what I get this unit for, didn't expect to watch movies or take clear pictures on it, I build homes quite often and it does a lot of work for me on that regards.<br/>Nr one reason I got it, I had an expensive unit (won't mention brand) that got stolen and in my latest house, my hardwood installer covered one of the heat registers in one of the bedrooms and didn't want to go on a fishing expedition and try to find it blindly, this unit makes that work a  smooth experience since will give you the difference in tem, mind you, will not read thru material like drywall or hardwood, but will tell you the difference in temp with regards to these materials.<br/>Also, I happen to keep bees as well, and again, while it can't read temp thru the hive box, will tell me  the difference in temp with regards to any location of the box, hence allowing me to see where the bees are clustered without me opening the lid and cool their environment and force them to overwork to reheat their cluster, this toy does that for me and that is of great benefit to me.<br/>Hope that helps, yeah, there are people out there that might feel that they've been cheated with regards to description, but unless you know what you wanted for the value of it, don't complain for the wrong reason.<br/>Dan</span>

<span>I wanted this to track down some bad insulation, and I ws sure there would be other uses for it, I don't use it for tracking animals when it's dark. I'm not sure it would have enough range for people who want to do that. But no issues with looking at hot and cold spots on my roof from 50ft away.<br/><br/>This is my first imaging camera, and while I read up on them quite a bit, I'm still a newbie at using one. And it's also not like I've had one before, so I don't have any personal experience of features that I liked or didn't like.<br/>I had read that the higher resolution of this one at 320x240 would show detail that would lessen the need for a feature that blends a visible light image with the IR image. This camera does have that feature, but I find I rarely use it. It works, but I find that I get all the detail I need without it.<br/><br/>I'm happy with the spec, and the documentation that comes with it is adequate, but I would have liked to have had more detailed specs before I bought it. When I looked at the outside of the box, the shortest focal length for this unit was listed as 2meters and that of the HT-18 at 0.5 meters. I was concerned at this, but I find I don't have any difficulty making out detail at half a meter away, so no concerns there.<br/><br/>So like I'd imagine many people are, I've just got this, and it's  a fantastic new toy that's already been useful, so i'm 5 star happy with it. I've only given it 4 stars because even if I plan to be more expert in using one, I'm not yet. It has some features that others have complained about in other reviews. it won't record video; that doesn't seem like a problem to me. If it did, it would need more storage, and then it would cost more. I've seen complaints about the button sequence to store an image, but I really don't have a problem with it. Maybe if I knew more i would have.</span>

<span>I bought this device to help identify and troubleshoot some issues with our hydronic radiant heated floors. The images were ultimately really helpful. But the device did not fit securely on my phone through my phone's case, even when I fully extended the device's "lightning connector."  I had to hold the device onto my phone, both so that the device would actually interface and connect with my phone and to ensure that the device would not fall from my phone and break.  My case isn't particularly thick, so that was a bit of a surprise.  Also, the battery life of the device was shockingly bad.  I let it charge for upwards of three hours before I first used it, and it was almost out of charge with just 15 minutes.  Those two problems were immediately apparent and "deal breakers" for me, so I returned the product promptly after I tried it.<br/><br/>Also, I’d thought that a representative of the company had told me that this particular model can measure specific temperatures at two or three different points, which is the primary reason I chose this model over the lower-priced models.  During my brief period with this product, I couldn’t figure out how to modify the settings so that it would measure the temperature at more than one point.  I’m not sure if I got bad information about the product's functionality, whether the product was glitchy, whether the product's settings simply aren't very user friendly or intuitive, or whether it was just user error on my part.  Ultimately, the single-point measurement would've been fine for my purpose anyway, and I probably would've overpaid for the product with that feature.</span>

<span>In addition to the FLIR One Pro, I’ve used the FLIR E5-XT, FLIR TG 165, and Seek Compact Pro all within the last several months.<br/><br/>My primary application is for assessing medium-sized electronics. The Seek represents a great value with high thermal resolution and captures relatively crisp thermal-domain images, but the app is of limited functionality and awful support. It's been a great tool but desperately needs updating. I keep an old Pixel phone only so that I can continue using the Seek.<br/><br/>The handheld FLIR E5-XT was a decent camera, but was very expensive and offered limited functionality. Images were inferior to the inexpensive Seek. I don't think it could capture video. It came with a nice case and seemed to be a durable unit.<br/><br/>The TG 165 was marginally more than a toy. The camera offered shockingly little in terms of functionality. No custom scaling could be applied to the images, and the single indicated measured temperature was not aligned with the image, making it basically useless for anything other than finding massive air leaks in residential applications.<br/><br/>The FLIR One Pro has been the best of all of these, independent of price. I bought an iPod Touch to dedicate to the thermal camera. The accuracy of the temperature values are not great and they do shift around during use - 5 to 10C of error between 0 and 100C is typical. This isn’t a deal breaker for me; if I need a precise reference, I can keep ice water or boiling water in the frame. The app has a fantastic amount of functionality, permitting the use of multiple manual measurement points, manual temperature range scaling, and selective use of the optical and thermal cameras.  It’s great for transient measurements and has been an indispensable tool for my applications.</span>

</ul>

The FLIR TG165-X dramatically reduces inspection and diagnostic time by helping you visually pinpoint the source of electrical, mechanical, and HVAC/R system faults. Instead of searching for temperature anomalies with a single-spot IR thermometer, this non-contact temperature measurement and imaging tool displays a thermal picture of your target including any hot spots or cold zones that could indicate a problem. See wires or components clearly and even read labels thanks to FLIR patented MSX image enhancement, which adds visual details to full thermal images. The bullseye laser helps ensure you’re always targeting the right component for measurement while the drop-tested, portable design with easy-to-use buttons and settings help you complete the job quickly and stress-free. With internal storage for up to 50,000 images and rechargeable Li-ion battery, the FLIR TG165-X is ready to go right out of the box.

<span>I've been utilizing this after a heavy rainstorm to see how bad and the extent of the water intrusion through one of my windows.

<span>The camera picture and thermal image do not overlap. so if you are looking at a glass of water. you can see two glasses. Yes! a double image which confuses me. This seems a software calibration problem. 3D imaging cameras that use multiple cameras have a way of solving this through their software by combing the images into one.  Unfortunately, FLIR thermal camera images do not do this.  Another caveat is that you have to pay $199 subscription to use their software to manipulate images. The free version is pretty useless.<br/><br/>*Update: I had to call the manufacturer to figure out the horizontal ghost image. You can correct this using the image adjustment option in the menu. Access image adjustment, access MSX menu and then press the center button again until it shows MSX ON at the top with up down arrow. If you press the up down arrow (rubber keys) at this point, the image will adjust horizontally. Once it's aligned to your satisfaction for the normal distance you will use it for, press the center button again. And that is it! If your image is ghosting vertically, the unit is faulty according to the manufacturer. One star down for not including a detailed manual. You can access the manual online perhaps.</span>

<span>I'll keep this short and sweet:<br/>1.  Unlike what is mentioned in the description, this device ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT MEASURE BODY TEMPERATE AND CAN'T BE USED FOR SUCH.  THAT IS A BLATANT LIE.  You can adjust emissitivity but there is no setting for the temperature range mentioned.  You 'can' measure body temp but it will not be accurate nor consistent.<br/>2.  This is a good (and fun) camera.  I've been "ghost hunting" all over the house with the grandkids.  With some planning, you can leave heat signatures behind and then "find" them later, spooking everyone.  I seem to have odd hand prints on the wall and people sitting in chairs when nobody is there.  Oooooo, scary.<br/>3.  It can detect animals in the dark.  From about 30' I picked up a rabbit in my back yard.  The best night setting seems to be arctic or black hot for this.<br/>4.  It has good detail and lets you see what your looking at from a reasonable distance.  Of course there is no zoom so this will work well for looking at a breaker box but the little rabbit I mentioned earlier was just a little dot.  In my breaker box I could see how much energy my two water heaters were drawing.  Yikes!<br/>5.  Being able to blue tooth the picture to the phone is great.  You can use the software to prepare a report and send to a customer (or whomever) or take a pic of your overheating AC system and send it to your HVAC guy.  Wonderful.<br/>6.  You can check for air leaks, cold and hot spots and window efficiency.  You can see water lines though walls, check coils on freezers and refrigerators, check for blockages on car radiators or condensers and so on.  You can even see the inefficiency of your doors.  It's like having X-ray vision!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I don't have that many but one seems to stand out.  It is laggy.  The picture produced is a real-time picture with a thermal overlay and these can misalign easily.  Sometimes when moving the device, the picture will move but the thermal will lag and you have to wait for it to catch up.  It also washes out easily.  If you're checking the house and come across a light source, which will be amplified through the thermal cam, it will wash out and you have to wait for it to reset.<br/>I have both the 165 and the 267 and the 267 is the better purchase, even valuable for the casual user like myself.</span>

<span>To reduce expenses and to help protect the environment, in early 2021 our household started taking a number of measures to cut our energy consumption. Those measures have proven successful: total 2021 electricity consumption in our single-family, detached home in the US SE was about 8,000 kWh (3,200 of which was for HVAC), compared to about 11,000 kWh annual average in previous years.<br/><br/>We first used our Klein Tools TI250 Rechargeable Thermal Imager to identify where our home’s protective envelop was weak – places where we were losing heat / allowing cold air inside in the winter and losing cool air / allowing heat inside in the summer. The imager revealed problem areas we had suspected, e.g., around windows and doors – areas where we needed to improve weatherstripping. But above all they highlighted an extremely acute problem we hadn’t focused on, namely the 7 recessed lights in our kitchen. In summer, and with those lights off, the thermal imager showed the lights as 7 ultra-bright, fiercely orange circles, though the ceiling all around (under thick insulation) was deep, cool blue. It was ugly, indicating that we had been wasting massive amounts of energy and money for years. We solved this problem (along with a similar problem associated with bathroom fans installed between ceiling and attic) by installing FF130E Recessed Light Covers: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XVPUAO  These were easy to put in, sealed with Great Stuff: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KSANBTY<br/><br/>We continue to use the thermal imager from time to time around our house to make sure everything is OK, and we lend it to family and friends.<br/><br/>On a sunny day, when pointing the camera toward the outside through a window, we got an interesting, rather spooky surprise. The naked eye revealed no reflection at all in the sun-filled window, but the thermal imager revealed our own images, clear as could be, standing there in that same window, waving at us when we waved at them.<br/><br/>Here are some other products we purchased at Amazon that we can recommend to those interested in cutting home energy consumption:<br/><br/>Aootek solar lights 120 LEDs with lights reflector, 270 degree Wide Angle, IP65 Waterproof, Security Lights for Front Door, Yard, Garage, Deck (4 pack): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NQ4L1SB , as well as Solar Lights Outdoor,WWimy 210 LED 2500LM Motion Sensor Lights with Remote Control, 3 Heads Security LED Flood Lights, IP65 Waterproof, 270° Wide Angle Illumination Wall Lights with 3 Modes (2 Packs): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08T9F2MM1  Purchased in August 2021, these lights continue to work well here in the SE, saving us over 150 kWh/year. We shared some of these lights with relatives in the North; they also report that their lights are going strong after a rough winter.<br/><br/>STATINT Window Film Privacy One Way Daytime Mirror Static Non-Adhesive Solar Glass Film Heat Control: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W3VCZNF  Dramatically reduces amount of direct sunlight, gives privacy by day, and protects from shattering.<br/><br/>Kuman KW47-US Electricity Usage Monitor Plug Power Watt Voltage Amps Meter with Digital LCD www.amazon.com/Electricity-Monitor-Voltage-Overload-Protection/dp/B07DPJ3RGB  Looking back, we can say that purchasing a Usage Monitor Plug has been one of our wisest and most useful moves, and a very inexpensive one at that.<br/><br/>AcuRite Wireless Indoor Outdoor Temperature and Humidity Sensor: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T0K8NXC We got two of these to go with our AcuRite weather station. They allow us to monitor temperature and humidity in four places at once: outside, in our living room, in our crawlspace, and in our unfinished attic. Thanks to these readings, we have established a smarter, more energy-efficient way of ventilating our crawlspace. They also helped us see that our attic needed additional ventilation in the roof, prompting us to purchase the following.<br/><br/>4 SEASONS Solar Powered Polycarbonate Vent, Weatherproof Design, Quietly Cools Up to 500 Sq Ft, 400 CFM: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DMSCPJA<br/><br/>RYB HOME Room Darkening Patio Door Curtain, Hanging Room Divider Screen Insulated Drapes Privacy Wall Panel: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D32DJ2V , as well as RYB HOME Blackout Curtains &amp; Drapes - Total Privacy Thermal Efficiency Backdrop Curtains for Bedroom Room Divider Vertical Blind Living Room Patio Sliding Glass Door: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077SZRBNJ<br/><br/>Grandekor Blackout Window Blinds and Shades Cordless Cellular Shades: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NWBGVL3</span>

<span>I recently purchased the Flir C3-X to replace my older model C2. While you do need to set up an online Flir account , it does make file transfer painless as long as you have Wifi you're good to go when on the road. If anything it comes with the USB cable included. View, edit, download your photos where ever, pay nothing extra. When using the online software Flir Ignite you do need to consent to roughly two requirements, pretty standard, nothing crazy as others described with the C5 series. Recommended warm-up times is roughly 5 minutes once you power it up but, this device is pretty fast and much faster than my older C2.<br/><br/>Yes, you own your photos as well, read the fine print! I'm a home inspector and I do use my thermal cams often. Perfect size, priced right for a brand name thermal camera, picture quality is great for my use of the device. Touchscreen options has just what you need, can even edit photos right on the cam and add names, location to each photo.<br/><br/>Product also came with a pouch, durable lanyard, USB cable, 3 month trial of Flir Thermal studio which is different from the Flir Ignite I mentioned above. This appears to be for those that need to do a lot more with the thermal images such as thermal reports on Flir templates. Received my order the next-day, well packaged, no damage to box or device. Being my second C series thermal device, I would recommend.</span>

<span>When my FLIR One Pro recently died, I thought I'd "upgrade" to the C5. Unfortunately the C5's few advantages are outweighed by its disadvantages in my application.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Great battery life compared to the FOP<br/>- Feels like a "real" camera, not always fumbling with an awkward phone attachment<br/>- The auto-seek spot measurement is awesome - it automatically goes to the hottest spot in the frame and reports the temperature, as opposed to the FOP where you have to manually put a spot marker wherever you want to measure.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- There is no distance adjustment for MSX parallax, and the minimum range to get the MSX to line up is about 3 feet, rendering this camera completely useless for circuit board work. Probably OK for HVAC or electrician stuff, but a total show-stopper for me.<br/>- In order to get pictures out of it and onto a computer, you have to create a "FLIR Ignite" online account, upload pictures there, go to the website, navigate to wherever they are in the folder hierarchy, and download. With the FOP, I just go to the Camera app and AirDrop to my MacBook - WAY better.<br/>- The user interface is in its own way pretty much just as crappy as that of the FOP. I'd hoped for better, since it's ostensibly a more deluxe product.<br/>- The camera body is surrounded by a synthetic rubber "soft-feel" coating. Straight out of the unopened box, there was cardboard dust stuck all over it. If you have owned other products with a similar coating, you know that it's only a matter of time (3-5 years typically) before the whole thing degrades into a gooey mess.</span>

I can see things I could not otherwise see and that expands my abilities for maintenance, repairs, and other efforts. Plus the curiosity of seeing that a cold-blooded frog doesn't show up and other natural science observations are great.<br/>I have used this for:<br/>1. Indoor ceiling to identify poor insulation locations<br/>2. Identify within seconds if an air conditioner is working<br/>3. See the temperature gradient in compost bin<br/>4. See that a frog is in fact cold-blooded<br/>5. Check the circuit breaker panel in the house<br/>6. Look at warm footprints on the carpet<br/>7. Identify wet spots, water evaporates in the 40s<br/>8. Identify lost energy in ceiling light fixtures, wiring, plug adapters, paper shredders on standpipe, audio and video equipment on standby, because if it's turned off and it shows as warm, it is consuming electricity<br/>9. Inspect heating on electrical circuits for hobbies<br/><br/>[Above added 8/20/2022]<br/>I very much appreciate that the Flir ONE properly orients the app when the phone is held upside down. It is more comfortable to hold the phone upside down.<br/><br/>The occasional auto calibration is a bother, but mostly would be a sticking point for video recording, the camera is just as useful with this auto calibration.<br/><br/>It has estimated the temperature of my hand at 102°F or higher without a fever and it has estimated the temperature of frozen food (boxed food) at -2°F(seems right) in my freezer side-by-side. I don't know if I can tune that to be more accurate.<br/><br/>I can see where evaporative cooling is happening, immediately the warm footprints from my dog on the carpet, warm breakers or unused doorbell transformer (wasted electricity), and much more.<br/><br/>This review was written with less than 3 hours of use. Setup was simple.</span>

<span>I got this thermal camera for finding hot spots in my home. It works great. I found 2 breakers that were heating up with no apparent load. I replaced them and that solved my breaker tripping issue. On a hot day I used my flir to see how much heat my attic was holding during the day. I have installed a gable fan and that has taken a major heat load off the house. These are things I kind of already knew to be issues but having the thermal image really drives home the heat gains or loss that you can't  see. I would highly recommend this to people with older homes that want to do energy audits to see where you are losing heat or gaining heat depending. This winter I plan on taking this under my crawl space to find some leaks in my duct work that seem to be elusive to me.  This is definitely a tool every HVAC Electricial and possibly plumbing contractor should have on hand.<br/>Now alot of people complain about the resolution of the thermal image. If you expect to pick out individual squirrels in a tree at 100 yards this thermal images is not for you and it is not advertised to do so. I gave seen you tube reviews saying this imager is trash but the reviewers are usually trying to use it in ways that it was not designed for.<br/>Well anyway I like mine it works as advertised. Just make sure you keep it charged.</span>

<span>Review of the MR77: I use this instrument professionally and debated on it and a few other moisture meters.  Our office utilized Delmhorst and Protimeter moisture meters, so was able to compare this model with those.  I have been using this instrument for moisture mapping for about a month at the time of this review.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Very good build quality.  The instrument feels very solid in the hand and feels high quality.<br/>2. Measurements (relative humidity, temperature, scanning moisture, direct reading moisture) all appear very accurate in multiple situations.  No lab quality testing but am able to compare to other instruments.<br/>3. Can confirm device functions with Flir tools app on iOS.<br/>4. Condensation function of this device very helpful.<br/>5. The MR77 uses a 9volt battery and battery life is amazing.  I also use a FlirONE for thermal, so the other newer moisture meters from Flir were less appealing.  Note we also use numerous Fluke IR cameras for moisture mapping.<br/>6. Price is actually a plus.  This is a well made professional device that combines many meters in one device.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. iOS Flir Tools app needs some work and crashes often for me and other investigators.  Not a con on the device.<br/>2. Compared to other manufacturers, FLIR does not specify what is considered dry, borderline, and wet.  The flexibility allows the user to set alarms for those readings.  However, in professional work it is often helpful for the manufacturer to offer guidance on that for most materials so this can be quoted in reports as backup to inspector interpretation.  While I understand the decision from Flir, it would be difficult to adopt this device without the ability to cross reference the Flir MR77 readings against other moisture meter readings.<br/><br/>Summary, great device.</span>

<span>Used the unit for inspection inside vehicle structure looking for corrosion and damage. Pucture quality is good and the coaxial lighting does a good job with illumination. Needed a mirror accessory to see at a right angle, but there doesn't seem to be one for this diameter camera, only the larger one, which is the primary reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. The Bluetooth sync worked well with both Android and Apple tablets or cell phones and the length and flexiblility prooved to be very acceptable for the application of weaving through internal vehicle structure for 3 or 4 feet.

<span>The tip of the camera snake is not smooth and flat.  Instead there is a slight rim extending out, surrounding the lens.  The result is that when using the camera in a plumbing drain pipe, the rim acts like a little shovel, scraping the goop off the sides of the drain pipe and covering the lens and the LEDs.  if you are going to use this tool in situations where there is any kind of contamination (sand, dirt, drain goop, etc.) be sure to buy a jumbo box of Q-Tips.  You will need them early and often for lens cleaning.  Repeated cleaning like this has he potential to scratch the almost-certainly-plastic window covering the lens and LEDs.  We'll see.</span>

<span>Neat toy, You point the device at for instance your wall and it sends a green light to indicate where its measuring.<br/><br/>When you scan over a temperature variation the color of the LED changes either to red to indicate it senses a higher temp or purple to indicate a lower temp at the same time you get a the temperature displayed on the units LCD screen.<br/><br/>A few years ago I had a company run CAT5, coax and a a ton of Siemens wire for some security cameras along with satellite TV an alarm and some updated phone lines. Well it turns out that in the process of running all that cable they made a TON of air leaks everywhere.<br/><br/>Found a spot where when they drilled through the fire stop they messed up the insulation and that area was 10 degrees warmer than the surrounding areas you could feel the heat coming in from the outlet they put there.<br/><br/>While playing with the scanner I noticed that the Smarthome keypadlincs and other smarthome light switches I have generate a TON of heat!<br/><br/>For instance a keypadlinc that is a x10 transmitter only read 85.5 degrees compared to the surrounding wall that was 9 degrees cooler.<br/><br/>A keypadlinc that contains a built in dimmer measured 95.37 degrees. Compare that to a normal electrical switch that generates no heat and uses no electricity to sustain itself.<br/><br/>Now your thinking thats cool but how does that affect me?<br/><br/>Well heat is power loss regardless of whether you are talking about loss through the transfer of from inside to outside the home or heat created by the consumtion of energy it all cost you money.<br/><br/>I really need to look into how much its costing me just to have these smarthome switches in place. If they are generating that much heat are they consuming 3-5 watts per hour? multiply that by 15 switches in the house over the course of a year and that adds up! The question then becomes does the convenience of being able to control multiple lights from 1 switch outweight the annual cost? Don't know yet.<br/><br/>This thing has tons of uses from measuring how inefficient your insulation is to seeing where your air conditioner and furnace ducts are not properly sealed, were hot water pipes aren't insulated properly (mine aren't at all yet)or just which windows aren't properly sealed.<br/><br/>I should point out that the family is a bit ticked off at me lately as I have been walking around the house pointing this thing at everything. I made my older son unplug his cell phone &amp; tooth brush charger because they were generating heat and consuming energy I put a power strip on our loft TV which rarely gets used but yet the tv, receiver, subwoofer cable box and dvd player were once again all generating heat all using electricity even though they were turned off. (even in standby the cable box was generating INSANE heat 92 degrees IN STANDBY!!)<br/><br/>I also ordered a P3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor from amazon that hasn't come yet but with that I will get a dollar amount on how much energy we are wasting.<br/><br/>As a final note the reason I am going through all this trouble? Well last months electric bill was $375 and I almost popped my pants well this months bill? $482.00!! Yeah i did %^$% my pants!<br/><br/>Personally, I thought we were ok energy wise, every bulb in the house is either florescent or LED, the only halogen bulbs I have are some landscape lights (300 watts worth) but these last two months have opened my eyes.<br/><br/>Next few months I'll be making changes so that I will never see any more bills like those.</span>

<span>I wanted a remote-measuring thermometer for checking my home for hot spots (in summer) or cool spots (in winter).  This one is great! It couldn't be simpler to use, and it's very accurate.<br/><br/>It projects a green, red or blue spot onto the wall or other surface being measured. The green spot represents the baseline temperature of a wall or other surface measured when the unit is powered on. The spot turns to red when scanning a surface that is hotter than the baseline temp, or blue when scanning a surface cooler than the baseline temp. The colored spot makes it really quick and easy to scan for hot and cold areas, since you don't need to pay close attention to the actual temperature reading until you find a zone of interest. At first I thought that the colored spot might just be a gimmick, but, in practice, I have found it to be a really useful feature.<br/><br/>My background is in science and engineering, so I appreciate instruments that are accurate and work well. I checked this thermometer against several others that I know are accurate and it consistently agrees with the others +/- 2 degrees or better. This is within the specs for this device, and pretty good for under $30.<br/><br/>Be aware though, that this unit remotely measures the temperature of surfaces, so it is not a good choice for medical use, for cooking and for other jobs where you need to measure internal temperatures. That said, it will measure the temperature of your skin pretty accurately. It will not accurately measure the temperature of shiny or transparent surfaces, but you can stick a piece of masking tape or duct tape on the surface and measure that.<br/><br/>It's so sensitive that it will easily measure the residual heat left by my bare foot standing on a cool wood floor. Leave your foot in place for a minute or so, so that the temperature of the floor is increased by your warm foot. Move your foot away, then measure the temperature at the spot where your foot was, and the surrounding floor. The red LED light will light up when the thermometer is aimed at the outline of your foot, but will turn to green for the surrounding area. (Note: this probably will not work for concrete floors, since they will not warm up enough).<br/><br/>You start by aiming the unit at a reference surface, such as a wall, to establish a baseline temperature. (Note: a switch in the battery compartment sets either Farenheit or Celsius for the readings) Then you can select one of three ranges: +/- 1F*, +/- 5F* or +/- 10F*. (.5, 3.0, 5.5 C)  I like to start out with 10F*, since that will quickly let you zero in on any serious hot or cold spots. Spend your time fixing those spots first, and you'll get the best bang for your buck. After those spots are fixed, or if you don't find any in the ten-degree range, then move to the 5-degree range and repeat.<br/><br/>Aside from its real value in finding and fixing thermal leaks, this thing is a heck of a lot of fun just to play with. My grandkids had fun searching for hot and cold things around the house.  On the 5-degree setting, you'll find that just about anything that runs on electricity and stays on all the time (clocks, power cubes, etc.) will turn the LED to red. A/C ducts will turn the LED to blue if cool air is coming out.</span>

<span>I am a home inspector by trade and I like this camera for #1 portability.  I keep it on my tool belt so I can look at items without having to go back to the truck.  #2 ease of use, the temp range is right on the screen and is easy to read.  And the target temp is captured along with a floating target to really capture what you are looking at.  And to complete my top 3 reasons why I like this is the brand.  Flir is a trusted name and they have been an industry leader in testing equipment.</span>
