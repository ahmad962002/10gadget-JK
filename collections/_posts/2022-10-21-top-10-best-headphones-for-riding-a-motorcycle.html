<span>We have had our set for 3 years now, and we have misplaced the charger(s). I reached out to their customer service to ask what type of charger since it only says what the new style is on the current listing. They are going to send me a charger! I can't thank them enough!! We love the headsets anyways, this makes them, and their company even better! 10/10, would buy again!</span>

<span>I ride a CBR 954rr w/yoshi pipe for reference. Fairly loud.<br/><br/>Sound -  I bought this model based on other Amazon reviews. I must say I'm surprised how well I can hear sound while connected to my phone wether it be a call or music. You do not hear wind noise through the mic in a full face helmet, however you will hear your engine, but it isn't enough to be a bother. I'm not sure if there is some issue that I am causing but if I connect the two devices to each other the voice volume is fairly quiet although much more clear than a phone call, I have to pull the clutch to kill my RPMs to hear my passenger, but if we connect the devices to our phones and use a call the voice volume is almost doubled. If I can figure that little quirk out (which maybe that's just how it is) this would be A++ for the price. And to be honest.. if you aren't riding/driving a loud-ish vehicle this IS A++ for the price.<br/><br/>Mounting - It comes with velcro on all inside-helmet pieces which allow you to quickly attach and de attach without problem to most helmet lining fabric. It also comes with attachable velcro incase you need it. The main outside unit can either be held in place by velcro or a plate with screws. I am apparently not smart enough to see how you could ever use the plate on a full face helmet so I opted for the velcro. It is very sturdy and I'd trust it will never fall off. Wires easily hidden behind helmet padding. Total installation on both helmets was maybe 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Operation - Not much to say here. Power button (power, modes, connect). Phone button (Answer/hang up), and volume buttons (tap to change song or long press for volume adjustment.)<br/><br/>All in all a great product for $100.</span>

<span>Easy to install and worked well for a bit. Both headsets quit working after less than 6 weeks. If you get these buy the protection plan. I did not and know I’m out of luck.</span>

<span>My son and I installed these for dirt bike trail riding.  Used them once so far.  They work well for the price, not quite loud enough for a dirt bike (my ears are pretty old though) but better than nothing!  Only real complaint is common on the reviews:  the sync up for intercom is not easy and has to be redone every time you turn them on and also if you get out of range, even if only for a brief time.  The latter isn't a problem unless you exceed 150-200 yards. We have Scala riders for the street bikes that dont ever require re-sync but are more $$... Phone syncs with no trouble.  I will update after a few rides but they sure beat me looking over my shoulder to see if he's still with me or yelling over engine noise!</span>

And the design of the SPH10 allows for a stable and secure fit for almost any active condition. Bluetooth 3.0 technology provides the capability to listen to and share music with the use of Bluetooth playback controls and offers Multipoint Bluetooth technology for dual mobile phone usage.

Also, each audio source has its own independent volume level you can adjust for an improved riding experience. Even if your companions don't have Sena gear, the SPH10 uses the Universal Intercom protocol, which allows your gear to work with their gear, regardless of brand. The SPH10 is fully water resistant for use in any condition, and you'll get up to 10 hours of talk time and seven days of stand-by on a single charge. All registered Sena owners get access to free firmware upgrades, which ensure your unit is always operating with the latest software updates.

<span>I bought a pair of these headsets to use on my sailboat. Sailors refer to this type of device as "marriage savers", because they eliminate for the need for one spouse to yell instructions to the other spouse when on opposite ends of the boat, as in anchoring.<br/><br/>Here are my complaints: First, the units aren't terribly well-built. They are made of plastic that feels a bit flimsy. Second, the fit-and-finish is not very good. It is very difficult to seat the microphone in the headset unit, and I am unable to install the included rubber earpads onto the headset unit. Without them, the unit would be pretty uncomfortable. Third, the documentation is poor quality, with little or no guidance on setting up the unit, such as how to install the rubber earpieces. I haven't even gotten to pairing the two units together, and I have put over an hour into the setup. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>I have put in a tech support request to the manufacturer, and that was a pain in the neck. The support form demands all sorts of personal information that is not at all relevant to support, but which probably can be sold to others. I'll see what response I get. If it's not an improvement over what I have experienced so far, these things are going back to the seller.<br/><br/>If I get past these problems, I will update my review. I'm hopeful that they will work, since there are very few products like this on the market. A great idea, poorly executed.<br/><br/>UPDATE 05/02/2019<br/>I have raised my rating by two stars, mainly because once I got past a particular problem, setup took five minutes.<br/><br/>My problem was with the rubber earpads that come with the unit. I finally reached customer support, and their advice was dead wrong. I'm going to explain why it doesn't work, and then I'm going to explain how to make it work. These are instructions the manufacturer should provide.<br/><br/>The rubber earpads come stretched over a plastic frame the same size as the earpiece. Carefully remove the foam pad from the earpiece. You will see a small speaker unit with three slots. The plastic frame that holds the rubber earpad has three corresponding tabs. Tech support said to push the plastic frame onto the earpiece, so that the plastic tabs on the frame go into the slots in the speaker, then twist clockwise to lock them in. I tried for an hour to make that work, with no luck.<br/><br/>In desperation, I tried taking the rubber earpad off its plastic frame, so that I could see the tabs and get them lined up correctly. Doing that, it became obvious that the two plastic pieces simply could not fit together, and it occurred to me that the rubber earpad could go directly over the speaker frame. Voila! It fit perfectly. I took the foam pad I had removed from the earpiece and carefully stretched it back over the rubber earpad. I repeated the process for the other earpiece, and the problem was solved.<br/><br/>I bought two of these units, intending to pair them together. The pairing is well-explained in the downloadable User Guide--much better than the paper quick-start that ships with the unit. It took only thirty seconds or so to pair the units, and it worked on the first try. So, now I'm in business.<br/><br/>I am still of the opinion that this product is a great idea with a questionable execution and really poor technical support. But the workaround on the earpads got me over my biggest problem and, nw that the units are working, I think my wife and I will like them. We'll see how they hold up and, if I run into problems, I'll update this review.</span>

<span>Wish we bought them 2 years ago. They are excellent at helping boat captain and crew communicate in difficult times when you cannot see or hear each other. Great sound quality. Not as comfortable on the ears as If like but we usually wear them for short periods.</span>

<span>These are some versatile BT headphones!<br/><br/>I need to connect in the following ways, and these fit the bill so far:<br/><br/>+BT to computer for music, video work, and occasional computer-based phone calls, with ability to roam around home or office beyond the 30 foot range of class 2 BT devices without loosing connection<br/>+BT to phone for both music and calls<br/>+Mulitpoint connection so I can receive calls while doing video work or listening to Rhapsody or Sirius/XM online<br/><br/>Note that I did not purchase these for use on a motorcycle (that was many years ago for me) or during sports (use the excellent, sturdy and very light weight Sennheiser PMX-680's), which are a couple of the target usage scenarios for which the SPH10's are designed, so won't be commenting on these applications.  I do, however, plan to wear these on my boat when it's just me cruising the lake!<br/><br/>Wow do these have range when coupled with a Class 1 BT transmitter, e.g., </span>

<span> which I am using on my laptop!  I can reach every corner our house that is above ground, and can even walk out to the mail box at the street without loosing the music stream!  They start to break up when I enter my garage (concrete walls and steel doors), but that is no surprise.  Excellent, and better than the other Class 1 options I've tried, the Motorola 705 class one BT receiver (plug in your own headphones), and the Jabra Motion UC MS class 1 BT headset </span>

<span>.<br/><br/>Sound is solid, and improves considerably as you break these in.  They are admirably detailed, but the bass takes a while to come on and is still improving as I listen to these more.  Out of the box, the mid/vocal range is more pronounced, but with listening hours the response levels out considerably.<br/><br/>The SPH10's are also fairly comfortable, some of the more comfortable full headphones I've worn, though not perfect nor great with my glasses.  I strongly prefer the behind the neck style anyway, and these seem to be pretty well designed, carrying the size and weight of these headphones better than one might expect.  For me there is a pressure point that gets a bit numb right above each ear where the headband grips, so my limit is a couple hours before adjusting/taking a break.  Rotating the neck band down as far as it would go on my neck helped a bit.  I'm using the flat foam covered ear pieces.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>+ OUTSTANDING range when coupled with class 1 BT transmitter, 80-100 feet or more in my home.  One of the only BT class 1 headsets available!<br/>+ Very good music quality, though not the best I've heard, quite acceptable, and improves with break-in time<br/>+ Multipoint connection works with my computer and phone<br/>+ tough-looking funky but practical design<br/>+ love the jog dial for volume etc.!<br/>+ big, easy to use phone button<br/>+ charges with standard micro USB connection<br/>+ versatile options - water resistant, two different interchangeable boom microphones (and I bet they would work with some other mics I own), long range intercom with other SPH10s, wired audio input and upgradable firmware<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>- minus one star for the weak bass and limited comfortable wearing time<br/>- not huge, but kinda a big, and very industrial looking.  Again, I like this, but sleek they are not.<br/>- glasses have to ride on top of (not under) ear hooks to be comfortable, at least for me, limits comfortable wearing time<br/>- bass is weak compared to alternatives<br/><br/>Will be using these in other situations, and will update this review with any significant new learning.<br/><br/>So far, highly recommended, especially if you need the range and versatility!</span>

<span>This is the 4th sph10 we have purchased.  The first one, owned over 8 years, died after going swimming in salt water.  Yes, there is a story to that.  The partner unit did have a failure of the arms of the headset.  My husband is now more careful with headset number 3 and we now have the remains from the saltwater soaked one to fix any broken arms.  With the instructions printed out  I was able to reset the configuration on headset #3, then pair it with headset #4.  It took me a few minutes of careful reading regarding how long to  push buttons.  The both work well together.  We love the hands free for handling lines on the boat.</span>

<span>Tried to use this with a Smith Vantage MIPS helmet and the thickness of these headphones is too thick. Uncomfortably thick. TBF, Smith did change up the shape of their drop-in space to work with the Aleck 006, so that may have caused part of the issue. I was unable to get them positioned to where it didn't hurt my ears after a few minutes.<br/><br/>The sound was meh. The description states big bass, but these sounded more akin to a couple of small Bluetooth speakers placed up against your ears. For $40 or $50 USD it's tolerable, but don't expect massive sound quality.<br/><br/>The description also states "Headphone can be charged directly without pulling off from helmet". There is *no way* this is possible, at least not in the Smith helmet I tried.<br/><br/>They did pair easily and were simple to use. If they work with your helmet and are looking for something cheap to provide noise while you ride, these will do the trick. Otherwise, spend the money and get something a bit nicer.</span>

<span>The speakers themselves fit barely into my Smith helmet.  Once inside, they disappear nicely and the cord tucks behind the helmet adjustment hardware.  They are not easy to use through the speaker pockets.  My gloves could fell the buttons but couldn't activate them half the time.  I would have to take a glove off and use a pinching motion to activate the headphones through the pocket materiel.  During a phone call, the microphone is almost useless through a wind.  I had to put my hands up in front of my face to block my helmet and redirect the sound to the microphone. Once out of the wind, the sound quality to the microphone was passable.  Had plenty of battery for all day use.  Charging time was fairly quick.  Overall, does the job.  Not as convenient as I had hoped.</span>

I'm sure when I use this again, which I will, I'll figure that out and it won't be a problem going forward.</span>

<span>Comfort: the speaker is just thick enough to apply enough pressure on the ear to become uncomfortable after a while.<br/>Sound quality: tinny with adequate mid-range and bass.<br/>Ease of use: difficult to find the buttons for volume control and track selection. The button for powering on/off, voice assistant, pausing/taking calls is very easy to use. Voice assistant is sometimes tough to activate. Often takes several tries.<br/>Biggest annoyance is the auto power-off after a short 5 minutes. It’s not mentioned in the description and only became aware after a follow-up email from the manufacturer before my first use. Not convenient if you like to turn music off during lift rides or for conversations. Very annoying.</span>

When paired with a Bluetooth-enabled phone, it'll also let you make hands-free calls. The SMH10 features a Helmet Clamp Kit and Boom Microphone. The Jog Dial makes for an intuitive user interface that is much easier to control while riding. The Jog Dial default is volume control, and pushing the integrated button lets you cycle through all device functions with minimal fuss, which means you'll ride safer. The SMH10 delivers crystal-clear, natural sound through the stereo Bluetooth headset that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio.

Integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device. You'll get up to 12 hours of talk time and 10 days of stand-by time on a single charge. And even if your companions don't have Sena gear, the SMH10 uses the Universal Intercom protocol, which allows your gear to work with theirs, regardless of brand.

<span>I installed the unit today and then took a ride on the expressway. I easily installed the unit in my new helmet and then paired it to my phone. I've tried several helmet speaker methods such as having regular phone earbuds in my ear. That works OK but the problem is keeping earbuds in my ear when I put the helmet on and the mic positioned near my mouth. At highway speeds the wind noise makes it difficult or impossible for the other party to hear. I tried a dedicated wired motorcycle helmet headset but the volume was too low to hear clearly at highway speeds and it was a hassle connecting the dangling wire from the helmet each time I got on and off the bike. Thus my purchase of the Sena bluetooth unit. I read many reviews of other units. Most had volume complaints or were double the price.<br/><br/>The volume on this unit is simply amazing!!! At 70 MPH on a phone call I can hear the other party very clear and loud. Believe it or not it actually hurt my ears and I had to turn the unit down. The same is true of music. How is the music quality? Good enough. It's not five star orchestra quality and there's not much bass but it sounds good and most importantly LOUD rolling along on a bike. The amp in the bluetooth unit actually drives the speakers to the edge of distortion but that's a good thing.<br/><br/>I believe one key is to make absolutely sure that you use the included pads to position the speakers where they press right up against your ear when you put the helmet on. Proximity probably makes a huge difference in sound volume. 1/4 to 1/2 inch away would probably reduce the volume in half which would make the system much less effective.<br/><br/>I have a Motorola Razr Maxx phone and the volume button on the unit does not affect the phone volume. Most bluetooth units work in conjunction with the phone volume. If you lower or raise the volume on the bluetooth unit, it correspondingly raises or lowers it on the phone. With this unit, volume controls seem to operate independently of each other therefore you need to turn the phone volume to max and adjust volume from the bluetooth unit. The unit is firmware upgradeable so perhaps that will be corrected in a future release but I am so thrilled with the performance of the unit that such a minor detail is insignificant.<br/><br/>There is a plus to this arrangement in that music playback and phone conversation volumes are independently maintained. In other words, if you set the volume on a phone conversation and then switch to music and set a different volume the unit will remember the phone and music volume independently. So I guess it's designed to work independently of your phone volume and as I thought about it, that's probably a better arrangement. Your helmet system would always be set to motorcycle preferences regardless of what level you set your phone.<br/><br/>I haven't tested the intercom features and performance. My wife is terrified of my motorcycle therefore I usually ride alone so I don't need the intercom feature but it's there if I ever do need it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Volume is FANTASTIC and you can hear phone conversations or music clearly at 80% volume at 70mph.<br/><br/>2. The person on the other end hears virtually no mic wind noise at 70mph. They couldn't believe that I was on a motorcycle at 70mph. They heard NO wind noise which was hard for me to believe but I was talking to my mother so I knew she was telling me the truth. Of course I had on a full face helmet with the visor down.<br/><br/>3. Unit can operate while charging. The battery life talk time is rated at 12 hours with a standby time of 10 days. I haven't tested that yet but if it truly lasts 12 hours and you do happen to talk longer than 12 hours at a stretch you can plug up the unit and talk while charging. I've never ridden more than a few hours in a day so a 12 hour talk time before recharging is NOT going to be problem for me. I'm going to poop out long before the bluetooth battery. Talking while charging is something that most bluetooth units can't do.<br/><br/>4. Volume control button is big. On a motorcycle with gloves the button is easy to find, turn or push.<br/><br/>5. It looks cool on your helmet with the blue blinking light.<br/><br/>6. Good price. I bought the H10 instead of the H5 since the price difference was not that much and it appears the H10 comes with better speakers. I'm not sure about that as I couldn't fully tell from the descriptions but it read like the H10 had better speakers than the H5. The upgrade speakers cost the difference between the two units but the H10 does more. It's about a $25 street price difference between the H10 and the H5.<br/><br/>7. Uses a standard micro USB port for charging.<br/><br/>8. Has a standard 1/8" port to plug a wired music player.<br/><br/>9. Ports covered by rubber plugs for weatherproofing.<br/><br/>10. Easy to remove from the helmet if necessary.<br/><br/>Cons: NONE that I've found so far.<br/><br/>I installed it in this helmet:</span>

<span><br/>I am just as impressed by the helmet as I am the bluetooth unit. I can't believe the quality of this helmet for the price. I've got five helmets. This is the cheapest one and it seems to rank right up there with the quality of the very expensive helmets if not better. It has perforations in the helmet liner for the speakers so it works perfectly with the Sena bluetooth unit.</span>

<span>I am happy with the performance of this intercom; I give the performance 5 stars, but there are a few rough edges that cause me to give it 4 stars overall. I use it with Garmin Zumo 590 GPS, Apple iPhone (with Garmin app and Pandora), and SiriusXM radio, and all work and play well together.<br/>  When mounting the mic clamps (provided with this item and also available separately as Sena SMH-A0301 Helmet Boom Microphone Clamp Kit) I discovered you can crack the mic clamp (cracks horizontally on either side of the electrical contacts port opening), if you deform it in any way when you tighten the clamp screws. The mic clamp material is plastic. An 'extra plastic shim piece' is provided that can be used to add thickness to the body of the mic clamp. If the clamp does not fit the exact contour of your helmet I recommend using the additional plastic shim provided.  The 'extra plastic shim piece' has double-sided tape on it and can be used without the thin metal clamp and screws that are discussed in the instructions as the preferred method of mounting. You have to replace the provided two screws with longer ones so you can use the 'extra plastic shim piece' along with the thin metal backing clamp - this is what I did and recommend, if your helmet has a contour that deforms the mic clamp in any way when you tighten the clamp screws, or the mic clamp will eventually crack. (If the mic clamp cracked while riding the intercom would almost surely fall out of the mic clamp.) One of mine developed cracks after being installed for two weeks without cracking - crack detected before riding).  The provided screws for the thin metal clamp (that goes inside the helmet) are M3 about 8mm long. The longer screws (not provided) that are needed to use with the thin metal clamp and the provided 'extra plastic shim piece' need to be around 12mm long. (I had and assortment of socket head M3 screws on hand I and didn't measure the exact length I used.) My experience with SENA Customer Service was excellent and they replaced my cracked mic clamp under Warranty.<br/>  I have read reviews that describe that the SENA intercom - when used so that it is installed (snapped into place) and un-snapped from the mic-clamp every time the bike is stopped - as eventually developing problems with the electrical contacts. This is surprising because the contacts are high quality gold plated type. From my experience so far, I believe there are two reasons people may experience these electrical contact problems:<br/>  1) As I have described above, if the mic clamp is deformed in any way, it affects how the electrical contacts mate up when the intercom is snapped into the clamp. If when you un-snap the intercom (to remove it), and it is at all difficult, this is an indication that the mic clamp is deformed and flattened more than it should be - I would expect some type of problem to develop. (Until mine eventually cracked, I didn't have an electrical contact problem.)<br/>  2)  Unrelated to any deforming of the mic clamp, When you snap and un-snap the intercom from the mic clamp there is a lower tongue on the intercom that fits into a slot on the mic clamp to provide the lower retention mechanism. This tongue in slot system provides excellent retention, but it does not guide the intercom into the mic clamp so that the upper snap lines up perfectly. As a result, you may apply side pressure, toward the front or back of the helmet, on the intercom to get the upper snap to align while you are pushing in on it to get it to snap in. Repeatedly putting side pressure on the contacts (to align the upper snap) while pushing in on the intercom will eventually damage the contacts. If you look to align the upper snap before you rotate it toward the helmet to snap it in place, you can snap it into place without putting any side pressure on the electrical contacts, and prevent any damage to them.  Granted it would have been great if the SENA design engineers had been able to foresee this problem but all in all I believe they did a good job. I believe engineering relied too heavily on the high quality of the contacts to prevent this problem with possibly applying side pressure while attempting to snap in. I also believe that using a little care to align the upper snap before rotation the intercom toward the helmet, and into place, will prevent this problem.</span>

Product Description   The Sena SMH10 Motorcycle Bluetooth 3.0 Headset and Intercom was designed to keep you connected to your riding companions over longer ranges for conversation and music sharing--up to 900 meters (980 yards). When paired with a Bluetooth-enabled phone, it'll also let you make hands-free calls. The SMH10 features a Universal Microphone Kit. The Jog Dial makes for an intuitive user interface that is much easier to control while riding. The Jog Dial default is volume control, and pushing the integrated button lets you cycle through all device functions with minimal fuss, which means you'll ride safer. The SMH10 delivers crystal-clear, natural sound through the stereo Bluetooth headset that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. The Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward and track back functions, plus each audio source has its own adjustable volume level. Integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device. You'll get up to 12 hours of talk time and 10 days of stand-by time on a single charge. And even if your companions don't have Sena gear, the SMH10 uses the Universal Intercom protocol, which allows your gear to work with theirs, regardless of brand.   Amazon.com   The SMH10-11 is a Bluetooth v3.0 + EDR Class 1 Stereo Headset with long-range Bluetooth Intercom designed specifically for motorcycles. With the SMH10-11, you can call hands-free on your Bluetooth mobile phone, listen to stereo music or voice instructions of GPS navigations by Bluetooth wirelessly, and have intercom conversations in full duplex with a passenger or other motorcycle riders. This SMH10-11 bundle comes with a universal microphone kit that includes both a boom mic and a wired mic for versatile helmet installation.  Features include Bluetooth 3.0, multi-point connection, and conferencing for up to 4 people Thanks to the latest Bluetooth v3.0 and the advanced digital processing technology, the SMH10-11 offers the best sound quality for both incoming and outgoing sound in its class. Also, the easy-to-access and intuitive button operations make the SMH10-11 a perfect companion for motorcycles.Bluetooth v3.0 WirelessSMH10-11 can wirelessly connect to other Bluetooth devices supporting HSP/HFP (Headset Profile/Hands Free Profile) and A2DP (Advance Audio Distribution Profile). HSP/HFP is standard in all phones with Bluetooth features. Almost all Bluetooth MP3 players, smartphone, and audio dongles support A2DP to send stereo audio to Bluetooth headsets like the Sena SMH10-11. Enjoy Bluetooth music playback control by AVRCP: play, pause, track forward and track back.Other Bluetooth features include Multi-Pair to allow intercom functionality for 4 persons, and compatibility with select motorcycle GPS systems. Use as an intercom, or connect to your portable devicesIndividual Adjustable Volume ProfilesYou can easily decrease/increase the volume of the voice, music and intercom using Jog Dial. The SMH10-11 can save volume levels of previously connected profiles. This means that phone volume (HSP/HFP), music volume (A2DP), and intercom volumes will be saved separately and return to its own saved volume level whenever associated profile is reconnected.Profile volume adjustment is only affected during the use of its specific profile. However, when changing volume during standby mode, then volume change applies to all profiles. Alert tones like low battery warning and connection tones can only be adjusted in standby mode.Easy Installation for Most HelmetsThe SMH10-11 will fit onto various types of helmets. The universal microphone kit included in this bundle includes both a boom mic and a wire mic, and will fit onto most types of helmets.

Did all this in living room but not on bike because its wintertime.  I bought two units and don't have anyone to test intercom feature with yet under riding conditions.  Hoping for best as its really the reason I bought.  I can tell you that the downloadable desktop program to upgrade the unit firmware is crap.  Many complaints on forums about this but the last real upgrade for these units was quite a few years ago so even a firmware upgrade really wouldn't do much so its not a big deal.  Looking forward to using under riding conditions.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This product has some fairly good perks, but a few cons. I've used them for week and one day as of writing this review and overall I can not complain. I have a few pet-peeves with it, but I will focus this review into listing pros and cons.<br/><br/>-- Pros --<br/>1) Comfortable - It sits well on my head and it's almost not noticed when using for an hour to two hours of use.<br/><br/>2) Sturdy build quality - These are built in which you can bend them and it will go back into its original shape fairly well. You can twist this the band in loops and it springs back, so these could survive for a while thrown in a bag.<br/><br/>3) Audio quality is decent - For comfortable bone conduction headphones that don't squeeze tight against your head, the sound quality is pretty good. I wouldn't put these up there with high end headphones, but more in the low to mid tear headphones. As the audio can change using ear plugs or not. With ear plugs don't expect them to become high end headphones, but for bone conduction it does make it so you can turn down the volume and pick up on select sounds easier.<br/><br/>4) USB-C for charging is fantastic. I understand why some of these have proprietary designs, but at the same time USB-C is rather small and very universal. If you break this cable overtime, you can easily replace it, verse a proprietary cable that isn't sold separate like with most of these bone-conduction headphones.<br/><br/>5) Ear Plugs provided with carrying case.<br/><br/>6) Nice button layout. Volume controls &amp; sync/power on one side and pause/play button on the side of the haptic speaker.<br/><br/>-- Cons --<br/>1) No easy access to the battery. If the battery ever fails on this, you can't replace it yourself easily. You would have to pry the thing open and hope to not break the headphones in your pursuit. Then hope you can find a potential proprietary designed internal lithium-ion battery that is likely shoved very tightly into the on side which doesn't contain the buttons.<br/><br/>2) Can not be used as wired or charge and use. I figured this would likely be the case, but it's a shame this isn't an option. Specially when they provide ear-plugs for use when in a safe area where you don't need to hear your surroundings.<br/><br/>3) When the battery gets low, every few minutes a ladies voice says, "Charge Me". This can not be turned off and can be rather annoying. As you can still have around an hour and a half to an hour of charge left. It's not super loud, but it's still disruptive to the content you are listening to.<br/><br/>4) The provided USB-C cable provided is very short. I've not measured it officially, but it looks like it's 91 Centimeters or around 3 feet long. Charging from a computer or charge bank is the best option due to this. I wish they would have provided at least a 2-3 Meter (or 6-9 feet) cable instead so you could power brick this easier. Though, as mentioned it's USB-C so this can be easily fixed.<br/><br/>5) Multi-Sync is locked to using a phone application. Upon reading the manual for this online, this feature is here, but you have to sync it first to a phone, install the application, and then use the application to sync to another device. I've not yet used this, but I would assume this means you're using your phone as a bridge between devices. This in my opinion is slight annoyance, since I do not keep my phone glued to my hip when home.<br/><br/>6) Some of the programmed multi-push controls are not the best. Like previous track where you press to hear three beeps isn't the best. There is times I felt like I didn't push the button enough to get a track switch on my music.<br/>---------<br/><br/>Personally I would love these to be wired or at least have a charge and use function. Yet for a wireless device the overall sound quality isn't bad even at lower than 100% volume level. Specially with ear-plugs in. Though without you may need the one-hundred percent volume or if using your OS's sound mixer to amp the volume beyond 100%, if not using ear plugs. (Don't do this to high or to long. Bone-conduction can lead to hearing loss like regular headphones when the volume is to loud. Though, bone-conduction is easier to be to loud). This of course only applies when the volume of the content is super low volume.  I would not recommend these for non-earplug usage for movies or tv shows. Though, content like music and maybe a YouTube video where audio can potentially be higher or well leveled these are great. Since the tiny speaker tweeter can't vibrate enough to conduct very low content.</span>

<span>The idea of bone conduction has always been an intriguing concept to me so I finally decided to buy it during prime day deals. The fact that I can listen to my music at a medium to high volume but not heard by anyone else is a major plus for me. I enjoy alternative and pop songs but I mainly listen to classical music or instrumental covers such as piano, violin, etc. to keep my adhd in check - I don't need nor want other people to know what I listen to lol<br/>Consequently, I can still hear my surroundings while listening to music at medium volume so I am fully aware of who calls me at the office or what's going on whenever I do groceries and whatnot. Not exactly noise cancelling but you can eventually tune out your surroundings if the volume is set on high (you'd just hear low mumbles of conversation at most). Sound quality is just as good as other premium headsets. The functionality and convenience of this product is worth the price.<br/><br/>Now with my personal con for this: it can get uncomfortable over time. I've tried this product for about a good week now wearing it every day at work and school. The times I would take off my Steelseries and U8L headsets are when I need to take a break or relax from my tasks. With this, I had to take a break because the headset was uncomfortable. It fits fine but it's designed to rest on your ears with the weight of the earpiece and its components distributed in front and behind your ear in which over time can get uncomfortable.<br/>The battery life is also not something I'm a fan of. It's advertised that it would last about 6 hours but mine has lasted less than that so at some point of the day, I have to switch to my old set of earphones.<br/><br/>Tl;dr : functionality, convenience, and sound quality is awesome but headset is designed to sit on your ears which can get uncomfortable over time and battery doesn't last long so I would eventually switch out.</span>

<span>This is a very good product from my perspective.

I had heard of "Open Ear" headphones from friend before this purchase, it seemed like a good fit for my circumstances so I decided to try them.<br/>Good news right away was that I could wear my glasses and these all comfortably at the same time. But soon after using them on jogging and playing, I found myself wearing them all time. The sound is absolutely great considering that they sit outside your ear canal. They're equally handy while doing yard work, household chores, or working on the computer. On a full charge, I can wear them for five or six hours easily before even beginning to think about the battery level. Also  the built in microphone during calls and no complaints from the person on the other line.</span>

<span>My dad and I have both been using and loving aftershockz headphones. They are great for doing things where you want to have more situational awareness, while still providing decent audio quality. Having previously had the more expensive model, I can say the OpenRun is worth the upgrade for better quality music listening, but not necessary for podcasts or less-than-premium music experience. Perhaps the biggest positive is that they are much more comfortable than most other headphones/earbuds for extending wear.<br/><br/>Issues? Durability. I've broken two pairs using them within parameters that are fine for other earbuds, and I'm pretty sure my dad's gone through even more. I did warranty the second pair, and after an easy but slow process I did get a replacement. I think you need to expect these to die in one to two years of moderate use, and if that isn't acceptable to you, then probably skip them. Currently I'm using mine with a mix of other headphones, only using these when I really want their benefits, hoping to keep them going for a good while.</span>

<span>The sound quality is on par with current top of the line bluetooth headphones. With them being as light as they are, I regularly forget that I am (or am not) wearing them. The volume doesn't get super high but it is worth noting that at the loudest volume, you can tune out the world. If inserting earbuds (not included), it can be even louder, though sound quality does deteriorate, leaving a really cool muffled effect. Charging is super fast and hassle free with the magnetic charger (about 3 foot long). And in optimal conditions, the bluetooth range can actually exceed what is listed in the product description. The ONLY complaint/criticism I might have is that it would be nice if they manufactured hard cases like the ones sold for this product by Hermitshell(?) and that I wish they sold longer charging cables. I personally don't have current need for one but I know that situations vary and change. Thank you, Shokz, for an amazing set of headphones</span>

<span>I bought this on Amazon Day sale to replace an Aftershock that I lost.  I use them for work calls all day and it has better  sound for both me and on the other end than any Plantonics or Jabra that I have owned previously.  I also use it for cycling so I can hear what is going on around me while listening to turn by turn audio directions and traffic alerts from my Garmin Varia radar.<br/>Battery life is good.  I usually get 2 days per charge with heavy use.  Call audio is perfect, while music audio is acceptable with normal use.  It gets much better with cheap foam ear plugs if you don't need the ability to hear your surroundings.<br/>I have noticed that my ears are no longer irritated like they were after years of wearing  in ear devices.  Absolutely worth the degradation in music quality.</span>

<span>Okay, so I should preface this review with: this is not my first pair of 'Shokz', and this is now my go-to brand so keep in mind and possible biases.<br/><br/>When I first got a 'Shokz' brand headset, it was back when their brand was still 'Aftershokz'. This 'OpenRun' model is the immediate successor to the 'Aeropex', and let me tell you about some features they changed for the better, which you may never know about.<br/><br/>For example, my review did not in fact start off "CHARGE ME!!", because between models they listened to their customers and made serious quality of life improvements. Mx. ChargeMe no longer screams unholy in your ear the moment your battery is looking a little low. Now we have a quieter, slightly softer voice informing us that it's both on, and either connected or low battery. Hey Shokz team? Our eardrums thank you!<br/><br/>Next feature difference between my last pair and this one? I bought the Mini this time, and I am LOVING THEM. The comfort difference between the mini and the standard is noticable, when you have the right size. If any point you thought their pre-purchase sizing was silly, think again. Do it, and you'll love yourself for it. This isn't something new, but it is to me, and frankly I'm thrilled- save for the fact that the Mini isn't available in the same range and colors. Hey Shokz? I'm the Big Sad that I couldn't buy that lovely Seafoam Blue/Green color just because I wanted the better fit.<br/><br/>I wear my headphones until they literally break, which was the case with my last pair. They kept playing beautifully until the very materials comprising them were deteriorating. I wore them every. Single. Day. And for each day I have never been gentle. I wear them to work, wore them to college, wear them at home (and yes, in the freakin' shower and I am SHAMELESS about it). My entire family has a pair, because we are thorough believers in being able to listen to what we want, while still being available to those around us.<br/><br/>These are durable, reliable, great quality, and easy to operate- just avoid the button on the left ear, I way too often hit it and "Re-Dialing last number.." Wait, wha- @?$&amp;, NO!<br/><br/>10 outta 10, I recommend. So much so, I've been listening to a streamer through my OpenRun's while typing this review. :3<br/><br/>(P.S: Only ever had to return a pair through RMA, once. It was my first pair, and the warranty process was painless and easy. They were also above and beyond, earning them some serious loyalty from me. So, great customer service from the Manufacturer.)</span>

<span>It's amazing to finally have the option of listening to music on runs with zero problems or hassles. Thank you Shokz.  Here's the back story:<br/><br/>In the old days, I used to snake headphone wires under my shirt and strap a massive iPod on my arm to listen to music. The armband slipped off, the wires got tangled. Smaller iPods were junk and couldn't handle much if any abuse or sweat. Smartphones are just too big and clunky. Music capable smartwatches are amazing and compact, but Bluetooth headphones and anything stuck in my ears quickly gets sweaty and uncomfortable. Jabra Elites, for example, sound good, but fall out multiple times every run.<br/><br/>After having pretty much given up on having music on runs, a colleague turned me onto Shokz. What a find. Paired instantly with my Garmin Fenix. The sound is way better than I expected would be possible with bone induction (and just good period). The headphones stay comfortable throughout the runs I've been on, and the playback stays flawless.<br/><br/>For me at least, and I would venture other folks who like to run hard and thus sweat a lot, these things are a game changer. Get them. You will not be sorry.</span>
