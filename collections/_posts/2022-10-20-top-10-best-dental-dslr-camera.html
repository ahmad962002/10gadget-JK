<span>I like this a lot! That being said, if you are purchasing this to get a clean HDMI output for content creation through a video capture card - look elsewhere. The focus bars appear in the HDMI output; and well that's not what we want when doing content creation.<br/><br/>The picture is amazing, but you will need to use the Windows Canon Software to get an image. My Mac detects it just fine, but Windows needs the Canon software.<br/><br/>Pictures are amazing, video is amazing.</span>

<span>I've loved cannon since I traded up years ago from my beginner point and shoot. This camera was a treat for myself when I decided to start my bucket list and visit Scotland. It did not disappoint. A great upgrade to my 12 year old rebel. Easy to use, outstanding pictures. Couldn't be happier.</span>

<span>Nice build quality, the pictures come out really good with just the kit lense, definitely recommend for any beginner who has never tried photography! Videos suck, but with some editing and good lighting, you can get a video that is good enough for small businesses. I bought a used T7 and the one thing I would change is the eye lense is very blurry, I have to take most of my pictures on the digital display because with the eye lense, you can’t tell if the person or item is in focus. 4/5 camera, if you have the money definitely buy a new camera or go for the cannon M50 or the M50 mark II.</span>

<span>Automatic mode does not do well in shaded areas. Landscape shots are difficult to achieve with provided lens’s, however, It is possible with lots of minor adjustments, time consuming in manual mode. I would recommend manual mode for beginners.</span>

<span>For my entire life I’ve loved photography but have never owned anything more than your average point-n-shoot cameras in the $100-200 range (my last one was a low-end Panasonic Lumix). Or for the past decade I’ve only used the camera on my iPhone. I was lucky to receive a few Amazon gift cards on my recent birthday so I finally bit the bullet and bought this one. And may I just say...wow. I couldn’t be more pleased.<br/><br/>The main thing I’ve always wanted was a camera that could shoot with good depth of field. You know, where the subject being photographed is in sharp focus but the background is blurry, giving the object a more realistic, 3-D look. This camera does that spectacularly, even in fully-automatic, auto-focus mode.<br/><br/>I’ve also always wanted a camera that can take great low-light / night shots. My iPhone camera was actually not bad for day-to-day photos but it took HORRIBLE night shots. The moon, for example, was always nothing more than a blurry blob no matter how still I  stayed. Not so with this camera! The dark shots I’ve taken thus far have all been nice and crisp/clear rather than grainy.  Overall I’m very, very happy with my purchase and I haven’t even used the extra telephoto lens that came with it yet! There is still so much I have yet to learn about its many features so I know it’s only going to get better and better once I learn what all its many options can do.</span>

But the iA, Intelligent Auto will rarely allow you to miss a shot. the 4K photo mode has totally changed the way I approach picture taking, pure fun, extraordinary pictures at a low price.</span>

<span>I know it's got to be a good camera because a pro-video friend uses one in his free time with the family because he doesn't want to bring $35K equipment around a bunch of kids!  It's still a little confusing for me only because I'm just coming from using an iPhone &amp; this has more dials.  Now I know how my Mom felt when I bought HER an iPhone!!!</span>

<span>I'm a beginner at photography and have always wanted my own camera so this is my first. With thorough research I wanted to make sure I got a camera that was good and worth the money I would be spending. Not only does this camera have great zoom and focus but also the settings gives you great range. The battery lasts pretty much all day, it's pretty easy to navigate without instructions, and it's nice and compact. Love this camera!</span>

<span>Since my iPhone can take better pictures than most professional cameras, I wanted one that would give me the Zoom that I cannot get with the iPhone<br/><br/>This camera is great for macro, wildlife, and other although you will need to learn its features and tricks to get the best out of it<br/><br/>The sensor is small although you get a nice smaller size than a professional one in exchange with a very nice price for the Zoom optics<br/><br/>This camera is a great compromise that offers good price, great zoom, OK quality and battery<br/><br/>If you want a professional camera with all bells and whistles and great flexibility, there are better options are a higher price</span>

The little things around my house including my kitten that with a phone doesn’t pop much absolutely come to life! I bawled when my camera came in. I have been scraping up every penny to be able to save up for this camera and I’m so happy I did. One thing I do wish it came with was a lense protecter. I have seen mentions of uv lense protecters that are supposed to be absolutely wonderful. If you do get this camera save a little extra to get one. Once I can save up I’m getting me one. It is a super easy camera to learn especially for beginners. It is not heavy at all, which comes in handy for if you are doing long photo shoots. Another thing I wish it came with was a camera cleaner. Or things that told you what was safe to clean the camera with. Obviously not water but are glasses cleaners safe? Or is there a specific camera cleaner? Not sure but other then that I’m beyond happy!</span>

<span>Bought this for macro use with my D7200. Works flawlessly. Also a good all around TTL flash out to about<br/>14-15 feet. But it's really designed for macro work and that's where it shines.

<span>This is a nice little ring flash and the price is right. I mean how can you not buy it? It works albeit a little over poweringly. That can be modified by physically moving the camera farther from the subject. It also has a range of intensities.  use it mostly with a zoom lens. It comes with adapters for almost every lens you own. The adapters I tried worked perfectly. I would have given it five stars but the instructions are almost incomprehensible. Definitely written by someone whose native tongue is not English. It's not that difficult to figure out but it would still be nice to be able to know how to handle a nyproblem you might have. You'll be on your own there. If you ever wanted to try a ring flash but thought it wouldn't get much use and you didn't want to spend the bucks, here's your chance to own one. I can't compare it to other ones but it certainly works for me and there have been quite a few times it has come in handy.</span>

<span>Did I say I loved this camera?  Well I do.  I love this camera.  When it first arrived I was a little disappointed that it is a little bulkier than my previous cameras.  I've purchased several generations of the Panasonic ZS series and have loved every one.  Well, I was tired of buying refurbs and decided to treat myself to a brand new model, with all the bells and whistles.  This was the first camera I've had without GPS built in.  Initially I was disappointed that I couldn't get one with it, but connecting it with the cell phone's GPS was easy.  On average it's taken about 13 seconds to lock in, the longest was maybe 20 seconds.  I was concerned about when I travel abroad if it would work, but from what I've read, you bring your cell phone and even if you don't have phone or internet service, our US gov't tax dollars provide us with free satellite connections all over the planet. I haven't had the opportunity to test this for myself, but there are a few YouTubers who have confirmed it.<br/><br/> ANYWAY this thing takes amazing pictures.  Granted, all digital cameras have their faults when it comes to focus and lighting issues, but for the most part this thing works like a champ and on rare occasions have I run into any of those problems.<br/><br/>The screen is crisp and flips up for selfies, and includes a 4-3-2-1 countdown so you can smile and look ready and natural for the shot.  This also worked well when I had to use a mini tripod for a group photo and it 'just' gave me enough time to jump in - although the outtakes are pretty funny with my hair flying in the air as I hadn't quite gotten where I needed to be.  And even THOSE pictures are CRISP.<br/><br/>It is such a pleasure to take a Panoramic shot and have all the images stitched right on the camera rather than bringing it home and doing it on the computer.  How nice to see it instantly to ensure you've captured everything you wanted.  I have yet to try it but am anxious to dabble with the burst feature along with another 'stitching' program which takes several photos you've chosen (out of up to 30[?]) and putting them together to show the object-in-motion in a series of positions, while everything else stays the same.  THIS you have to use software for, but it's going to be great, I know it.<br/><br/>SUMMARY:  The camera is great.  As far as point-and-shoot cameras go, it is a terrific choice with lots of cool features.  It's a little too big to fit in an average sized pocket but if you wear cargo pants, you can probably carry it in there.  I chose to get a good case with a strap as I decided that most of the time I KNOW when I'll be taking pictures, and will want it out and ready anyway.  The other reason is that these cameras are notorious for getting dust in, behind the lens and will need it cleaned professionally (trust me - as careful as I was it was still a disaster doing it myself).  The GPS will work anywhere and tag all your photos accordingly.  Panoramic shots, you see in an instant!  Burst is terrific too, and the app and/or software will help to make some even more interesting pictures for you to share.  You want this camera.  I have absolutely NO buyer's remorse.</span>

<span>UPDATE (4 Star) After getting the technician report it said: "excessive amount of dust in lens and on barrels causing issue-unable to clean off- dust also in unit-deemed abused". I am not sure how to abuse a camera to insert dust inside it- and to clean it the charges were to be over $200. For having this camera for two months through normal use, I felt the need to write a strong email and request to speak to a manager, especially with my big trip coming up (which this camera was mainly for) with a few days left to spare. He decided to authorize the repairs in warranty this time and had said to always store the camera in a case and never put it directly put it in my pocket (which is what I tend to do with smaller cameras). I luckily got it back today with 1 day to spare before leaving the country and it looks great and has no dust on the lens. I still warn others though that this camera is prone to this dust issue, which is a major design flaw in my opinion- but use with a case and never in your pocket and hopefully this experience does not happen to you!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW (1 Star) This is the second Lumix I have purchased, and after my experience with Panasonic I will never purchase a Panasonic product of any kind. My prior Lumix was great, however after a year there was dust/fibers in the camera that were ruining every photo (I would have to manually Photoshop it out of thousands of images). In that case, my Asurion warranty through Amazon came to the rescue and I got the camera good as new in under a week.<br/><br/>With this new camera, I had it for under two months and it already had the same issue- I am not sure how dust and fibers get in Lumix cameras so easily. Asurion said the camera is still under Panasonic's warranty so they cannot handle it until later. I used Panasonic's help form and mailed in the camera. After not hearing anything after two weeks, I decided to give them a call today and they claim the camera is 'out of warranty and beyond repair because of excessive dust in the lens'. I am not quite sure how it can be deemed as excessive- regardless of the amount of dust, cleaning it is the same process. Also, Asurion was able to clean a much dirtier lens and get it back to me in less than a week. How does the repair center for the camera manufacturer so incompetent in their abilities that they cannot perform a basic clean their own product while a third party, like Asurion, can have it back in under a week? When I asked why they had not contacted me and that they were simply not going to fix the camera and were just holding it, they said they didn't have my email address on-file. The hilarious thing is that to give them all my information I had to send my phone, address, product, serial number, and other info via my email address through previous correspondence with them. I told the Panasonic representative that it was unacceptable their product is unusable after 2 months after minimal use, with a simple issue that their technician team is unwilling to address, and that they weren't even going to reach out to me to tell me?!? The technician didn't even apologize- for any of Panasonic's incompetency in design or service, and pretty much had a 'just deal with it' attitude. I requested a manager call me back and am awaiting to hear anything.<br/><br/>I am going on a big Europe trip in two weeks and now I have no camera and am down $400. I am a very reasonable and patient person, but this is the worst customer service I have had in my entire life. Unless they fix this I will never purchase a Panasonic product again of any kind in my life- it is unacceptable. Panasonic's tagline should be 'Terrible Cameras and Customer Service™'</span>

<span>Short review for the ZS70 here, my full review shortly will be published on my blog (google camera name and photographic-central). Quick rant/explanation: I'm giving it 5 stars for two reasons- One, I can't choose 4.5, and two, there were a couple one star reviews here when either the camera wasn't released yet or there was obvious user error. To me, those aren't valid reviews so the extra half point helps to mitigate them (since Amazon hasn't removed the reviews, and probably won't I'm doing my part to keep things fair). Moving on...<br/><br/>Review: There simply aren't any decent pocket-able super zoom cameras on the market that shoot raw. As a professional and enthusiast, I demand raw. I suggest readers who don't use raw learn how to so that they can get the most out of the TZ70. This camera has a very small sensor, but, it is a modern BSI CMOS, which means it's very efficient for the size of its pixels. As long as you have reasonable expectations from a sensor this size, it will probably exceed those expectations. Image quality from raw is much better than I anticipated. The lens is very sharp through the range (just don't go over f5.6 if you can avoid it, natural diffraction kicks in). Therefore the sensor and lens combo out perform a camera of this class. Even dynamic range is better than I could have possibly thought. Credit to technology moving on.<br/><br/>When you factor in all its features (a vast array from 4k video to wireless to time lapse video), it's top notch design aesthetics (minimalist, classy, utilitarian), excellent build and ergonomics, this camera is a powerhouse of a pocketable "all in one" compact. My only wish is that the lens were slightly brighter (max aperture through the range), but otherwise it's a camera in its class of sensor size that shadows all others. At first I dismissed the ZS70 because of its packed tiny sensor, but I was shocked and pleasantly surprised looking at the image quality in raw. 1" sized sensors are still going to outperform it mind you, but this sensor is much better than you might think. Once you get it set  up, it's a joy to shoot with. That lens is so versatile for all kinds of snapshot photography- from landscapes to macros, action shots to long range stills or portraits. Its fast focusing so even actions shots are within reach.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is everything  you need in a little point n shoot, and nothing you don't. The controls on the exterior are plenty and holding it is quite lovely for one handed shooting- it's slightly larger, thicker, and heavier than the ZS50/60 but that is a good thing for a camera with such a long zoom. It makes a more stable platform when you are shooting at full telephoto. It has just the right heft to it for a camera of its size and type, welcome if you ask me. The five axis stabilization helps tremendously to keep blur at bay. Most of the controls are customizeable. The LCD is helpful for waist level shots and acts as a sort of angle bi-pod when you place the camera down for more stable shots (if you don't have a tripod for example). The EVF is welcome and usable, and helps in bright light and for extra stability when you are looking through it with the camera pressed to your eye/face.<br/><br/>I cannot get over how lovely its designed- all sides are nice n flat, nothing protrudes to snag, there's no obnoxious advertising of features on the camera itself, and everything appears proportionate and cleanly organized. The front and rear grips are improved and excellent. The design looks very Leica-esque - minimalist and beautiful. Great choice in exterior materials, the blend of flat fleck paint and satin metal. The black and silver versions are both excellent and classy.<br/><br/>If you print, you can easily make lovely prints to 13x19", and if you have some talent or stack your raw images, you can raise that number substantially (30x40" perhaps!). To me this camera is the sleeper compact out there right now. And it's likely to get more reviews and fans as a result.<br/><br/>Overall the ZS70 is the best of the newer ZS series (or TZ series if outside the USA) cameras. It's classy, versatile, discreet, minimalist, and utilitarian. I wish more cameras were designed like this. Keep it up Panasonic!<br/><br/>Edit: My full review is now up on photographic-central blogspot dot com :)</span>

<span>This is the second of two identical cameras.  I bought the second when I thought the first had given up the ghost, only to discover I had inadvertently changed a setting and could not figure out the features.

<span>I use this to record long form videos in 4k and it’s great! I recommend that you get a dummy battery that can plug into an outlet so that you can have infinite battery life. I haven’t ran into any overheating issues at all which is something that apparently could happen.<br/><br/>One downside is that this camera is only able to record in 4GB chunks before splitting into a different file. This doesn’t effect the video in any way and it can still record for as long as your SD card can hold, but it does mean you have to put over 20 separate clips on a timeline in order when editing. This is really not a big deal, but just something to consider I suppose.<br/><br/>Overall, this camera rulez, and I would even go as far to compare its Quality to the LUMIX S5. The S5 is superior for multiple reasons, but the output quality for 4k video at 30fps is comparable.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for a budget camera to shoot high quality footage this is definitely your best bet.</span>

<span>This is a hyper solid camera for the price. If you're looking to dip your toe into the Panasonic ecosystem this is a solid intro. I bought it to experiment with Micro4/3 and Panasonic lenses without dropping $2,000 on a GH5. It has some HARD limitations but you can account for a lot of them.<br/><br/>I have a couple uses:<br/>1. In studio web shows.<br/>2. Smallscale short film production.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In studio it's a beast. With good lighting and audio input this thing looks/sounds amazing. Even the kit lens. It's simple and straightforward, and the recording time/file sizes are super manageable. Additionally with an Elgato HD60s you can run the camera directly into a PC to use it for live streaming. I use it to record format shows/podcasts and run my audio directly into the camera. It's a super simple workflow made possible by how solid this camera is.<br/><br/>As a film production camera, this is where the limitations come into play. It doesn't handle low light too well. In my experience, the image was barely usable at 1600 ISO if you're trying to make a decent looking film. That was on my Rokinon 35mm T1.5. It just gets grain and distortion really easily.<br/><br/>Additionally the focus/autofocus isn't the most intuitive. The auto focus is practically nonexistent. I could never get a sharp image with it. On top of that, the focus peaking just didn't seem to do its job. With some practice you can get better at focusing this camera, but other cameras don't take the work. This issue was fairly consistent with different lenses and setups.<br/><br/>With all that said, depending on your use case you really can't beat it for the price. The 4K is solid and when you can get everything to come together you can make ridiculously good looking projects with this.</span>

<span>I was initially on the fence about this one, particularly with the increased price over previous models on launch, but due to the readdition of phase-detection (along with the standard contrast-detection) to the new hybrid AF system, I decided to take the plunge. My *only* gripe about the previous two models (GR, and GRII) were the loss of phase-detection; as stellar as they are, the AF isn't as on par as the older, smaller sensor versions, the GRDigitalIII and GRDigitalIV. That has now changed and I can report that though it's not as fast as those older model at least in lowlight, it can finally focus in near darkness just like those older models, though it takes it a couple moments to do so. Using the assist-light helps considerably but I never use that merely because no one like to look at a green light pointed at them when its dark and it rather takes away from the nature of these cameras - unobtrusive, quick, stealthy.<br/><br/>I've yet to test wifi features and such and have only played with the camera for the better part of a day. The original 2013 GR is the first camera I ever pre-ordered and I did not regret that decision. It doesn't seem that I'll regret this one either.  5-stars for initial impressions. I'll expand on this review in a few weeks or months after I've really gotten to know it. I love this camera line. A shooter's camera through and through.<br/>________________________<br/>Update (brief) 3/26/2019:<br/>Just wanted to ad a couple thoughts though I've still not had the opportunity to really test this thing. The wireless connectivity is proving fincky at best currently - evidently a major app update is coming from Ricoh in April which should address some issue. I really don't use these features so cannot speak to them well.<br/>The IBIS is fantastic and shots I've taken as high as ISO6400 are ridiculously good IQ, much more than expected. Previously I've held ISO to 800 (sometimes 1600 subject depending) but that has gone out the window. These cameras have *always* produced high-ISO noise that is far, far more pleasingly and film-grain-like as compared to other digital sensor/lens combinations found on any other camera, but now that is more true than ever. I was looking at 100% crops of images (both RAW and B&amp;W JPG, more on that in a moment) and simply marveling at the natural looking noise - it resembles film grain now more than ever (I'm still a film shooter about 90% of the time or more) and not only in B&amp;W JPG files... even RAW color transitions have a look to them that just "works" for me.<br/>The JPG filter modes have been expanded further, particularly the B&amp;W styles (4 or 5 different ones now, rather than just 2) and they look great.<br/>The touchscreen works great (even though I'm not a huge fan of touchscreen) and the added focus options related to it are quite handy. I particularly like the scroll-wheel addition on the former d-pad. It's lovely to use and I can see myself preferring it to the old toggle that has been removed.<br/>Overall, whilst going through menus and shooting options there've been a few times I've literally said aloud "oh wow - that was a good idea, Ricoh". So yeah, I'm enjoying this little beast.<br/><br/>UPDATE EDIT 4/27/2021<br/>Just a brief addition. I still have this camera and still love it. The Wi-fi transfer issues have all been worked out (the app isn't the prettiest but it's entirely functional and works very well, at least in my experience on Android). The battery life is certainly less than its predecessors but with 2 spares I've never found myself flat and stuck. Just a fantastic camera that deserves far, far more attention than has received.</span>

<span>If you are reading this, then you are probably very familiar with the GR -2, or you are considering this vs all the 4/3rds out there.<br/>So, let me get to the FYI's.<br/>Regarding this camera vs the IQ of the recent Pany G8 or the LX100-2....and Leica D-Lux 7 Honestly, all 3 are very similar.  The  Leica D-Lux 7 is the closest to the GR3, regarding IQ.<br/>Of the 3, the GR3 handles the best.<br/>The reality is this.....If you are looking to buy your 1st GR series, then get this one, as the IS makes it a no brainer at this price and according to it value, overall.<br/>Its true that not having any type of movable screen or EV is unfortunate, but, these will eventually show up in time, as they were left off this model so that later on they could be added for...$$$$$$<br/>Till then, this is a fine camera, handles well, feels well crafted.<br/>Downsides?..... The AF is not great in general, and even less in low light.<br/>Most surprising feature is that the Macro mode works really well.<br/>Bottom line : would be a perfect shooter for all seasons if it had a Tilt screen and an EVF.<br/>Till then, its a very nice camera, the price is not a gouge and you'll have a lot of fun with it.<br/>Its a fun camera overall that takes very nice photos.<br/>Mine is set to "P" Auto ISO, "Vivid", ND-on, all noise filtering set to "off", and upper ISOA1600....Sharpness on (2), Contrast and Saturation on "2", Touchscreen is "off", and Focus is on "center".<br/>One photo i posted is of the end of a branch that was cut. The size of the branch is about the size of your thump. The other is a 1x2" glass figurine, bright fluorescent light, "auto" ISO.<br/>This is a powerful tool that has a few solvable issues (EV and Tilt-Screen, Slow AF in dim light), but otherwise you'll enjoy it a lot.<br/>IQ is very good.<br/>Its a fun camera, easy to hold, and is very satisfying.</span>
