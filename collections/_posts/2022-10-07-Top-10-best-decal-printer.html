<span>Horrible product.  It was the perfect dimensions for my space and it was "HP", so I thought I couldn't go wrong.  In hindsight, it was RIDICULOUS to buy a printer without a display/touch screen - no messages, no options.  I have to guess why it's unwilling to make a copy or print a page.  The accompanying intrusive software is highly undesirable, but somewhat unavoidable.</span>

<span>I just had to say that I almost did not purchase this printer based on the many reviews stating how difficult the set-up was. My beloved Cannon printer had expired and family members recommended HP with their ink subscription. I wanted the HP Envy 6000e printer but it seemed like the set-up was going to be a nightmare based on comments from other purchasers. However, believing the best, I used HP Smart App on my desktop computer, followed its very clear directions, and was printing in no time at all! I was so surprised at the simplicity of set-up when using the HP Smart app. I do not know what problems other customers ran into- but really, I'm 75 years young and it could not have been easier. I tested printing duplexed articles, images, and photos. All crisp and beautiful! Now I have a ZIPPY and lovely HP Envy 6000e printer! Please don't hesitate to buy this printer because HP offers a lot of support should it be needed. I am quite pleased.</span>

<span>Just a basic printer, which is all we needed. It does, however, let you print remotely, which is nice to shave. There is no screen icon but have found out we really do not need it.  It also can print front and back if you want it to.</span>

<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>This honestly has to be one of the best printers i’ve tested so far. Its fast and reliable. I was looking for a printer to use in my home office and came across this and gave it a try and honestly don’t regret my decision. And to add to the positives it comes with 6 months of free ink which is a win win situation</span>

<span>Light weight and compact enough to not get in the way. Prints fast for me. Easy to assemble but to setup you will need to install the App on your phone or PC for it to work. If you have trouble printing right with Windows 10 it is due to MS update and there is a patch for it, the link in the app so you can install the driver. Wireless and you can print from anywhere to the printer. Also an option for HP+ and Instaink so they send you ink when you are low before you run out, you pick your plan on how many pages per month you use or change it whenever. Never run out of ink. The basic low end is only 99 cents a month!  You can choose to opt out of it. Cannot comment on durability and life because I just go it the other day. But with HP+ there is a 2 year warranty included.</span>

<span>I spent MONTHS reviewing budget printers for personal use at home.  I needed color, wanted something fairly small in size, didn't want to spend an arm and a leg, and wanted to keep ink replacement costs down as much as possible.  Just kept finding myself going back to HP, and finally settled on this one.  I found it pretty easy to set up.  Am using wifi to connect with printer in the same room, and so far no problems.  This was purchased just for home correspondence and color photos for making online sales.  For the price, it's pretty sturdy and I'm happy with the color quality.  The only thing I DON'T like is the fact that Hewlett Packard is now twisting the buyer's arms, restricting them from being able to use generic budget ink in HP printers, so that, over time, you're basically spending more to keep the printer going than you paid for the printer itself.  HP, SHAME ON YOU!!!</span>

<span>Bought this to replace an old Epson printer. Light weight. Small footprint. Installation through the HP Smart app was acceptable. Had to contact HP support for assistance.  There is very little documentation included with the unit.  Both color and black and white copy quality is good.  Wireless works very well once it is set up.  Scan quality is good with multiple options.  The scanner option is single page feed, but additional pages can be added through the app.  Both document and photo printed quality is good.  Print speed, however, is slower than it should be.  This unit is best for light personal use.  Would not recommend this unit for business use or heavy personal use. 1st set of inkjet cartridges through Instant Ink program arrived promptly.  Cost of the program and multiple options is a cost saver. This unit will serve my purposes very well. LCD panel informative and well designed.</span>

<span>Was easy to set up. I suggest you download the “HP Smart” app on every device you plan to print 🖨️ from. It makes it so much easier. I even downloaded the app to my kids devices so there is no issues. I placed the printer 🖨️ in the spare bedroom so that it’s easily accessible to all of us. That’s the best part of it being wireless.

<span>I'm a fairly new watercolor artist, and often people want my paintings. But I do a lot of commissions, so the originals go to the person who ordered the artwork. I ordered this printer because of the great reviews, and have used it a lot.<br/><br/>The big issue is the paper feeds. When I load the Epson Velvet Fine Art paper in the rear tray, it almost never feeds by itself. I have to stand there and push the paper into the feed. It doesn't help that the paper tray is at a bad angle to feed the paper, so I have to hold it more upright.<br/><br/>The front tray has issues, too, and I get a lot of paper jams.<br/><br/>The quality of the prints on the Epson Velvet paper, when I get them to actually print, is excellent. On regular copy paper, I do get some of those annoying stripes, no matter how much I align the print heads. Also, the ink costs a small fortune. But I am happy to be able to make my own prints.</span>

<span>I really love this printer! I got the pink one. It was sooo easy to set up. The instruction booklet was simple and fast. Installing the ink cartridges was easy (I had never done it before in this kind of printer) as well as everything else - extremely easy to set up and connect wirelessly to my laptop. You just follow the instructions in the book, then it gives you a website to go to and download the compatible software to your laptop from the official canon website - and then that's it. I set mine up by myself with ease. It looks amazing - prints well and with good quality - I just printed a cat photo on regular paper and it came out great. Printing photos on actual glossy photo paper improves the quality immensely - as I saw in a youtube video by a guy who tested this very printer. The only advice I would give is to package the printer more discreetly possibly with "FRAGILE" labels all over as it was delivered in it's standard canon box so everyone outside could see what it was. At the same time, they may do this so people handling the package at Amazon and with the mail people will handle the box accordingly. Not sure- I didn't really mind.. just something to note. Maybe try to have it delivered on a specific day so you can be home to grab it. I really really love my purchase and it will be perfect for my sophomore year of college for printing out papers I type and for printing study material and taking copies of textbooks etc. Really I needed it last year too - but I have it now!</span>

<span>I needed a printer for my crafting space. (I do photos, printable vinyl, etc.) Inwas initially drawn to this one because of the reortedly small desk footprint--I have a computer and a Cricut on my desk already so I was hoping for a small printer with good capability. I read reviews and did some research. I like that it's small and mighty, and that I can add an ink subscription via Dash. I kept coming back to this printer. I was originally looking for white. Longer story made shorter, I ended up getting the pink one AND it arrived in three days. I've printed 2 detailed shirt transfers and 3 waterslide decals from just the starter ink. (It is still not emptied BTW.)<br/><br/>To be fair I will list cons: the drivers on the included CD were in need of an update straight out of the box. Also I don't love that little paper tray. (It slides out but it doesn't slide back in as easily.) The printer did not include a data cable, but this was not major because I purchased one alongside anyway.<br/><br/>All in all, I really like this printer. I'm happy with its functionality. Very cute and perfect for the level of printing I do. (If you are a heavy hitter you definitely want to subscribe for ink or possibly go a grade up printerwise; just a heads-up.)</span>

<span>I sell a lot of items on Ebay and I recently purchased this printer for the sole purpose of creating 4x6 inch Ebay Shipping Labels on a Mac.  I was worried about whether I could get it to work because I've read about the various problems other people have been having getting it configured and the fact that Label Printers are not officially supported on the Mac. I'm pretty good at figuring things out so I took a chance and bought it.  Long story short, I had to come up with my own solution in the end, but I ultimately got it to work quite easily.  And I am now happily printing out perfect 4x6 inch Shipping Labels on a Mac.  The printer is working flawlessly and the labels I'm printing are perfect.  Therefore, this is a printer I highly recommend even if you're using a Mac. Below are the step-by-step instructions on how to got it to work:<br/><br/>*********<br/><br/>How To Print Perfect 4x6 Shipping Labels from Ebay usng the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL Printer and a Mac...<br/><br/>Most users selling items on Ebay already have their computer set up to print labels to their laser printer and to other kinds of printers, and for PC users, that also includes to Label Printers as well, such as the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer.  Unfortunately for Mac users, Label Printers are not officially supported.  The good news is, there is an easy way for Mac users to make use of the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer as well, and can easily print out perfect 4 inch by 6 inch shipping labels every single time. The following explains how...<br/><br/>For Mac users, when printing a label via Ebay, on the page that says "Purchase and Print USPS Postage", once you've clicked the button that says "Purchase Postage" to buy your label, a secondary page should open allowing you to print your label.  It is on that secondary page that we will choose certain options which will allow us to print directly to the DYMO Laserwriter 4XL printer with a Mac, and we can get perfect results every time. The following are my step-by-step instructions...<br/><br/>Step 1 - After clicking on the "Purchase Postage" button and arriving on the secondary page, click the button above the label window that says "Print Label".  This will open up a Print Dialog Box to allow you to select your printing options.  Note, we will NOT be printing from this particular Print Dialog Box at this time because we first have to "crop" the label.  To accomplish this, ignore all settings and options in the current Print Dialog Box.  Instead, at the bottom of the Print Dialog Box window, click the button that says "Preview".  This will open the entire label including your receipt in a separate window in Apple's Preview program.  We will now use the "Crop" tool in Apple's Preview program to "crop" the label from the page...<br/><br/>Step 2 - Once the label is open in Apple's Preview program, you may notice that it is now oriented sideways.  Don't worry about the orientation. It will still print correctly once we're done.  In Apple's Preview program, choose the rectangular selection tool and select the area around the label where you want it to be cropped (I generally select an area about a 1/4 inch around the entire label). Once the area has been selected, choose "Crop" from the Tool menu (this crops out the receipt and all other unnecessary portions of the page).  All that is left is your label, perfectly cropped, and ready for printing.  Note, before you proceed further, make sure your DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer is connected to your computer and turned on, and that all software has been installed...<br/><br/>Step 3 - From the File menu (still in Apple's Preview program) choose the "Print" command.  This opens up the Print Dialog box again.  We will now choose certain printing options in this dialog box...<br/><br/>a.  In the Print Dialog box, from the pull-down menu that says "Printer", choose the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL as your printer.  (Note, your DYMO LabelWriter 4XL must be connected and turned on at this time in order for it to show up under this menu)...<br/><br/>b.  VERY IMPORTANT - Under the pull-down menu for "Paper Size", scan down through the list of sizes and choose the preset that says: "1744907 4 in x 6 in".  This option will match your cropped label to the 4 inch x 6 inch labels in the 4XL printer (otherwise, it will print at the wrong size).<br/><br/> c.  ALSO IMPORTANT - Under the Scaling Options, choose the "Scale to Fit" option and also the "Print Entire Image" option (this scales your label image down to fit within the 4 in x 6 in label space without any portion of it being cropped off).<br/><br/>d.  Under the pull-down menu that says "Preview", pull down the menu and choose "DYMO Options".  For the "Print Quality" setting, change the menu from "Text Only" to "Barcode and Graphics".  For the "Print Density" setting, change the menu from "Low" to "High" (this tells the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL to print the label with maximum density and with maximum contrast).<br/><br/>e.  All options have now been set.  We are now ready to print.  Click the "Print" button at the bottom of the window.  Your DYMO 4XL printer should begin printing, and should print out a perfect 4x6 shipping label every single time...<br/><br/>By following the above, I've been happily printing out perfect 4x6 shipping labels from Ebay using a DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer and a Mac.  And it's been working without a hitch...<br/><br/>**********<br/><br/>IMPORTANT UPDATE:  For those of you who are using the Mac program Garage Sale when selling items on Ebay, an excellent shipping option to complement Garage Sale is the shipping program called "Endicia" (it costs about $16 per month).  Not only does Endicia provide direct USPS Parcel Select support (which Ebay won't offer until March), but I've also learned that Endicia is fully integrated into Garage Sale.  Meaning, once you have both Garage Sale and Endicia installed on your computer, and you then make an Ebay sale, in the Inspector Palette of Garage Sale there is an option you can choose which allows you to "ship the item with Endicia".  By choosing that option from within Garage Sale, Garage Sale will then automatically find and launch your Endicia application, and the best part of all is that (...GET THIS!!!...) when Endicia opens, it will already be pre-populated with all your Ebay sale data!  That's right, you won't have to copy and paste anything because all your Ebay details for the transaction will already be imported into Endicia and you'll be ready to print your label.  All you have to do is just verify everything you see, make any changes needed, and then Print your shipping label.  It's so easy.  And did I mention that the Endicia for Mac program also offers direct support for the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer.  That's right.  Ebay doesn't offer any Label Printer support for Mac users, Paypal doesn't offer it, Stamps.com doesn't offer it, but Endicia DOES!  There is a preference option in the Endicia for Mac program where Mac users can now print directly to the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer without any fuss or problems at all.  I've been printing 4x6 labels using Endicia and the 4XL and it's been working like a charm.  The 4x6 shipping labels are coming out perfect (even better than printing them via Ebay as outlined above).  Endicia and Garage Sale are like a match made in heaven.  I've found very few things otherwise to complain about.  If you want a great Ebay shipping option solution that truly works on a Mac and is designed for a Mac, then Garage Sale and Endicia and the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer is your ticket.</span>

<span>Bottom line move up the larger version of this, the 37 or 4700 series.  Pay the money, it's worth it.<br/>This 2760 was great for about one year and then started having issues, freezing up, etc.  We did all the upgrades, etc. Never got through the first load of ink on that one and the touch screen was painfully small and hard to use. Got frustrated and moved up to the 4760 with no regrets.  More ink, MUCH better touch screen size and layout.  Will stay with Epson due to the eco tank option, no rip off ink cartridges, etc.  Next time your brand X ink cartridge goes dry, crack it open and see how small the ink chamber volume actually is!</span>

<span>I purchased this for my small business so I can start printing things in-house. Using the settings for plain paper was horrible, so I had to change to photo glossy and that helped with the resolution. The print looks great, but it took FOREVER to print (~5 min per sheet). Thankfully I'm printing low volumes, so this is a minor inconvenience.<br/><br/>Also, Epson is really pushing for the Wifi printing for this printer, but connecting the printer to the network has been so unreliable. If the printer goes to sleep, it loses wifi connection and I have to go through connecting it to the network all over again in between prints. I got so frustrated with the connectivity problems that I ended up just getting a wire to directly connect to my computer. Now jobs are sent really quickly.</span>

<span>I’ve been a fan of Epson printers for many years, based on my ownership of an Epson Workforce 633 for over 8 years.  I purchased refillable catridges and a chip resetter that kept my printing costs WAY down.  I printed a BUNCH of stuff on that printer.  The printer outlasted 3 kids through High School and College and printed forms for our photography business (Wedding contracts, order forms, etc.) and even custom DVD labels that looked VERY professional.<br/><br/>So, when my Workforce 633 finally refused to print, I looked for another Epson as a replacement.  Luckily, Epson now has a line of printers that you can refill with ink without purchasing 3rd party components.  Welcome the Epson Ecotank series of printers!<br/><br/>I looked at the Epson EcoTank ET-2720 and ET-2760 as possible options (I’m thrifty and my printing needs are NOT that elaborate).  The latter was about $30 more, and I opted for that model.  The main reason I selected the ET-2760 is that automatic double sided printing is supported.<br/><br/>The printer arrived quickly, as most Amazon Prime shipments do.  Unpacking involved removing a lot of tape that secures the printer in the box for shipment.  Unboxing and setup are super quick and easy.  The longest part of getting ready is filling the EcoTank with the supplied ink.<br/><br/>The total time from start to printing out my first document from my computer was about 30 minutes.  I was taking pictures during the unboxing and installation with my phone, so probably a bit slower than other reviewers.  I followed the steps outlined in the “Start here” guide and you should too.  Especially where it mentions “do not drink the ink”.  Seriously, it’s there under setp 2’s warning section.  So, I heeded their warning, although I was tempted to take a sip (No, not really).  Notice that you don’t connect the printer or turn it on until after the ink tanks have been filled and the printer drivers and utilities are installed on your computer.<br/><br/>A few more notes on setting up your printer if you utilize the wireless option.  If your router has dual band capabilities – i.e it broadcasts in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz - make sure you select the 2.4 GHz connection.  And, if you’re running software that monitors and allows/disallows connections through your firewall (HIGHLY recommended), don’t forget to allow access for the setup to complete successfully.<br/><br/>So, how does the printer perform?  Very well if your expectations are in line.<br/>Setting up voice activated printing was easy, but a little tedious.  Like most other devices that connect to Alexa – like our Wyze Cams and our Whirlpool microwave/oven combo – you have to enable the proper Alexa skill and perform a few more steps before use.  Then, you have to setup your printer to an “Epson Connect” account.  You’ve hopefully already completed this step when you setup your printer drivers and utilities.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, this printer supports voice activated printing.  What actually does that mean?  Well, as HUGE fans of the Amazon Alexa devices, it does provide some interesting “neat” features, although I’m not sure how often we’ll actually use them.  We have, at last count, 6 Alexa devices in the house, ranging from Echo Dots to the Echo Show (2nd gen).  So, you can do things like “Alexa, ask Epson Printer to print my shopping list…” or “Alexa, Ask Epson Printer to print my calendar”.  Of course, don’t forget to include “Ask Epson printer”, or you’ll confuse Alexa.  But, this isn’t really necessary for me, as I use the Alexa shopping list and to do list on my phone and don’t need a printed copy in hand.  The same goes for my my Google calendar or to do list.  But, if we were printing a calendar for the family fridge, that might be a cool feature!<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can point to about this printer is the paper capacity (But, after reading the reviews, I already KNEW that).  It says 100 sheets, but that’s a stretch.  I’ve found that anything more than say 35 pieces of white copy paper will not work without an issue.  You’ve been warned.<br/><br/>So, am I happy with the printer?  After a few weeks of use, I can say that things are really going well.  We’ve printed about 250-300 pages thus far.  This includes several wedding contracts awaiting signatures, bridal fair wedding package handouts on high quality resume paper and professional looking DVD labels for the DVDs we’re handing out at the bridal fair later this month.  All of the print looks AWESOME and the colors are true to what’s on my monitor.  If anything changes, I’ll update the review and adjust the star rating if necessary.</span>

<span>I read many reviews on different brands of printers and chose this one. I'm 63 and I found it easy to set up with no problems, I did not encounter any of the ridiculous complaints that are in some of these reviews. However, I've dealt with computers since the days I had to write MS-DOS batch files in order to get my old IBM AT PC to do anything. This is my first Epson printer since the dot matrix days when Epson ruled the world. I have used Canon, and then HP printers, since inkjet printers became reliable in the early 90s, and now I just refuse to pay a minimum of $150 for a complete set of cartridges for my HP. I only have three things negative to say about this printer: 1) the brilliance of the ink is not as good as HP, although the print quality is excellent in terms of the definition of characters in lines, the blue and red inks are just not as bright doesn't have the snap to them that HP ink has. I'm sure the Epson ink engineers could easily change that. 2) if they are going to insist that the printer update the firmware during the set up process, then the firmware process should work. I tried twice and the firmware update failed, that should be a pretty simple process they could've worked out by now because I noticed that same complaint was on a review several months back as well as some YouTube reviews I watched. Apparently Epson is not paying attention to its customers. Firmware controls everything this printer does and could probably even fix my complaint about the ink without any changes to the ink itself. 3) The touchscreen is a little small and hokey, you really need a stylus unless you have very small fingers, but once you're through the initial set up process of putting in date time etc., I can't see that I would need to use it a lot.<br/><br/>During the set up process don't be alarmed by the amount of noise the printer makes, once you start printing it's no more noisier than any other inkjet printer and in fact it's much smoother and quieter than my current big heavy HP 87xx printer which shakes the table as it prints.<br/><br/>After two days I can't say I've used it a whole lot, maybe about 50-75 pages so far, which includes high quality 22 pound paper, and 110 pound card stock that I used to make checklist for my job as a flight instructor. I encountered absolutely no problems with double sided printing or the card stock. I do print a lot, that's why I have chosen the ink tank printers this time around and I will probably order the print head cleaning kit that will also remove bubbles from the ink tank lines, which will cause the printer to stall and not print a certain color  when it encounters an air bubble in the line. Removing air bubbles and cleaning the printhead looks like a pretty simple process from the videos I watched. I think it would be handy to have on hand since it's relatively inexpensive, rather than waiting several days to order one when you encounter the problem, which I'm sure it will happen to all of us at some point in the future.<br/><br/>I did not rate tech support because I have not used it and I don't have any other Epson products to reference.  I'm sure, or I would certainly hope, if I did call them they would give me a workaround process to update the firmware since the printer obviously isn't going to do it on its own.<br/><br/>Like everyone else, Epson is playing "invasion of the body snatchers," by asking you to give them permission to search your computer during the set up and registration process, to find all your software and products so it can improve the operation of your Epson printer, with the promise that it will not transmit or collect any of your personal information. It may not collect your personal data and passwords, but trust me, their software will gather every thing it can find about you so they know your every move on your PC, everything you search for on Amazon, FB, TickTock or Google by collecting those cookies, so that they can then target you for advertising etc. etc., and even though your name and personal information may not be attached... they will sell it. I'm sure that is the primary goal...it's not to assist their printer work better on your PC as stated. So my advice is don't give them permission together any of your information on your computer usage.<br/><br/>Overall if you're looking for a fantastic printer that's lightweight, this baby is first class.</span>
