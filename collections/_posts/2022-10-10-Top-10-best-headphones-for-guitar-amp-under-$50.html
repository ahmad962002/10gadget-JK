Offering the easiest way to enjoy true analog amplifier sound in your headphones, the amPlug series has been a bestseller since it first appeared in 2007. With amPlug G2, the crucial analog circuit has been drastically improved, and each model now provides three modes. Guitar types provide multi-effect functionality, and a rhythm function has been added to the bass type. A foldable plug mechanism that rotates 180 degrees and an auto power-off function are additional features that contribute significantly to improved convenience and ease of use. The amPlug is the simplest way to get serious sound; occupying virtually no space, it's an ideal choice for any guitarist or bassist.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love the fact that I can toss on my cans and BASSically (see what I did there? That's wit.) Be totally mobile. I could walk down around my yard and practice. Sounds stupid but it is so liberating. I could also have a decent portable Bluetooth speaker with an 1/8 inch jack and do the same thing sans headphones. I highly reccomend this to any bassist or guitarist that doesn't have an acoustic to practice with. It's so nice to not be tethered to my amp or pc to practice with 'phones.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It's small and portable, great for late night practice. Sound quality is great but hard to remember functions without reading the tiny booklet.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>When I opened the package and I saw the item I was not very impressed. It did come with batteries but they looked like they had been smashed. I went ahead and put a couple of new batteries in it even though I was hesitant. I plugged it into my guitar and plugged my headphones into it. "WOW". I couldn't believe how good it sounded. Then to top it all off it has like 24 different sound effects. So all I can say is it's true, you can't judge a book by it's cover</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>With the volume all the way up the amp provides just barely adequate listening volume. I thought the batteries included with the amp might be low, so I tried brand new alkaline batteries with the same result. The amp also has really loud "hiss" - a truly annoying amount, enough to complete with your bass sound.  You can reduce the hiss by turning the tone control all the way down, but then you lose the top end. Would I buy it again? Definitely not for this price. This thing is $55. For $80 you can buy a Fender Rumble 15. I am really disappointed with the sound quality of this headphone amp. I expected much better from VOX.</span>

<span>These phones are Insanely awesome.<br/>I DJ, am of German decent and live in Wisconsin, so yeah, Sennheiser and Koss are the HOLY GRAIL of phones, but at the price and sound, SONY comes in there fighting and wins, ding ding ding.<br/><br/>When Koss had that issue some years back (embezzlement) and went downhill and I needed a new pair I went with Sony, cause yeah, they still made stack Turntables  and HOLY CRAP Cassette players (now everyone makes turntables).<br/>Sony and Panasonic stuck in the game, so I turn to them.<br/>Sennheiser are like BOSS who lead the pack, but so much out of the region of what can be afforded, they almost cancel themselves out.<br/>DJs don't make alot of money, but NEED true sound with the option to hear outside, and these are wicked.<br/>Each earpiece flips away from the ear, the band stays strong to the head if moved of an ear, sure, the cord doesn't disconnect, but the cord is CRAZY long and only the one.<br/>Had my pair for 4 or 5 years now (can't remember, which is GOOD) and have not had to go in and solder new connections (like I did with my Koss).<br/>These are GREAT phones, the packaging alone makes you feel like you are someone of importance, hahaha.<br/><br/>By the way, there are cases to store them in out there.<br/><br/>I dropped stars for "Travel" cause without a case, the cord is seriously long.</span>

<span>the good.<br/>for $75, it is a good equipment for general purpose recording, film or music.<br/>sound revealing headset.<br/>It has a smile frequency response; not flat and not neutral.<br/>sound is geared toward the bright side.<br/>fairly well built and can last many years for sound engineers.<br/>The ear cup works well for noise  isolation.<br/><br/>the bad.<br/>it doesn’t sound anywhere liked a beat for bass heavy or at50 for strong vocals and acoustics. .<br/>the mid for vocals is weak and singer will have to really really work on singing, liked control diaphragm and vocal canel.  but isn’t that what any good  singer  will do.<br/>the bass is there; not accurate.  given the sound is on the bright side, some people will get tire from listening for a long time.<br/>feels cheap; just like cans in this price range.  Ears gets warm.  People thrown it around will not find it long lasting, esp, people burn these cans with lighter and lighter fluid.<br/>there is no noise cancellation.</span>

My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because the V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered ($30 cheaper than the 7506's), and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.<br/><br/>These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of "over-the-ear" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensive </span>

<span> for occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first "quality" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.<br/><br/>Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have found:<br/><br/>- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone "for Digital", and the 7506 has blue stickers "Professional". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.<br/>- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but  if this is true - and I am not able to confirm whether or not it is - then maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).<br/>- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: "both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number."<br/>- The box for the 7506 states "neodimium magnet". The operating instructions included with the V6 state "samarium cobalt magnet". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.<br/>- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.<br/>- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.<br/><br/>UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]<br/><br/>According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:<br/><br/>- MDR-7506:<br/>  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity<br/><br/>- MDR-V6:<br/>  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity<br/><br/>I am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And I do believe that the two headphones have slightly different sound.<br/><br/>Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The "professional" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.<br/><br/>I've been using these headphones with the </span>

<span>, and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.<br/><br/>As a final comment, some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time, and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort. I also purchased a pair of </span>

<span> for this reason, and although I have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the Sony headphones, I do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort, as well as replace them when they have become worn (some owners use these headphones for many years).<br/><br/>I notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones, many of them long-time owners who feel very strongly that these Sony headphones are the best. I'm just beginning to use them, but I have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that I will continue to be as satisfied with them as I am today.</span>

<span>I love my Tascam headphones and its 9.5 foot chord! Yes, Tascam may not be the top brand on the market and I’m certainly not what you would call audiophile, but the sound quality and comfort is comparable to some of the big name brands for a fraction of the cost and depending on your needs. Prior to my purchase, I never heard of the Tascam brand. I usually stick with Sennheiser or Sony but price was my motivator.<br/><br/>Design/build: They have the look and feel of lightweight studio headphones. But… Everything nowadays is plastic and ditto for the headphones. The over-the-head band is plastic with soft foam like material for cushioning. The earcups (ditto) are plastic with the same foam material. They look good and are decently built. I do love the 9.5 foot chord and 3.5mm to 1/4" Adapter so I’m not tethered to sitting in front of my home studio.<br/><br/>Comfort. The ear and head cushions are comfortable and a perfect fit for my size head. The clamping pressure of the headband is mild. They are tight enough to stay on for long periods of time without getting a pressure headache. As over-the-head headphones that rest on ear are concerned, I have found them rather comfortable after 5+ hours (daily) and even after having fallen asleep wearing them on several occasions. The headphones survived and so did my ears with no discomfort the next morning!<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling? Nope. Since the headphones met my price point I never considered “noise cancelling” as a must have feature. The headphones are not “noise cancelling” (so don’t expect to “tune out” your barking dog or TV set), on the other hand, anyone near to you will not be too bothered by your music so I guess it does provide some noise blocking.<br/><br/>Movies, audiobooks and radio: My listening experience is 5-6 hours a day of mixed media. I have found music, vocals and speech to come in clear with a nice balance. They are exceptional for casual listening.<br/><br/>Audio mixing and editing:  I use audition &amp; cakewalk for personal projects and have found them suitable for my purposes, BUT I would caution against using these for serious professional work. If cost is not an issue, I would definitely consider upgrading.<br/><br/>Gaming. Great sound.<br/><br/>Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. As they say, you get what you pay for. For once, I can honestly say you’re getting a better value for the price which just doesn’t happen much anymore. These are a great price, good value, portable, durable, and good sound quality at a price that’s hard to beat. I’m assuming you don’t have money to burn if you are considering these, so take a chance. I think you will be satisfied with the purchase.</span>

<span>Very happy with these ATH-M20X headphones. I bought them to get a sample of what the ATH-M50X might generally sound like.  I prefer these to my Sennheiser HD 599 SE which cost 3x more. The ATH-M20X have the mids and to a certain extent the highs which are missing from the HD 599's. If you want to hear ALL the music these are for you. I love hearing accentuations I've never heard in recordings I've listened to many times before. If you like bass heavy don't buy these. They aren't lacking in bass, the just aren't bass heavy.</span>

<span>If you are looking for the most posh, comfortable headphones ever, with the most outstanding sound, you may want to pass these up. But if you need a solid set of great sounding headphones, for doing studio work, or for some casual listening, I don't see how you can go wrong with these. They sound very crisp and clean, and reasonably rich, even when using no equalizer settings to assist them. But they do fall a bit short of having "upper end" headphone sound quality.  But you don't expect to get that kind of sound with less than 25 dollar headphones. But the sound they do create, seems much better than I would have expected for  the price I paid. And to me, they are larger than they appeared on the promotional photo, which is also good.<br/>But they are inexpensive headphones, and as such they do have some of the drawbacks usually found in  cheaper headphones.<br/>Firstly, they wear a bit tight, and a bit hot. And no amount of adjusting I tried seemed to help. So you may want to try something else more comfortable, which probably means more expensive, for longer listening sessions.  Also, I was surprised to find that they do knock out some of the outside ambient noise. But they aren't like some of the ones that cancel almost all of it out. And I wouldn't expect that from these either. But I was pleasantly surprised that there is a decent, or a measurable degree of noise cancelling with these.<br/>And I like the "L" plug in's much better. than the straight in type plugs. But in the defense of these headphones, the cord is heavy enough, and the transition seems well designed, so this should not be an issue for years to come.<br/>And another positive is, that the jack worked on my cellphone, right away, even with my case on it, which for me is rare, for any out of the box larger headphones.  Usually I have to do some carving on the end of the rubber part of jack, to trim them down, so they jack will go through that smaller hole in my phone case,  which is frustrating. But these plugged right into my phone, case and all, the first thing, with no modifications needed.<br/>And maybe these deserve 5 stars, for the money.  But I reserve 5 stars for top notch products only. And since the comfort level is a factor on these, and I don't want to seem to be misleading peopel, so 4 stars it is.</span>

<span>I bought these on a slight discount for $14. Previously, I'd owned a pair of Audio-Technica ATH M40x headphones. A swivel joint broke after nearly 6 years of use, and those Audio-Technicas currently run nearly ten times the price, and I kid you not, provide similar audio quality to these Beringers. These headphones also have the added benefit of being light, and adequately comfortable in my experience, and I have a big head. No noticable aches after nearly a dozen hours of consistent use.<br/>My only complaint is that the chord is somewhat short, but that can be fixed with an aux extension. The design is simple and effecive, no gimmicks here. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.</span>

<span>I was looking for a usable set of headphones to mix audio with, these have suited me just fine. They aren't the most comfortable headphones, but for the price it's understandable. They are designed to have a flat response curve so you can hear the actual frequency curve, there not designed to exaggerate the low end and sparkle the high, they present what is actually there, so don't purchase if your looking for headphones that tamper with the frequency curve. All in all, if used for what they're intended for they are a solid set of the under 100.00 range.</span>

<span>They are great for listening music. But if you are producing, Tascam TH-02 are better. Still, this are very very good.</span>

<span>This was a good purchase. I have a large head, and while the strap rests on my head, it isn't uncomfortable. Sound quality is good, I use them to watch movies late at night. I can get all the way through the movie with very little discomfort on my ears, too. I don't like inner ear headphones, and the other type fall out, so these are perfect for my use</span>

<span>Work great for my metal detector, came with an adaptor.  The coiled cable is also great, keeps cable out of the way when digging a signal.<br/><br/>Pretty comfortable wearing for long periods, and also fit snuggly so they dont fall off while digging or moving.<br/><br/>Mostly metal construction, pretty solid headset.<br/><br/>One con is the plastic that holds the earpieces to the headband seems a bit flimsy or just loose but has not affected use YET.</span>

<span>caliphone's headphones at first were more curious to me then anything:they are clearly built like the classic tour guide\official educational center\learning disability techroom headset: all the way down to the individual level adjustment and mono\stereo switches...caliphone even produces jacboxes to allow up to 8 of these headsets to plug at once to the same audio source,which i honestly think is amazing.<br/><br/>i came to hear about these headphones from a friend of mine: much like many other parents who lived in my previous country: his kids were grounded at home due to the many lockdowns that happened in 2020. so,this father of 5 bought these headsets and the jackbox: allowing his similar aged kids to watch their classroom zooms on the same computer. at the same time,he did something similar with his kid's gaming room: basically plugging  5 of these on a jackbox connected to the same game console so he and the misses could watch their tv in peace as the kids all enjoyed the game through headphones.<br/><br/>i tried one of these on at their place and was honestly interested: i haven't seen headphones like these since i visited a few european museums back in '05. so,with my recent move: i decided to get one of these headphone.<br/><br/>i plugged them in to my home pc along with a cb radio speaker,both set to mono...and i was hooked: these headphone are in fairly good quality and for a really comfortable price range: i'm geniunly considering getting a similar jackbox setup for when our kids grow up  to be noisy playstation gamers.<br/><br/>and i personally still use these headphone to this day for casual use  and as someone who mostly listens to mono audio: these headphones really hit the spot.<br/><br/>the build quality is also pretty wonderful: just what you expect from a blast-from-the-past style headset like this.<br/><br/>i highly recommend this to anyone who's into 1950-early 70's mono recordings,casual mono listeners,people who want a sturdy headset for their casual phone use or even someone like my friend,who has a gaggle of kids all of whom make insane noise on their game consoles. the sky is really the limit with this one.</span>
