<span>I purchased this product over a year ago, and can't believe how much easier it is to track multiple documents, edit and teach classes now from my Dell 17" laptop. The only challenge I have had with it is, almost doubled the weight of my laptop, and depending on how far back I have the screen tipped, I need to place a support under the corner to keep it from drifting down.<br/>I have had no performance issues with the monitor or computer due to the magnets used for mounting the Trio screen. As an author and educator, it is easy to spend 8 hours a day on the computer - if there was any reliability or saftey, I would have found it by now. I plan on upgrading to a blue tooth version with the next laptop purchase.</span>

<span>Quick backstory, I'm a video game developer. I got 2 of these for my 17.5" laptop so I can continue development when I'm away from my main computer, or if I want to be somewhere else in the house during the pandemic.<br/><br/>They'll get the job done. but don't expect it to be like your main laptop monitor.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1920x1080 FHD (Full HD)<br/>Removable adapter for USB-C to USB-A<br/>Slim profile<br/>Easily tucks away behind the screen.<br/>Easy to connect to Windows. (Don't know about Mac, I think you need a driver)<br/><br/>Cons: (There's a lot, and I'm not exaggerating)<br/><br/>1. The magnets, can't hold the screen up because the screens weigh just over 2 lbs each, and when it's extended. the offset of the weight can't be supported by the magnets. but the plates stay on.<br/><br/>2. If you have vents on the back of your computer and you don't MacGyver it like I did, and I assume like they did in their super 'slick'... sorry, misleading video. It's not going to stay on. I had to go get double sided picture tape (the foam square one) just to give it enough grip to stay on without sliding around the back.<br/><br/>3. There's no way it's 60 hertz, because the screen lag/mouse lag suggests it's being processed to 60. I also, assume it's because I had to use the adapters in a C to A hub, just to get it to work. but there's severe ghosting even with a direct connection from the monitor to the USB-C port using the c to c cable they provided. So if you're thinking of using this as anything other than a travel monitor, i'd look somewhere else. I tested my switch. Again, ghosting of the textures. (If you don't know what ghosting is, essentially it's screen blur/trails/tails of texture, because the screen can't refresh fast enough) the x and y pixel refresh rates aren't synced and it's as if they just used low budget tablet monitors. What make this a suspicion is that there's literally 4 white dots that have been burned into the screen image when I turned on one of them, and I've already asked for a replacement.<br/><br/>4. The clips that are supposed to hold the two monitors together allows the backplates to slide. I don't know if that's an intended feature. but it doesn't stay put especially for a larger laptop. So it's extremely annoying. but thankfully back to the foam square double sided picture tape, it fits perfectly in both ends of the clip. and it keeps it from moving.<br/><br/>5. This is specifically for those who buy two monitors. Going back to the screen weight. these screens together, weigh more than your laptop. so unless you have a very sturdy screen hinge, and a way to weigh-down the base of your laptop. I DO NOT suggest getting two of these. luckily i have an extremely stiff screen hinge. but I had to again, use double sided foam tape to 'glue' my laptop to it's external fan plate, so that it had enough counter weight.<br/><br/>6. This product is extremely overpriced for what it is. I'm going to be testing a few things on this over the next month to see if i can improve it. but it in NO WAY deserves the rating it has, and if what I've said isn't a problem to you, then sure. spend $300. because you're essentially paying an additional $120+ for a cheap piece of plastic, 4 magnets, and 4 plates, that don't work.<br/><br/>7. The hinge that clips the monitor into place when extended, isn't able to support the parallel weight of the monitor, so it sags.<br/><br/>Personally. I don't mind it being permanent. like i said, I NEED the real estate. but between the refresh rates, the ghosting, and the sagging. I literally cannot recommend this product, and will most likely be returning it if it doesn't improve with drivers and tweaking the screen settings.</span>

<span>I really love this set up. Functionally it being attached to my laptop itself is great - I had a standalone travel monitor and disliked the extra space needed to use it. This makes it a lot easier to travel with and the set up is extremely easy and the quality of image is perfect for daily working tasks. I want to love this so much! BUT it won't stay glued/stuck together. I've had to reinstall/attach two magnets because the stickiness didn't hold. And now the metal plate on the monitor that attaches has become detached and won't hold causing the monitor to be uneven but more so causing me worry it won't stay on. I've used the supplied extra sticky dots for the magnets as well as the metal plate it just doesn't seem to hold.... I'll probably have to superglue the metal plate back onto the monitor. I'm annoyed but going to try to make it work.</span>

<span>I love using this product,  so convenient but make sure to get on size less by measuring your monitor especially if you have one of those thin laptop display.<br/><br/>The manufacturer Customer service team  were really helpful and responsive when I needed more adhesive and wire.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/><br/>1) Responsive Customer service.<br/><br/>2) I can work from any where using this device (car, hospital lobby, and my garage.<br/><br/>2) Quality felt the same as regular monitor. In fact, I didn't need to use a desk monitor for a month.<br/><br/>Improvements:<br/><br/>1) The kick stand  can be improved or video tutorial on how to hook it up would be great.<br/><br/>2) USB cable can be more sturdy but the  manufacturer customer service were responsive and send  a new one.</span>

<span>Mine had a problem with the HDMI which apparently didn't work from day one but I didn't realize it for few months because I was using the USB C connection and by that time, the return period was over.  I contacted Amazon but that was just a waste of time.  I then called the support line through Lepow's website directly.  After sending them a pictures of the issue and few emails back and forth, I had a new unit sent to me within a week.  I would say the service was great and they were pretty prompt on getting back to me on every email response I sent.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with the unit and use it often during the week.  USB C works really well and requires no additional power.  HDMI connection makes it very convenient to connect to lots of things including Raspberry PI's.</span>

<span>Great monitor that gets power from the USB-C directly off of my MacBook Pro.  Fits perfectly next to it in my Laptop bag.  Includes a Mini HDMI to HDMI and USB-C to USB-A Power cord + power brick as well.  They also included a plastic screen protector in the package which is why I only gave this 4 stars... there was no way to get this on the display without bubbles.  I am pretty good with these things but the lip around the display makes it near impossible to put on the screen protector... I ended up throwing it away after several attempts (now just run it without it).  If this needs the screen protector I wish they would have put it on at the factory.  Other than that snafu... this is a great little monitor!</span>

<span>This is a preliminary review of a pretty decent screen. (Updated with a comparison to the Viotek LinQ P16C at the end.) I bought it for business travel and took it on the road once before I returned it. Quality is akin to what you'd expect to see from a panel in a ~$600 semi-premium laptop. I'm running it from the mini-HDMI port with power provided by either my 2016 Dell laptop's USB 3.0 port or the included 5V/2A USB adapter. No USB-C testing yet.<br/><br/>It comes with three cables and a case. The cables are sufficient quality and resemble Monoprice's house brand products.<br/><br/>USB A -&gt; USB C (3')<br/>HDMI -&gt; Mini-HDMI (3')<br/>USB C -&gt; USB C (3')<br/><br/>There's also a screen protector, but I don't know why you'd want it on a non-touch matte screen.<br/><br/>The case looks and feels like an oversized version of $15 magnetic iPad folding cases. Quality is fine, but unlike those cases, this one doesn't attach to the screen. It's more like a binder or folio. It gently sticks to the screen's metal backing, but if you hold it open-side down, the screen may fall out.<br/><br/>In use, there's more than enough friction to keep the screen up at a variety of angles in horizontal viewing mode. However, because the base of the screen has to rest on one of the case notches, there's always at least 1.5" of case protruding forward (or 3" if you don't fold it back on itself). If, like me, you position the screen to the right of your laptop and use an external mouse, the case will limit your room to move.<br/><br/>There's no facility for portrait viewing, and this isn't feasible anyway with mini-HDMI; that cable exits one short side and the other short side has a protruding adjustment knob.<br/><br/>Viewing angles are excellent. Typical IPS. Screen reflectance is also typical for a matte screen: quite low. The A/G coating, if it exists, is minimal and does not cause sparkling or crunchy text. No complaints about sharpness, though the onscreen control range seems to go from blurry (0) to correct (4, the max value), rather than the more typical blurry to oversharpened halo mess. There's a smidge of backlight bleed near the bottom of my panel, but not enough to notice in use. Linearity in both brightness and white balance is very good.<br/><br/>Absolute brightness is lower than expected. The native panel white balance is a very blue 8800K, and that's where you'll see maximum output approaching 300 cd/m. Using the onscreen channel balance controls to bring temperature down to 6000K reduced this to 200 cd/m or so. More than adequate for indoor use with light control, but a bit dim if you're working near large windows. One annoyance is that inner bezel immediately abutting the screen is reflective aluminum; if you're viewing from even a slight angle in a lit environment, it distracts from the picture.<br/><br/>A second annoyance is that the brightness tends to reset to 30 if my Windows 10 laptop goes to the lock screen. (It's been suggested that setting 'High Performance' in Windows power settings will prevent this; TBD. Battery life is likely to take a hit.) Extended sessions, it's fine, but CTRL-L and come back and it's likely to be dim again. Rather than fixing this with the fiddly adjustment joystick, you can install a program like ClickMonitorDDC to adjust the brightness with a keyboard shortcut. (A third annoyance is that the monitor doesn't correctly interpret DDC signals; sending '100' via the program sets brightness to 255 (off scale); you need to tell it to send 39.)<br/><br/>Color gamut is bad: only about 55% of sRGB according to my EyeOne calibrator, though the dullness is uniform across all three color channels. Native color accuracy is very good. A forty-minute calibration brought the average error down to a stellar 0.7dE, though on previewing the profile, it was almost indistinguishable from the pre-calibration picture. It's a close match for my three 27" 4K LG screens and doesn't look out of place alongside them. Still, sRGB is the most common display gamut; if you edit photos or video on this screen, everyone else will see more saturated colors from the end result.<br/><br/>The major screen controls are Brightness, Contrast, Black Level, Sharpness, and RGB controls for color temperature presets. Exactly what the second two do is unique to this screen. They both affect the white point, black point, and gamma curve. To get blacks and whites in the right place, expect to do some twiddling. I ended up at Contrast 40, Black Level 50, though the values were different when I drove the screen from my laptop.<br/><br/>There isn't much overclocking headroom. I could only drive it to 63hz; not worth the bother. Input lag is minimal. Slightly less than my LG screens (despite running those 10hz faster) and barely perceptible with my wireless Logitech mouse. Power draw is modest: no more than 10W, and probably nearer to half that. My Dell's battery life dropped from 5 hours to 3 hours when powering the screen.<br/><br/>To digress a moment to the actual utility of this screen: it's terrific. Windows 10's multiple desktops are no substitute for a second monitor. Probably +50% productivity. I'm so used to working with larger screens that I initially considered traveling with a real one at 20" or above, but that turned out unnecessary. 15.6" is perfectly adequate at the closer viewing distances typical of laptop use.<br/><br/>That's it for now. I think this screen is good value. Good inherent picture quality, proper onscreen controls, and no obvious gaps in quality. I'd like it be brighter, but based on what I'm seeing from reviews of competing screens, there are a lot of pitfalls this one avoided.<br/><br/>After using this one for a week, I bought the Viotek LinQ P16C to compare. The two panels are similar in brightness and quality. Similar limitations in color gamut and portrait viewing, and I assume (based on other reviews) the same quirk with resetting brightness. However, the Viotek is a bit smaller, has a thinner and non-reflective bezel, and has a case stand with more adjustment range that doesn't protrude forward. The only thing I don't like (on first impression) is the piano black rear facade that'll inevitably become scratched in use. Otherwise, I'd take it over this LePow.</span>

<span>I purchased the Xebec dual portable monitor screens and after I received them the screens were too small and the brightness was very dull.  I sent this product back.  After doing more research for a good portable monitor, I found the Mobile Pixels Trio monitor on Amazon.<br/><br/>I was excited to receive the monitor and after I set up the monitor to my laptop I was not disappointed.  Great value for the money.  The screen is a good size for a portable monitor and the brightness is good, could be better, but better than the Xebec product.  If you're looking for a portable monitor to travel with, I highly recommend the Mobile Pixels Trio monitor.  You have the option to purchase one monitor or two.  One works for me.</span>

<span>I’m on an extended work trip where I’m working remote from my laptop for several weeks. I work with data analytics and having at least two monitors is essential. I bought this thinking it would be a great way to keep up my productivity while working from other locations. It helps a lot. But using it can be a challenge.<br/><br/>First, the magnates that are used to hold it on to the laptop are definitely not strong enough. It regularly falls off while I am adjusting the screen. I mean, every single time. If I am not holding it on when moving my laptop off my lap, the monitor falls off. The screen is really really heavy and it will pull my laptop back from the weight. A small struggle for the overall benefit, until the monitor falls off because the magnets can’t sustain it.  I had originally planned to purchase a second one to add on but once I realized the weight and the magnets can’t handle the one it came with, I decided against it.<br/><br/>The monitor slides in and out of a frame. It is not an easy slide. It regularly get stuck. It’s a bit frustrating. It also doesn’t slide out fully. So often times I have to move pages so I can get to the additional buttons or features on the far side of the screen.<br/><br/>That being said… it is still a godsend. Having the ability to use a second monitor that is easy to transport is truly amazing. I might wait for a second version with stronger magnets that is lighter weight. But if you really need one now, I think it’s worth the money for the increase in productivity.</span>

<span>The monitors are excellent quality, exactly what I was looking for to take on the road with me and work remotely. I love them and I'm glad I made the purchase. Since my partner also works remotely, we bought two of these so that we could have the flexibility of each of us using one, OR one of us using both. He also loves that he can use the display modes to mirror his screen to a customer sitting opposite him. All of this functionality works great.<br/><br/>However, when using TWO of these to connect to your laptop and have a three-monitor setup, there are some caveats that weren't very clear (or I underestimated) upon purchase. They do work, and the quality and function is pretty good, but it is very bulky. As it does clearly state in the instructions, the mounting setup requires that it rests on a flat surface. It is NOT capable of supporting two monitors without tipping over your laptop, unless they are resting on something for support. This makes it difficult to work on any soft or angled surface (such as your lap, or on your hotel bed, or even on an angled laptop tray). Each monitor has to be connected separately, so there are cables running around every side of your computer. Also, only one powered USB-C can be connected at a time. After hours of trying to find some sort of dock with two, video capable, powered USB-C connections, I learned this is a limitation of the technology, but I found it rather irritating that they seem to go out of their way to omit this from the instructions. In any case this meant that the second monitor was not plug and play as I'd hoped; I had to call corporate IT and have the drivers installed to run the second monitor from a regular USB connection.<br/><br/>Overall, I would absolutely buy these again. The quality was so impressive for the size that I almost feel bad giving them 4 stars instead of 5. However, the manufacturer differentiates these from others by advertising the ability to connect two of them at once, so IMO they need to work on making that setup a bit cleaner - or at a minimum, be more transparent about how it will work in practice.</span>

<span>Of all the things I’ve purchased for my home office, this was the best!<br/><br/>It is light weight and does not pull on the laptop lid.  You can buy extra magnets, and use it on other devices. It has the ability to be used in both portrait and landscape modes! I’ve been using it a couple weeks and have never noticed a glare on the screen.<br/><br/>Having this monitor allows me to keep a tidier works space with less cords to manage. At the end of the day I simply fold everything up, and my workspace is clear and can be used for other purposes. It also has made working while traveling a breeze!<br/><br/>When you install it, the directions say to center it on the back of your lap top. If you have a 15” screen or larger, I would recommend moving it a little off center in the direction you plan to use it. I found that in having it perfectly centered it cut off a little bit of the screen, and made it hard to rotate the monitor. On my 15” laptop I loved it about 1/2 an inch off center. On my 17” lap to about 2 inches off center. It works beautifully!</span>

<span>I have a stationary dual monitor screen setup at home, but we travel often and I work with my laptop in the car a lot. The transition can feel painful at times! Not having the second screen leaves me feeling less productive. My brother in law purchased this screen a few months ago and he raved about it. So, I jumped on the purchase trusting him. I went with the 13" screen size since I work in multiple programs at a time. I received the product in a timely manner and the application and installation was easy with a guide for where and how to place the magnets. I was impressed how secure the screen was after applied with the magnets, and also how easily the screen slid out to be used. It has a nice swivel feature so you can angle the screen toward you and it is pretty sturdy. I plugged in and followed the instructions and was working within minutes. I appreciate that it came with extra sticky adhesive for the magnets in case. The screen was bright and I set it to extend my existing screen so I have lots of room to move my windows around.  Looking forward to using it often and enjoying the second screen!</span>

<span>Update: changing my review to 5 stars, for really impressive levels of customer service. I never reached out to the company, after my first screen broke, bc I figured that it was on me not them. But I left a review of 3 stars so ppl could get some perspective.<br/>I left 3 bc the product is cool but I was left with a feeing that it was flimsy. Well a few weeks ago I recd an email from the company, apologizing for the issue and offering me a refund or another screen. This was unsolicited, they read my review and wanted to make it right. I thought that was amazing and figured I’d give the screen another shot. Turns out the key is in the mounting. If done correctly you will have zero issues. The screen I received with a box of extra magnets had the magnets aligned correctly for mounting the screen. Not only should the screen portion slide out, but the backing itself should also have some room to slide out on the magnets. It’s key. It makes 100% difference in how the screen moves mechanically and therefore it’s usability. Watch the video, call for help, but make sure you’ve got the mounting of it right. Once you do, the product works without a hitch.  Like there is no way I would end up breaking the screen now, nor yet have trouble with it sagging or not sliding or bending at the hinge. Like I said in prior review, beyond the mounting the set up is “plug it into the port on your laptop”..lol super easy. Picture is great, just all good with this one. Thank you to this company, and Miya who reached out in response to my prior review. You have a great product and your customer service is excellent.<br/><br/>Prior review from before the above occurred:<br/>They are lightweight and have a decent picture, not hard to set up, but the way the attach to your laptop leaves a bit to be desired. Mine tended to sag toward the end of the screen and while your supposed to bend it at the joint toward you to avoid that, that isn’t very easy to do without ending up flexing the screen. Eventually during my struggle to do this the screen flexed too much and cracked so it’s now just completely useless- no picture at all. I don’t know if this is an issue with all these types of screens or no. I don’t intend to spend several hundred dollars to find out. I’m just buying a free standing one. It’s a great idea, but it’s not for everyone I guess.</span>

<span>I have two very old, inexpesive 18" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.<br/>I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>This review is for the “(Sceptre 20" 1600 x 900 75Hz LED Monitor 2X HDMI VGA Built-in Speakers, sRGB 99% Machine Black (E209W-16003RT Series) aka “20” 75Hz Wide Viewing Angle” monitor.<br/>I got 2 of these for $115/ea. It was difficult to return them and go with two Samsung 1080p IPS 22” monitors instead. For some reason, the non-IPS screens (like these) have a hard time displaying an even black/gray screen. The pictures with the grayscale test have my very high-quality laptop monitor below them as a reference in each picture for what the black/gray screen SHOULD look like. The monitor is on the top of each picture and my laptop is below it. The laptop screen is mirrored on the Spectre monitor above it. These exhibit pretty bad “ghosting.” To be fair, it is not as bad in real life as the camera makes the monitor look. But I still found it too distracting to work with. Because the screen is always darker at the top than the bottom (regardless of viewing angle), it can be difficult to see vertical scroll bars because it fades from normal at the top to washed-out at the bottom. Googling information can also be difficult because the color change of a site you have already been to on Google is more difficult to see at the bottom of the screen than at the top. It is also harder to work in Excel because the grid lines are not an even shade across the entire screen. It is not horrible like the HP V20 HD+ 19.5-inch monitor. But it is still not great. I found it too distracting to work with as a home office monitor. There should be 6 pictures showing the different shades of black/gray mirrored off my laptop onto the Spectre 20” monitor. The monitor in the picture also has a bad pixel a few inches from the top left corner that you can see in the darkest pictures as green. I personally do not take off points because my specific product/item has a flaw/defect. Even the best manufacturers have products that pass quality control. So I simply mention it and let readers decide for themselves if it is too common of a problem for them to decide not to purchase it. I only give bad reviews for “systemic problems” that affect all of a product line like this. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>On the good side it does have some really nice features for the money. I will miss the dual HDMI ports and the speakers even though they’re not very good. But this allows you to plug in a Roku stick and watch/listen to TV while working on the other monitor if you have two (see picture). I also personally liked the size better than the 22” Samsung 1080p monitors I’m keeping. Two 22” monitors are a little big for my very small desk even when VESA mounted. The Spectre monitors are also VESA mountable which was another reason I purchased them. They come with screws that create a gap of about ¾” between the monitor and a VESA mount (see picture). I’m not exactly sure why they did this, but it does make it easier to access cables in the back and it was not an inconvenience for me. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>If you don’t have much money and these are on sale for $120 or less, it might be a monitor worth considering. But the one I opened to try/test had a defective pixel so I had to return it anyways. And I never opened the 2nd one because I decided I just couldn’t work with this monitor for most likely many years. The Samsung’s look fantastic straight out of the box without having to mess with screen adjustments. And I got them on sale from Amazon for $140/ea. For my needs, as a home office monitor(s), the Samsung’s are much better and worth the extra $25/ea. But the Samsung 22" IPS monitors are normally $165+/ea. It would have been a more difficult choice if I had to pay full price for the Samsung’s.</span>

<span>Does anyone remember walking around at grandma's house and there were NO little lights on? Nothing beeped, squeaked, or pulsated?

This blue pulsating nightmare is European Disco so crank the techno and get thumping...<br/><br/>I am not a fan of yank and crank reviews. I rely on amazon reviews to make high quality, informed decisions. I had a super SCEPTRE at work, like $400-600. I bought this one after a lot of research and need a curved screen for programming. It is inadequate for text.<br/><br/>Purchase greater than 1920 x1080 pixels if working with text or dont even bother. Go get one at the dump or on craigslist.<br/><br/>SCEPTRE programmers should get their head out of disco mode and turn their stuff off light grandma's house. ~for those who stuck around thank you for time and hope this is helpful! best bbz</span>

<span>I had to replace one of my monitors (it was also a Sceptre and its screen randomly burst) so I purchased the same monitor that I bought last year to match my other Sceptre, hoping the screen bursting was a fluke. I received something that looks different with a different thickness of the frame, and the picture color is duller than the first one. The blacks are not as black and other colors are not as vivid. Also, there was no mounting hardware to mount the monitor to the double arm. I had to find scrap screws around the house because the screws on the previous monitor were too long. So even though I purchase the same monitor through the same sales page, I got something different that is of lesser quality. The box is too dang big though to pack it up and send it back, so I'll just see if I can live with the slight decrease in quality (even though it's clear because the two monitors are side by side).</span>

<span>I decided to include this monitor in my first official desktop setup because it was curved. At first, I was kinda unsure on whether I was going to like it or not, but looking at it right now, it's really good! Beats my expectations. I haven't calibrated the display yet, so it's looking a bit too cool color wise, but I'm very sure I can fix that. Setting this monitor up was pretty easy, a few screws and they give you a magnetic screwdriver so you don't lose anything. So far, it's working well! I did take a star off because the speaker was that bad. Normally something like speaker quality wouldn't bother me since I'm not an audiophile, but the sound coming from this was sooooo tinny, it's worse than the dollar store headphones. If you're planning on getting it, do yourself a favor and buy some cheap amazon basics speakers. I had to bust out the wireless speaker I had on hand. Otherwise, buy it! Just don't expect quality sound with it.</span>

<span>I purchased these monitors to use in my home office as well as for my photography hobby. My goals are to be able to switch between laptops and not use a docking station for either laptop if at all possible. I use an UpLift Desk with the Dual Monitor stand. Having these monitors without stands and the proper connecting cables saved me money and waste. The screens have very thin bezels so they can be very close to each other without a large distracting border. The colors are excellent and I see that my photos are much easier to edit. Since I went from editing my photos on my Alienware laptop to these I see that the laptop was tricking me into a color cast. These screens have no color bias so now my photos are true color. I use two screens at the office and needed the same for the home office as this is now where I will do most of my work for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>My background on Display Port<br/>I have not kept up with technology over the years and wanted a solution for multiple monitors with my work and home laptops. At work we use docking stations and the DVI cables. I had not heard of the Display Port standard. After reading about it and checking my laptops, a Dell from work and an Alienware for home I found they both have these ports. The monitor pair came with two cables for Display Port. They use the VESA standard mount which the UpLift Desk stands provide.<br/><br/>Getting the Monitors<br/>Unboxing is straightforward and mounting also easy. Now comes the fun part. I ran one cable from the first monitor (DP Out) to the second monitor (DP In) . I put the other cable on the first monitor (DP In) so that the mini Display Port cable end is free to plug into either laptop (mini DP Out). The box had ample padding and space to prevent any damage to the monitors in transit.<br/><br/>Monitor Configuration Changes<br/>I had to go into the settings menu on both monitors and turn on MST to get both PCs to recognize these monitors separately. Originally all three screens showed the exact same image. If the use case is a training situation or sharing information with a client in a bank or health care situation this is ideal as each person can have a separate monitor and see the exact same thing.<br/><br/>Work Laptop Windows 7 Professional<br/>I plugged the Display Port cable into my work laptop and it recognized the new monitors quickly. We are upgrading to Windows 10 later this year. So as far as the monitors doing what they are supposed to do they worked flawlessly. The hard part is getting Windows 7 to use the laptop screen and the two monitors as three separate screens. After some internet research and work with the PC I finally got all three screens so I can have three different screens to work on. I did end up buying a laptop stand so that the laptop screen is more or less level with the ViewSonic screens.<br/><br/>Windows 10<br/>The home laptop runs Windows 10 already. All I do to switch between the two laptops is unplug the mini DP cable from one and plug into the other.  Easy peasy. Now the same hard part as above. For some reason I had a harder time getting Windows 10 to work the same as Windows 7. I did finally get everything configured and this is a dream setup.<br/><br/>Lightroom<br/>I use Lightroom for my photo editing. I like to attend the Cars and Coffee events locally and shoot a lot of photos. My techniques have improved over the years and now I shoot in RAW format and do my post editing in LR. LR can use dual monitors to edit. One screen is showing the catalog and editing tools while the other screen is showing the full size picture. I load my pictures to Flickr and can view them on my TV's using the Flickr app on Roku. I can say after editing the latest batch of photos where the lighting went from early morning cloudy to mid morning full sun that my photos are more consistent that ever before. Using the laptop not only would I get a color cast but also more variation in the f-stop, i.e. lightness and darkness from photo to photo.<br/><br/>Sound<br/>The DP standard also carries the sound signal. These monitors do not have speakers but do have an audio out jack for PC speakers. I rounded up an old pair of speakers and plugged them in to one of the monitors. Again more work is spent in Windows getting it to find and use the speakers. I use them for the corporate presentations we get at work as well as on-line classes at UDemy and Lynda. For this purpose they work quite well.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Just the monitors you need and just the cables. Especially if you are using the DP standard for connection.<br/>DP carries a sound signal and monitors have a sound out feature for PC speakers.<br/>Only one cable to plug into either laptop to switch between systems for work and home.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>A few small ones.<br/>I had to research the seb to find out about setting the MST to On to get the OS to recognize these monitors separately.<br/>If I were being picky having the buttons on the back of the monitors and the menu on the front I have to count them to find which button selects which item on the menu. But once you get them set up correctly you probably won't touch these buttons again.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>I am very happy with this setup. I am more productive with two monitors for work as well as editing photographs. I may purchase the color calibration sensor for my desktop down the road to get that final piece of the photo colors correct. I don't use these for gaming so no comment on that use case.</span>

<span>I was hesitant at first purchasing this dual monitor package as I was use to a larger single monitor from HP.  I am an amateur photographer and wanted to be able to run my photo editing software without having to switch between other programs. That hesitance was lifted once I got them installed and working.  There is hardly and visible front bezel so they can be placed next to each other with out any noticeable gap. The only problem I had was that one monitor had an issue with the display port out of the box.  I followed their on-line trouble shooting help but it ended up being a hardware problem.  I contacted their customer service department and after answering a few questions I was provided an RMA.  Turn around was quick and am now able to operate them via display port.  So even though there was an initial issue with one of the monitors Viewsonic's customer service saved the day.</span>

<span>I bought these for my graphics setup and they are awesome.  Very nice price point and they are working beautiful together.  I was in the market for 2 monitors for a long time and trying to find 2 monitors for zoom meetings and some graphics work, but I could not find ones that were not $400 dollars or so.  Then these showed up on my recommendations and yes...bought them and I am very pleased with them.  They look great, have a usb 3.0 hub built in and multiple ways to configure.  Awesome.</span>

<span>Pros: picture quality is amazing! I use it here and there for gaming but not really. Sharpness, colors, etc are crisp.<br/><br/>Cons: I don't know who or where i kept getting advertised about these monitors, but its advertised that the picture on the monitors are supposed to look exactly like your cellphones. I selected the sRGB option and didn't look like my phone. (Samsung Android without any weird tweaking the display) I had to manually tweak the monitors until it looked similar to my phones and tablets. Once put on sRGB I wasn't able to up the brightness. Option was greyed out. That's why the 4 stars and 3 stars on brightness. Maybe I need a different newer monitor?? Idk but I kept them and work on them and I am happy with them overall!!!  I'm wanting to try out their new 4k wide monitors in the future for photography and video editing.</span>

<span>So far it's been working pretty good for over 3 months and important thing is when you plug the HDMI in the port 2 the refresh rate its higher.  It may be good for videogames buy maybe more refresh rate.</span>

<span>I ordered this monitor because I was switching from a dual 22" monitor setup to a single ultra-wide monitor, and required picture by picture (PBP) functionality for screen sharing. To note, I'm only using this monitor for work so can't comment on the gaming aspect. The first monitor that I received was defective - the monitor powered on and off continuously. I tried experimenting with different cables, hubs, and laptops before realizing it was an issue with the monitor itself. Amazon shipped me a replacement and the new one worked like a charm, once I had the right hub (highly recommend the CalDigit Element Hub for Mac Users) and appropriate cables for my laptop. The picture and screen quality are good but not mind-blowing, and the lack of height adjustment is a minor annoyance, but as mentioned, I was primarily looking for a relatively inexpensive ultra-wide that supported PBP and this fit the bill. I would recommend this monitor as the price point is really competitive for the features, and most importantly, the compatibility with my MacBook Pro.</span>
