<span class="cr-original-review-content">Superó bastante mis expectativas, ya que venía de un proyector de los tantos que hay con wifi pero de menor resolución y especificaciones de gama baja, y al leer en muchas partes que para tener un proyector de siguiente gama o nivel había que gastar arriba de los 7 o 10 mil pesos y así tener funciones como resolución 1080p nativa, brillo y contraste por encima de la media, y sobre todo un enfoque preciso y parejo en todas las zonas de la pantalla, pues fue grande mi sorpresa de que por este buen precio este proyector cumplió con todas estas características. También se mueve uno de manera muy fluida por los menús, trae selección de potencia para el ventilador, siendo el alto el promedio de un proyector , y el bajo muy suave y nada molesto para funcionar en entornos templados o fríos sin causar molestia. Otro buen punto fue el sonido que ha hecho que cuando lo uso en interior, no haga necesario el usar un sistema de sonido externo, ya que está muy bien logrado, trae buena potencia para interior, no distorsiona, trae personalización tanto en efectos de sonido como en ecualización de las bandas. Y cuando lo he usado con un sistema de sonido externo en exteriores, me gusta que trae la opción para elegir qué canal de audio usar y así suprimir el sonido  interno del proyector y así evitar esa superposición molesta que traen otros proyectores y no se puede evitar.<br/>La imagen está muy bien lograda tanto en resolución, brillo, contraste, etc, y aún usándolo en mi patio en una pantalla de 120 pulgadas, no se pierde tanta calidad como me pasaba con otros.<br/>Muy contento de haberlo comprado y obviamente lo recomiendo.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I bought this for my sons 5th fiesta themed birthday. My wife had compiled all my sons best photos and videos and created an amazing slideshow we wanted to project on the wall in the garage for the party. It was the perfect spot to set up the projector because we had a bounce house and food outside and we used this walk through space as a little kids “movie theater” and even blew up mattresses and created a bunch of comfy couches. The projector comes with three mounts- ceiling, tripod(which we used) and stand. The picture quality was really nice and the colors were sharp and vivid- you can adjust the brightness and color quality to your liking. The remote also made it incredibly convenient to use during the party. My parents have an outdoor projector and it doesn’t compare to this one- i’m glad I read the reviews and didn’t spend more than I had to for the purpose we need this for. During the end of the party we played Disneys Coco for the kids and again the quality was great- especially as the sun went down you could see everything a lot brighter. We connected this to my wife’s apple smartphone but it can be connected to an array of different devices. Very excited to use this all summer as we’ve been talking about having night movie viewing parties in the pool like they have at the community center. Very happy with this purchase.</span>

<span>I got this projector on sale and i am very pleased.  The 1080p image is sharp and bright and it does have 4d keystone correction.  Like with any projector it is better with the lights off, but this one does a decent job when the lights are dimmed with enough light to navigate the room.</span>

<span>I have a theater room in my house and i wanted a projector to use. This is my first time every having one and it is cheaper then buying a new flat screen tv. After reading lots of good review I decided to order this and so far it is pretty good.<br/><br/>The picture quality great for the price. I have mounted on the ceiling, the image is sharp and crisp colors with a bright light. The fan is not too loud and doesn't bother while watching a movie also it doesn't get too hot. The sound quality is decent for small speakers.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Setup is a easy<br/>- The color is nice<br/>- The resolution is nice<br/>- Native 1920x1080<br/>- Keystone correction.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Sound not loud but I bought speaker<br/>- remote control sometimes don't work unless it is pointed at projector<br/>- no wifi or Bluetooth<br/><br/>To sum it up it is great for the price and easy to use but, it could be a lot better with built in wifi or Bluetooth</span>

<span> This is not a light thing, it's metal and sturdy. Mounting on a wall would be pretty straightforward but I highly recommend finding studs. I am not sure how it would work if you didn't have studs the right width apart for the mounts, with my limited carpentry knowledge I would probably just mount it over a long board that was itself screwed into multiple studs if my studs weren't spaced in a way that would fit the holes here.<br/><br/>For my use case, I myself envisioned this as a dual purpose thing: a projector screen and a way to cleverly cover my open shelf which is currently used for storage of musical instruments and accessories I don't often use. As a result, I needed to mount it in the ceiling. This wasn't easy as a solo job. With two people it would be easier to mark the second point for the second ceiling hook to go. There is almost no leeway if you put your second ceiling hook in the wrong place, as the projector screen comes with small loops to hook onto rather than something with more wiggle room, like a chain.<br/><br/>I ended up doing this by hanging one end, and setting my ladder up on the other end and walking it over to the ladder, and climbing the ladder with it one hand. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are comfortable ascending a ladder without both hands to steady you.<br/><br/>I also had some trouble finding my first ceiling joist, but that's not the fault of this screen. Now my ceiling has a few more holes than I wanted, but it's nothing a little spackle and touch up paint won't fix. In the end, I got it done by myself and I'm quite proud. I even mounted the wired remote into the wall and used a third hook to tuck the power cord behind some stuff on my shelf.<br/><br/>So 1) Find your joists for ceiling mount/studs for wall mount and 2) two well placed hooks (ceiling)/screws (wall) should do it!<br/><br/>P.S. Wireless remote has two buttons that don't do anything, makes me think the electronics were just repurposed when the remote was made for something else originally.</span>

<span>This is hands down, the best projector you can get in this price range. Look no further. I bought this in 2016 and installed it in my mancave to watch movies and game on it and it's amazing. Truly the envy of all my guests. Not only is the picture clear, crisp and gorgeous, but its bright enough that it's still very visible and clear even in low lighting so the room doesn't have to be pitch dark to have a great picture. Short throw means that I have a 110" image on my screen with the projector ceiling mounted about 4-5' away.<br/>For gamers: Something to keep in mind is that the refresh rate is only 60hz so if you plan on gaming keep in mind you wont get a higher frame rate than that. I'm not sure if there are projectors that display in 120hz or more but at the end of the day, the image size and quality can't be beat. Maybe play on a monitor if you want a higher refresh rate. You're certainly not going to be playing FPS on this as the size is prohibitive to those types of games anyway.<br/>Another thing to keep in mind is that if you plan on having multiple devices hooked up, you are going to NEED an A/V Receiver. This only has two outputs. I figured that out afterward but honestly this kind of setup demands a good soundsystem anyway. The sound it puts out is pathetic, but that's not what you're buying this to do anyway.<br/>In the summers, I put this out on my deck and put UFC PPVs on a 144" screen. I feel like I should be charging the neighborhood for the free show they're getting! Once it's dark enough, this thing is bright enough to be seen clear as day.<br/>To sum up, this is the one you want. You could spend more or spend less but unless you really want (and can afford) a 4k projector, this is the perfect projector for you.</span>

When I called about this I was told it was the shippers problem (even tho it was part of internal packaging and outer box was perfect). Wasn't impressed with customer service rep. Don't know if she hung up on me or assumed once she told me it wasn't her problem we were done. So projector? Thumbs up. Packaging and customer service? Not so much. Overall worth the price.</span>

<span>I have used this in my bedroom because my wife says no TVs in the bedroom, so it's a loophole in her argument.<br/>I did have one fault but thought it happened in shipping; one of the button snaps was dented and did not take the female end of the button. I reached out to the manufacturer, and they got me squared away.<br/>10/10 customer service.<br/>I used this at my house and my brother's house. I show a movie at sunset, and people always stop and watch a bit before they head on their way. It is a great way to do things with others while being distant.<br/>I own the 135-inch screen.<br/>I put this up myself and take it down myself.<br/>Super easy to put up and take down.<br/>Five minutes for both; if not, it is close.<br/>Each time I put it up, most of the wrinkles come out because the frame pulls tight when you snap it into place. If you follow the directions, you will have no issue, corner 1, corner 3, 2, then 4, then the snaps in the middle. I love this screen.<br/>I went with the 135 inches because I feel it is the largest size to manhandle by myself.<br/>They have a nice carrying case and some rope to tie it down. I do not use the rope and stakes as I use heavy bags of salt or sand. When you have little kids running around, you do not want cords potentially causing a trip hazard.<br/>I recommend this to anyone, If not the 135inch but the brand. Nice sturdy frame and the heavy-duty screen is well made.<br/>I wish that I could give this another star; it is that good.</span>

<span>I purchased this screen (front and rear projection wraith veil) and used it once, and it was great. I put it back into the sleeve/case it came with.  Then a few weeks later I pulled it out to use it again. The sleeve/case is black on the inside and it had stained/rubbed off on the screen (side note, the set-up and storage instructions for this product are not very clear.  I highly recommend you keep some of the foam packaging and wrap the screen in it when putting it in the sleeve to prevent this from happening to your screen). We tried several items to clean it and scrub it off, and it would not come off.  So we reached out to Elite Screens, and I have to say I was not expecting much based on the reviews of their customer service that I had read online.  However, they surprised me came through! I provided them with a picture of the damaged screen, and my order information, and later that week I had a replacement screen.  Very quick and easy, no hassle! We used it the same night we received it and it was great!  I'm very pleased with how they handled my particular situation.<br/><br/>As for the screen, I much prefer the rear projection (keeps the projector, cords, etc out of the way of my small children and others) and this one (wraith veil) works fantastic for that!  Great quality and a lot of fun for outdoor movies.</span>

<span>The OMS145H2PLUS will fit in an empty SKB 3i-4719-8. This can be done within the oversize and overweight limits of most U.S. airlines.<br/><br/>Packing the screen surface elsewhere such as your projector case will keep the weight under 70 pounds, which is required on some European airlines.<br/><br/>The doubled over screen surface will fit nicely into a custom bottom tray in a Pelican Air 1637. An Optoma Technology GT1090HDR, and Punks Corey Tripod will fit in a custom top tray in a Pelican Air 1637. Bolting a Leftfoto 120mm Arca-swiss release plate to a PCMD projector mount provides a light and compact means of using the tripod as a projector stand. Other projector cases worth considering include the Pelican Air 1626, Nanuk 960, SKB 3i-2317-14, SKB 3i-2217-12, and SKB 3i-2617-12. The depth and extra 5 pound weight margin of the Pelican Air 1637 make it a clear choice of projector case if pairing the screen with an Optoma Technology GT1090HDR. This can be done while staying within standard checked luggage limits of 50 pounds and 62 linear inches.<br/><br/>There is enough room remaining in the SKB 3i-4719-8 to include a folding flip-chart easel. With the screen surface moved to the projector case, a flip-chart easel stays under the 70 pound European weight limit.<br/><br/>The SKB 3i-4719-8 is the only injection molded style hard case which will work while staying within 80 linear inches, and 70 pounds. I have also considered every projector screen size case by Nanuk, Pelican, and Seahorse without any luck. The Draper model 219203 roto-molded 52" screen case will likely also work for similar money, but it will not be waterproof.<br/><br/>Only the Elite Yard Master Plus models have the height range to reach table height as required in a meeting or conference setting. The standard Yard Master models don't go high enough.<br/><br/>I also strongly considered the 161" diagonal 16:9 Draper model 241182 screen with case and HD legs. The Da-Lite and Draper models are significantly more expensive than the OMS145H2PLUS, even after buying the SKB 3i-4719-8.<br/><br/>After examining the OMS145H2PLUS in person, I'm not convinced the Draper or Da-Lite will be much better built. I have not had an opportunity to compare the Draper, and Da-lite models in person. The 1.25" aluminum square tubing of the OMS145H2PLUS is the same outer dimension as the tubing of the similar Draper screen.<br/><br/>The listed gain on the Elite surface is greater than the Draper and Da-Lite models. The 4200 lumens of an Optoma Technology GT1090HDR is as bright of a short-throw laser projector as I can find at it's size and weight. Yet, even that is a little marginal in a well light room at these screen sizes. The higher gain of the Elite should help with that, at the risk of more bright spots.<br/><br/>I have attached a variety of photos and diagrams. I have only directly handled and measured the OMS145H2PLUS, Leftfoto release plate, PCMD projector mount, and 3Legged Thing Punks Corey 1.0 travel tripod. For everything else I am still working off of published dimensions and weights.

<span>This screen is every bit as good as the description.  The layering of the polymers does indeed help the picture in high ambient light situations and it's nice and clear.  The tabs on the side keep the screen taught and steady.<br/><br/>It installed relatively easily and looks great in the room.<br/><br/>If they oversold one feature, it's the speed it rolls down and up.  It's supposed to be speedy...  I can say it's the same speed as the previous screen, which was 1/3 the price.  Not that big of a difference at all.  Maybe my hopes were high there, but that feature was a wash, IMO.<br/><br/>Other than that, its definitely a great screen!  Spendy, but worth it if you want a permanent screen that looks good in the room.</span>

<span>Purchased in March 2018 as part of a basement theater room renovation, paired with the Optoma UHD60. Couldn't be happier with the look and quality. Recently ran into an issue with the screen not retracting into the ceiling. Emailed Elite Screens and a rep (Johnny J) immediately responded with troubleshooting suggestions. In less than five minutes, everything was working perfectly again. Great support, great product. Would buy again and have referred many envious friends.</span>

<span>UPDATE 18 Months later: After less than 2 years of use (the warranty period); the limit switches on the unit have failed and the unit won't roll back up.  I'm attempting to get parts from Elite Screens, will follow up on how that goes.  It's important to note that if you adjust this screen AT ALL after installation (screen drop, for instance) Elite Screens will tell you your warranty is now void, despite the fact that their paperwork only says that "improper" adjustment of the screen will void your warranty, without any explanation that by "improper" they mean "any."<br/><br/>Hopefully I'll be able to get replacement parts, even if I have to buy them, and be able to fix the unit.<br/>----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I don't think I could have really stomached this unit at the full retail price, even with how good it is.  That being said, I picked this up as an Amazon "returned stock" item for about half of full retail.  It was received in perfect condition (outer box was damaged, inner box was just fine.<br/><br/>The build quality of the casing is really good, and all the installation parts that come with it were top notch, though they could have used much better instructions.  It takes a good deal of puzzling over what the heck they mean with some of the steps and the distinct lack of any decent pictures.  In the end, I had to go watch a few Youtube installation videos to get an understanding how some of it was supposed to work out.<br/><br/>I also decided to wall mount this unit (and plan to enclose it with a trimmed in soffit later); using angle iron and a ledger board firmly bolted to the wall.<br/><br/>The screen itself hangs nice and flat, and is quiet enough considering that I don't have it yet enclosed in anything.  The motor is definitely high quality, and the additional 12" drop on the top made it the perfect choice for our room that has 9' ceilings.<br/><br/>Our projector is an older Optoma HD37, and when the blinds are shut and the room darkened, it looks great on this screen.  We're seated about 10' away, and even in plain old HD resolution, the image is not noticeably pixelated and is reasonably bright.<br/><br/>Definitely a good deal and a high quality unit.</span>

<span>While installing this screen and opting for the hard wired option, I found what appeared to be an unusual difference in the suggested wiring diagram.  The user manual shows that if using a hard wire configuration the black wire is common and the white wire is hot.  This is the complete opposite of how most house wiring is done.  I phoned tech support twice and each time they confirmed the manual is correct and stated no one has ever phoned before on this issue.  Against my better judgement I wired it according to the user manual.  When I went to flip the breaker, it gave me a red error condition without actually flipping the breaker.  I assumed that this meant it detected a problem with polarity.  Glad I didn't try to operate the screen!  Once I reversed the wiring to standard (white-white; black-black), I reset the breaker and no error.  Screen works as expected.  I suspect no one ever reads the manual but I'm the rare guy who does.  Very frustrating.  Rating may be premature based on lack of actual use and based mostly on perceived value of received product.</span>

<span>I purchased this screen at the beginning  of the summer with the hope of moving group-oriented TV activities, such as family movie nights, sports, and games outside. It has absolutely delivered. Some initial thoughts after a summer's-worth of use:<br/><br/>• The initial setup was straightforward, although I found that asking for help and getting a second pair of hands made the process much easier. The stakes that come with the projector are a bit undersized; I would recommend buying some sturdier stakes to safely keep the frame from falling.<br/><br/>• The creases, while visible during the day, were a non-factor during while using the screen at night from a normal distance.<br/><br/>• I paired the screen with a mid-priced Nebula projector and the image quality far surpassed my expectations. Old movies don't look anymore washed than their original versions, brightly colored games still "pop", and watching sports on a screen that's twice the size as the TV has been a lot of fun.<br/><br/>• Going in, I was hesitant that the dip in quality between the TV and projector would deter us from using the screen on regular basis once the novelty wore off, but I'm happy to say that hasn't been the case. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.</span>

Everything easily and neatly stores in the carrying case (no shoving/cramming!). The screen always pulls tight and I love the flexibility to project from the front or rear (which has come in handy several times).

<span>My wife enjoys making stain glass and got this projector to add art to her templates.  She really likes this purchase because it does what it says it will do. She was up until 3:00am enjoying this thing. She does say that the bulb gets extremely hot and that she plans to change it out with an LED. I think that this projector will get a lot of use and bring great value to my wife and her hobby.</span>

<span>This is my first review ever with Amazon, and I've purchased many items from them over the years.<br/>Well first of all, when I opened the box, I discovered much to my disappointment that it was a USED PRODUCT!!! I paid for a NEW PRODUCT!!! I Expected a NEW PRODUCT!!!<br/>Secondly, it would not give a sharp image on tracer paper (just purchased at Dick Blick) of the item I was trying to copy in a "low light" room...  It's cheaply made and overpriced!  Absolutely Not worth the Investment!</span>

The Pro Frame Thin DarkStar UST 2 is an EDGE FREES ultra-short throw fixed frame screen. It uses our innovative ceiling ambient light rejecting DarkStare UST 2 material which absorbs up to 85% of overhead light. The DarkStar Degree UST 2 material has a serriform optical surface structure made specifically to negate the washout effect caused by overhead and other off-axis light sources. This technology allows the material to retain image brightness, color saturation and contrast for superior picture performance. The EDGE FREES design permits the DarkStar UST 2 material to wraparound the inside of the frame to maximize the viewing area in a smaller footprint. The material is designed for use with ultra-short throw table-top configurations without worrying about shadowing the picture when giving a presentation in front of the screen. The Pro Frame Thin frame design compliments any boardroom, training facilities decor.Design and Installation Sleek EDGE FREES Fixed Frame resembles a flat panel TV Lightweight aluminum split-frame design Wraparound design maximizes viewing area and reduces overall footprint Ultra-thin black bezel trim Project within a short distance without shadowing the picture Designed for table-top ultra-short throw projectorsScreen MaterialDARKSTAR UST 2The DarkStar UST 2 material has a serriform optical surface structure made specifically to negate the washout effect caused by
