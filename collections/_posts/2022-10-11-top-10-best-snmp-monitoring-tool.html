Tripp Lite's SNMPWEBCARD allows network users to operate any expansion slot-equipped Tripp Lite SmartPro or SmartOnline UPS as a managed device on the network. It enables remote monitoring and control of UPS and site electrical conditions using the SNMP network management platform or a web browser. This unit provides remote viewing of site electrical data, UPS status information and self-test logs. It also supports selective rebooting of locked network equipment without disrupting power to other devices when used with customized load management receptacles available on select Tripp Lite UPS systems. The optional EnviroSense module (sold separately) provides remote temperature/humidity monitoring and a dry contact interface to control and monitor alarm, security and telecom devices.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have 2 separate UPS's from Tripp Lite, and 2 different SNMP webcards, one with version 12.06.067 and the other with 12.03.0024<br/><br/>Strangely it seems the older version is much more superior than the newer version.  First, it doesn't require Java to work, it loads faster, has a simpler cleaner interface (it looks like the PowerAlert local software) and since the webpage for the older firmware doesn't require Java, it can be viewed from any device, even phone or tablet.<br/><br/>The newer firmware requires Java, which is rarely supported by modern browsers, only Firefox as of this writing supports it.  This card also doesn't work properly with the latest version of Java, in fact Tripp Lite provides information on how to modify certain files in the Java installation directory to get this card to work!<br/><br/>Unfortunately I had to return mine due to this lack of modern compatibility.</span>

<span>Should have bought these when I first bought my ups.  How does one use a ups without network monitoring.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>After several years and firmware updates, this card is still unreliable and time consuming to manage via the web interface. If you plan on getting notifications, make sure you are using a third-party monitoring software (SNMP) like PRTG or Nagios, etc. Parts of this card's configuration will literally disappear after it locks up for no reason. Things like descriptions of loads, load groups, alarm triggers and contacts.<br/><br/>I have had to replace a couple of these just because the thing would no longer boot and needed to be "rescued" with some extremely and overly complex methods of using, the console, tftp and knowing how to convert the binary IP 4 address to long form... EXCEPT that it isn't long form at all (despite the console telling you that it is), it is HEX. Not even their tech support rep knew what to do and told me to try Googling long form until I pressed him and finally someone there said try converting to HEX.<br/><br/>After countless hours wasted over a couple years with a variety of problems on a simple infrastructure that has 6 of these cards (4 have been replaced either under warranty or me buying new ones on Amazon), I have decided to never purchase TrippLite products again. Not even 5-star rated patch cables or panels. The only exception is when one of these locks up and is irrecoverable but I am budgeting to replace all UPSs and PDUs with another brand next year (4 years in service). The UPS and PDU have been fine and have carried through several power outages. It is a shame that they are connected to such horrible network interfaces.<br/><br/>APC and Eaton network cards are competitively priced, although their UPS are more expensive, it is worth it if you value your time, sanity and actually want to know if there is a problem with the equipment managed by or connected to the SNMP WEB Card.</span>

<span>This overpriced piece of hardware does not come with any software.  The software needed is available from Tripp-Lite but it requires an ancient version of javascript to function if used in a network environment.  It probably would work fine with a USB coble connection but with an Ethernet network connection, you cannot make a connection via a static IP.  It may also relate to trying to use it in a Windows 10 environment.</span>

<span>Some other reviews and features seem to conflict with my experience.  As of August 2022, this camera checks all the boxes of my needs.  I'll TLDR them in this list, then expand:  Setup in browser only without proprietary app... manual on/off for IR light...  PTZ (digital Z)... quiet and fairly smooth PT... can view high in browser without plugins... substream feed as well.<br/><br/>DETAILS ON EACH<br/>Setup in browser only without proprietary app... I'm not sorry; companies making me download an app to configure a camera aren't getting my business.  I know that makes it "consumer simple," but I own many types of cameras, light switches, and other smart-home devices.  This IP2M-841B checks the boxes for me in that it also offers IT-savvy users configuration options without downloading and maintaining an app.  When I change my WiFi password, I don't want to have five different apps to reconfigure five different devices.<br/><br/>manual on/off for IR light...<br/>When using an IP camera outdoors in a dry space, or even indoors in a garage or barn, spiders flock to the IR -- to the point of making the camera unusable at night.  Bugs like the warmth of the IR, spiders set up web across the camera light, bugs get caught and eaten.  Meanwhile we can't see much of anything.  By turning off the IR, I can use an external illuminator or low light source to keep the camera spider-free.  Trust me.  If you've ever deployed home security cameras, disabling IR is a must for outdoor / barn / garage.<br/><br/>PTZ (digital Z)... quiet and fairly smooth PT...<br/>Pan / tilt / zoom works great.  I connected this to Blue Iris and it auto-discovered the correct settings / protocol.  I haven't used the zoom.  Blue Iris didn't configure it the way it configured my other cameras with 10x optical zoom... but "digital zoom" is just a fancy term for expanding the existing pixels.  Blue Iris does that for any source already so I didn't need a zoom button on my BI interface.  The motion is just the right speed for pan and tilt.  Some of my cameras suffer the 3-bears factors.  Some move too fast and are tough to control remotely.  Some are too slow and painful to use.  This one is just right.  Thanks, baby bear!<br/><br/>can view high in browser without plugins...<br/>Many of the import cameras in this price point use an old HTTPD (on-board web interface) that requires crummy plugins or is stuck to MSIE (windows ick browser).  This works on my Mac and Linux desktops in Chrome, Firefox, and yes, Mac Safari.  Streaming video in high quality in browser, as well as the motorized controls for P/T.<br/><br/>substream feed as well.<br/>For connecting Blue Iris to an obsessive amount of cameras... you know who you are if you smiled when you read that...  if you're hooking up 15+ cameras to a mediocre BI hardware box, you want to use the substream feature.  This auto-detects the substream and is still fantastic quality for viewing.  Substream on BI saves a ton of hardware (CPU) usage for Blue Iris.  This is something you might not care about if you're not using Blue Iris but it's worth noting for those who do use it.  Yes, there are a lot of people who do and you should check it out.<br/><br/>Perspective on this camera is not fisheye -- but it's wider than a normal lens (I say that as a very good feature).  It's not distorted, but it shows a wider picture than most cameras I've seen.<br/><br/>There is nothing about this camera that I don't like.  I wish they were waterproof so that I could replace some of my old PoE cameras outside, but this does everything I want it to, perfectly.  I have had zero wifi disconnects in the couple of days I've been using it.  I really can't emphasize enough how great the picture quality is either.</span>

<span>I received my Amcrest ProHD 1080P WiFi Wireless IP Security Camera on October 20th, and set it up for the 1st time on October 22nd. Been using the Foscam FI8910W since February 2014 and that has not missed a beat. Works everyday like a true soldier.<br/><br/>But needed an upgrade as the Foscam FI8910W was 1st released in November 2011 (way back when) so it's not that user friendly unless you are a mid level techy and I wanted more recent features.<br/><br/>So when Foscam sent me an email on the new Amcrest ProHD 1080P WiFi Wireless IP Security Camera, I jumped on it.<br/><br/>I bought it because it had all the festures of the FI8910W but more friendlier (the biggest difference, setting up Port Forwarding so you can stream your camera live anywhere in the world from your Amcrest App).<br/><br/>So here goes:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- it truly is a 30 second set up (including port forwarding). The App does everything for you. Currently I am at work and I can tap into my Amcrest App and view my Live feed.<br/><br/>- HD Quality is great<br/><br/>- The camera is very responsive when you change the Pan &amp; Tilt from your phone app...even if you are miles away<br/><br/>- It looks great. Does not stand out like the Foscam FI8910W<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>- Wi-Fi Connectivity (as someone else mentioned): I am still testing this one but the range doesn't seem to be that wide. I moved the camera from being 5 ft away from the router to 20 ft away inside my TV stand on the bottom shelf and it had problems. Would not connect. Which is very disappointing because that is the spot my Foscam FI8910W has been in for the past year and a half. But the FI8910W does come with an antenna on the back which will help with range. The Amcrest does not have an antenna.<br/><br/>- Going Deep in the Set Up: Ok, it is 30 seconds to set up....if you stick to the basics (install app, scan QR code, and you have Live Feed with Port Forwarding). However, if you want to go deeper and set up email forward on motion alerts, etc, that does take sometime and you will probably have to email Armcrest for support as this will involve using their web interface which you can access by using the camera's IP address in your browser. The instructions on using the web interface so far are non existent, but again, i've only opened the box last night so maybe the instructions are somewhere on their website. Will investigate this further.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 03/11/2015<br/><br/>After having the Amcrest ProHD Camera for roughly 2 weeks now, it is truly an amazing camera with surprising features for a DIY system<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- The online User Interface is very extensive. Unfortunately there is no instruction manual on how to navigate the Amcrest web browser UI, but once you have figured it out, you will be quickly impressed.<br/><br/>- Motion Detection settings are very detailed. Within the cameras field of vision, you can set up detection zones for the camera to focus on and focus on only. It does this by dividing the field of view into little squares and you can activate/de-activate each square<br/><br/>- Motion Detection Sensitivity &amp; Motion Graph: Saw a review where a customer complained the camera was too sensitive. This is not the case in my situation. You can get very detailed again with the settings here. They are two settings: Sensitivity and Threshold. 1st, you can set how sensitive you want the camera to be for motion, which is then transposed onto a motion graph shown on the web browser UI, and then you can set the threshold. Continuous motion caused the graph to rise and once the graph as risen above your set threshold value on the vertical axis, the alarm is triggered (whether this alarm is email or audio if you have a siren hooked up to it)<br/><br/>Ethernet Connection: Having some issue with WiFi connectivity, so set mines up via Ethernet. Works absolutely brilliant using the Amcrest Android App when connected by Ethernet....and this is regardless of whether you are at home and miles away. I can open my app anytime, anywhere and be guaranteed it will log into the camera.<br/><br/>Remote Pan, Tilt &amp; Zoom: Again, this review is based on connecting the camera via Ethernet. The remote pan, zoom &amp; tilt from the app is very response. If you are miles away and want to pan,zoom or tilt the camera via the android app, there is little to no delay.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Still, WiFi range is my only issue. I took the camera by a friend and it did not even pick up her router that was 5 ft away (that was odd)....but she is using the ISP basic router. As with any WiFi product, your router and all other wifi devices in your home will play a big role in each device performance<br/><br/>Bottom Line:<br/><br/>Brilliant Camera, but gets 4 stars from me as the WiFi range is not impressive, in my set up. Remember this can is dependent on your router &amp; number of wifi devices in your home.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 16/11/2015<br/><br/>Purchased a 2nd one of these cameras lately. Showed a friend who was so in love with it that she took my original one and so I purchased this replacement.<br/><br/>With this one, the Wi Fi on it works like a dream. It's only been two days, but I have not experienced any WiFi issues with it like I did with the 1st Amcrest. And I have tested it both while at home connected to the same network and when away from connected to the local cell phone network.<br/><br/>Ethernet Connection is still faster....but the wifi connection only has a very small delay....less than 1 second, which is pretty good. The Ethernet connection is instant....even if away from home.<br/><br/>What I must say though is I need to go back and check the Firmware version on the 1st Amcrest. This time for sure I updated the firmware from the .5.R which the camera came with, to the 2.420.AC00.8.R which is available for download at http://amcrest.com/firmware .<br/><br/>So maybe if the Firmware on the previous is out of date, perhaps that maybe what caused the poor WiFi performance issues. So, I am changing my review from a 4 star to a 5 star because thus far, with the 2.420.AC00.8.R Firmware, the WiFi performance on this 2nd Amcrest it outstanding.</span>

<span>This CAM must be setup using the proprietary app, so you WILL have to install yet another app on your device :-(<br/>The good news is that with a boat-load of tinkering (digging through your router device list to find the IP address, logging on with the right browser, setting your own userID and password, changing to a static IP and Port #, and turning on sub-stream video and audio) you will be able to use a 3rd party app to monitor this alongside all your other IP cams.<br/>The sub-stream video is lower quality, and you must turn on the sub-stream audio (turned off by defaul), but eventually this can funcion as a true IP cam.  I've only just gotten everything to work, so I cannot speak to the longevity of these settings or the device in general.<br/><br/>For the pricepoint and if you have the time &amp; skill for this level of tinkering, this may be a good addition to your home monitoring system.</span>

<span>Very happy with this Amcrest IP2M-841 so far. For $60 it performs well but it does have a few issues you should know about. I used these IP2M-841 cameras to replace my unreliable Foscam FI9821P cameras (3 out of 4 broken after 3 years). What’s nice about the Amcrest IP2M-841 is the setup webpage looks like that of a Dahua camera. If you know your way around a Dahua setup page you will feel right at home with the IP2M-841. Rumor is this camera is a rebranded Dahua which is fine by me since I’ve had two Dahua bullet cameras for years and they have been flawless. I want my cameras to send video only when they see motion to my local FTP server (Filezilla). I don’t want to use the cloud or an SD card. I don’t want to use an NVR or Blue Iris. I don’t want to use the app on a smart phone. But the good thing is the IP2M-841 will do all these if you want it to. I used the Ethernet port to set it up (using Firefox version 49.0.2 to deal with the plug-in) and then deploy it where it then uses WiFi. Also note that Chrome also works but it downloads and adds a Chrome app to the Chrome browser. You then use the app, not the Chrome browser from there on.<br/><br/>First off the GOOD:<br/>1) Has both RJ45 ethernet and WiFi<br/>2) Nice crisp 1920*1080 picture and a lower res sub stream, both with lots of options for framerate, bit rate, etc.<br/>3) Field of view is good, about 90 degrees, but there is some curving distortion at the sides.<br/>4) Night vision works well and has adequate range for indoor use.<br/>5) The PTZ works well, PT speed is selectable and you can set up to 25 preset locations.<br/>6) Can set up to 8 Tour profiles so the camera will automatically move from preset to preset in the order you specify.<br/>7) The video uploaded to FTP is mp4 format and includes sound. It automatically creates a folder for each day and within that daily folder it creates folders for each hour. I prefer this way of organizing the videos rather than just throwing all the video files into the same one folder like Foscam cameras do.<br/><br/>The BAD:<br/>1) The camera will only Tilt from 90 to 0 degrees (straight up to horizontal). It can’t look below horizontal. This will be a problem if you put the camera on a fireplace mantle and then want to view the floor below the fireplace. However, it’s not a problem for me because I mount the cameras upside down from the ceiling and then flip and mirror the image in the camera setup.<br/>2) No external WiFi antenna, only internal, so the range is so-so.<br/>3) The Tour feature lacks the ability to specify the “Stay Time” which is the amount of time it stays at one preset before moving on to the next. But there’s a work around. Give the same location multiple Preset numbers. For example, point the camera at the front door and set this to Preset 1 and Preset 2 and Preset 3. Then point camera at the kitchen and set this to Preset 4 and Preset 5 and Preset 6. To construct the Tour you select a series of Presets and as long as the next Preset number is different from the prior Preset number it will accept the number even though it points to exactly the same location. For example, for Tour 1 tell it to use Preset 1 then 2 then 3 then 2 then 1 (all front door) then 4 then 5 then 6 then 5 then 4 then 5 then 6 then 5 then 4 (all kitchen). The camera seems to stay about 3 seconds at each Preset.<br/>4) There seems to be no way to see what a Tour is comprised of as you build it or once it has been made. There is no documentation stating the maximum number of Presets a Tour can have. I think this is a serious flaw. You will need to write down the sequence as you are building a tour. If you then start the Tour and you want to add some extra time at a few locations, you must redo the entire Tour! That's ridiculous!! If Amcrest could fix this "Stay Time" and Tour display/edit issue they would have a spectacular camera.<br/><br/>I have to take a star off for this Tour issue but there is a workaround so add half a star back, so can only give it 4 stars.</span>
