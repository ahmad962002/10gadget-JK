<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>This is by far one of the best Windows laptops I have ever owned. It came with minimal bloatware (much of which I cleaned up upon receiving the laptop) and the memory and processor performance of my personal laptop keep up with high loads: multiple virtual machines running, WSL running Linux, Firefox, VSCode, Spotify, Teams and Outlook run almost constantly on my laptop with no gaps in work or delays from loading.<br/><br/>I originally intended to make a lot of use of the RTX 3050Ti that's in this laptop, but I have yet to put it through the ringer with synthetics or processing loads. I have no doubt it runs rather well, as I have connected numerous displays to the laptop using USB-C and USB 3.0 and found no issues.<br/><br/>There are a couple things I should mention about the laptop that aren't really cons, at least not for me. The keyboard is a general chiclet style keyboard, the same you find on most laptops these days. Surprisingly, the keys have a bit of travel and tactile feedback for a chiclet keyboard, so they are fine for the coffee shop or on-the-road. Key brightness is minimal, it would be useless in sunlight anyway. The screen does not get tremendously bright, but I have used it in direct Florida sunlight without issue. The mousepad is a bit frustrating at times, but it is hardly different from most laptops on the market. It functions well and has a wide plane for my larger hands. The fingerprint reader is nice, I hardly use it. Camera is good for a laptop, it isn't an amazing quality, but for business meetings and talking with friends it will be more than enough.<br/><br/>There is an HDMI port, one USB-C port, and one USB 3.0 (with power delivery) port on the left. One more USB 3.0 port on the right along with a 3.5 jack for headphones or a headset. You can charge the laptop with the USB-C port, but make sure your charger or the USB-C hub can deliver 90W of power to match the stock power supply. Less than that and you may see your battery decrease under a reasonable load. I do recommend getting a USB-C charger as the included power supply connector is tiny and seems like a single fall away from the shaft breaking off.<br/><br/>I would 100% recommend this laptop for someone who does a lot of computer work, maybe not a gaming machine but it will at least code games and test them without issues. You could probably play some recent AAA titles on lower settings.</span>

<span>Jack of all trades laptop that does everything pretty well. Ill go over some of the important categories in detail. I did end up returning this laptop for reasons Ill mention but it is a good device overall.<br/><br/>Build Quality -<br/>Build quality is good overall with metal construction and not too much flex on the chassis or lid of the laptop. It has some upgradability with a second, empty m.2 drive slot. Which is pretty nice since you can expand on the original 512gb SSD without having to replace it. The RAM is soldered onto the board and, therefore, cannot be changed. 16GB should be enough for most cases, but again, with them marketing towards creators the option to expand past 16GB may have been nice even if only a single so-dimm slot was accessible like in the Asus g14 for example.<br/><br/>I/O -<br/>I/O is solid for a 14 inch laptop with it housing 2 USB type As, 1 USB 3.2 type C (charging capable), a mic/headphone combo jack, and an HDMI port. Though for a device marketed as a "Creator Laptop" Id have expected either a full size or at least micro sd card reader.<br/><br/>Keyboard/Touch pad -<br/>The keyboard provides a nice typing experience. Though the keys are a little mushy for my liking.<br/>The touch pad is also very solid with a smooth surface and accurate tracking. Could be a little larger possibly but is fine for the size of the laptop.<br/><br/>Battery Life-<br/>Battery life is pretty good for this segment. Could probably find better at a similar price but given the hardware in this laptop it is plenty good I'd say. I was generally reaching around 7-9 hours at 50% brightness and with background apps disabled. Usually while web browsing, watching videos, and coding in Visual Studio. Make sure to turn off one drive syncing though as its on by default and drastically lowers battery life.<br/><br/>Display -<br/>The Display is both a pro and a con for me. It is very bright and color accurate but it is not very good for gaming. Now this is not a gaming laptop so i was not expecting a high refresh rate display or anything along those lines. What I was not expecting was to be so impacted by the high response time of the display. Every game I played experienced ghosting and was generally not very responsive. It ended up being a deal breaker for me as, while I bought this for university primarily, gaming is an important 2nd use case for me. The performance is not the problem as ill touch on shortly, but the screen hinders the gaming experience too heavily for me. This is a subjective opinion as I am sure it wont be a problem for most and it may have to do with the fact that I have always had a high refresh rate display on both laptop and desktop for the past few years but its an issue for me nonetheless.<br/><br/>Performance -<br/>Performance is great for the price and size of the laptop. My model was equipped with the R7 5800u + 3050ti. This combo could handle pretty much any workload I threw at it. I never completely stressed the 8 cores and 16 threads the CPU had to offer but I did not experience slowdown when coding in visual studio or when I had a large amount of chrome tabs open. I am not a content creator but I would imagine this hardware combined with the color accurate display would make it a great fit for any kind of photo or video work, as it should given its advertised towards this use case. For the gaming side, the 3050ti in this thing is only a 40w part but its no slouch. Easily beating out integrated graphics or the underwhelming MX line of dedicated GPUs from Nvidia. There wasnt a single game I tried that was unplayable. Even cyberpunk can hit 60fps with DLSS. The most graphically intensive game I consistently play at the moment is Battlefield V which will run at a steady 60fps on medium or 50-60fps on high with some dips. The 3050ti in here seems to be on par with a full wattage GTX 1650ti while trading some blows here and there from what I have seen. Again, certainly not a gaming laptop, especially given the screen, but it is more than capable of allowing you to play pretty much any game in your library at some level of settings. Pretty impressive for a laptop with this combination of price and portability.<br/><br/>Thermals/Acoustics  -<br/>Thermals are a strong point of this laptop. Unlike full fledged gaming laptops, the 3050ti in here is a bit easier to handle. As such, this laptop running only a single fan. While the CPU can run a little toasty from time to time it will usually spike then drop to a more comfortable operating temperature. Seemingly up to around 95C then settling in the low to mid 80s in my testing. The GPU stays pretty cool at all times, even when being maxed out. Thankfully, due to that single fan, even under load the laptop does not get very loud. I did not test the exact decibel count but its quiet enough to where I could play a game without worrying about putting on headphones as opposed to a traditional gaming laptop where eventually jet engine mode activates. That said, when installing programs and doing some other seemingly mundane tasks that can put a little stress on the CPU, the fans will spike which can be annoying.<br/><br/>Closing Thoughts -<br/>Overall I really liked this machine. It offered good performance, battery life and build quality for a good price. The display ended up being a deal breaker because gaming is too high of a priority for me to compromise in that area. Which this laptop showed me honestly as I was not expecting it to be something I found to be such a problem. All that said, it probably wont be an issue for most and if it sounds like it would be to you Id recommend looking elsewhere.  Otherwise this is a great option for pretty much anyone looking for a good all around device in this price range.</span>

<span>I was looking for a 14 inch laptop for my programming classes that wouldn’t break the budget. I found this laptop and decided to buy it. It’s good for multitasking and programming. You can also play games in 1080p. I did decide to add a WD Black SSD to store my games. I think this laptop is a great deal without spending a lot of money.</span>

<span>It’s small, lightning fast and powerful. It gets insanely hot when running anything gpu intensive but a laptop fan will help it cool down. It runs smaller games like Terraria, Stardew Valley and Starbound with ease. It could definitely run new titles with lowered settings but I have not tried it yet. Temps are in the normal range even when it heats up. I recommend getting a 65W usb-c charger instead of using the charger it comes with. The one it comes with is a little flimsy and I feel like it’ll break with extended use. It doesn’t offer that many ports so I got a j5create usb-c multi adapter which helps a lot. And it does not come with that much bloatware as I expected which is nice.</span>

<span>OK, this is my second Stream.  The original was a 32GB that is still operating and is obviously limited by the couple GB remaining after the operating system space.  However, was useful for web browsing.  This one is 64GB and that leaves about 30GB space for programs plus one year of MS Office free.  I got rid of the Windows 10 S mode and the speed for web browsing and program operation is fine.  And I'm used to an Intel 11th generation i5 on a desktop and have no complaints. That is an absolutely amazing unit for $200.  Of course, in both cases, I've added extra room using a USB 128GB flash drive so really, it's a fantastic deal.  The only con that I've found so far is that the sound is rather puny but connecting a cheap bluetooth speaker solves that issue.  Update:  I hooked this up to an external monitor and it gave me an option to go from the native internal screen resolution of 1366x768 to 1920 x 1080 and it shows up great on the external monitor.  I'm shocked.  I cannot believe this computer was $200.  Well, we'll see how long it lasts.</span>

<span> This product lives up to its name! All the features mentioned are true. Took a little long to start up and get everything up but it’s because it’s brand new and it had to process and upload all my old stuff from previous laptop onto this one. I used my old email and password and everything automatically came onto my new laptop.  Great product, not too large and it’s light weight . Only thing the SD card does not fit the regular SD  cards but hey guess we are phasing that out , I just used a SD card reader inserted it into the USB port and I was able to edit my videos as normal! Recommend! I’m writing this comment because I do read other ppls comment and it helps . Definitely worth purchasing 💕 I love my laptop</span>

<span>I bought this Asus laptop because I bought a piece of design equipment that is run solely by software that requires Windows operating system. Since it will be dedicated to just this operation, I wanted an inexpensive but powerful laptop with a large clear screen. The 15.6" screen is sharp, clear and visible from a distance and different angles without much distortion that you often find when viewing laptop screens from an angle. This Asus running Windows 10 Home (I converted it from Windows 10 S mode) runs my design program perfectly without any lag in speed or function. It's lightweight, sleek, the keyboard is easy to type on and colors render quite nicely on the screen. While it may not be up to gaming (not a gamer here) it's a perfect laptop for a student who needs basic computing needs and like me, someone who needs to run a windows-exclusive design program.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: By submitting this I may qualify for an additional 90 day warranty. Why wouldn't I? I was about to submit my positive review anyway when I got he email offering the additional warranty. I do like this laptop very much ... and that's coming from a dedicated Macintosh user! I definitely recommend this Asus L510 laptop. You can't go wrong.</span>

<span>The good: I like the back lit keyboard, the fast, quiet solid state memory, the long battery life, the big 15.6 screen.<br/>  Used as a simple school or business tool it is a perfectly good computer.<br/>The not great: The 4gb ram is a limiting factor on this unit.  You cannot ever install additional ram to handle modern software or games, as it has no slots for ram at all. The 4gb ram is simply soldered in to the unit.<br/>Be aware of this when making this purchase.<br/>On the plus side, You can easily greatly expand on the 128gb solid drive by plugging in an internal m.2 SSD card.  An empty m.2 slot is provided. The speed of this computer is only slow when used for multi tasking with intense business software. Regular use is fine, in fact its pretty snappy with good performance. I did have to disable the windows 10 S mode. Disabling 10S is a built in option, allowing a return to regular windows. 10s would not function with the business software and non microsoft add ons I require. I am now running regular windows 10 with no issues.</span>

<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The Acer Aspire 15 has been a super great laptop. It's probably one of the best tech purchases I have ever made and I'm an IT guy. I paid about $350 USD for this one and am very happy with the purchase. The last time I was searching for a Laptop I returned 5 laptops before I was satisfied so I'm pretty picky. This was for my wife but I use it at night when I'm not in my office sometimes.<br/><br/>Storage &amp; Upgrades: Although it only comes with 128gb SSD &amp; 4gb RAM it's no big deal for about $100 you can upgrade to 20gb RAM and 2tb HDD + 128gb SSD. I love that you can run dual drives. 1 SSD + 1 HDD. I added a 2TB HDD for Data Storage for $50, it came with the bracket in the box, and it didn't void the warranty, like on my LG Gram. The 128gb SSD is functioning as a Boot Drive. I also added a 16gb module for about $50 and now have 20gb RAM. The upgrades were pretty straightforward and you can use normal small screwdrivers.<br/><br/>Performance: It boots up super fast, maybe 10 seconds to reach the sign in screen and 2 seconds to log in. Web pages and programs load quickly. We use it for Web browsing, Word, PowerPoint &amp; Excel. I'm not doing video editing or high performance gaming on this but it runs almost as fast as my i5 LG Gram that cost $1500 with all SSD drives. It doesn't get too warm but we do have it on a fan stand, but I don't usually plug it in because for some reason the USB keeps powering the fan after it powers down, and I can't find a BIOS setting to turn this off. I notice that it gets a little warm when sitting directly on a table. I usually can't hear the fan at all. Sometimes you can hear it kick on when you open up 15 tabs and a bunch of apps.<br/><br/>Screen: The screen is really nice too. It's 1080 Full HD so you don't see the pixels like on a normal 15" Standard HD screen. I think it's average brightness but we use it indoors so it's plenty bright for our needs.<br/><br/>Keyboard: I love the Keyboard, it's much better than the keyboard on my LG Gram, and just as good as the best keyboards I have tested in BestBuy from Lenovo. It's wonderful to type on. It's backlit as well so that's nice plus. And I love the Number Pad, even though the number pad is a little skinner than the other keys.<br/><br/>Fingerprint ID: It's super fast and I didn't know how much I would love it!<br/><br/>Speakers: The speakers are fine. They are loud enough to watch YouTube videos and the news but it won't compete with a home stereo system.<br/><br/>Ports: It has plenty of full size ports: 3 USB, 1 USB C, 1 Full HDMI a headphone jack and even a RJ-45 Ethernet Port! I hate dongles so it's nice that you don't need one for this laptop. I would have liked to see a MicroSD reader but my wife doesn't SD Cards it so it's no big deal for her.<br/><br/>Window 11: It comes with Windows 11s but is very easy to switch to standard Windows 11. I was a little concerned about this and it almost made me not go for this laptop. But it's no big deal, as soon as you try to install something "non Microsoft" like Google Chrome it says something like, "If you want to install non-Microsoft software, you have to switch to full Windows 11 mode. Are you sure? You will loose all the exclusive Microsoft Security with Windows 11s Mode." But you just click, "Yes" and it switches, it may require a reboot but I can't remember.<br/><br/>Battery: The battery is average. We usually leave it plugged in on the desk but the few times that we have used it without a battery we used it for a few hours and it remained at 70% battery. Windows 11 doesn't estimate the time remaining so I really don't know for sure how long it would last. I'd guess it would go from 100% to 10% in about 5-6 hours for Netflix, YouTube or web browsing or MS Office apps.<br/><br/>Again, I really love this laptop. I keep telling my wife how impressed I am with the performance, storage upgrade options, keyboard, screen, etc. She doesn't really care that much as long as it works fast and does what she wants so I decided I had to tell all of you Amazon people that this is a great laptop for 95% of normal people who just want something that works well and is a good price. I highly recommend the acer aspire 15 and would buy it again, no regrets!</span>

<span>I think for 350-400 this laptop is probably one of the best you could find, especially considering it's size. I'm not sure how people are having trouble switching out of S mode, but I did it in literal seconds (for free, no clue how people are getting messages they have to pay) after I was able to access the desktop so that's a complete non-issue. It also looks a bit more expensive than it is which is cool I guess.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The audio is good but rather quiet, there's oddly no light indicator on the caps lock, and the buttons to raise/lower the brightness have their icons swapped?<br/>Hard drive is miniscule, I had 85 GB free in total. At least it is a SSD. You can find external hard drives of any size for cheap nowadays so this isn't an issue, also given that the computer has 3 USB ports, just be aware of it going in.</span>

<span>I'm far from a computer expert. I bought this computer for work because my job requires me to use a couple of different specific software programs. I needed a computer with a lot of storage, a fairly large screen, a numerical keypad, and most importantly, a cheap price tag. This computer has all of those things. I don't do any gaming or anything really sophisticated on it. Just work and some internet browsing. It boots up quickly and has been running smoothly so far. My biggest complaint is that it came with a lot of Microsoft bloatware that I hadn't experienced on my other laptops and by default it uses your Microsoft OneDrive for storage instead of the computer's SSD. The first time I logged onto the computer it asked me to either sign up for a Microsoft account or login to an existing one. My job requires me to take a lot of photos, so I was saving my photos to the computer without realizing it was uploading to my cloud storage account. That was an annoyance because I had to figure out how to switch that off. I unintentionally used up all of my cloud storage space because I didn't realize the system was set up that way. Once I figured out how to fix it, I was good to go. Also, the computer essentially comes in a "safe mode" which limits a lot of what you can do. It is designed for you to only use apps from the Microsoft app store and not download any software from any other source. It can be turned off, but it is another annoyance. I feel like they were trying to make it like their version of a Chromebook, but that makes it just as annoying as a Chromebook. Overall, it is a great computer once you get past all the Microsoft stuff.</span>

There is no home icon to bring me back to my home page, and the micro soft that comes preinstalled does not let me use google at all, everytime I've tried to use google browser micrsoft prevents it, the screen is a bit smaller then the advertized measurements imply, and every single day since I purchased this laptop there have been microsoft updates which is getting fustrating. If you don't install the updates asap it slows the laptop way down  and I've only owned this for not quite thirty days</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I've had several technology fails this year, including my gaming laptop and my Linux laptop breaking down. My budget is not what it was when I bought the gaming laptop, and the other one was a hand-me-down from a relative. So, I needed a cheap laptop to do basic typing and web browsing on until I can afford something to game on. Finding a non-Chromebook under $300 is tough these days, so I took a chance on this model.<br/><br/>This laptop is good for very basic functionality. It's small, lightweight, and runs quickly enough (granted you buy a separate hard drive and don't overload its very small memory). I have the feeling that it would run better with an older OS: Windows 11 is not only awful on its own, it's terribly bloated for a small-memory machine like this one. I won't go into all the reasons why I hate W11 here, that would be a whole other review. I would recommend installing another OS on it if you have the know-how to do so. I may eventually install a Linux OS on it if performance ever decreases. So far, it's quick enough for me. Don't expect lightning-fast loading, though. Another tip: look up ways to unload extra programs to free up space and don't have any programs run on start/continuously in the background if you can help it (OneDrive really bogs the system down).<br/><br/>The screen quality is middling but it displays videos crisply enough. I wish it would dim a little more, since I often type in low-lighting. This leads me to my biggest complaint: NO KEYBOARD BACKLIGHT. I suspected it wouldn't have one since it wasn't mentioned in the product description, but since it's such an important feature, I'm mentioning it in all-caps here. I use a low-wattage lamp to type by and I can see the keys (the white keyboard helps with this), not to mention I can type without looking at the keyboard often, but be warned about this! I know a keyboard backlight is a must-have for anyone that may need to type in extremely low/no-lighting situations.<br/><br/>I'll also mention that this is not a touchscreen laptop. I never use touchscreen laptops, but I know some buyers may expect this feature. The touchpad mouse has no buttons and can be a bit wonky; I highly recommend buying a separate mouse.<br/><br/>I tried to run Steam and some games on this machine out of curiosity. Don't do that. Even pixel art games with low-demand graphics will skip, sometimes freeze, and put too much demand on the system. I haven't tried streaming video from this machine to my TV yet. This is not a media or gaming laptop, though. You can stream any service on its native screen (YouTube, etc) easily, play music streaming or old school mp3s (you'll need a separate drive for CDs/DVDs), but I wouldn't push it beyond that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's what I expected for the price. I wish it had an older version of Windows and a keyboard backlight, but neither is necessary for my needs. I use it for listening to music while typing and sometimes streaming YouTube, it works fine for those things. I've un-bloated the system as much as possible and done some tweaks to get it to run as fast as it can, but not every buyer may know how to do this and especially running OneDrive all the time can bog the system down considerably. It definitely needs a separate flash or hard drive to extend its memory. I will update this review in the future if any issues arise.</span>

<span>I thought it was a great laptop for its price but I got it for streaming obs and I didn’t realize that obs is not compatible with chromebook so I am returning sadly. I definitely didn’t know how to right click on this kind of pad, so if anyone is wondering, you tap the right side of the pad one single time with your index fingers in case I’m not the only one and I hope I’m not lol overall if I could have used this for what I bought it for I feel like it’d be a steal. It’s not a slow computer, the screen quality is honestly better than I thought it’d be for it being as cheap as it is but it’s not like it’s top notch quality of course just better than I personally expected, battery life is great and it’s definitely lightweight. I love that a case was included as well.</span>
