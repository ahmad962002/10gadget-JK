<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>This camera is a great starter camera. I used it as my starter and it is amazing. The focus, 4K shots, nightime view, quality, and zoom is amazing if you're starting out. It produces great photos for a long time. The battery life could be longer but that doesn't take away from how amazing this camera has been for me. 5 Stars. 100% reccomend to starters and/or sports photographers</span>

<span>Overall this is an excellent camera. It feels great in the hands and the zoom and image stabilizationis phenomenal. a few problems i have is that if youre shooting professionally, or even semi professionally, do not get it. The camera does have quite a few filter features which are each individually able to be customized as well. the only reason why i am giving the camera a 4 star rating is because i am a sucker for detail, and when cropping the images you do get a decent amout of grain, even with the ISO set for 100.  When you use the function for shooting in raw,there is alot of grain and discoleration when aking light and color adjustments, furthermore, you get alot of chromatic light abberations in your shots when using the zoom feature in sunlight. other than that it is a great camera. this camera is excellent if you just want to take memorable shots on a trip or vacation and it is very versatile as far as the functions it has. it is highly customizable which ia also a plus but at the same time does take some time to get used to. One really good feature this camera has is continuous 4k burst mode, but i highly recommend getting a high speed memory card due to the fact that if you dont, the camera will stop recording 5-10 shot inso the process. The vidio quality and sound quality is excellent on this camera, and if you enjoy taking video as well as shots, this is the camera to get. also, the screen swivels 180 degrees so it makes it easy to get shots above your head, or close to the groung in a crouched position. The camera also comes with a lense hood for blocking sunlight that might cause haze or light leaks in your shots. So to summerize, proffesionally, not a great camera to have, but if you just want something versatile and quick and easy to use that takes good quality shots and video for traveling etc, this is the camera to buy. I provided some example pictures above so you can see what it is capable of.</span>

<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>I have a degree in photography, and I currently have a Cannon DSLR. I have been looking for a bridge camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on trips, so I don't have to carry 3-4 lenses.  I also wanted to have a camera the I would be allowed into concert venues. This camera is light and easy to use. The main reason I purchased this camera is the ability to save as RAW photos. I admittedly have only had the camera for a few days. I am loving it. The ability to shoot in 4K burst came in handy while photographing the hummingbirds in my yard. I purchased the camera thru Adorama. Received the camera before it was expected. Customer Service is quick and efficient. Thanks Adorama!</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>The zoom is truly awesome in this.  No SLR lens can compare.  It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.<br/>4k video is great.  I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.<br/>Fast FPS.  The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps.  It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos.  Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out.  Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me).  I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly.  As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.<br/>Cons:<br/>Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful.  To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no "action" choice on the selector.  The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed.  I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this.  I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst.  I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast).  This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.<br/>No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss.  Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST.  This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for.  Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.<br/>Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode)<br/>My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only "A", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience.  I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots).  Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects.  The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable.  The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me.  I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd.  And for $300, no SLR can compare on value.  However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist.  Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.</span>

Its “mirrorless” design enables a lighter, more compact camera body while also offering cutting-edge video, audio, creative controls, wireless, intelligent-focusing and exposure technologies not possible with traditional DSLRs. With the exclusive Lumix 4K PHOTO (~8MP, 30/60 fps), simply pause that perfect moment from video to produce printable high-resolution photos. A high-resolution 17. 5mm, 0. 7x OLED eye viewfinder (2, 360K-dot) matches up to exactly how you intended to see the image even under direct sunlight. For connectivity convenience, the G7 includes 3. 5mm and 2. 5mm microphone & remote ports, USB 2. 0 and a micro-HDMI (Type D) terminal. The G7 can be combined with the DMW-FL580L External Flash, the DMW-MS2 Stereo/Shotgun Microphone and many other accessories. It’s also compatible with newer BUS Class UHS-I/UHS-II SDXC/SDHC SD cards capable of storing high-resolution 4K videos and meeting the demands of 4K Photo and RAW mode burst shooting.

<span>I'm brand new to photography; I've always been curious, but never gotten into it very much. After LOTS of research I decided on the Lumix G7.<br/>PHENOMENAL camera, as far as this novice can tell. Mirrorless, so it's lightweight. The picture quality is superb, the autofocus is intuitive, the entire package is solid. And the 4k features available in such a cost-efficient bundle can't be beat (I'm seeing retailers offering it $100 less than what I paid for it a month ago now). If you're just starting out like me, you really can't go wrong with this one. I'm also a YouTube content creator (shameless plug: check out "Chris and the XD in The C4 Movement") so having this available to shoot up to 30 mins of 4k video is huge. I'm loving almost everything about this camera.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing that stops it from getting a full 5 stars from me: it has a mount for tripods, but the manual states anything over .22 inches is not recommended and may damage the camera. That rules out a LOT of the tripods I've been seeing. As a photography novice, to really learn the shots and get best possible images without camera shake, I really need a tripod. Perhaps options exist, I'll keep searching, but just keep that in mind as you consider options. If you're going to need to mount on a tripod this may not be the perfect choice. But if you're like me and just want to make some cool shots here and there, I heartily recommend giving this camera consideration.</span>

<span>I'm just a hobbyist photographer and wanted a better quality camera with interchangeable lenses. This fit what I was looking for and the price range I was in. My photos are decent, but can get better as I learn more about post processing and editing. But this camera has served me well for years and I've used it a lot while on trips with excellent results at least to me. I do wish it better stabilization. Some third party brand lenses that have stabilization in them won't work with this camera body. Only Panasonic branded lenses will work with the stabilization for this model. The newer cameras are more up-to-date with this stuff and interchangeable with the stabilization.<br/>I may upgrade in the future but this camera is still great quality and I will continue to use until then.</span>

<span>EDITED 8/17/2015:<br/><br/>I recently received a Panasonic G7 from Amazon, and I have already shot over 20,000 frames with it during the seven weeks I've had it (with many different lenses, and with mostly using the electronic shutter), plus a few video tests. Since I already own the Panasonic G5, and GH4 (and I also had the G6), and have shot over 125,000(!) photos with these MFT cameras, I was familiar with Panasonic cameras, and also with the menu settings changes I generally make to get what I want in the images. The G7 fits “neatly” between the very small and light G5/6 bodies and the considerably larger and heavier GH4 (although that one is still relatively compact compared with most dSLRs, and its MFT lenses are also generally very compact and light – and this gear is FUN to carry and use!). I value the GH4 for its excellent EVF, great grip (it is easy and secure to use one-handed), its excellent set of useful external controls, its wide range of useful options in its easily-used menus, the excellence of its stills-quality (with selected type and sample of lenses, and with customized menu settings), and its great video capabilities. I value the G5 for its sharp EVF (the one on the G6 has better color and contrast, but it is not as sharp), its miniscule size and weight, its very good external controls and menus, and the excellence of its stills and video (although the G5, unlike the G6, has no external mic input, and it is without focus-peaking).<br/><br/>The G7 is a nice combination of the good qualities of both the G5/6 and the GH4, at a lower price in size, weight, and cost compared with the GH4 - although it is without weather-sealing and high data-rate and slow-motion 1080 video options (but it does have 100Mbps 4K-24/30P video plus “4K-Photo” options). The excellent EVF is similar to the one in the GH4, the grip is almost as good, the external controls (both buttons and knobs) are unusually numerous and useful, and the menus are similar to, and consistent with, those of the other models in the line. A few items have been added to what the G5 had: 4K-Photo/Video, the tone-curve adjustment shared with the GX7/8 and GH4 (I find this very useful!), “Diffraction Compensation” (I briefly tried this and decided to leave it “Off” – it progressively sharpens  the image as the lens is stopped down to its smallest stops to offset the softening normally resulting from diffraction, but this can result in excessive noise even in good light - and this sharpening can be done better during editing), and an external mic input similar to the one on the G6 (but missing on the G5 and GX7). Using the G7's electronic shutter, leaving the EVF and camera always-on during shooting sessions, and using no flash, I get well over 600 JPG highest-quality frames per battery charge.<br/><br/>As for color and other photo characteristics, I appreciate having the ability to adjust EVERYTHING on these Panasonic MFT cameras (color balance and saturation, contrast, color-curves, sharpening and noise-reduction levels, etc.) - and I also appreciate being able to match surprisingly well the EVF's characteristics with those of my reference computer monitor so that I get very useful and accurate previewing while using the EVF (with a floppy wide-brimmed hat worn while outdoors to shade the EVF). These cameras are a "tweaker's" (read, "perfectionist's"...;-) dream come true...!<br/><br/>Overall, I have no real complaints with the G7, although a few things bothered me very slightly at first. As with the GH4, the rear “dial” (which on the G7 is a circle of buttons as with the G5, rather than a wheel as with the GH4) gets somewhat “hidden” below the rear surface of the camera toward the “dial’s” upper right – but this is to keep it from being unintentionally pressed/moved by the right hand gripping the camera. It took me a bit of time to remember the new way to access exposure bias adjustment (I generally use A-Priority, setting the aperture for best lens performance with each lens and/or for best DOF for what I want in the image – and I often adjust exposure-bias as I shoot, using the excellent EVF as a guide), and it required a button-push to access this on the G7 (the G5/6 and GH4 can be left with the rear thumb-wheel needing only to be moved in order to adjust exposure bias). But, I discovered that with going into "Dial Set" in the menus, I was able to enable exposure biasing with a simple turn of the rear wheel (no button press required!;-). Also, the image resolution is very slightly smaller than that of the other Panasonic cameras I've used, but this is of little practical consequence. And, as others have noticed, the G7's (and also my GH4's) serial number tends to "evaporate" - and with my G7, there is now no trace remaining of that number. Panasonic has recognized this issue, and if both the box label with the serial number and the purchase invoice are retained, and if the camera is registered with Panasonic, the warranty will be honored.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is one HECK of a nice camera, at a very decent price! Highly recommended! (A few photos taken with the G7 are attached...)<br/><br/>--DR</span>

<span>In this day of camera smart-phones, is there still a place for DSLRs?<br/><br/>I say yes, if you actually want to take pictures rather than snapshots and if you are willing spend some money and are ready to haul some stuff around to take those pictures. I settled on the Micro 4/3 format because it is the most easily portable DSLR camera, and therefore the most likely to be used by me.  I don't see myself printing larger than 8x10 photos so 16mp is more than enough and overkill for social media. The regular-speed 4K video is more than adequate for and videography I will be doing (invest in a good mike to up your game).<br/><br/>A HUGE plus is the fact that this camera and kit lens that cam with it are weather-sealed so I have peace of mind taking it on a hike.<br/><br/>I look forward for using 4K pre-burst mode, it is literally a time machine, letting you capture an event up to one second before you push the shutter button! It allows you to follow your child on the field and to get the shots you really want with having to take thousands of pictures.<br/><br/>There are trade-offs for not going full-frame sensor (e.g. low-light performance, less depth of field) but the price differential, $697 on sale with a 12-60mm weather proof lens, rather than thousands for the bigger camera? It was a no brainer for me.<br/><br/>Great ergonomics, custom setting modes that can be saved to allow up to 4 different set-ups, a very good and versatile kit lens (24-120mm 35mm equivalent focal length) all in a camera that I will take on day hikes.<br/><br/>Go on Youtube and watch some videos about what this camera can do. You will see that it is still more than adequate for a hobby-enthusiast.  It has rekindled my love of photography.  Happy snapping!</span>

<span>I mostly use this for video and I'm very impressed with this camera. I want to shoot and then minimize editing as much as possible so that's why I like the G85 so much. The 4k video quality with standard un-graded settings is better than the GH4 I replaced this with.  The clarity and color is better with the standard settings and I don't really have time to get lost in post processing.  I also compared this to the Sony RX10iii and its 4k video quality was just a tiny bit less detailed but the overall look was better with the G85. Also the menu settings are so much easier with the g85 over the Sony.  Also the button placement is much more intuitive with the G85. Auto focus seems about the same but I mainly use manual for video to make sure it stays in focus.  Especially because I'm shooting in a controlled environment.  I'll miss the wide focus range but not by that much and I can always buy more lenses with the G85.  Another thing is the G85 seems like it has a touch less crop shooting in 4k so I can get a slightly larger angle.  That bothers me with all cameras when shooting 4k and I wish I could get the 35mm equivalent of 24mm out of it instead of more like 28mm in 4k. Also it seems that the  Pictures were much better with the G85.  It seems that whenever I put the RX10iii in auto focus to try to get some kid pics for fun 1 out of 5 pics came out correctly where almost every pic comes out correctly with the G85.  For me the f3.5 does a good job but it sure does look better with the f2.8 12-35 lens. I thought my untrained eye might not pick that up but it did. Everything looks better even when comparing f3.5 vs. f3.5.  It's pricey so it might not be for everyone.  I also tried the Sony a6300 and it was an amazing camera but it overheated very quickly weather I pulled the monitor away from the body or not.  So there was no way I could keep it and that's a major deal breaker.  The G85 can get warm but never get's so hot that it over heats and shuts down when shooting for extended periods in 4k.  I shot for about 4-5 hours in a row shootiing 5-8 minute vids at a quick turn around and it never shut down. It got a little warmer than the GH4 and Sony RX10iii but never malfunctioned so all is well.<br/><br/>The one issue I have with the G85 is I wish there was a 4k 30mbps instead of just 4k 100mbps.  I shot around 40 5-8 minute videos and it was something like 122Gb.  I had to use compression software to keep it which is a bit anoyying.  Love the water/dust resistance and that is what kept me from keeping the G7.  It also feels like a better made camera than the G7 with a more intuitive layout too.<br/><br/>If you are like me, an intermediate, who needs a good camera with 4k for work but doesn't want to go too deep into the post processing world it's hard to find a better camera.</span>

<span>The Panasonic G85 was my first mirrorless camera after years of using a Nikon D40 DSLR. I wanted a camera that's good for photography and video, and the G85 has lived up to my expectations. Not only is the camera good, but I also like the well developed ecosystem of lenses and accessories, which continues to grow and improve.<br/><br/>Likes:<br/>* The controls are intuitive and responsive, with many switches and buttons to quickly access the setting I need, and there's a lot of ways to customize the controls to my preference. The touch screen further augments the physical controls, and I use it often. I also like the two custom modes on the dial to quickly access my often used settings.<br/>* The ergonomics and hand comfort are good. Controls can be reached without straining my fingers. I can carry the camera and kit lens without a strap, and not feel any noticeable discomfort.<br/>* It can reliably and quickly focus under low light and tricky conditions. Better than my old DSLR.<br/>* The image stabilization is outstanding. It allows for almost effortless hand holding at normal focal lengths, and reasonably feasible hand holding at 300mm and longer focal lengths.<br/>* The image quality is very good, better than my old DSLR in terms of dynamic range, sharpness, noise performance. Since I don't plan on using crazy high ISO, I don't need a larger sensor, and the compromises of an inferior system.<br/>* Did I mention the system? Not only is this camera weather sealed, but Panasonic has a growing number of weather sealed lenses to match. One of the reasons why I didn't go with the Sony E-mount system. I'm also enjoying the benefits of a 600mm-equivalent tele lens that isn't ridiculously bulky and heavy.<br/>* It actually has a built in flash. Since I don't plan on limiting my self to an indoor studio, and don't plan to lug around a bulky external flash, this was a must have feature for me. If Fuji would have thought of such a revolutionary idea, maybe I would be using their camera instead.<br/>* It has the video features I need - external mic jack, tilt and swivel screen, peaking, zebra stripes, and manual exposure. Many other mirrorless cameras I looked at were missing one or more of these.<br/>* Panasonic has addressed the early problems of stabilization humming and jerky panning with firmware upgrades. I no longer have any serious complaints about the camera, and it shows they take their camera business seriously.<br/>* The kit lens is noticeably more capable than most other kit lenses elsewhere. Not only is the zoom range wider and longer, but it's weather sealed to match the camera body. This is the lens I use most often.<br/><br/>Dislikes:<br/>* It would have been nice to incorporate a wireless remote shutter release that doesn't involve a smartphone, like the inexpensive infrared remote on my Nikon D40. Instead I'm forced to buy a more expensive and less convenient cable release.<br/><br/>Overall, a very capable camera and system, and priced lower than the competition I looked at. Looking forward to getting a lot of use from this new camera.</span>

<span>UPDATE (4 Star) After getting the technician report it said: "excessive amount of dust in lens and on barrels causing issue-unable to clean off- dust also in unit-deemed abused". I am not sure how to abuse a camera to insert dust inside it- and to clean it the charges were to be over $200. For having this camera for two months through normal use, I felt the need to write a strong email and request to speak to a manager, especially with my big trip coming up (which this camera was mainly for) with a few days left to spare. He decided to authorize the repairs in warranty this time and had said to always store the camera in a case and never put it directly put it in my pocket (which is what I tend to do with smaller cameras). I luckily got it back today with 1 day to spare before leaving the country and it looks great and has no dust on the lens. I still warn others though that this camera is prone to this dust issue, which is a major design flaw in my opinion- but use with a case and never in your pocket and hopefully this experience does not happen to you!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW (1 Star) This is the second Lumix I have purchased, and after my experience with Panasonic I will never purchase a Panasonic product of any kind. My prior Lumix was great, however after a year there was dust/fibers in the camera that were ruining every photo (I would have to manually Photoshop it out of thousands of images). In that case, my Asurion warranty through Amazon came to the rescue and I got the camera good as new in under a week.<br/><br/>With this new camera, I had it for under two months and it already had the same issue- I am not sure how dust and fibers get in Lumix cameras so easily. Asurion said the camera is still under Panasonic's warranty so they cannot handle it until later. I used Panasonic's help form and mailed in the camera. After not hearing anything after two weeks, I decided to give them a call today and they claim the camera is 'out of warranty and beyond repair because of excessive dust in the lens'. I am not quite sure how it can be deemed as excessive- regardless of the amount of dust, cleaning it is the same process. Also, Asurion was able to clean a much dirtier lens and get it back to me in less than a week. How does the repair center for the camera manufacturer so incompetent in their abilities that they cannot perform a basic clean their own product while a third party, like Asurion, can have it back in under a week? When I asked why they had not contacted me and that they were simply not going to fix the camera and were just holding it, they said they didn't have my email address on-file. The hilarious thing is that to give them all my information I had to send my phone, address, product, serial number, and other info via my email address through previous correspondence with them. I told the Panasonic representative that it was unacceptable their product is unusable after 2 months after minimal use, with a simple issue that their technician team is unwilling to address, and that they weren't even going to reach out to me to tell me?!? The technician didn't even apologize- for any of Panasonic's incompetency in design or service, and pretty much had a 'just deal with it' attitude. I requested a manager call me back and am awaiting to hear anything.<br/><br/>I am going on a big Europe trip in two weeks and now I have no camera and am down $400. I am a very reasonable and patient person, but this is the worst customer service I have had in my entire life. Unless they fix this I will never purchase a Panasonic product again of any kind in my life- it is unacceptable. Panasonic's tagline should be 'Terrible Cameras and Customer Service™'</span>

<span>Did I say I loved this camera?  Well I do.  I love this camera.  When it first arrived I was a little disappointed that it is a little bulkier than my previous cameras.  I've purchased several generations of the Panasonic ZS series and have loved every one.  Well, I was tired of buying refurbs and decided to treat myself to a brand new model, with all the bells and whistles.  This was the first camera I've had without GPS built in.  Initially I was disappointed that I couldn't get one with it, but connecting it with the cell phone's GPS was easy.  On average it's taken about 13 seconds to lock in, the longest was maybe 20 seconds.  I was concerned about when I travel abroad if it would work, but from what I've read, you bring your cell phone and even if you don't have phone or internet service, our US gov't tax dollars provide us with free satellite connections all over the planet. I haven't had the opportunity to test this for myself, but there are a few YouTubers who have confirmed it.<br/><br/> ANYWAY this thing takes amazing pictures.  Granted, all digital cameras have their faults when it comes to focus and lighting issues, but for the most part this thing works like a champ and on rare occasions have I run into any of those problems.<br/><br/>The screen is crisp and flips up for selfies, and includes a 4-3-2-1 countdown so you can smile and look ready and natural for the shot.  This also worked well when I had to use a mini tripod for a group photo and it 'just' gave me enough time to jump in - although the outtakes are pretty funny with my hair flying in the air as I hadn't quite gotten where I needed to be.  And even THOSE pictures are CRISP.<br/><br/>It is such a pleasure to take a Panoramic shot and have all the images stitched right on the camera rather than bringing it home and doing it on the computer.  How nice to see it instantly to ensure you've captured everything you wanted.  I have yet to try it but am anxious to dabble with the burst feature along with another 'stitching' program which takes several photos you've chosen (out of up to 30[?]) and putting them together to show the object-in-motion in a series of positions, while everything else stays the same.  THIS you have to use software for, but it's going to be great, I know it.<br/><br/>SUMMARY:  The camera is great.  As far as point-and-shoot cameras go, it is a terrific choice with lots of cool features.  It's a little too big to fit in an average sized pocket but if you wear cargo pants, you can probably carry it in there.  I chose to get a good case with a strap as I decided that most of the time I KNOW when I'll be taking pictures, and will want it out and ready anyway.  The other reason is that these cameras are notorious for getting dust in, behind the lens and will need it cleaned professionally (trust me - as careful as I was it was still a disaster doing it myself).  The GPS will work anywhere and tag all your photos accordingly.  Panoramic shots, you see in an instant!  Burst is terrific too, and the app and/or software will help to make some even more interesting pictures for you to share.  You want this camera.  I have absolutely NO buyer's remorse.</span>

<span> Doing multicam work, and find this camera to be the best in decades of shooting.  4K 10bit in 3840 or C4K/DCI on fairly standard SDXC cards, not exotic memory cards that A7SIII would need.  Glad to finally move on from Sony ecosystem, especially in the IOS stabilization department.  Happy with the image quality, and the lightweight 20-60mm lens.<br/>I'm a SOC (Society Of Camera Ops member), and enjoy using it for handheld work also.  Good viewfinder, and ability to place the LCD screen implements well also.  Connectivity and ports are ample. Pair it with a fast lens for very low light shooting.  Typical night lighting, it images fine.<br/>Basically like I mentioned, it can record 4K 10bit onto pretty standard SDXC cards.  Yes you can go down the higher bitrate road to wherever with the Sony and others, but this one can go there too, externally to a Ninja V, in 6K.  Personally if I need 6K in 12 bit, I would rather buy regular useable recording memory, ie SDXC cards and SSD drives, instead of proprietary or expensive memory.<br/>The power options are excellent, the single battery last a long time, and it can take external power through USB-C.<br/>So I started this whole rig with building it with Sony A7SIII's.  I quickly changed that when looking at a side by side sequence shot with both cameras (A7SIII and S5).  The test was at night.  To me the S5 had much better motion interpretation, and again way way better stabilization.  The S5 to me was a clearly better choice for my work.<br/>One last thing, the video shows 8 S5 cameras in full record sync, I love that multicam record beep sound.</span>

<span>I really love this camera, and at the 2-2.5k USD price point I think it is the best out there. I usually jump between Nikon and Sony, so this felt like an awesome blend of the two (with the autofocus being the only quality that's worse than both of the others). Overall, for narrative filmmaking, travel filmmaking, vlogging that doesn't challenge the autofocus with fast-changing lighting or subjects, general photography (except for maybe sports unless you're okay with 6K Photo burst) this is an amazing all-rounder. The kit lens is also super versatile. The 20mm is awesome for vlogging, architecture, and some landscape work, while 60mm is decent enough for some light portraiture and compression. I paired this with the newer 85mm 1.8 to satisfy some low-light, bokeh and telephoto gaps that the kit lens leaves. I think an S5 + 20-60mm, 85mm 1.8 (and/or 35/50mm 1.8), and 70-300mm would be a perfect combo for most hybrid shooters that don't require faster zooms for sports/weddings/other high-pressure and non-repeatable moments.<br/><br/>This issue: I thought I purchased a new camera, but the package doesn't come with sealing so there's no way to really tell, but I found that my 20-60mm Lens came with the wrong model lens cap and the rear lens cap has some subtle scratches on it. It seems like the optics are pristine and the camera looked and worked equally fantastic, but when you pay for a new product (even if it was on sale at the time) you expect to have an unused product. I'm fine with dinged up, scratched and beat gear, but I'd much prefer to be the one to run it through the mud and to at least not pay a "new" price for someone else's mistakes.<br/><br/>Still a wonderful camera and I will either re-order or wait for a successor, because this is really something special.</span>

The EOS R combines a redeveloped lens mount and an updated full-frame image sensor for a unique and sophisticated multimedia camera system. Revolving around the new RF lens mount, the EOS R was created to be the means to make the most of a new series of lenses and optical technologies.

<span>The EOS R + 24-105mmm kit is replacing my 5D Mark III + 24-105mm kit.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice when you pick up the camera is that both the body and the native lens are noticeably lighter than the 5D Mark III kit. The body is very easy to hold, fits firmly in the hand. The LCD is bright and clear, even in daylight, and the touch controls are incredibly intuitive to use, you can tap to focus, navigate menus using your finger, pinch zoom, like on a phone.<br/><br/>The eye detection autofocus is especially helpful with wide aperture lenses like the 85mm F/1.4. Due to the very shallow depth of field, even a slight movement can throw the eye out of focus. You can easily end up focusing on the nose or ears with the eyes blurred. With the 5D Mark III, it was a challenge to get close shots with wide apertures right. The EOS R focuses on the eyes accurately pretty much every time. Out of the 100+ portrait shots I took over the holidays, less than 5 were out of focus. Even shots taken by others with no DSLR experience were focused perfectly, which I couldn't say about the 5D. As a bonus, eye detection works even with cats and dogs, as the attached photo attests.<br/><br/>Despite the higher resolution, the camera performs well at high ISOs. The attached photo was shot at ISO 4000, F/2.0, 1/60s, 85mm, at dim lighting. You will notice that color accuracy is excellent and noise is barely noticeable.<br/><br/>I love the control ring on RF 24-105 lens, which I programmed to adjust exposure compensation quickly. It is too bad that the control ring adapter was not available at the time when I bought the kit.<br/><br/>Since I always shoot raw, I appreciate the fact that there is a raw-only mode (no JPEGs) and images are saved at a more efficient compressed raw format. Despite the higher resolution, the .CR3 files are smaller than the Mark III's CR2s.<br/><br/>What I really miss on this camera is an analog mode dial.<br/><br/>As for the touch bar, I did my best practice and learn how to use it productively, but failed. I consider it a gimmick that I will likely never master.<br/><br/>Although I already have a GH5 for video, I did some experimenting with the video mode on the EOS R. One nasty surprise was that the SD cards I had, which easily handle 4K/10-bit video (150Mbit) on the GH5 were not fast enough for the Canon, even though in IPB  mode the bitrate should be only 120Mbit. I need to stick with HD for now.<br/><br/>With the EF-EOS R mount adapter, all 7 of my existing EF lenses, even non-Canon ones, work flawlessly. I am really glad that Canon made the new RF mount backward-compatible.</span>

<span>I am a Semi Pro and have been for more than 15 years now. I have the 5DII &amp; III and decided to get the R instead of the 5D IV for a couple of reasons.  First I'm getting older and I wanted something more compact to walk around with and second, I didn't want to sacrifice image quality by downsizing.  Since I already have a significant investment in EF-L lenses the EOS R with the ring adapter seemed to be the perfect way to go without investing in a whole new and unfamiliar system.<br/>  As my title states - I have ZERO regrets. I bought the R with the RF 24-105 f4 IS lens and a the Canon Control Ring Mount Adapter for my EF-L lens lineup. The RF 24-105 that I got with my R is the quickest focusing, tack sharp lenses I have ever owned. The IS gives me at least 3 stops to play with in low light. In my tests I can easily shoot 1/40th hand held no problem.  All of my EF-L lenses work flawlessly with the adapter - Thank you Canon!<br/>  Images are beautiful with very good performance in low light, high ISO, with very usable images up to 8000 ISO even though I rarely go over 6800 ISO.<br/>  The controls (buttons &amp; dials)  are very customizable and I have even found a good setup for the hated touch bar that the critics keep bagging on.<br/>  So in short - the haters can keep on hating but I love my Canon EOS R.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have bought both the Panasonic FZ2500 and the RX10IV Sony and compared both of them side by side.  First, the FZ2500 is such a light camera it is a blessing for its light weight compared to the Sony.  The function buttons are many to behold and in all the right places.  The balance is great because of its inner lenses zoom.<br/><br/>Once the camera is turned on the outer lens is fixed, no movement, only the inner lenses zoom in and out!<br/><br/>It is, without a doubt, a great fixed lens prosumer video camera with one of the best zooms in the video world of camcorders and cameras under 2,000 dollars.<br/><br/>The zoom video part is actually better than the RX10IV Sony IMHO, which is saying a lot!<br/><br/>How many times have you used these bridge cameras and said to yourself, "If I could just slow the darned zoom down, I would not have to jerk the zoom along, If I had not jerked the zoom, it would have looked like a professional video!"<br/><br/>Well, if you are looking for a great slow, smooth, best zooming bridge video camera, stop here, you do not have to look any farther than the Panasonic FZ2500.<br/><br/>It has time lapse, built in filters, and it converts its ultra high definition into 8 mega-pixel stills, and it even has Dolly Zoom where the image stays still as the background can either zoom forward or backward behind the person or object.  This all done by the computer inside the camera!  First of its kind?  I think so.  Yes, and the lens is very clear.  Is it as clear as the Zeiss lens in the RX10IV?  No it is not.  But that is IMHO. I looked at one camera each; side by side. Did I buy two dozen cameras each and check each one out?  No, I did not.<br/><br/>The FZ2500 has been biased against from the start, from what I read from normal consumer reviews mainly from Amazon and a few from B&amp;H that made me wonder if that old axiom a rolling stone gathers no moss is true. Once that bias gets rolling it is hard to stop and even the professional reviewers who are hard pressed to keep silent on a story that has blossomed and has gained momentum. There is a fear of some reviewers about feeling excluded and being left behind from new news. You have to be quick in the camera new news business because a new camera can become an old camera very, very quick. Reviewers can be left behind, but the Panasonic FZ2500 was about a camera that very well could have ended up being fake news.  I know at least two professional reviewers that are regarded at the top of their camera professions, added on to their reviews, later, saying there could be a quality control problem with the Panasonic Leica lens being too soft.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Where there is smoke there is fire.  There is that slight chance that there is a quality control problem in the Panasonic factories that make the Panasonic FZ2500, but I doubt it. The reason I doubt it is because the same factories make the FZ200 and the FZ1000 cameras that have very few problems that I can remember reading in the consumer reviews.  I own both of those cameras and love each one and feel they are very well built and very well made and have very clear Leica lenses.  I can see no differences between the FZ1000 and the FZ2500 camera lens.<br/><br/>Does the RX10IV Sony have time lapse, neutral density filters with built-in control buttons on the camera, and convert its ultra high definition 4k video into frame by frame 8 mega-pixel stills.? Does it have Dolly Zoom? Does it have a fully articulated LCD Screen?  No it does not have any of those above options, but I wish it did.<br/><br/>Do you know a camera that does.  Yes. I sure do, that would be the Panasonic FZ2500!  If you are looking for a prosumer camcorder that weighs heavy on the video part and does a very good side job for stills, look no further.  The Panasonic is my pick!<br/><br/>There is a story of Jim Bridger the mountain man sitting around the campfire with other trappers telling this story about wolves that were closing in on him as he ran faster and faster. The wolves gained on him every time his feet hit the ground.  What was worse, he said, "there were no trees anywhere," and he was fast running out of wind.<br/><br/>He paused, leaving his spell bound listeners in limbo.<br/><br/>He waited a few more seconds until one of the tenderfoot trappers could not take the silence anymore and bit. He said, "My good man, what did you do?  What on earth did you do"?<br/><br/>Jim paused a little longer to gain a little more effect.<br/><br/>Then he said,<br/><br/>"I clumb a tree."<br/><br/>The tenderfoot trapper looked at him in disbelief and said, "Climbed a tree?  You just got through saying that there wasn't any trees. Anywhere."<br/><br/>Jim, again paused, took a long draw off his pipe and said,<br/><br/> "There had to be a tree!"<br/><br/>Of course the men around the campfire, howled and burst out laughing.  Jim was known for his yard long tales.  This story was told by mother's side (Wilson side) of my family.<br/><br/>Jim Bridger was a big imagination mountain man. He told that there was one place out in the West that he came across and he hollered an echo that, later, came back to him six hours later. Six hours before it was time to get up in the morning he would holler,"Time to get up" then six hours later his echoed voice would say, "Time to get up," and this was the way he got up in the morning while he was there. (Wikipedia)<br/><br/>(Think of the speed of sound at 700 miles an hour, and then ask yourself if Jim even had a watch at the time?)  Through his wanderings it was later found that he was one of the first white men, if not the first white man, to discover Old Faithful and the, steaming, boiling, unworldly climate of Yellowstone National Park that he often described, but because of his windy tales He never was taken seriously. Years later others followed in his footsteps and described, exactly, what Bridger saw.<br/><br/>The wolf tale is, probably, the closest that Bridger ever came to talking religion.  He just didn't know it!<br/><br/>I think this could be this same scenario with the soft lens stories on the FZ 2500.  Consumer reviewers wrote in about a possible soft lens that grew into a big story the more it was told.  A little lightening in a little cloud turned into a tornado with fire and brimstone.<br/><br/>Judge Judy (on the Judge Judy court TV show) said about some of the false statements made by some of her defendants that it was a "whole lot of who shot John."<br/><br/>She said, "Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining!"<br/><br/>You say, "<br/><br/>"Where there is smoke there is fire."<br/><br/> I say, "Maybe,<br/><br/>but I have the Panasonic FZ200, the FZ1000, and had the FZ2500 for two weeks. All 3 lenses were clear as bells, not as good as Zeiss lenses on the RX10IV Sony, but very good clear lens.  All three Panasonic cameras were made in the same factory as far as I can tell.<br/><br/>That's 3 to 0 for me!<br/><br/>I saw no softness in the lens on the Panasonic FZ 2500, but I will admit that I hesitated a bit before I wrote it down and reviewed the camera once again, before writing this down.<br/><br/>All right, which one did I send back...  I sent the Panasonic back.  But why?  Because the RX10IV was the best well rounded camera that I have ever picked up.  And Yes, the Zeiss lens was great. It was the clear Zeiss lens, the long 600mm opitcal zoom, 2400mm digital zoom, and the fast speed of the processor that made me take the RX10IV!  The 2400mm digital zoom is not that bad in bright light!.<br/><br/>The digital zoom from 600mm to 1200mm Sony calls Clear Digital Zoom, and Sony says it is hard to tell the difference between it and an optical zoom.  I was hard pressed to tell any pixel smearing under 900mm and more, but from 900mm to 1200 you will just have to try one out and see for yourself.  I do not want to appear as an idiot and undermine my entire review.  I just do not want to appear as gushing!  I was amazed to say the least!<br/><br/>There are 10 or 12 Canon 1200mm lenses out in the market place that Canon made many years ago. Every once in a while you will see them on e-bay for sale at 50 or 60 thousand dollars.  They are a non-zoom lens, and they are about a yard long and the picture I saw looked as if you could make a good dinosaur club out of one of them. I can not imagine the weight of one of those monsters.  I think National Geographic has a couple of them.  I would love to see compared pictures shot through one of these Canon 1200mm lenses against a RX10IV zoomed out to 1200mm, and while we are comparing them, yes, let us go all the way, get stupid, and put the 1200mm Canon lens on a 2017 full sensor Canon camera to make it really interesting.  I am not going to make anymore stupid comments so I will leave it at that.<br/><br/>However, pull out your wallet and shake out those musty, rusty, and crusty, hundred dollar bills that you have been saving back for a rainy day and that have mildew on them and kiss them good-bye because you're going to need them and then some, to buy this sweet little RX10IV Sony camera; around seventeen hundred smackers and before you know it, within a blink of a cow's eye, memory cards, batteries, and such will add up to 2,000 dollars or more real quick!  Is it worth it?<br/><br/>Yes it is, for the best all around camera in the world.<br/><br/>Did you notice, I accidentally left out the word "bridge?<br/><br/>I already have the Panasonic FZ 1000 that does the 4-k with the mega-pixel stills.  Now,  would I have chosen the Sony if I did not have the FZ 1000?  I probably would have, but I am not that sure.<br/><br/>If someone is looking for a good long zoom 20X camera leaning heavily on the video side, and wants to spend $700 less than the Sony Mark Four,  I would say, "Take the FZ2500, and your saved 700 dollars, and run.<br/><br/>*Note: Camera Decision Review gave the Panasonic FZ 2500 three more points than the Sony RX10IV making it their NO. 1 fixed lens, large sensor, super zoom, point and shoot camera!  DP Review gave the RX10IV its Gold Award and gave the Panasonic FZ 2500 its Silver Award; in their reviews of the fixed lens,large sensor super zoom camera picks. The Sony beat it by only three points!<br/><br/>* 1-28-2018 The Panasonic FZ1000 is suppose to have the same lens glass and the 1" sensor as the FZ2500.  I just got through taking a picture of a license plate No. at  150 yards away with my FZ1000, then I took the same picture with my RX10IV, the Sony had the much clearer picture by far.  I did not notice this until now.  I guess I will have to start eating crow about now.  However, the FZ1000 has only 16x compared to the 25x Sony.<br/><br/>Happy shooting, Rick</span>

<span>The Panasonic LUMIX FZ2500/2000 (in Europe) is a capable point and shoot bridge camera that has a 1-inch sensor and neutral density filters  that make it a worthwhile alternative for video, as well. The camera can compete against its more expensive Sony RX10 counterpart, as both bridge cameras can rival more expensive, professional camcorder market, as many professional camcorders you’d be hard pressed to find many with the image quality as good as the lens on both these cameras. While the Sony RX10 IV may have the advantage in terms of sharper lens of f/2.4 vs f/2.8, the Panasonic is the only bridge camera of this quality where you can shoot 4K video with a time limit as most including the Sony RX10 are all limited usually by a 30min limit, as the FZ2500 can shoot 4K video for as long as you have SD card and/or battery capability, nonethelesss.<br/><br/>The FZ2500 is an excellent video camera and offers a 20x powered zoom capability on a camera with a slightly smaller sensor to its Panasonic cousins the Panasonic LUMIX GH4/GH5/GH5S, which has a micro 4/3 size sensor that is just one size up from the 1-inch sensor. This camera can compete against those interchangeable lens cameras in terms of 4K video, as the FZ2500 can shoot cinema scale 4K video, at resolution of 4096x2160p and this is am advantage to the Sony RX10, which shoots video at UHD 3840x2160p.</span>

<span>The FZ2500 is an upgrade to the FZ1000. The image quality is the same as the FZ1000 due to its sensor being the same size. A lot of people buy the FZ2500 for video use because of its built-in ND filters. I own the FZ1000 (which I’ve used for years) and I’ve compared it with the FZ2500 carefully, and if you already own an FZ1000 there really aren’t too many reasons to upgrade to the FZ2500 unless your interest is in making videos and movies. The FZ2500 costs a lot more than the FZ1000, so keep that in mind. But it’s a great camera.<br/><br/>Neither the FZ1000 nor the FZ2500 will give you the image quality you’d get from a DSLR, but if used skillfully, you can get excellent results from both cameras. If you can afford the FZ2500, get it, but if you can’t, get the FZ1000. The latter has excellent photo and video quality (4K just like the FZ2500), and costs a lot less. Both cameras are beautiful and a pleasure to use.<br/><br/>The FZ2500’s memory card slot is on the side of the camera like most DSLRs; the FZ1000’s memory card slot is within the battery housing on the bottom of the camera which can be pose an issue if you need to switch out your memory card while the camera is mounted on certain tripods. The FZ2500 also has a little more focal length than its predecessor, but not by that much. It also has a touch screen, headphone port, and focus bracketing which the FZ1000 does not have. The FZ2500 also has a higher max video resolution.<br/><br/>The FZ2500 is also sometimes called the FZ2000 depending on region.<br/><br/>I’ve posted a few pictures I’ve taken with the FZ2500.</span>

<span>I like that this camera can use the DMW-DCC8 DC Coupler with a USB connection.<br/>That allows me to plug into a power bank and not worry about changing batteries all the time.<br/><br/>It has side access to the SD card which can be hot swapped without disturbing the camera position on the tripod. Take more videos while checking the first card.<br/>It has a nice camera app which connects through WiFi to my tablet.<br/>It has a external mic jack.

<span> I'm a former commercial photographer that used 11x14 film cameras and Hassleblad medium format. This looked like it might be fun because of the 60x zoom. I was expecting average quality. I was amazed after a perfect photo of the moon so crisp in detail you might think NASA took it. Today I got to try out the video on two geese that were visiting. I've not yet mastered following a bird but the quality of both the video and audio is superb. This is the best $300 I've spent in a long time.</span>

PANASONIC LUMIX digital cameras are full of innovation for both traditional and modern camera enthusiasts. The LUMIX ZS100 brings together the visual performance of a large 1" sensor and the legendary optical performance of a bright LEICA DC Lens in a highly compact point-and-shoot camera. Traditionalists will love the hands-on manual feel of a lens-mounted control ring and thumbwheel, plus the familiarity of an eye-level electronic viewfinder. The modern enthusiast will love the Wi-Fi mobile device controllability and next-generation flexibility that 4K video and 4K PHOTO modes bring to the creative experience.

<span>My first ZS100 camera arrived DOA.  It seemed to work until the first time I tried to zoom out.  Then, part way out the lens ground (literally) to a halt and I got the dreaded "System Error: Zoom" message on the screen.  I tried turning it off but the lens was jammed.  I applied a little pressure and tried turning it on and off a few times and finally got the lens to retract normally.  I powered it on and it seemed normal until I tried to zoom and then the same thing happened again.  I went online and tried the few things recommend by Panasonic.  No help. I did a chat with a Panasonic rep online and he said the camera needs to be returned.  I was NOT a happy camper.  I had been very excited to get this new camera and it was defective!  Worse, I found I was not alone in this, there were a significant number of others that had the same issue, though some did not have it occur right out of the box.  I called Amazon support and they were GREAT.  I had a replacement camera in my hands the next day!!!!<br/><br/>The replacement has worked fine for the past couple of months, but I still have the thought in the back of my head each time I turn it one, "is it going to fail this time".  That is NOT what you want to have in you head when using a fairly expensive camera.  Note that I did not deduct any points for this issue since it was rectified immediately and the replacement camera works fine.  But it is disappointing to read online about all the others that have this issue and yet Panasonic has not seemed to address the problem other than offering to repair it (which requires paying to send it to them and waiting several months for it to be fixed - and possibly being denied a warranty fix because they claim you must have damaged the camera).  This did not happen to me, but others reported this added abuse after their camera broke.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the replacement camera.  I have been very pleased with almost all of the features and operation of the camera.  Yes, there are way too many items in the menu making for a high learning curve.  But I don't have to use all those features and settings.  If I just ignore those I do not understand or that do not interest me, I am able to have a lot of control over the features of the camera that I care about.  The negatives I found are 1) the camera does not focus well in low light.  I have had a number of blurry pictures that should have been clear.  I am talking about light like normal indoor room light not darkness.  2) The facial recognition (the camera can memorize up to 6 people's faces and will identify them on screen when it sees them) is inaccurate.  It usually knows it is seeing one of the people in the list but id's the person as someone else in that list.  3) There are some "gotchyas" - for example, the touted 5-axis stabilization does not work during 4K video recording.  Why not?  4) If you want to let the camera process the pictures into a JPG format (rather than using the much larger RAW format files that need post processing by you) the results are not always good.  Some JPG format photos look great, others have too much contrast or details have been lost in bright or dark areas (low dynamic range).  The RAW (unprocessed) photos do not usually have these shortcomings.  I have started to save BOTH the JPG and RAW format files for each picture (which the camera will do) and use the JPG picture where it looks good, or use the RAW picture if the JPG has issues that can be fixed by using the RAW format file.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have said the camera is slippery.  I do not find it slippery as much as "not tacky" to the touch.  But given the choice of using only the words "solid, firm feel" or "slippery" I would have to choose the latter.  You can use some rubberized tape or buy one of the add on grips by Flipbac ($9.95 on Amazon) to address the issue.<br/><br/>While the camera DOES fit in my shirt pocket (but would not be a good fit in a normal pants pocket) it is slightly too heavy and pulls down that side of the shirt.  So, yes I do keep it in a shirt pocket most of the time, but if you care about how your shirt looks, which I don't, you may decide to use a neck strap (which I think would actually look worse - but would be more convenient).<br/><br/>I have read and watched a LOT of reviews of this camera both before and after I purchased it.  The reviews are about 95% positive.  It feels good to read reviews by experts (or at least authorities) on cameras and hear them say nice things about the product I just spent a lot of money to purchase (though I did catch the camera on sale for under $500). Thinking about all the pros and cons of the camera that reviewers have mentioned AND that I have experienced, I am happy with my decision and would definitely recommend this camera to someone who wanted a compact, easy to carry and use camera with great features.  My biggest issue is that zoom failure problem which might reappear at the worst possible time.  But I am thinking positive and hoping that this camera is not going to have that issue.</span>

<span>I wanted this camera badly, so I bought it a day or two after it became available. It was through Amazon, but the order was fulfilled by Focus Camera. The ZS100 arrived in a few days (seemed a little slow on the shipping) and immediately there were problems out of the box. I got lots of error messages just trying to do the initial setup. I did get it set up and took a couple of photos, but was getting error messages and freeze ups every minute or so. So the same day I received it, I shipped it back to Focus Camera for a refund. Once the camera arrived at Focus, the refund was slow in coming and I was not reimbursed for the return shipping. I eventually got the refund and Amazon reimbursed for the shipping after I complained.<br/><br/>The camera was in short supply and I wanted it badly for an upcoming assignment (a paying photography gig), so I ordered a replacement from Adorama. That one came promptly with a carton full of accessories -- and the camera worked perfectly out of the box. On to the review of the Panasonic ZS100:<br/><br/>I like it... I really like it. I have had several Panasonic ZS series cameras starting with the ZS7, but the last one I got (the ZS50) was not nearly as good as I expected. It's photos were just fair at best, although video was pretty good. I loved the size and the long zoom (30x) but the lens added distortion and artifacts, especially when zoomed all the way in. I knew what I needed: I wanted to trade some zoom length for a bigger sensor. That's exactly what the ZS100 is, and it works much as I expected.<br/><br/>The Panasonic ZS100 has a "1-inch" sensor, which works out to a diagonal of about 16mm. That doesn't sound that big, but it has something like four times the area of the sensor in the ZS50 (which is a 1/2.3 inch sensor). More area means bigger pixels that have better light gathering ability, which means lower noise and higher resolution from less optical interference. This sounds complex, but I can tell you that it works -- the ZS100 takes much better photos and much better video than the ZS50. Of course, it costs quite a bit more.<br/><br/>What I like about photos from the ZS100:<br/><br/>-Excellent clarity and color<br/>-Much better in low light than a small-sensor camera. The ZS100 really is usable to ISO1600.<br/>-The flash on the ZS100 is excellent. It's a pop-up flash that lines up with the lens almost exactly, eliminating ugly flash shadows.<br/>-Even though the lens is f5.9 when zoomed all the way in, I still get excellent bokah. Check one of my images below.<br/>-At 20 megapixels, there is plenty of resolution for my applications, which includes magazine publishing.<br/><br/>What I don't like about photos from the ZS100:<br/><br/>-The lens is not as good as the removable Panasonic lenses I have for my GX8 Micro-FourThirds camera. Lens quality seems to be the limiting factor on the ZS100<br/>-The auto focus doesn't always find the right focus, even when the subjects are in the clear and seemingly obvious.<br/><br/>I want to re-iterate what I said about the flash on the ZS100: This is the best flash I have seen on a pocketable camera, and I have owned about 10 such cameras over the years. It reaches out 15 feet or so with good illumination and the results look natural. Because it's a pop-up flash, it is virtually impossible to accidentally cover it with a finger. (It was much too easy to accidentally cover the flash on the ZS50.)<br/><br/>I complained about the autofocus on the ZS100 and you might think that I could just use manual focus. I do use manual focus and it is easy to use, but it's just not as fast as touching the shutter button to get a focus. I love that the ZS100 has a convenient manual focus, which I find especially useful for video shooting -- more about that in a moment.<br/><br/>As for my photography assignment, I completed it with the ZS100 with good results. A couple of these photos are shown below.<br/><br/>Now onto the ZS100's video capabilities. I actually shoot video more than I do photos, so I was really excited to get the ZS100 for its 4K video capability.<br/><br/>Here's what I like about the Panasonic ZS100's video:<br/><br/>-4K video quality is excellent, and HD (1080p) is even better.<br/>-The format the ZS100 uses for 4K video (100 Mbps MP4) plays back on all my computers with minimal complaint. I can even take the raw video files and play them on my Hisense 4K TV. That has a REAL "wow" factor!<br/>-When shooting 4K video, the lens works out to be 37mm to 370mm, and I like the 370mm telephoto. Having 37mm at the wide end is not so good.<br/>-Although no one has mentioned it that I've seen, the ZS100 will record 1080p at 120 fps for nice slow motion. Yes, it will do 120 fps at 1080p -- very nice. When shooting at 1080p, either slow-motion or normal speed, the zoom range is 31mm to 310mm.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't like about the ZS100's video:<br/><br/>-Again, the lens is not as good as the MUCH more expensive lenses I have for the Panasonic GX8. As with photos, the lens quality limits the ultimate quality of the images. They just don't look quite as pristine as the photos and videos I get from the GX8, although the ZS100 does fine with both. (The cheapest lens I have for the GX8 costs as much as the ZS100 camera, so this is not a surprise.)<br/>-There's no jack for external audio.<br/>-Having the widest shot be 37mm (31mm at 1080p).<br/><br/>For a pocketable camera, the ZS100 does a great job with photos and video, although a tick below the similarly priced Panasonic LX100. On the other hand, the LX100 has just a 3x lens, although higher quality... decisions, decisions.<br/><br/>Ergonomics and handling:<br/><br/>The ZS100 is chunkier and noticeably heavier than the ZS50. The ZS100 will easily fit in a jacket pocket and will even go in a roomy pants pocket, but you'll notice it. I carried it for four days at a big convention, where I took dozens of photos for publication. It was in the pocket of my sport coat and was not a problem there at all.<br/><br/>The 3-inch touch screen display on the ZS100 is excellent, and I quickly adapted to the touch screen after not having one on the ZS50. The ZS100 also has a small but useful eyepiece (electronic) viewfinder that is wonderful when shooting outdoors or when I need the added stability of holding the camera to my face. The eyepiece viewfinder has just enough pixels to be useful -- as far as I can tell, the ZS100's eyepiece viewfinder is identical to the viewfinder on the ZS50.<br/><br/>The other buttons and controls on the ZS100 are in logical locations, although there is a knob on top of the camera that I don't really see the need for. I can probably assign it to do something I regularly use, such as exposure, but I haven't yet done that. It's just there and does nothing at the moment.<br/><br/>Overall, I like the size, photo quality and video quality of the ZS100 quite a bit. I wish the auto focus was better, but I very much enjoy the lower noise and higher sensitivity of the ZS100, as compared to the ZS50. It does exactly what I expected the larger sensor to do. And the flash -- I'm very happy with the flash on the ZS100, despite the fact that it shoots only straight forward and can't be pointed anywhere else.<br/><br/>Below are a couple photos from the ZS100. Amazon won't let me post a link to a video, but if you go to YouTube and search on my name (Bob Kovacs) and ZS100, you will find multiple videos that I've shot with the ZS100. I also have a l-o-n-g video review of the ZS100, and a comparison video: ZS100 vs. the Panasonic LX100. One nice recent video I shot with the ZS100 is on Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day 2016. Go to YouTube and search on "arlington cemetery memorial day 2016 zs100" and you'll find it.<br/><br/>I recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100, and appreciate Amazon's customer service for making right the initial problem I had.</span>

The size, weight, picture quality and particularly the zoomed picture quality make the purchase price more than worth it for me. I remove the top portion of the camera case (not included, see below) when I go hiking, throw the cover strap over my shoulder and I'm finding it fairly quick to grab, turn on and shoot without having to remove the shoulder strap. After some practice, I find I am also able to do that one handed which is a plus, as I often have both my trekking poles in my other hand.<br/><br/>All that is to say I think I'll have a fair chance to get some opportunistic/fleeting shots of wildlife using this setup if and when they present themselves.<br/><br/>The camera does have a multitude of features and settings that I really haven't played with in the week or so since I got it, but it is quite a sophisticated piece of compact engineering.<br/>It's fairly deep into "real camera" territory for those who want to manage their own depth of field/shutter speed etc, so don't mistake it for the severely limited point and shoots of yesteryear.<br/><br/>One note about time lapse that I couldn't find in the user manual:<br/><br/>If you use a shot interval &gt; 30 seconds for time lapse photography, the camera will retract the lens barrel every shot, darken the display, then extend the lens barrel and turn on the display for the next shot.<br/>I had to try different shot intervals to determine where the barrel stays put for the duration (&lt;= 30 seconds) but when I originally set it to 150 shots at 1 minute intervals I observed the barrel extending and retracting each shot (150 times per time lapse series).<br/>I for one don't want to put that much wear and tear on the lens barrel stepper motor and parts, so I'll only use 30 seconds or less for a time lapse interval, but it seemed like something Panasonic should have spelled out in their manual (searched and couldn't find anything about that operation).<br/>Of note is I did have the lens set partially zoomed (~110mm) when I observed this, but I really don't believe that was a factor.<br/><br/>Also bought and reccommend<br/><br/>Mini Tripod for Camera,Zomei Travel Table Tripod with 3-Way Pan/Tilt Head 1/4 inches Quick Release Plate and Bag for DSLR Camera<br/>(THIS TRIPOD IS ONLY 20.5" FULLY EXTENDED)<br/><br/>SanDisk 128GB Extreme PRO SDXC UHS-I Card - C10, U3, V30, 4K UHD, SD Card<br/><br/>MegaGear Ever Ready Genuine Leather Camera Case Compatible with Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100, DC-ZS200<br/>(IF YOU LIKE LEATHER, RETRO STYLE COVERS)<br/><br/>For me, the only downside (more aptly the cheap side) I will mention that the battery cover latch and the charging/hdmi port cover feel a bit flimsy to me, but I couldn't possibly justify dropping my review score by a star due to to those two largely aesthetic details.</span>
