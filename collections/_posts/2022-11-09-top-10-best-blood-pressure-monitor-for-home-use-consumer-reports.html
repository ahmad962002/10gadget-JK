<span>I have an older wrist-based Omron purchased about 10 years ago and I've been happy with it. I verified accuracy with my doctor's at the time who was suspicious of wrist-based monitors. When she saw with her own eyes the readings were near exactly the same as her readings, she was satisfied. I decided to stick with Omron but I wanted a device where I could export the readings to a spreadsheet which is the main reason I chose this particular model. The package arrived and I had it unboxed and taking readings and emailing me an excel report in mere minutes. I took two readings and then exported to Excel and it emails you the spreadsheet. It arrived right away. From unboxing to getting a spreadsheet report took at most five minutes. I then compared the readings with my wrist-based Omron and they were near-identical.<br/><br/>If you want a device that can keep your BP history and create an Excel report quickly and easily, this is your model.</span>

<span>I bought this because it's the one my doctor uses in her office. It's quick, very easy to use one-handed, very accurate, and doesn't try to squeeze my arm off like other brands. Fits in its little case (don't laugh--they don't all go back in once they've been unpacked) so it's perfect to take with me when I need to. Great little machine.</span>

<span>Moved to the OMRON arm cuff from the OMRON wrist cuff at the request of my GP. I chose this device because it had what I needed without going overboard. The set up and pairing with the app are easy, but I do recommend reading the directions. I have large arms and measured them prior to ordering this device and was surprised to find I was in range. Cuff did indeed fit well and there were no issues applying it or aligning it for a proper reading. The display is large, dark and easy to read. The monitor quickly synced with my phone app. My reading were consistent with those I had with the wrist cuff. I’ll update my review should anything change but I’m pleased so far. The included bag is a nice bonus. I recommend this device.</span>

<span>I bought this for home to monitor my blood pressure daily since I was recently diagnosed with hypertension and wanted to monitor while beginning new medications to stabilize it. This is a trusted brand, no doubt about it. They are pretty accurate as well. Mine always matches a manual reading pretty closely. Its also easy to use and I love how I can pair it with the app through Bluetooth to log all my readings automatically. This way it’s convenient to share with my doctor at an appt or even just for my own reference. The only flaw is that this bp cuff has a sensor on it for sleeves so if it senses you have a sleeve on and not on your bare arm, it will cause an error. But it tends to give you that error even if you don’t have a shirt on! That’s the only thing that has bothered me about this product. It doesn’t do it all the time but enough times to irritate me occasionally. Even if I try to adjust it or switch arms. Eventually I give up and try later and then it works. Not sure what’s causing it to give me that “shirt sleeve” error code. Other than that, it’s really great so I deal with it!</span>

<span>Omron's blood pressure monitor is accurate,  easy to use,  and versatile.  (1) Accuracy:  I compared Omron to my usual blood pressure cuff and stethoscope method,  and the readings were virtually the same.  (2)  The semi-rigid cuff slides easily onto my arm,  and is easily fastened with one hand,  unlike the endless futzing-about needed with a regular floppy cuff.  This makes it MUCH easier for a person to take their own blood pressure without any assistance.  Also,  to take a blood pressure reading,  just push a button,  and the machine does the rest.  This improves the accuracy of the BP measurement because you can be truly at rest,  rather than fidgeting with gauges,  and pumping on bulbs.  (3)  It is versatile because you can use the recommended AC power adapter (sold separately) to save on buying batteries,  or if you use the Omron in a "remote" location without AC,  it runs on batteries just fine.  I did not use the data storage,  or synching features,  so no comment on those.  For an individual monitoring their own blood pressure,  the Omron is an ideal machine.</span>

<span>When my husband started having high blood pressure, I purchased this so we could keep track of it until we could see a doctor. When we did finally get to see a doctor, we took ours in and compared it to what they got for their reading, and they were pretty close. Close enough that I feel comfortable with it as a screening tool at home. We continue to keep track of his blood pressure to make sure that the medications are at the right dose, and now that he's losing weight and changing his diet, we will be watching even closer to make sure that it doesn't go too low. We previously had a wrist monitor that I bought more or less for fun, but it was difficult to use and not very accurate . This one is easy to use, easy to read, and I would definitely buy it again.</span>

No matter how good it is, someone is going to say their readings are all over the place.<br/><br/>I’ve been doing this for awhile now and, by the time conditions are perfect to have your blood pressure taken and you’ve done everything right (sit straight up, both feet flat on the floor, quiet as mouse… oh, you had some caffeine? You’ll have to wait a bit. Oh, you were just walking? You’ll have to give it ten minutes, STOP TALKING!!, etc.) you’ll quickly realize your own medical staff has never done any of this stuff prior to taking your blood pressure.<br/><br/>Having the upper arm cuff does make me believe this is more accurate than wrist cuffs, but I’m probably full of it. All I know is that this monitor is pretty consistent with its readings and, that’s the best I can do. It’s incredibly easy to read, and very easy to operate, but putting these arm cuffs on yourself takes some getting used to.<br/><br/>You can record your readings to an app, but instead of doing so automatically, you need to press the appropriate buttons to upload them. It’s always nice to have something to keep track of your readings for you, but be aware your readings aren’t private; choosing to use this feature means your data is being shared.</span>

<span>Everything everyone else has mentioned so far is true, it is a really easy to use little monitor and uploading the readings or having them sent to you in an email are great features as well.<br/>The only caveat I’ve noticed is that you need to take a few readings before they stabilize and stop shifting around. My blood pressure is around 120/80 but it always starts me off at around 140/90, second reading will be 135/85, third at 130/83 etc till it roughly settles a couple of points above or below your reading. Make sure you spend a few mins taking readings instead of trusting the first couple of readings you see</span>

<span>I gave my purchase 4 stars only because of the shipping.  It came in the light omicron box like you would purchase it in a store.  No protection from being thrown around, like putting it in a cardboard box of sorts, not even bubble wrap at the least.  So one side was caved in and I was relieved that no visible damage.

<span>My local pharmacist at the grocery store recommended this brand of bp monitor. I am so glad she did because I had no idea about what brand could be good. I did a water fast for 2 weeks (lost 26 lbs in that time!) and when I went to a health institute for an unrelated medical study, I discovered my bp was exceptionally low, too low in fact. That has never happened to me before and I have been on bp medication for the last 3 years to manage hypertension. After some online research, I learned that the water fasting caused my bp to get too low because my sodium intake was not in balance with my water intake. So once I learned that during the last week of my fast, I started to put a tiny dab of liquid amino acids (said to be a healthier alternative to soy sauce) on my tongue each day and it brought my bp back to normal. If I didn't get this bp monitor, I wouldn't have been able to track my bp like I have been doing. I like the way this monitor keeps a log of your readings, I think it was for 2 weeks. I want off my bp meds with my doctor's help, so tracking with this monitor at home will be instrumental in me learning the extent to which my bp is regulating over time. I am living a healthier lifestyle now so once I get under 200 lbs, I'm going to tell my dr. I want to kick the meds to the curb, yes!</span>

<span>This blood pressure is consistent with another monitor and with its own readings.  I bought it for the promise of being able to download blood pressure readings with the companion app, so that they can be transmitted and viewed by the doctor.  It can monitor and store data from 2 different people.<br/><br/>I am able to overcome the limitations of product design and website implementation with a lot of careful attention.  Today's experience was particularly harrowing.<br/><br/>1 The Greater Goods account declared my passwords invalid, and each of these had to be reset, each user account must have a unique email address.  The password reset page does not indicate the account for which the password is being reset.  This is confusing for those who are resetting 2 passwords.  It is also confusing that the App is called "Balance" but the the passwords are stored in the password manager under the name "Greater Goods."<br/><br/>2 The Balance App also lost track of the the blue tooth link that allows synchronizations with the blood pressure monitor and the App.  This link had to be re-established, once for each user.<br/><br/>3 Today, the blood pressure monitor did not record my wife's blood pressure reading on the first attempt. It simply was not stored.  That was the first time this happened in 6 months of use.  We repeated the test, and the reading was stored, and uploaded to the App.<br/><br/>4 There is no help menu in the app. Instead there is a link that leads to the web site help page.  The link leads to instructions that seem to fit this device.  It turns out the these were instructions for a different device.  After 15 minutes or frustration, I realize the link was to the wrong instructions, and began searching the web site, and found the instructions for this device.  Perhaps this was a side effect of the Web site dropping the previously synchronization between device and app.<br/><br/>5 The app only orients in portrait mode, assuming I suppose, you are using a handheld phone.  Landscape mode is required to use the keyboard on my iPad, so I look the app turned 90 degrees from the correct orientation, or hold the key board on the side.<br/><br/>6 I had to relearn that the squiggly right arrow and the bottom right of the "history" page is the icon that must be pushed in order to send data from the App to the user's email address.  This is only documented in a YouTube video.  There is no way to tell how to do this in the app or the other web based documentation.  A link to the video is on the web site<br/><br/>7 The Greater Goods web site cannot be used to read data or initiate an email download. These are available only on the App.  The Greater Goods website only has documentation.<br/><br/>8 The emailed data are sent via email as a comma delimited file (CSV extensions).  Clinicians may not like this format.  Even when I substituted spaces for the commas, I found that our cardiologist did not at first understand the readings.  I imported the data into to Excel and transformed it so that systolic and diastolic readings were separated by the "/" character, and the pulse followed by the characters "BPM,"  and the clinician immediately understood what they were seeing.  This ought to be the default output.<br/> Transforming the data in the way that I did may beyond the computer skills of some users.<br/><br/>These problems are not insurmountable, but they sure are annoying.  I am very interested in learning if there is another blood pressure monitor that allows data to be exported, that uses good user design, especially for the app.</span>

<span>I have been using the Omron 10 BP785N https://www.amazon.com/Omron-Upper-Pressure-Monitor-Standard/dp/B00KPQB2SS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=omron+10&amp;qid=1560386740&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1 daily for a while now. I have been overall satisfied with it, although I don't like writing down the results twice daily and keying it into my phone app.<br/><br/>I was thinking about getting the wireless version Omron 10 BP786N, but there are a lot of complaints that the Bluetooth will not connect. Omron specifically listed my phone, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Android version 8, as not being compatible. (Only Android ver. 6 and 7, although I'm sure it would probably work with ver. 8.)<br/><br/>Rather than take the chance of it not being returnable, and since I saw this unit on sale at Amazon, and since this unit has many positive reviews about Bluetooth successfully connecting with phones, I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>Not really thinking about the cuff, I am surprised at how difficult it is to tighten it with one hand. Using the right hand to tighten the left arm is doable. But it is VERY difficult to tighten the right arm with the left hand.<br/><br/>The Omron 10 unit comes with a "Easy-Wrap ComFit Cuff" CFX-WR17 (which can be purchased fairly inexpensively) which is a "Pre-formed expandable firm arm cuff ". This cuff makes it extremely easy to connect to your arm. I decided to try it out on this machine. The Omron cuff fits perfectly into the Balance BP Monitor. I tested out both units with both cuffs, and the readings appear to be reasonably the same. I actually have 3 of these Omron cuffs (since one wore out) and I plan on comparing both machines for a while until I'm satisfied. https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00P6SATT8 If you are going to do this twice daily, you might as well be comfortable doing it IMHO.<br/><br/>So, the setup with Bluetooth was extremely user friendly. You just open the app on your phone and follow the instructions. You hold the arrow up on the device until the pairing message comes up, and the app on your phone connects to it on its own.  I always have Bluetooth active on my phone, so the app found the BP monitor within seconds.<br/><br/>The app itself is rather limited, but it works. I found that it is best to have the app open when taking a reading. It will update automatically that way. OTOH, if you choose to take readings with the app shutdown, it will sync up the next time you open it. (Although, this seems to take longer than one would expect.) I had tested the app before I got the device, so I sent myself a history list via email, and it works fine. The only modification you can make to the app is to add a note. Of course you can always edit the CSV file.<br/><br/>I am used to using a very detailed (paid version) app called "Blood Pressure Log - MyDiary" https://www.amazon.com/Zlamaniec-Blood-Pressure-Log-MyDiary/dp/B0178M2LDG - I may find it tough to break away from that, since it gives all kinds of averages for my Doctor. But, I ALSO like not having to key everything in, so we will see.<br/><br/>The readings seem to be pretty much equivalent to my Omron 10. Seeing as I am reviewing this product just hours after receiving it, I can't say for sure how accurate it is. I can say it is not very far off. I can say that the Omron 10 is much more consistent than a couple of the wrist monitors I've tried.  So, I am hoping that this unit will have the same consistency.<br/><br/>Overall, so far, I am very satisfied.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>UPDATE 7/17/2019<br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>So, about the cuff. I have been using the cuff that came with the device. Instead of trying to wrap the cuff around my arm for each use, I am leaving it velcroed at all times. Then I slide the cuff on and off. Not only does this make it easier to put on, but it also saves the Velcro from weakening.<br/><br/>Further, I can safely say that this machine is pretty consistent. I have been using it side by side with the Omron 10 arm model. Last week's average for the Omron was 115/69 while the Greatergoods average was 120/68. So, I can certainly live with a few points here or there.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth seems to work very well. For the best results, I recommend opening up the app on your phone before you start reading your blood pressure. I always test the left and the right arm, and this machine usually reads both readings to the phone (via Bluetooth) very consistently.<br/><br/>For the price,. this is a very good unit.</span>

<span>Ordered new BP cuff and now I’m loving it. So easy to use and not bulky for traveling with me in a suitcase. Had an issue with too large a cuff size but company quickly rectified that with no cost. They were great and device works well with daily usage.</span>

<span>This machine is easy to use and read. The cuff is comfortable. I compared it with my existing machine and this one gives me a lower top number and a higher bottom number. Sometimes it’s way off. I will take it to my next Dr. appt. to compare with her medical grade cuff she uses.</span>

<span>Seems accurate as best I can tell, as it and another one I bought earlier read similarly.  It's pretty easy to use; placement of the arm cuff is slightly cumbersome with apparent need to do and undo velcro and not definite information about wearing or placement.  The numbers are sometimes  initially hard to read, disappearing on the screen into other irrelenant numbers and necessitating simply looking at the device from slightly difefrent vantage point, maybe due to glare.  Quiet and quick. Comes with nice storage case.</span>

<span>This monitor works fine - but only after I contacted the manufacturer. The iPhone app to utilize with this device listed in the documentation would not connect via Bluetooth. That is required initially to get the unit started. After contacting the manufacturer, I was advised to download a different iHealth/iPhone app and that solved the startup and Bluetooth connection problem. The device is reasonably close to the readings my Dr. gets using their BP measuring device.</span>
