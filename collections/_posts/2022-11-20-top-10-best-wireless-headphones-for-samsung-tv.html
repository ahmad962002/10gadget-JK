<span>There are some very nice features to these buds, and I do intend to keep them. (Another reviewer was about to return them.) But there are some things that just aren't as good as I had hoped. I'll try to be as detailed as possible.<br/><br/>First, the out-of-box experience is kinda nice, but not fabuous. The smallish box presents the much smaller charger box that the buds live in, and a tiny box that contains a charger cable. Wait -- are there really no instructions? And I thought there were interchangable ear thingies to accommodate ears of different sizes. Ok, so the very brief instruction book clings to the top of the box because it's too big not to fall out on its own. And the ear thingies are hiding in the box where the charging cable is. I seem to be ok with the default ear thingies that are already installed on the buds. (Note, you have to use your own charger with the charging cable. You probably already have too many of those.)<br/><br/>You'll need to download and install the Galaxy Wearable app (on Android, a different one is available for iOS). The app helps you connect to the buds, pretty easy, and is reasonably fully functional. There are numerous options you can play with.<br/><br/>The fit -- quite comfortable actually. Looking at the peculiar shape, I wondered whether these would stay in my ears, and whether they would be uncomfortable. Yes, they stay put, even when walking around, and no, not uncomfortable. This was a pleasant surprise; Samsung really got this part right. I feel as though I could wear these at the office all day and not get ear fatigue. Much, much better than a clumsy pair of headphones slipping off my head when I'm walking around. When wearing the buds, you can hear outside sounds/conversations very well, and perhaps that's the whole idea of these buds. I like this.<br/><br/>There's an equalizer section on the app's main screen. The equalizer options are sort of ok, but not wonderful. I don't know why there's no option for a 10-band graphic equalizer. I just settled on the default after not liking the other choices any better.<br/><br/>You can turn on and off the ANC (active noise cancellation). I have a pair of conventional headphones (not Bose) with ANC that works really well. You feel like you're in a cocoon. These buds have ANC that you can barely tell is working. It sounds a little different, maybe even a little bit of an improvement, but it doesn't seem like it's getting rid of any particular noise. So the ANC is sort of a bust.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about sound quality. As I say, I really wanted to love these little guys. The sound quality is good but not great. Maybe I'm expecting too much. My pair of $250 conventional headphones sound spectacular, and I can listen to music for hours with them. These buds aren't that impressive. The sound quality is ok -- just ok. It's not "bad" in any way at all, but it's not great. I listened to an entire CD that I know well and like. The experience was pleasant, but at the end I really wanted to listen to it on the stereo instead. As I say, maybe I'm expecting too much. The sound quality is probably good enough to listen to at work all day. I had the volume up a little too high, and when my test CD was finished and I took the buds out of my ears, I felt that my ears were ringing a little bit. Next time I'll set the volume lower.<br/><br/>As an interesting aside, I'll compare the sound quality to another wearable that I just got, the Bose Frames (audio sunglasses, a weirdly interesting product). The sound from the Bose Frames is "smooth" in a very wonderful way -- much better than the buds. However, the Bose Frames have absolutely no lower end -- no bass sounds at all. The sounds they do have are great. By contrast, these buds are full range, with pretty good bass. But the sound just isn't smooth.<br/><br/>I didn't try to take a phone call., so I don't know how seamless this works. Considering it's Samsung, and I have a Galaxy S9, I bet this works well enough. I'm not very fussy about sound quality on calls -- I just need to be able to understand what's being said. So "good enough" for me is probably not hard to achieve.<br/><br/>There's a "button" on the buds that you press to skip a track, answer a call, etc. It's not a real button, it's just a touch-sensitive area on the outside of the bud. I haven't been able to get this touch point to work reliably. I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with the bud, probably just my fat fingers.<br/><br/>Bottom line? I think I'll have a use for these, most likely when I want to listen to my own music without disturbing others, and without the very wonderful but cumbersome conventional earphones. When I'm walking out and about, the smooth sound from the Bose Frames is better. So it's a toss-up with the Galaxy Buds Live. They're good enough, but unfortunately not better than that.</span>

<span>I am in love with the earbuds as far as color, shape, fit, sound, size, battery life, charging style, the app and several other things. HOWEVER, I believe the reviews/specs on Amazon showed multipoint capabilities and this is not true when using devices that are not Samsung. I really really do not want to return them but I think I have to because being able to seamlessly switch between devices is a must for me. I am so hurt. I don't understand why Samsung can't do multipoint with their earbuds when the most generic earbuds and earpieces have this capability.</span>

<span>This is my second pair, my first I purchased directly from Samsung and I noticed some slight differences. The biggest is the battery. For some odd reason the battery drains alot faster than my first pair, not sure why... but I find I have to charge it more. The second is the feel of the buds themselves. These are a bit lighter which is weird because they are light to begin with. The sound quality is about the same. They served their purpose as my back up set.</span>

<span>Once I determined that I did want wireless earbuds, I was torn on which to get, because earbuds have never stayed in my ears no matter what rubber inserts I put on them. I had a pair of Raycons that were pretty good at first but always wiggled out eventually. Well, the Galaxy Buds Live have fixed this problem for me! They sit inside of the folds of your ear and don't really go in, which means that they've never popped out when I've been using them. If you also have this problem, consider these earbuds. The sound is excellent -- though, because they don't form a seal on your ears, the noise cancellation isn't as intense as other brands. Keep that in mind if your preference is getting fully immersed. I enjoy still being able to hear what's going on around me, so it's not a problem for me. The Buds Live and their case have a nice build quality, and I really like the cute "coffee bean" appearance they have. Overall, I would definitely recommend them, and recommend them even more if you're like me and you have trouble with getting traditional earbuds to stay in.</span>

<span>I desired for a headphones that were RF, accepted optical input, and at a reasonable price. This one did fit the bill as hoped. Bass and mid-range are perfect, but treble is lacking. If you want perfect sound reproduction, spend some real money on a higher quality product. Oddly, the lowest volume level isn't as low as you might expect. I discovered that the battery life increased greatly after I fully discharged and then recharged the unit even after the charge light went out. Very impressive kit with all the included items.

<span>I bought these as a backup to Jelly Comb headsets I bought on here... Jelly Comb product is excellent but I somehow pushed the charging connector too hard into the opening and broke it.  Repair guy near me will fix it.  So I ordered these made by Sharper Image until I get Jelly Comb back.  Got it set up which was easy enough, but only one ear was getting sound.  Took it all out and started over and that one ear still wasn't working.  So I used the RCA cord from the Jelly Comb set for the heck of it and voila -- I got sound in both ears.  Even when I got it to work, the quality is definitely inferior to Jelly Comb.  I will keep these made by Sharper Image as my back up set.  Amazon no longer sells the Jelly Comb so if you're interested, you'll have to buy them directly from their web site.  Amazon -- can you get these back in stock?  I know a lot of people in their 60s, 70s, 80s who need headsets when watching tv so as not to disturb others.  Also the quality is so good and I've been raving about them... but none of my family or friends can get them on here anymore.  In fact the day I bought mine, I believe it said 'one set left.'  I lucked out.</span>

<span>See update below<br/><br/>I purchased these on Dec 17th and overall we're very pleased, they're for my wife. Her hearing is bad in one ear and very bad in the other, hearing aids give some comfort but they're not perfect. With these headphones she can set the volume to a level not available on her other hearing aids (headsets, buds etc.).<br/><br/>Closed captioning on television is nice to have but it's not always as smooth as we'd like and the placement on the screen can be annoying. She has tried a variety of headsets and ear buds over the years but none of them were 'very' good. This headphone set we heard about from a friend represents the proverbial 'godsend'.<br/><br/>The volume level on these headphones is pretty amazing, I didn't realize how loud they could be set until I put them on one day to test them and almost "blew one ear off" :-) had to quickly rip them off my head. So, be warned, these are not the typical headphone and caution should be exercised where they're kept if small children are around. It would also be nice if each ear could be adjusted separately, if you have one good ear and one bad ear you're going to be limited how high you make the volume for the bad ear.<br/><br/>The first thing she noticed other than being able to hear clearly again was she could walk around the house (2400 sq ft) and still listen without interruption. :-)<br/><br/>We did end up having one problem though. We traveled to visit friends out of state and I was not able to get them working on the Marriott hotel's LG television (55LX340H) no matter what I did even with the Optical connection being detected. Of course, these specialized, commercial, hospitality-grade televisions don't allow guests to get into Settings to make any adjustments so I was 'fighting with a short stick' as they say.<br/><br/>Strangely(?), the headphones would not turn on as if the batteries were not charged. The green light on the Transmitter Charging Dock was on and never went off. Pressing the Power button did nothing BUT viewing it in low-light conditions I could barely see a very dim red light if I held the power button down so thought the batteries were at end-of-life. This was very disappointing for my wife and she spent the week with closed-captioning.<br/><br/>I was hoping when we got home they would miraculously start working again...unh unh, not so. Anyway I left them setup and over a couple of days tried turning them on occasionally. I did try other rechargeable batteries that we use in our Panasonic home phone system but they were not recognized, guess they really mean it when they say use ONLY their batteries. So, I went to their site and tried ordering their batteries but the Website did not play well, their "three_d_secure Gateway Rejected..." the transaction as it detected inaccurate information. I tried half a dozen times and gave up, also tried with different Browsers and computers to no avail.<br/><br/>And then, totally unexpected now, they started working again, couldn't believe it! My wife is very happy with the 'resurrection' and they continue to work as expected. During this diagnostic phase I also learned there's an Audio EIA connector on the bottom of the left earpiece I hadn't noticed and with the accompanying Audio EIA cable we're able to connect to her cell phone and to the Panasonic house phones with an adapter. Wow, is she happy!<br/><br/>  https://smile.amazon.com/Josi-Minea-Converter-Headphone-Earphone/dp/B011S90G46/<br/><br/>So, I finally went to Avantree's Support page and submitted a ticket. I heard back quickly from Sara and she was very helpful. I was able to submit an RMA Order for no charge and have received their batteries. I'll wait until I need them before checking them out.<br/><br/>In the meantime while all this was going on I had gone to Amazon and ordered the Avantree batteries but they won't be delivered until January 30-31.<br/><br/>Again, my wife is very pleased with this purchase and I'm happy the Support is so responsive.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 8/5/2022<br/><br/>Well, it happened again, the earphones would not power on no matter what I did. I 'dug out' the batteries they sent me for the last incident (above), put them in my charger and then replaced the ones in the set that were 'still' fully charging.  You guessed it, didn't fix it, played around with it for another 3 or 4 days and just couldn't get them to power on.<br/><br/>I finally went back to the Avantree support page and filled out another ticket describing the issue and referencing the previous ticket. This time Jeany from Support made the decision to send us a replacement set; it arrived about a week later and BINGO, it worked 'as advertised' 😀.<br/><br/>I'm guessing the original set we bought had some kind of defect that was elusive, the fact the issue occurred and then miraculously started working on its own . . . and then 6 months later did the same thing. The current set is a newer model and haven't seen any complaints about it so I'm confident it was one of those 'duh moments'.<br/><br/>I still highly recommend this set, find myself 'borrowing' it when my wife's not around 😉 to plug into my tablet with the EIA cable so I can watch my videos with much better audio fidelity. Note when you use the EIA cable to connect to your phone or tablet you do NOT need to turn the power on, just think of them as 'big Buds'.</span>

<span>Nine years ago I bought from Amazon a Sennheiser RS 170 wireless headphone system and an extra HDR 170 headset - using one while the other is charging. Amazingly, I could actually watch tv while hearing and understanding the dialogue with or without closed caption - cc.<br/>After 9 years the phone's sound quality is still really good but the headsets were no longer fitting nice and snug - they'd fall off my head when leaning over, It's getting harder to find replacement ear pads, the sound from the aged drivers was just a little less crisp than when new and unfortunately my hearing is not improving with age.<br/>It was time to shop for new headphones and the first thing I looked at were the specifications for the RS 175's. Comparing with the specs of the older RS 170's it looked as though the newer RS175's should be several dbs louder and they are (a lot louder) and that is definitely a plus. The extended volume is also likely the reason for shortened battery life. For my purpose near audiophile quality sound, immeasurable distortion and with more than enough volume to overcome my profound hearing loss is well worth shortened battery life, around 10 - 12 hours with fully charged batteries vs 20+ for the RS 170s.<br/>The headsets (I purchased a second HDR 175 headset) are very comfortable for my head size and shape for many long hours usage. The headset controls, + / - volume, bass boost and surround sound simulation (which I've yet to try) have a short learning curve and are comfortable to use once learned. With near audiophile quality sound for both tv and music, I love both classical music and female jazz/blues vocals - Diana Krall, Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald etc. The phones have a nice tight natural sounding bass and while the bass boost doesn't seem to add much it doesn't sound contrived either.<br/>Overall whether one has perfect hearing, profound hearing loss or anywhere in between I highly recommend the Sennheiser RS 175 Headphone System.<br/>One additional note: I've seen complaints about powering the phones up. With the 170s the user had to turn on both the base station and headset to pair them. With the newer SR 175s one has to press the on button on the headset and it automatically wakes up and pairs with the base station (transmitter), couldn't be easier.</span>

<span>First let me say that I suffer a serious hearing loss which makes it difficult to watch television with my wife because I have to have the volume up so loud and even then I can't hear everything.  I have had two sets of sennheiser RS 120's for a few years now and loved them.  My wife wanted to get me these for Christmas this year because they were apparently capable of surround sound. Now I'm not an audiophile but I will try to point out some pro's and con's here.<br/>The 175's are an over the ear fit as opposed to the 120's being an on the ear fit.  The 175's fit much tighter which is very nice when up and moving about yet the tight fit makes it difficult to hear when my wife is speaking to me during a show which she does quite often.  I'll let you decide if that's is a pro or a con.  The 120's were loose enough that I could hear her speak even though I still had to remove the headset to understand her.  The looseness had a downside though in that if I went to the fridge for a drink or snack and bent down the headset fell off.  Not so with the 175's.  Both sets have excellent sound reproduction even though the 120's are analog.  The 175's can be digital or analog which can be decided by a switch on the back of the transmitter.  You have the option of connecting to the sound source by optical cable or 3.5 jack which in my case required a y adapter converting to RCA jacks.  I was amazed to find that there is a very noticeable difference between digital and analog, digital being the best by far.  With the digital you don't hear any static or interference noises in non-dialog or silent spots.  At least I couldn't hear any and my wife said in her words "this is fantastic".<br/>sound with the 175's:<br/>You can switch between regular stereo, low SRS, and High SRS by clicking a button on the side of the headset.  This can also be controlled at the transmitter.  There is a very noticeable difference between each setting.  I have noticed that on low SRS the background recordings seem to be moved back and reduced in volume while the main dialog remains at regular volume.  Ever had one of those instances where the main character is talking in a whisper voice, which seems to be in vogue these days, and is suddenly overrun by the background noise, which also seems to be a problem these days.  Well, low SRS helps to overcome that problem for me.  I can hear the dialog very clearly and if you've lived for a while having to constantly asked "what did he/she say?"  then you can really appreciate that fact.<br/>In High SRS there is a distinct surround sound quality.  I've never been able to experience this before due to my hearing loss so to me it is awesome.  I love Paul Simons music, especially "Graceland", "father and daughter" and "late in the evening".  I just thought I liked them before but after listening to them through the 175's I have heard notes and instruments that I didn't realize were there. Now I love the songs.  Having discovered that I went back and watched a couple of my favorite movies and discovered background sounds that I had been missing and they add so much more to the entertainment value.  Keep in mind that I have experienced all this with the 120's also and there is a large difference.<br/>continued pros sound aside:<br/>I like that the controls are on the side of the 175 headset because I often recline when watching television and this keeps the controls from contacting anything and changing the settings unintentionally.<br/>This was a problem with the 120 sets because the controls were behind the headset.<br/>The 175 set, to me, is much more comfortable because of the padding and because possibly of the tighter fit which keeps them in place verses the loose fit of the 120 set.<br/>cons (maybe):<br/>The 175 set is only capable of employing two headsets.<br/>The 120 can employ several at one time.  I'm not sure how many but certainly more than four because I have that many headsets.<br/>The 120 has an option of three channels selectable on the transmitter and the headset which means you can use more than one in a household without interfering with each other.  This is the situation at my house.  I have one set in the bedroom and one in the living room and we can use them separately on separate channels at the same time.  My grandkids love the headsets so this settles a problem when they come to visit and want cartoons while I want news.<br/>The 175 has only one channel so this setup would probably not be possible.<br/>The 175 power button has to be held down for about three seconds to activate while the 120 has a slide switch.  The 175 has a very slight delay between activation and transmitter connection.  The 120 is instant.  This caused a rather humorous incident early on.  My wife was watching a movie on Netflix and I picked up the headset, turned it on, placed it on my head and thought I was waiting on a connection when in reality I was in a very quite point in the movie just before an explosion and massive gunfire.  I was on my way to my recliner when all hell broke loose and it was so realistic I almost wet my pants and overran the recliner.  It was apparently the highlight of my wife's day.  She still laughs about it.  Her lack of concern about my bruised shins and ego aside...after the fact it was funny.<br/>I know this was lengthy but I hope it helps someone in my situation to make an informed decision.<br/>In  short I would never had purchased the 175's for myself due to the cost because I wouldn't have believed they would make this much difference.  Now that I've experienced them I would buy them in a heartbeat.<br/>Now a word about sennheiser's customer service.  I had a situation early on where I lost the optical connection with my TV.  I was quick to blame the new headset simply because they were new.  I sent an email to sennheiser  in hopes they could find a solution before I had to send the set back.  I had a return mail in about 45 minutes telling me what to do.  Turns out the problem was with the television and not the sennheiser transmitter.  Quick response, great customer service.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>There is a TLDR at the end for those of you that got scared clicking read more and see a wall of text appear on your screen. Since there's a lot I have to say about these headphones, grab some popcorn, a soda, and strap in.<br/>As a forward, I have only tried these for a few hours, so I will update this post if my opinions change at all.<br/>Some initial things to get out of the way, I am by no means an experienced audiophile. I do enjoy the many different aspects of audio though. I love the character of vinyl and have tried many different headphones over the years. By many, I mean dozens, as I have a very weirdly shaped ear canal that has trouble getting in-ear headphones to fit correctly. My main daily pair of headphones is the second-gen Airpods since they are the only thing that fit my ear well. I also have a pair of Skullcandy Crushers for when I want a pair of car subs attached to my ears and Jaybird X3's with Comply tips for skating and exercising. My testing device is a Note 20 Ultra, using Spotify set to the extreme quality setting (320kbps to my knowledge).<br/><br/>FIT AND COMFORT<br/>This category is incredibly subjective, as everyone's ears are different. I will say, however, that this is the first pair of in-ear headphones that fit my incredibly weird ears out of the box!!! I've done the shake test and they stay pretty well in there. Comfort is a 5/5<br/><br/>DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY<br/>The design and build are top-notch on these buds. The case feels incredibly solid and is about the same size as the case on my Airpods (the buds case is slightly thicker). The buds themselves look great and the mirror finish is nice to look at. Overall, very well designed and built and thusly, gets a 5/5.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY<br/>Another bit of forwarding before I jump in, this is another subjective category. I am sensitive to "bright" headphones (where the highs or treble are too high and sound painful to my ear) and steer away from them as soon as I notice them. I am only going to be commenting on certain tracks and genres that I enjoy and actively listen to.<br/>I am blown away from the raw quality of the sound coming out of these! I had the Airpods Pro for a bit, and these sound similar but tuned for a tad more bass. This is exactly what I was looking for. You also have a couple of preset EQ options to tune it more to your liking or listening habits for the day. I'm hoping adjustable EQ support comes in the future to help dial in the sound signature to your liking. I'll break down each track and categorize it by genre.<br/><br/>-ELECTRONIC/HOUSE/OTHER SUB-GENRES<br/>Transformer by Moog: I chose this track to see if the backing cymbal can be heard amidst the rest of the song. It's very clear, along with the rest of the track. Bass also sounds very nice, not overdone, and very tight and punchy. Clarity and great bass quality will be a reoccurring character in this segment.<br/><br/>-ROCK/METAL<br/>I Love You to Death by Family Force 5: (This is the song I used for the shake test.) This is a track that I like to crank and test the audio quality at high volume. I can confirm that these buds sound just as good at high volumes. The cymbals don't destroy my ears, the guitars are very clear, and SGA's screams are great.<br/><br/>Suck My Kiss by Red Hot Chili Peppers: This is another track that regularly gets cranked. Flea's bass sounds perfect and once again, clear as day. The drums also sound killer.<br/><br/>-RAP<br/>Jump by Mac Miller: I chose this track to hear how clear and tight the bass was. The bassline on this one can sound very different depending on what headphones you use. It's tight and punchy with these. Clarity was also strong on this one.<br/><br/>Bless Yo Trap by Smokepurpp: This song is perfect for its incredibly heavy (but well-produced) bass. This track through the Crushers will literally shake my head, it's great. These buds handle the drum machine (cymbal perhaps?) in the background very, very well. Most headphones will usually force me to limit the volume because it sounds so shrill. Not on these. I can crank them up and not worry about it. The bass left a bit to be desired... Until I used the bass booster EQ, which as you can probably guess, upped the bass and still sounded punchy and tight. Well done.<br/><br/>Big Fish by Vince Staples: I also tested the bass booster EQ on this one. I noticed when it was enabled, it started to eat into the clarity of the mids a bit. Without the EQ it sounds crystal clear.<br/><br/>Where I'm From by Digable Planets: This song's nice short bassline can sound different depending on your headphones. Very accurate and well-controlled bass on this one.<br/><br/>-CLASSICS<br/>Rocket 69 by Todd Rhodes: This is the "make it or break it" moment for figuring out if headphones are too "bright" for me. Todd's vocals, along with the amazing sax solo can destroy my ears on some headphones. These handle this track PERFECTLY. Everything seems very well controlled and balanced. These buds produce a fantastic sound, without over-emphasizing any one aspect of the sound profile. Bass is nice and subdued (you could be surprised with what the Crushers do to this track) and the highs are not shrill or painful to my ears. The mids sound crisp and clear.<br/><br/>-POP/NOT SURE THE GENRE<br/>Sit Next to Me by Foster the People: I was surprised by this track. I never noticed the bass guitar before. This is when I realized how much I was missing using the Airpods. Everything is so well defined and the stereo separation is perfect. Not much else to say about this one, as everything about it sounds great.<br/><br/>-COUNTRY<br/>What Was I Thinkin' by Dierks Bentley: This track was another case of pure clarity. I could easily hear and discern every instrument and they were separated perfectly. A joy to listen to on these. Nothing was overblown on this one either, the bass might be a bit too high, but it's so tight that it adds to the sound in my opinion.<br/><br/>All of these tracks sound great to my ear and easily get a 5/5<br/><br/>MEDIA CONTROLS<br/>Finally, something I dislike about these headphones. The single tap to pause/play a track works just fine. If you try to double-tap to skip/replay it is incredibly hit or miss. I'm not sure if this can be solved through software, or if my finger just doesn't hit the touch surface as well as it would like. Usually what ends up happening is, I double-tap to skip a track and it registers it as one tap, thus pausing my music. I then double-tap again to try to get it to skip and it just starts playing where it left off. Finally, on the third time, it will skip the track. Adjusting the buds usually ends up registering as a tap and will also usually pause your music, just trying to get it pressed in your ear better. It also does this sometimes when you initially take out the buds from the case and put it in your ear. It's a big pain in the butt right now and gets a 2/5<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELING<br/>Don't buy these for some Bose or Airpod Pro level ANC. They're good at sound isolation when you're playing something, but pausing a track won't leave you saying "wow" like with the Airpod Pros. The only testing I've done so far with the noise canceling is cleaning around the house and listening to them while typing up this review. When a track is playing I can't hear my keyboard, but paused they're just about as clear as having the ambient sound mode on. I'll conduct further testing on these and report back with my findings. For now, it gets a 1/5.<br/>(UPDATE: I've done some testing outside with them now and they are pretty good at blocking the lower frequencies. It takes a little bit for the noise canceling algorithm to catch up with the noise around you, but I would say it blocks out somewhere in the neighborhood of 50-60% of the noise around you. It also is great at removing wind noise at moderate speeds. Based on these new findings, it gets a 3/5. Not great, but not terrible or useless either.)<br/><br/>AMBIENT MODE<br/>I'm happy to see that someone has finally implemented a function that allows the ambient mode to auto switch to on when you're speaking to someone. It's worked perfectly from the testing I've done so far. The ambient mode also sounds almost as good as the Airpod Pros' function. It works well, thus netting a 5/5<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>I am simply blown away by these headphones. So much so, that I spent nearly 2 hours writing this review. They do almost everything they set out to do exceedingly well. I am hoping that future software updates will fix the issues that I currently have with them. I will be replacing my Airpods with these and will be recommending them to my friends. Well done Samsung, you have a real winner on your hands.<br/><br/>Well, that wraps it up. For the TLDR readers out there: they sound amazing, ANC and touch controls suck majorly right now, the build and comfort are perfect, and I would easily recommend them.</span>

<span>These are plain and simple great buds, I replaced a pair of wireless neckband buds that stopped connecting to my phone. I had several with the same issue, the reason I keep buying them is battery-life, 20-25h of battery-life on those are unbeatable, this is a big deal for me, I look for battery-life and comfort fit and mic quality in headphones, most other headphones sounds good enough when listening to music or watching a show, but the mic is usually where it fails and of course the battery-life.<br/><br/>These take a bit getting use to if you want to extend battery through out the day by switching from left to right ear to get the most of them, however, I do get a few good hours before I need to swap. And if you decide to use both buds, charging time to give you another hour or so is only 3 minutes or so which is acceptable and it gives your ears a chance to rest in between.<br/><br/>Noise cancellation is not great enough for me to even use the settings for it, I disconnect those settings to save a bit more on battery instead, people who talks to me says that it depends what noise they can hear, obviously loud sounds in traffic comes out but it doesn't disrupt the conversations, when I am in the car I can actually keep the radio on and they cant hear the background noise at all, maybe the wind a bit of the window is down, again without disrupting the call sound.<br/><br/>They fit farely well inside the ears with comfort, I am a mobile detailer, another reason why neckband buds have been my previous choice, when they fall out in a car they stay around my neck, when these fall out they always end up under the seats somewhere making me work harder to get them out. That said, that doesn't happen as often as you think with these, even when I am sweating like a steak on the BBQ, they tend to stay in unless you make sudden head movements or the head is entirely tilted vertically. So these might not be the best option for runners.<br/><br/>They sync up fast with the phone.<br/><br/>The charging case is small and fits easy in your pocket, to get a good and proper charge for the buds though, its important to clean the copper pins that will touch the buds to charge them, or you might find yourself trying to "rub" the buds in place in the case for the charge to start, in doing so you risk wearing out the pins and eventually damaging them all together. Just keep the buds and the case clean with a isopropanoled Q-tip or similar and you will be fine. My only pet peeve would be that the case lid is a tiny bit difficult if yoy are trying to open it with dry hands, some cases have this little rubber trim on it for this reason, but it is not a deal breaker, that can easily be remedied if you want it, it just worth noting here.<br/><br/>I do not regret buying these, sure, it was easier with the neckband and I had unbeatable battery-life, but these have awesome sound, people can hear me even when I am running vacuum cleaner and polishers and as long as I am aware how the buds sit in the ear I will not loose them in a clients car or somewhere else.<br/><br/>I have dropped them several times and nothing has come loose inside them, the plastic feels solid and surprisingly enough hasn't been to scratched from rumbling down the concrete grounds. They have been dropped in he sink while doing dishes and obviously been wet from being with me at work and still works just fine.<br/><br/>I'll will most likely stop buying neckband buds from now on and keep buying these when replacement is due, I have been pleasantly surprised with the performance of these.</span>

<span>These earbuds are excellent. The sound quality is great, you can use one at a time, and they automatically connect to your Samsung phone when the case is opened. In the car, on the highway, these do a great job of cancelling road noise.<br/>My two complaints are: 1. when in a store or somewhere with lots of background noise (even super soft music in a store), the background noise comes across loud and clear. Talking a little louder seems to help.<br/>2. I need the part that goes in the rear to be a tad smaller or at least provide different silicone ear pieces. My ear canal opening is small, which causes these to wiggle, loosen, and fall out. When I try to put it back then, it hangs up on the other party every. single. time.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a pair of higher quality ear buds, these should absolutely be on your list. I've used JLab for a number of years, and the quality of sounds with these is much better</span>

<span>This is my first set of wireless earbuds. I like that they pair easily and nicely with any product, but am disappointed that Samsung doesn't provide an app to non-Samsung devices to control the earbuds' functions such as ANC, volume up/down, etc. I have a Samsung device, so I was able to change the settings, and I could always borrow someone's, but that is silly.<br/><br/>I have small ears, and these are quite heavy and large, so they stick out. To get them completely wedged in, I use the largest ear tips. The small and medium fit, but yawning or head-shaking caused them to fall out much faster. All ear tips eventually get too stretched out, so I think I'll have to buy spares. I do not do any more vigorous exercise than meditation and walking with these because of the fit.<br/><br/>The wireless charging and USB-C cable included in the box make these a good buy on sale. If I could find a rubberized slip cover for the buds, I bet they would stay in my ears even better. I like that there are a lot of third party accessories, such as cases with lanyards, that you can buy for the standardized Samsung Buds case specifications, too. It future proofs accessories purchases, which makes for less tech waste.</span>
