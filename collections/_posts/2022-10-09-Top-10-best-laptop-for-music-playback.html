<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>Acer should not use the MediaTek Wifi card, its driver has issue very often.<br/><br/>The problem of this WIFI card doesn't work with 5G WIFI channel; right now, its only works with 2.4G.<br/>I bought two Acer laptops at the same time, both of them have the same issue.<br/>When I googled its driver, other brand like Asus and Lenovo also have issue with this MediaTek Wifi Card.<br/><br/>Turned out I bought an AX210 Wifi card to replace this crap, and then it works prefect!</span>

I did my research and I think this is one of the best value laptops of 2022 that is not a gaming laptop.<br/>Pros:<br/>-Intel 12 Gen 12 cores and 16 threads that's more than enough power.<br/>-DDR5 RAM memory, faster than order models with DDR<br/>-GTX3050, it's not the super graphics card for gaming, but better than the Intel integrated graphics that other laptops at this price range have.<br/>-Intel Thunderbolt 4, high speed and multiple screens can be connected using USB ports, can also be used to connect external graphics card.<br/>-decent web cam 1080p<br/>-good screen resolution and it looks pretty good imo<br/>-cool design, aluminum chasis and a nice green color<br/>-works with Linux out of the box, I wanted a laptop to use with Linux for software development, I installed Manjaro and everything works perfect (haven't tried fingerprint since that's not important to me but that might need extra drivers)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-sound it's decent but not impressive<br/>-battery life is fair, watching YouTube at 75% screen brightness lasts around 4hrs<br/>-RAM is fixed to the motherboard so it can't be upgraded, although 16gb RAM should be more than enough.</span>

None of their other solutions have fixed the problem. I would avoid this laptop unless you plan on using it on an airport tarmac to drown out the fan ramping up every 10 seconds.</span>

<span>I have a iMac desktop which I absolutely love but I can’t take it with me when I leave the house, so I bought this little guy so I could grab and go. I was anticipating a little more from it to be honest. There are a few big problems I have with it. First, it runs Windows 11 S. I don’t know what the S stands for but I’m guessing it means slow because it is painfully slow. Downloading the software updates took over a hour and a half. Secondly, the 64GB hard drive space is half way full just from the operating system and software applications it comes with.  I used 2GB loading photos alone. I decided not to put my music on it just to save disk space. Lastly, as I said  before, it runs Windows 11 S. I attempted to download some files from the internet but the Windows wouldn’t allow me to do it. It forces you to use Microsoft Store which is terrible if your looking for a good selection of apps. If you’re okay with those problems I experienced then go ahead and buy yourself one. I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere. Unfortunately I’m going to have to send it back because it’s not what I wanted or what they said was.</span>

<span>What I don't like is there was litteraly 2 hours of updates that I had to download before I could even use this laptop. There is no home icon to bring me back to my home page, and the micro soft that comes preinstalled does not let me use google at all, everytime I've tried to use google browser micrsoft prevents it, the screen is a bit smaller then the advertized measurements imply, and every single day since I purchased this laptop there have been microsoft updates which is getting fustrating. If you don't install the updates asap it slows the laptop way down  and I've only owned this for not quite thirty days</span>

<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>If you're working within the limitations of this platform, then there's really nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>It's an excellent throw-in-a-bag-and-go laptop.  No bells and whistles (except the numpad/mousepad), excellent battery life, and a surprisingly robust plastic chassis.  One charge usually gets about 10 hours of useful life, and that's without extreme battery saving settings in use.<br/><br/>The num-/mouse-pad is great.  The caveat to that is that it's mostly useless unless you have an external mouse, or are only using it in spreadsheets.  Having to toggle between functionality makes it mostly useless, otherwise.  But (!!) it does give you a one-hand numpad, which is unheard of in other laptops this size, so that's pretty incredible in its own right.<br/><br/>It should go without saying:  unless you're talking about solitaire or minesweeper, you shouldn't be trying to game on this thing.  That's not what it's for, that's not what it's good at.  But for basic productivity, it's hard to argue with this thing for usability and utility, especially at this price.</span>

<span>I'm writing this for a typical user, using plain language, so they know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation, which is a monster configured for performance, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop, knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy, but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced, and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.<br/><br/>My preferred browser is Opera, so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault, that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world, so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.<br/><br/>My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge, the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages, and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it, until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate, and that's a serious problem.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it came optimized the way I made, it, I'd give it a 4, maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3, if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year, and based on what I saw, there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email, that has better data management than a Chromebook, then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.</span>
