<span>I think I glanced at monitor stands briefly a few days ago. Then I got the annoying Amazon emails that attempt to lure you back to the site to complete your purchase. Usually these emails are for something that you looked at months ago or already purchased, but in this case, I just didn't have time to keep researching.<br/> In the email was a thumbnail of a stand that looked like whatever I was looking at. I clicked on it, looked at the description, the pictures, and bought them. They show up and I was immediately impressed by the weight on the box. Upon opening, it was pretty obvious how they assemble and operate. Assembly was super easy and everything felt strong and well made. They are holding some JBLs on the third highest setting. I have no fear of them failing. I would agree with previous reviews about one thing. The base isn't super heavy so I wouldn't raise the speakers too high on carpet or uneven floors. Other than that, I love these stands. They are affordable and well built.</span>

<span>I was considering picking up a pair of telescoping height adjustable speaker stands for my new home office/studio and saw a listing for the Pyle PSTND35.5 Pro Audio Monitor Speaker Stands on Amazon. I was intrigued by the design and noticed the platform size and height were exactly what I was looking for. The amazing price was an added benefit, so I placed an order and wasn’t expecting anything overly fancy. I received my order in a couple of days and was pleasantly surprised. These stands are very high quality and sleek looking. Assembly was super easy. The triangle base has a super nice foot print and the platforms are the exact size of my studio monitors. I immediately set them up and was super impressed with the appearance and functionality. The height fits perfectly in my studio and was exactly what I envisioned before stumbling upon the listing. Friend and colleagues have commented very favorably and asked where they could pick up a set. I am VERY happy and will definitely be purchasing additional Pyle products in the future.</span>

<span>After reading reviews of how the stand was never stable enough, I took care in inspecting the welds that connect the threaded plates to the main support tubes.  All seemed to be in order, so I completed the assembly.  The stand joints neither wobbled nor exhibited any evidence of a lack of strength.<br/><br/>As the stands would be used on carpet, I removed the rubber feet and installed the supplied carpet spikes and ensured that the stand was fully stable on the carpet.  I found it important to also ensure the stands' spikes had been adequately seated into the carpet.  Once I was satisfied with the placement of the stands and their stability, I placed the pictured monitors on them.  These are M-Audio BX-8s and are very well supported by these stands.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase!</span>

Sold in pairs, our SMS6000-P Studio Monitor Stands reliably support heavy speakers. Their adjustable height enables precise speaker placement to optimize sound in a variety of spaces. Padding on the speaker platforms provides a nonslip grip, protects speaker cabinets, and dampens vibration. The wide bases provide exceptional stability and offer two floor-contact options to accommodate hard surfaces or carpets.

<span>I got these for under $100, and compared to my other stands, costing more, they are far better.  Some of the reviews I have read contain valid points, but I don't think they are taking into consideration the price.<br/><br/>These are very sturdy and stable.  They work quite well with some surrounds I am using...but these are not your normal surround speakers.  They are high quality monitors where my integrated-amplifier surround-sound calibration system deems it necessary only to send sound under 40Hz to my LFE.<br/><br/>Some positives:<br/>1.  These are way more stable than my other stands, and I feel comfortable placing my speakers directly on them with minimal setup.<br/><br/>2.  You can screw everything fairly tight, but still manage to twist the monitor-base a bit for some fine-tuned direction.<br/><br/>Some negatives:<br/>1.  The plastic feet people have talked about.  They still work fine for my limitations, but if you remove them, small plastic pieces can enter the base and be difficult to remove.  Also, if you were relying on these instead of the metal screw-spikes for precise levelling, you would probably have some issues.  I am in fact using these with my carpet admittedly.<br/><br/>2.  The carpet-orientated spikes.  Because the metal in the entire system is light (without sacrificing stability and sturdiness), the spikes don't dig in like some stands with a narrower base, narrower spikes, and a heavier center of gravity.  I don't know how much testing is done on levelling carpet base-attachments in general for any stands.  I did find it a bit odd that this is the dedicated carpet (and not hard floor) usage, because my front speakers use metal adjustable spikes as well, but come with associated metal disks that they fit into.<br/><br/>Subjective points:<br/>1.  The plastic turn handle seems perfectly fine to me.  Whether or not this can scratch the pole is not that relevant in my situation.<br/><br/>2.  The 4" increments are acceptable for my needs, but admittedly, if someone needed the precision of a different gradation, this could be an issue.  However, the pin system is very sturdy and easy, and there is a mini-pin base provided to rest it on.<br/><br/>3.  Minor.  These do have a 'guitar-center' look to them.<br/><br/>Untested:<br/>1.  I am currently only setting the monitor-base up to 41", which is the second lowest setting.<br/><br/>Some future possibilities:<br/>1.  Add automatic level bubbles like a tripod.<br/>2.  Add the ability to tilt the speakers at specified degrees.<br/><br/>Summation:<br/>In the audiophile world, it isn't that easy to find sturdy stands that are adjustable.  These work great for a price that some may question if it is missing a digit.  They also come with an acoustically safe pad well engineered into the monitor baseplate, so no earthquake putty or blu-tack is necessary.  The stand-base itself is quite large but it managed to fit into the same place as my smaller ones without compromising my speaker position.  And, my monitors are fairly heavy at 5.6Kg each.</span>

<span>These will hold my HS8s very good. The plate is big enough to cover their base area. Very easy to handle, and you can feel high quality components. I wouldn’t recommend using these stands for bigger speakers.<br/><br/>The product came with minor scratches on one one of the posts, but nothing to worry about.</span>

<span>**EDITED, PLEASE SEE ORIGINAL MESSAGE**<br/>i am updating my review and giving 5 stars because the customer service was extremely helpful and efficient in correcting their mistake. the new stands are still slightly uneven, had to smack one of the plastic pieces down a few times and they’re still noticeably off if they’re side to side but in use it’s not a big deal. plus for what i paid for my monitors these stands are reasonably overpriced. material is still cheap and not as secure as i’d like it to be but it gets the job done and i don’t regret my purchase at all!<br/><br/>original message:<br/><br/>One stand is higher than the other. Must have received a defective stand. Other than that they are decent. Could be sturdier but gets the job done and I'm not worried about them falling over spontaneously or even if knocked a little.</span>

<span>I'm super happy with these speaker stands. I use them with Kali LP-8s and they are the perfect size for that. (They would work for the LP-6s as well, and probably Avantones too.)<br/><br/>I was worried about the triangular base but that actually makes them MORE stable. Think about it -- a triangle shape can't leave one side not touching the ground -- even a non-flat surface -- all 3 sides will always contact the ground. It's perfect.<br/><br/>When you raise the speakers, there are notches and there's a post you insert into a hole. This gives you safety, making it impossible for the speakers come down. Good design.<br/><br/>The top part where you place the speaker has a thin rubberish-foam bit to set the speaker on. It's good enough, but you might want to get one of those foam pads in addition to absorb more vibration.</span>

<span>So these stands are nice looking with a cherry wood pattern, not paint more like wallpaper. The original msrp I believe was $100 dollars...NOT!! Fifty dollars is still a bit much, closer to 40 dollars. Solid well made, however one of my stands is still loose no matter how much I screw...Epoxy will help. Shipping was quick...2 days, to Philadelphia, Pa. I presently have Definitive Technology Pro Cinema 1000 on them...they look nice. The parts bag has every thing you need to set up, which btw took 20 minutes with a manual phillips head screwdriver. I put mine together with the Rockville branding in the back...cleaner look. I would definitely recommend these stands. A matching center stand would be nice, about 4 to 6 imches tall...angling down. I gave a 4 of 5 because of price to value</span>

<span>The stands are very sturdy and well made. The wood accents are fake but convincing. If you are trying to match the wood color in your studio, it's a light cherry color. The stands are somewhat easy to assemble and the screw holes did line up on mine. I would not recommend the use of a power tool to screw these together. It would have been nice if it was pre assembled, but with it disassembled there is the option to add sand to the hollow middle part between the base and the upper platform for extra stability. This is mentioned in the instructions. The stands include adhesive wire management clips and zip ties, as well as rubber feet for sound isolation, but be careful with the rubber feet on polyurethane finishes as they tend to leave an imprint. The stands are a little chunky and not very sleek or modern. But they get the job done and your heavy monitors will be safe on these! They fit the KRK Rokit 5 G4 perfectly. All larger size monitors will overhang the top platform slightly, which isn't a bad thing.</span>

what makes our stands the best in their class?  robust poles our poles use thick metal giving you a 60 lb load capacity. This is the best in its class. (Other ones on the market Only support 20lbs).  anti-vibration foam we include EVE foam to eliminate speaker vibrations and stop the speaker from sliding.  supports for hard floor, carpet, and uneven floors included with our stands are fully adjustable rubber feet and brass pegs. The rubber feet are used for hard floors and can be adjusted at different heights if your floor is not completely level. The brass pegs are used in rooms with carpet and can also be adjusted at different heights ensuring your speaker and stand are 100% level.  powder coated long lasting finish our stands are finished with premium powder coated paint making them beautiful and durable. In addition, this type of finish helps protect the stand from cracks, scratches and chips.  Clean installation with cable management another great feature worth mentioning is the stands cable management. Our stands have discreet holes in the top and bottom of the pole making it easy to hide wires for a nice clean look.  height The Height of these stands is 37”. this is the perfect height to have them next to your TV or in your studio. We also offer 21” and 29” models to accommodate any application..

<span>These are sturdy and reasonably heavy (a good thing). Steel rings like a bell unless you dampen it from ringing. I attached adhesive foam insulation inside the support tubes and under the base and top to suppress self noise fairly well. It may not transmit as little vibration as one made of MDF, but it is much sturdier, and probably more durable. Good feet, too.. My speakers perform very well on them.</span>

<span>The stand is nice and solid.  There are 2 reasons I am knocking a star off.<br/><br/>First, instead of shipping the machine bolts in a parts bag they are partially threaded into the posts.  For 3 of the bolts this wasn't a problem.  The fourth bolt was cross threaded, tightened down to the bolt head.  I couldn't remove the bolt with the hand tool or using a power tool.  I ended up needing to use a bolt extractor.  Luckily, I had a spare bolt on hand that matched specs.<br/><br/>Second, there was a poorly placed sticker on the front of one of the posts.  Not only was the sticker in front, it wasn't straight either.  I removed the sticker to find two small dings in the post.  Looks like they are spaced apart the same distance as the diameter of a post.  Very small blemishes.  You see them if you look for them.</span>

<span>These are ok budget stands.  I needed something 35+ inches and wanted white, and there isn't a lot of choice at this price.  The stands themselves are sturdy enough where they sit in my house, out of the way against a wall.  If I move them in a higher-traffic area, I might think about epoxying a couple of additional metal plates (maybe 10-lb free weights?) under the bottoms for additional stability.<br/><br/>Assembly was easy enough, just four bolts to manage.  I highly recommend threading the speaker wires through the stands before you attach the plates, or you'll never get them through.  The included foam pads are very thin and I doubt it makes much difference other than to add a little grip, I also wish they came color matched to the stands.  You might want to add another layer of sound isolation between these and your speakers.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the packaging these things come in.  I don't know why they shipped these stands in cardboard that's barely thicker than what's used in shoeboxes.  As you can see (even through my blurry pics) the box barely made it to my house and there are small dents and scratches on several parts of these stands (more than I've documented here.)  The plates came wrapped in very thin bubble envelopes, but that did not keep them from getting chipped as well.  Luckily this looks like it's almost the same as liquid paper, so I hope to be able to cover the dings on the plates and the risers.  I'd consider sending them back, but there is no way they'd go back in the same box they came in without ending up a pile of parts and cardboard confetti on a UPS truck floor.<br/><br/>Had these stands arrived unblemished they'd be a solid 4-star.</span>

<span>I've used these kinds of pads for a while now, and they do a great job.  The Auralex ones have always been my go-to, but their price has jumped a bit in the last year, so I decided to give the Pyle product a try.  These stands work every bit as good as the higher-priced alternatives.  I'm using the 'medium' ones -- roughly 9" x 12" to hold a pair of Prodipe Ribbon 8 Pro studio monitors in my practice rig.  They give me the proper angle, and keep the coupling down.  (If you're looking for huge, boomy bass, maybe these pads aren't for you.  If you're looking for solid, natural bass they do the trick.)<br/><br/>To be fair, the Pyle pads might be just a smidge softer/spongier than their Auralex equivalents.  It's hard to say for sure, because: a) I don't have two identically-sized stands to compare; and b) the difference is subtle.  Plus, I don't have anything to measure the difference except my 'calibrated fingers.'  Nevertheless, the foam stands up to my 13kg (28.6lb) monitors without any noticeable compressing, so the product is clearly stiff enough to do the job.  I've got them in the 'steep' setup using the extra wedges, and the monitors sit firmly in place; I'm not worried about drift, even though they're being used in a rock band practice room.<br/><br/>What's wrong with them?  Nothing I can see, other than they say "Pyle" on them, rather than having a premium name that your friends will nod to with respect.  Oh, and I wasn't able to dump all of the $40 that was cluttering up my wallet.  ;-)</span>

What do YOUR speakers stand for? Or rather, what do they stand ON? Speaker support, placement, and protection are critical to accurate monitoring. While standard monitor stands work well to achieve this, they don’t always blend into their environment. Sometimes you need something more elegant and adaptable to the overall vibe of your living room or studio furniture, which is exactly what the Elite Studio Monitor Stands by Gator Frameworks provide – simplicity with an aesthetic to match any home or studio décor. Snag a second pair to dress up your home theater and entertainment room; place them with your turntable speakers to bring your listening area into focus. No matter the application, the stands will SIT right into place!

<span>The wood looks nice, but the build quality is cheap. When you look through the middle, you can see the space in between the center board, the two side boards, and the top board. Plus, it was assembled with those cheap wood inserts, and Metal hook style fasteners. Also, it’s too tall! Check the height and make sure you’re happy with something this tall, I could see it working for a rear channel speaker in a home theater, but it’s definitely too tall for bookshelf fronts.</span>

The desktop studio monitor clamp-on stand pair by Gator Frameworks supports most small-sized studio monitors in both vertical and horizontal orientations to improve speaker performance during playback and mixing. The GFWSPKSTMNDSKCMP functions by separating and elevating speakers from your desktop surface, giving you a more isolated audio response for improved accuracy during studio monitoring. Easily adjust and lock the stand height from 10. 5” to 14” and speaker tilt angle from 0 to 15 degrees for preferred positioning. The stand clamps to desktop surfaces up to 2. 25” in thickness to free up space on your workstation table and will hold a max load of 60 lbs. In addition to studio monitors, the multipurpose top deck platform works great for MacBook Air/Pro models and will fit similar-sized laptops.

<span>I've bought two pairs of these monitor stands. Both work well and look great with 8 inch and 7.5 inch monitors.<br/>The only thing I disliked is that theres a small plastic piece with the tightening mechanism that can fall into the hole if you remove the stand. It took me a while to realize that the plastic piece fell in as i was wondering why it wouldn't tighten.</span>

<span>I jumped on a sale on these Amazon had, and I'm so glad I did. We're using Auralex foam risers on the stand platforms, underneath Kali LP-6 v2 monitors for the DAW.....these stands do the job well and, with the Auralex for further decoupling, really allow the Kali's to sing. I'm pretty impressed. There were no missing parts, or anything wrong with the stands I received; and they adjust beautifully. They will also easily handle monitors bigger than the aforementioned Kali's we have.</span>

<span>Used for my Emotiva 6S powered monitors, that are about 25 lbs each. Very steady, and I don't feel like they're going to fall off, even when I accidentally scoot my desk by leaning on it. You'll need a minimum of 6 inches of clearance to the wall if used on a desk, so they won't work if you need to push your desk all the way to the wall. They position the load on the center of gravity on a 9 inch deep platform. If you had them positioned 90 degrees your desk surface, you'd only need 4.5 inches, but most people listen toe in at least a little. Only minor negative is that there's no built-in cable management. Easy enough to stick cable holders to the back or just thread them through the velcro loop that holds the retaining pin.</span>

<span>I ordered these not realizing my 3” thick desk would not be compatible with the clamp size on this product. My desk is too think. However, I do see that a review from a user says he was able to purchase an adjustable C-clamp alternative and make it work for his desk. That review came from user Driskull. Driskull, if you see this review, I’m wondering how you made this work with switching out c-clamps. I see the adjustable c-clamps from WALI that you would’ve purchased but not totally sure how the assembly would work. Maybe I’ll just have to purchase and try your approach. In any case, these are good monitor stands and nice to have your monitors off the desk without having to deal with a another stand on your studio floor. Just make sure they’re compatible with your desk before buying.</span>
