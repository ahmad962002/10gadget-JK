<span>Quality feel, responsive and easy to upgrade. I don't play a lot of demanding titles, but this pc preforms well in games like WOW, Minecraft Dungeons, ESO and Genshin. It works nicely for office work and other media consumption as well.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Keyboard has a nice tactile response, and the typing experience is enjoyable even if a little truncated. That is to say that the 10 key (numbers pad) is a bit on the smaller side. It feels natural after a few hours of typing. It is backlit which is also nice.<br/><br/>The screen, to me, is more than bright enough and the colors are vibrant. Not as good as my desktop monitor but way better than any of my budget media/office laptops.<br/><br/>It was very easy to upgrade as well. Included the bracket, connector, and screws to mount a 2.5 inch drive.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>There is a lack of ports, which I knew when I bought it and is not a deal breaker but is worth mentioning. Two usb a (3rd gen), one usb c (data only), an hdmi, a combo audio jack and a proprietary power port. A third usb a (even if only 2.0) would have been nice, on the opposing/lefthand side as would a car reader. I also don't understand the lack of usb c charging in this day and age but that seems to be a common issue with gaming laptops (at many price points) so I would hold that against it.<br/><br/>It did not include a standoff of adding a second M.2 NVME even though there is a slot for it. Not the end of the world but odd, nonetheless.<br/><br/>Battery life is nonexistent. 2-3 hours of mixed use and less than an hour when gaming.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>I must say that I am happy so far. As I said, it was easy to upgrade and is quite responsive both in office work and at gaming. If what you are looking for is portable gaming setup, this might be for you. Or you want to do some light media editing. It also does office/schoolwork and media consumption well, as it should. Makes a great alternative to trying to buy a graphics card for your desktop at the moment too.<br/><br/>Quality seems to be there; it is your use case that will decide if this pc is for you. Want a portable gaming setup that can do office/schoolwork, some light editing and media consumption? Then this might be for you. On the other hand, if you want a work/school pc that can game on the side I might look for something with good integrated graphics that is lighter and has better battery life. That call is going to be on you.<br/><br/>As long as you understand what you are buying, I think you will be happy with this laptop. I know I am.</span>

<span>Edit: This was originally a five-star review. I'm still really happy with my purchase, but I ran into stuttering on YouTube videos and unimpressive/inconsistent download times that I couldn't seem to fix. Come to find out the wifi cards that come preinstalled on these laptops leave something to be desired. This isn't a big deal if you have an ethernet cable handy, but it would likely be a massive pain for anyone meaning to, say, write an essay at a coffee shop.<br/><br/>I swapped out the wifi card in my old laptop for the one in this one and it works flawlessly. I can't vouch for it, but I've read Intel's AX200NGW wifi card is a good replacement for the one that comes stock in these machines. If you're going to be adding RAM or an extra HDD anyway, swapping out the wifi card isn't too difficult; the tiny connectors are just really finicky. I could live with the wifi as it was, but I don't have access to a wired connection as much as I'd like. If that's you, be prepared for a bit of tinkering.<br/><br/>Everything else I said stands.<br/><br/>Edit 2: Elden Ring runs great on this.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I paid a little under $750 for this laptop. Out the gate, I added 32GB of RAM, which cost me around $150. That's overkill - 16GB is perfectly serviceable on this configuration, especially without a secondary SSD, and 16GB would cost roughly half that. I wanted to future proof my purchase and make it simple to switch out my secondary mechanical drive in the future.<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend swapping the RAM for two 16GB sticks (you want them to be the same variety to get the most performance and bang for your buck) and the 8GB my model came with is only just enough for Windows at this point. If you only intend to run Steam and some games, it might do. If you have a Chromium-based web browser running in the background, forget about it. Trust me - extra RAM will save you a lot of headache.<br/><br/>My model didn't come with easy access panels on the back for adding an HDD or for changing out the RAM. Luckily the screws are fairly easy to remove, and the panel came off pretty easily with a plastic pry tool. (Amazon sells the kit I use - it's really handy to have on hand in case you ever need to get inside your machine. Search "Syntus Electronic Repair Tool Kit with Magnetic Driver Kit, 80 in 1 Professional Precision Screwdriver Set with Portable Pouch for iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Gaming Console, Controller, Black")<br/><br/>There's two M.2 slots and one SATA slot. I wouldn't recommend mounting a second M.2 drive - one, I'm not sure how you'd safely mount it in this revision. Two, if you watch Linus Tech Tips video on the performance difference between a SATA SSD and M.2 drives, you'll see that the average user isn't going to notice a difference between the two types of SSDs. Frankly, my 7200rpm mechanical drive loads things really quickly on this laptop, so I'm not even in a rush to upgrade from that. Games like The Witcher 3 run perfectly fine off of it. (And honestly, if you're on a budget and don't want to deck out this laptop with the best kit it can handle, 2TB 7200rpm mechanical drives can be had for around $40-$80 these days.)<br/><br/>The build quality is fantastic. You can tell which parts of it are a little cheaper than others - I'd be careful with the plastic tabs when you're prying the bottom off; take your time with it - but it feels solid the moment you take it out the box. The back of the IPS panel is mounted to metal. The bezels are designed such that it's entirely feasible for you, as the user, to open up and work on your own hardware. From a right-to-repair standpoint, this machine is as good as it gets in this price range. Even if you have no interest in working on it or ever opening it up, you can take it to a local computer shop and be rest assured they can easily get to whatever they need to work on.<br/><br/>The screen is the part most likely to fail on a laptop over extended use. I haven't cracked open the bezel on my unit because my screen was in perfect working order and after a nightmare I had with a different laptop, I just wanted to get back to using my computer. Looking up tutorials and images online, every model of this computer I've seen uses screws to hold the screen in place. No glue or anything like that. In the event that you or a technician ever needs to swap out the screen for a different one, it should be a fairly simple process.<br/><br/>And again I return to build quality - I've noticed very little light bleed when I'm running various applications. This is not the best ips panel I have ever used, but let me stress again - for the price? It's amazing. High refresh rate. Everything is crystal clear. Good contrast. It's been a joy to do photo editing work on it.<br/><br/>For gaming - I use Linux as my daily driver, and removed Windows from this device as soon as I got it set up and made sure there weren't any malfunctions or defects that would warrant calling the manufacturer or returning it to Amazon.<br/><br/>If you're curious whether this makes a good Linux machine - yes, with some caveats. My model - 15ACH6 - did not have working wifi out of the box in Pop OS or Manjaro.<br/><br/>I initially wanted to use Pop OS because it has great hybrid graphics support (better than Windows, if you ask me) and it comes pre-packed with tools to help maximize your laptop's battery life. However, making the wifi work wasn't a simple fix. There are several methods; the least complicated one for me was upgrading the kernel. Problem is - Pop OS is an Ubuntu-based OS and isn't designed to have the kernel upgraded independent of the operating system.<br/><br/>Long story short - I got Pop OS working perfectly, but getting the kernel upgraded was just the first issue I had to solve. I also had to change the power management settings so my wifi wasn't throttled, and my printer was detected but wasn't working properly out of the box.<br/><br/>Manjaro makes it easy to upgrade the kernel, and I was up and running within an hour. The thing that took the longest was waiting for all the updates to install. The only thing I had to do to make full use of my hardware was update the Nvidia drivers, manually install the Optimus Switcher (look up "How to setup Optimus Manager on Manjaro! | DenshiHelp" on YouTube, especially if you use KDE) and adjust the power management settings.<br/><br/>If you're a Linux user or you're Linux-curious, Manjaro is your best bet on this thing if you want a relatively painless experience. (This is also why I bought so much RAM - if I absolutely have to use Windows for any reason, I want the extra memory to run a VM.)<br/><br/>Mind, this shouldn't be an issue in the future. The latest version of Pop OS at the time of this writing is 21.10. If you get this same model of this laptop and newer revisions of the major Linux operating systems have been released, it should be a fairly seamless experience regardless of which one you choose.<br/><br/>I also want to note - in terms of getting this laptop to boot from USB, this was by far the most painless experience I've had. Any other laptop I've had has fought me tooth and nail when I wanted to remove Windows and install Linux. Part of that's the AMD architecture - in my experience, AMD respects their users more than Intel or Nvidia does, so if that's important to you, this is a great machine. If you've ever heard of Intel's Management Engine, AMD's equivalent - the PSP - can be just be switched off in the BIOS. Not once has this machine tried to tell me - its owner and end user - what I can and cannot do with it.<br/><br/>But back to gaming - I didn't try to run anything on Windows, but I can tell you just from the hardware specs you're going to have a great experience with anything released from 2018-2020, and the GTX 1650 would be a respectable graphics card even in a desktop at this point thanks to the current market. You most likely won't be running a game released in 2022 on Ultra on this laptop, but you should be able to get admirable performance on medium-to-high settings running something that just released.<br/><br/>On Linux running Proton - The Witcher 3 runs flawlessly for me on the highest settings using the current experimental version of Proton through Steam. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, runs flawlessly. All the indie and retro-style platformers I threw at it - Cuphead, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, Blaster Master Zero - flawless. Streets of Rage 4, Mother Russia Bleeds, Terraria, Celeste, Knights of the Old Republic 2 - those are Linux native so they ran for me as well as they do in Windows. Most of your older RPGs like Fallout: New Vegas and Morrowind will run amazingly on here regardless of what OS you're using.<br/><br/>I won't sugarcoat it and tell you that gaming on Linux is every bit as good as gaming on Windows. It's not. If you want to play the latest multiplayer games with your friends or you like to hop around and try different games when they come out without having to check if they work and without having to tinker, keep Windows on this machine.<br/><br/>For me - I have always been about 5 years behind the curve, my favorite games are in 2D, and I refuse to play games with excessive DRM (here's looking at you, Denuvo) or invasive anti-cheat (that is a security timebomb waiting to go off) so my experience switching from Windows to Linux has been relatively painless as a gamer. Valve's Proton is at a great place right now, and if you look up anything that's Steam Deck verified you should have a good time. You've got hundreds - if not thousands - of games at your disposal regardless of what kind of OS you're running.<br/><br/>To end this off - I am in love with this laptop, and I would gladly get another Lenovo machine in the future. The 8 gigs of RAM it came with is a little lean, but it's an easy upgrade, and you will definitely want to add a harddrive anyway. The IO is a little lacking at a mere two USB 3.0 ports, but - they're both USB 3, and you can attach a USB hub. (Just don't run an external HDD off it as most USB hubs don't draw additional power from the slot.)<br/><br/>The build quality is rock solid. The specs are respectable enough that it will breathe new life into your older games and allow you to play most newer titles. You can easily do photo and video editing on this. It's set up to be easy to clean, maintenance, and repair. All in all, for less than $800? This thing is a steal.</span>

<span>This is the 4th one of these that I've bought!  With it being all solid state, battery life is excellent.  Startup is very fast.  I've added a second SSD to two of them with no problems.  It even comes with the necessary hardware to add it.  It's not fast enough for intensive gaming but plenty fast for games like Minecraft, which the kids like.

<span>Ive inly been really using this laptop for like a month and a half but Its a good laptop. For rreference though My last laptop I had was used when I recieved it and "on its last legs" and started having noticible issues once it turned 11 years old...I enjoy doing video editing and that over a decade old laptop was no longer covering it so I decided to inest in this laptop. With its core I7 processer of 16gb of ram its doing really well amd seems to not struggle at all for what I do and or need. Its a good computer cabale of doing lots of work and the battery life is superb. I ran a couple of stress tests on it and it preformed well. The one downside is that because its windows 11 alot of stuff that was free and or included on windows 10 or lower is not included , most of the software thats available on this laptop is consistent of free trials or trying to get you to make a yearly purchase to use the programs such as the microsoft suite ( which will run 99$ a year or the price of like 9.99 a month). And the free trials are short lived or require you to put in credit card info...so I would suggest anyone who gets this laptop to be ready to either pay for what use to be free or start doing research on free open source software that is comparable to whatever programs you may want to use that are no longer free on the windows platform. Windows 11 isnt really bad its just different. As for the hardware I suggest doing your research before buying this laptop, and make sure you get the correct processer type for what you do, core I3 or below will not cut it in most cases try core i5 or higher and get atleast 16gb of ram aka memory to be on the safe side for anything other then really light light computer use. Also since this is a thinner laptop it has no cd rom and can in some cases overheat a little as it needs some ventalation when in use if doing heavy duty work which is to be expected for its thinness, and my very slight complaint is that while doing heavy duty work it can get to humming a bit too loudly for my taste but nothing that is too terribly concerning. I reccomend this laptop and I love it thus far.</span>

<span>This laptop is pretty good. Keypad has a weird layout, and the keyboard lacks proper Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown keys. Oddly enough, Shift+Home works if you do LShift+RShift+Home, while LShift+RShift+End does not work and is just treated as End.<br/><br/>Probably the most baffling spec about this laptop is its 4 GB of memory. I highly advise to spend an extra $15 on a SODIMM DDR4 chip (preferably 2667 MHz), because 4 GB is nothing nowadays, especially with the increased minimum requirements of Windows 11. Everything was loading pretty slow and programs like JetBrains Rider could barely function because they're constantly fighting for the physical space. Once I popped off the bottom cover and doubled the RAM, everything started going pretty fast afterward. Probably increased its impressive battery life even further.</span>

<span>I'm writing this for a typical user, using plain language, so they know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation, which is a monster configured for performance, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop, knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy, but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced, and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.<br/><br/>My preferred browser is Opera, so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault, that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world, so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.<br/><br/>My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge, the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages, and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it, until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate, and that's a serious problem.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it came optimized the way I made, it, I'd give it a 4, maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3, if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year, and based on what I saw, there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email, that has better data management than a Chromebook, then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.</span>

<span>OK, this is my second Stream.  The original was a 32GB that is still operating and is obviously limited by the couple GB remaining after the operating system space.  However, was useful for web browsing.  This one is 64GB and that leaves about 30GB space for programs plus one year of MS Office free.  I got rid of the Windows 10 S mode and the speed for web browsing and program operation is fine.  And I'm used to an Intel 11th generation i5 on a desktop and have no complaints. That is an absolutely amazing unit for $200.  Of course, in both cases, I've added extra room using a USB 128GB flash drive so really, it's a fantastic deal.  The only con that I've found so far is that the sound is rather puny but connecting a cheap bluetooth speaker solves that issue.  Update:  I hooked this up to an external monitor and it gave me an option to go from the native internal screen resolution of 1366x768 to 1920 x 1080 and it shows up great on the external monitor.  I'm shocked.  I cannot believe this computer was $200.  Well, we'll see how long it lasts.</span>

<span>So far this laptop seems decent. Manage you’re expectations. You can’t buy a mid-range gaming laptop and expect all the best. I’ve yet to try some of the more demanding games.

When I received my laptop, the Thunderbolt icon was missing and only showed the normal USB icon. I was excited for the thunderbolt port but alas the port is not Thunderbolt. This cost them a star on my review simply because having it in the pictures is misleading and they should be updated to reflect the correct icon.</span>

<span>By far the most feature abundant and powerful laptop I have ever used. This laptop is actually perfect for work as a freelance videographer. The render times are significantly better than any of my other laptops and PC. I picked up this laptop since I need to be one the go and it's definitely light enough where I don't mind carrying it around.<br/><br/>This laptop is really a bang for your buck with how many features is jammed in. It's perfect as a business laptop and not a pleasure laptop. I have a gaming laptop too that I use for that. This laptop is perfect for work and editing in a coffee shop and such.</span>

<span>TL;DR -<br/>Bad: Significant quality issues, hardware and software limited to only support 1 external display, extremely low quality construction particularly of screen, useless track pad. Awful customer support.<br/><br/>Good: The most bang-for-your-buck on pure specs, if you only need one monitor, don't care about build quality, hard to beat 32gb of DDR4 3200 and a i712650h with TB SSD and RTX3060 for the price.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>The best thing I can say about this laptop is that Amazon was kind enough to let me return it after I missed the return window! I've been an MSI customer for years, I had a Ghost Pro 60 for several years which I loved, and have had a variety of their products I found to be exceptional. This laptop alas was a significant miss.<br/><br/>The ability to only support 1 external monitor, despite a RTX3060 which can support 4 monitors is a deal-breaker on a creator or gaming laptop for me. The USB-C port is gen 1 and cannot support display or advanced hubs (trust me, I tried every dongle imaginable, and then contact MSI support who confirmed this laptop is both hardware/port and software limited to 1 display).<br/><br/>The screen is also extremely disappointing, and shows significant light-leakage around the edges. It's a shame as the resolution and color density is pretty solid, but the overall construction is so flimsy and cheap feeling that it ruins the effect of what seem to be decent pixels. Additionally, there are various software issues I've encountered related to the displays, when opening or closing the laptop with the single external monitor connected the laptop monitor often fails to display or shows a blank screen, which cannot be resolved without a hard restart, sometimes several (including disconnecting the external displays).<br/><br/>The plastic construction feels cheap and gathers fingerprints like managers gather Karens.<br/><br/>The trackpad is also useless. It's also quite large and bulky. The power brick is medium, smaller than on the Alienware R15, bigger than on my Lenovo (and let's not talk about Mac!). The speakers are trash, but could be worse.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>Not to be too negative, there are some big winners for this laptop, the biggest being the specs for the price. If you only need one monitor, and primarily will be using peripherals than this is still a very good buy. I purchased the i712650h with RTX3060 model (interesting that the beefier version has a slightly slower processor, but w/e).<br/><br/>Benchmark scores are slightly lower than what I expected out of the hardware, but still extremely solid for a laptop. Novabench clocked it at 3904 and 3902 on tests several months apart, details in screenshot. While the 6GB of RAM on the RTX3060 isn't going to hit the same FPS/speeds a 3070+ or comparable AMD card, this is definitely a powerful machine that will play games with solid speeds on medium to high settings, and can handle pretty rapid video and art renders. 32GB of DDR4 at 3200 speed is also more then enough, and will save on future upgrades. I have not taken this apart or done any mods so I can't comment on how easy it is to do so or internal build quality.<br/><br/>Feature-wise, obviously the lack of ports for another external display is huge, however that aside is does have HDMI, a gen1 USB-C, and several USB ports. The power cord is not inconveniently placed, which is a plus.<br/><br/>The biometric fingerprint scanner is also surprisingly good, despite it being embedded in a trackpad which is about as useful as a used chewing gum as a lubricant for delicate machinery.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a shame that this product isn't a rockstar. With a few minor adjustments, even for the relative increase in price, this could be an absolute beast. Despite the awful support I will likely try more MSI products in the future, and would not use this particular example to veer you away from some of their other laptops. I wish you the best of luck in your laptop shopping experience!</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>• Latest 12th Gen Intel Core i7 processor is good for processing content<br/>• 32GB rams is more than enough for better load time<br/>• 16" QHD+ 60Hz 100% DCI-P3 is good for color correction, especially for content creators<br/>• RTX 3060 is a nice graphic card addition<br/>Con:<br/>• None<br/>My Three Cents:<br/>I forgot to mention that the cooler on this creator laptop is excellent while pretty silent.

<span>Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!<br/><br/>This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.<br/><br/>I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.<br/><br/>The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this.<br/><br/>GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!</span>

<span>Wow wow wow. I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that.<br/><br/>It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips.<br/><br/>OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros / cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and "clicky" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors.<br/>-This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag / pocket will do!<br/>-The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference.<br/>-ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package.<br/>-The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine.<br/>-The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a "state-of-the-art" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines.<br/>-The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment.<br/>-There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great.<br/>-Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless.<br/>Cons:<br/>-Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you!<br/>-Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable.<br/>-The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased.<br/><br/>Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine!<br/><br/>More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops...<br/><br/>In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing.<br/><br/>I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you.</span>

<span>I've only had my computer for a couple of days. I just finished registering it on the ASUS page and got a notice that the 5 yr warranty is expired. This should not be since I just purchased it BRAND NEW. I don't usually give a review until I've used a product for a few months, but I had to warn others of this issue.</span>

<span>Like many of the reviews said, the volume is not very loud, but sound is not something I use my computer for a lot. I have a bluetooth speaker that can give me all the volume I want when I do want it. I think the screen is nicer than what some had described, especially at the price point this computer came in at. Also like many reviews said, the keyboard is not backlit as it is described, unless I'm missing something to turn it on. This was not really a big deal to me, but wish it wouldn't be in the description if it don't have it. Otherwise, I've had it for a few days and am enjoying it very much. For what I paid it seems very fast for my use and a great value.</span>

<span>Okay, so I was hesitant on this laptop because some of the reviews mentioned bad temperatures. I was concerned with getting a laptop with bad thermal paste (which does happen). However, the laptop came super well! Lots of reviewers fail to mention the healthy temperature levels. Idle should be 30-45c. And under full load it should never go past 85c. EVER!!! If it goes past, it's likely it could either be, 1: Bad Thermal Paste/application, 2: Bad Fans, 3:Lack of contact with HeatSinks. 4: Bad Ventilation. If buying new, and the temps aren't matching, exchange it, as shipping can sometimes damage components. Laptops generally require maintenance. If heavy using, 1-2 Years.  Make sure those temps never go past 85c. Over time you will have to replace the thermal paste or fans may give out. Grizzly Kryonaute is the best paste.  Those are very very easy fixes. Just keep that in mind when buying ANY gaming laptop! If you are scared to tamper with it, buy some insurance and send it to acer. (Continuing with the review......)  With poor ventilation I was reaching 85c. I bought a laptop cooler, the IETS with rubber rings. I'm getting incredible temperatures! Never going past 78c! This laptop is very heavy on proper Ventilation. If you look at the design there are a ton of vents from the bottom that push out through the top of the keyboard. S1I think a laptop cooler is necessary if you're gonna be gaming. This thing is incredible.  I'm running games on High/Max settings (Elden Ring, warzone, apex) and getting awesome frames. I upgraded the ram to 32GB and this thing is a work horse. Dual rank 3200 32gb ram will increase your frames by about 15, and more opened tabs!! ;) I also installed a 2tb samsung ssd. (Which I highly recommend you do) It is much easier to install an nvme than the SATA one. So I would recommend getting a m.2 nvme. Opening the back piece for upgrades can be a challenge. There Is a trick to it, and it's likely you will break something if you don't get it right. So don't force it!  So be very careful and gentle when doing it. Use a pick to slowly Pry it open. Pull from the vents back side. The battery can get kinda hot too. So make sure it's in a good spot. You can also set the battery charge level to 80% for longer battery lifespan. That's pretty much it! It's an amazing laptop for the price and power! Bang for your buck! Happy gaming!</span>

<span>I bought this laptop to dip my toes in the water for PC gaming and also to use as a personal PC for emails, browsing the web, etc. I used a separate monitor as I wasn't using this as a mobile gaming set-up. The version I got with the i7 and 3060 laptop GPU was great for warzone. I was able to run well above standard graphics on Warzone at about 100FPS. I never had any issues with overheating, although I did buy a cheap "fan deck" to put the laptop on. The fan isn't quiet, but that is to be expected with any gaming laptop, especially when under stress. I have since bought a full gaming desktop as I realized I did want to fully make the jump from console to PC but I gave this laptop to my wife who plays the Sims and Age of Empires and she has seen HUGE performance boosts compared to her older Asus Nitro 5. Her games run much smoother on this laptop. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get into pc gaming or someone that is looking for a multi-use portable PC. Be sure to check the specs and reviews for the specific model you're buying as Amazon shows reviews for similar pcs with different internal specs.</span>

<span>Had this since January! Absolutely incredible upgrade from my crappy 8 year old Lenovo. Turbo fan speed is an absolute plus. I play League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Stardew, etc. I play with everything set high. LEDs are my fave. Got a fan lapdesk that also has LEDs and it helps a lot with keeping the laptop cool. Great product. Love it.</span>
