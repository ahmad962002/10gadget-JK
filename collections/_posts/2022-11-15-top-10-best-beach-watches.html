<span>This is a Nautica watch.  They are not a traditional watch maker.  However, they sub contracted this out to Timex.  It appears well made.  It is a solar watch.  Works perfect so far.  It is not a dive or sailing watch as it is only water resistant.  This means it will hold up to sweat, rain, and brief amounts of water.  I did wash dishes and forgot it was on and no problem.  However, if you sail and get it wet often I suspect you will eventually have problems.  It is more for the 4th of July picnic at the sailing club.  It looks great.  Sailing flags are bright.  Everything looks sharp in a great way.  As long as you remember it is water resistant and not a 100M dive watch you will love it.</span>

<span>This watch is a great every day watch.  It looks good, keeps good time, and it being solar powered is great.  I have a Seiko that is solar powered that I really like. I bought this one just as a second watch and it has become my everyday watch.  I will never buy another battery powered watch.  I had a used smart watch that I got from a family member.  I felt like I was always charging it, and I really did not use most the functions.  Only one CON: the band is sort of cheap, so I bought a velcro band and it works great.  I would buy it again.</span>

<span>Pleasantly surprised I have to say, good material, it has a nice weight to it. Very clear and seems well put together. Never had a solar watch so it was pretty cool watching it come to life once I went outside. First day I used it for work I quickly got a few compliments.  Only thing is I wish it had a slightly larger case (its 43mm), I can pull it off since I am not the biggest guy but if you have a large wrist definitely look elsewhere. Either way I really like it so far.</span>

This is a new stylish interpretation of Pacific Beach, an iconic watch in Nautica’s assortment. The new design of the dial strengthens the connection with the nautical world, featuring the signature Nautica style flags as indexes. The bi-colored top ring adds a touch of color, matching the red detail on the tip of the second hand. The watch comes in a blue silicone strap that makes it perfect for a casual everyday look.

<span>Beautiful watch. First time I am trying a sport watch and especially with this size. I'm usually wear a thin dress watch with max thick about 10mm and no more than 40mm in case diameter. For reference, my wrist size is 180mm. The description said 44mm in case diameter but  in fact is 46mm and 12.5cm in thickness. If the description said 46mm, I would have not bought it. But since have it on my wrist, I have grown to love it. It has a noticeable weight, the band is of a soft with a bit of stretchable rubber; So it is very comfortable to wear. The dial and band color match perfectly. The hour index and bezel mark are in contrast with the dial color make it very easy to look at. The only thing I wish they make it differently is the bezel, too bad it is not rotate able.</span>

<span>The tool I need when I'm out training over seas. Main use of purposes is for gps. I'm not an LT, so I can find my way..lol but if need be for a quick quick 8 or 10 digit grid look up.its easy and fast. Tracks my running workouts and heart rate when weight training. Wished it had visible maps like the fennix.but grids will do.also one last thing to put out.if you are in a country thats cloudy or its fall-winter season.solar charging is not really good..overall I love it as it was a gift for my bday from the wife..CPL Valdezy🤙</span>

<span>Pretty good watch. Battery life is excellent. It drops a lot faster if you are actually using the workout features, but still pretty good. I wear it almost 24/7 to help track my sleep and heart stuff so the fact that i dont need to charge it everynight like every other smart watch helps.<br/><br/>I went  with the tactical and realized i could have done without all the features in it and saved some money, but FDE is nice...<br/><br/>Solar takes a long time to charge. An 8 hour detail in the sun, bought me a whole extra day of battery life! (Sarcasm). The battery life is awesome, so i could have avoided the solar too.<br/><br/>The garmin software is pretty good to and the training programs and coaches are good too. Just not sure i needed the tactical.<br/><br/>The only complaint i have is the learning curve with using the buttons and navigating the menus. Ive cancelled workouts i dont know how many times halfway through by hitting the wrong button, but it's a small gripe.<br/><br/>If you dont need the bonus features or an obsession with fde, skip the tactical. If you arent taking it to a combat zone where you never have access to a wall outlet skip the solar.</span>

<span>I bought this because I work in construction and needed a smartwatch I could beat to heck without it getting damaged. I didn't want some giant device on my wrist to get caught on whatever may present itself.<br/><br/>This watch certainly fits that bill.<br/><br/>The watch has been beaten up submerged, covered in concrete. You name it. The watch has persevered.<br/><br/>However, there are some drawbacks, which are necessarily a result of it's small form factor.<br/><br/>For us old guys, the text is kind of small. It's also difficult to read in full sun (it's doable, just not great).<br/><br/>My primary reason for getting this was to display text messages. Not even necessarily to respond to them-- just display messages as they arrive so I don't have to dig for/unlock my phone. However, due to the small form factor there is not much text displayed. You can scroll thru, but this is not touchscreen. You have to physically press a button to scroll. It doesn't sound like a big deal as you're reading this, but in practice it's really a pain.<br/><br/>If this were  $200 watch I'd likely buy a different smartwatch with a larger face (face, not case) that has touch and isn't a "rugged" design. However, for the price I will simply wear it until there is some catastrophic failure.</span>

<span>This was the first tactical watch I’ve ever purchased, and it has just blown me away. The battery life is phenomenal, on average I get over 20 days (granted you can get more but I choose to use more features) with moderate use.<br/><br/>It’s highly accurate as well, being able to correctly tell my heart rate, pulse-ox, and even GPS location. At $500 it’s a little pricey, but for what you get it’s highly worth it</span>

<span>What a beautiful and well finished watch! This such a great value, but then Casio is the value king in watches. For the price of a Seiko diver (yeah they are automatic, and Seikos are great) I can have 2-3 Casio Duros - in Black and the gorgeous blue dial finishes. Really happy with this purchase. How does Casio do it?Very happy.</span>

<span>I've only had the watch now for a few days, so this review will stand as an initial impressions statement.  I will, however, return and expand upon my review as time goes on.  You can see this on my Casio W-735H review.  I bought this watch so that I'd have a real diver style watch for our vacation to St. Lucia.  I wanted something that looked and felt the part and could actually take some abuse in the water, but not make me cry if it breaks or I lose it.<br/><br/>Initial impressions: Really beautiful color, I got the blue dial and bezel and it's an extremely deep, gorgeous azure.  The size and heft are perfect for me, I have a 7.25" wrist and this fits perfectly.  Any larger and it would look a little ridiculous.  I'm not normally into polished cases like this one has, but I'm ok with it.  The bezel is hard to turn, but that's actually a design feature.  Dive watches are meant to be uni-directional and you really don't want them just freely spinning, it's meant to track usable oxygen in a tank, after all.  I put mine on a NATO band and it fits the style very well, but I was not prepared for how good the stock bands are, they feel like very decent quality for mass produced plastic.  The operation is silent, I'm sure that's from the density of the case and crystal, but it's totally silent, even when I held it up to my ear, I couldn't hear anything.  I also have no idea how deep I'm going to take this watch, but the 200 meter depth rating instills confidence.  I'll go nowhere near that, but it's still a nice feature.<br/><br/>Gripes:  Almost everything I have an issue with is subject to personal bias based on a design (artistic) choice and will not be applicable to most other people.  First, I don't care for how small the Casio name and the Marlin logo at the bottom is on the dial, not a good use of negative space.  Next, I also wish the lumed indices were slightly larger to help eat into the dial center a little more as well as the date window and number, I feel it's a little small.  Again, a negative space design choice.  I feel if the dial were balanced out just a little better, this would become my favorite daily wear watch.  Very personal, small dings that really only matter to me.  Some things that aren't design gripes?  This thing really does attract fingerprints and it shows them off in all their detail, so I find myself constantly wiping them away.  Also, you can get a pretty bad glare off the crystal unless it's pointed straight at your face.  Lastly, the lume doesn't last very long, maybe 15 minutes before it's pretty well dead.  In perfectly dark environments I'm sure you might still be able to see it, but not in partially lit, but still very dark areas.<br/><br/>Overall impression after just a week:  I really enjoy wearing and looking at this watch, the deep blue color catches my eye and I tilt and turn in the light so that I can see the ultra deep color through the crystal.  And, for what it's worth, it's plenty accurate from what I can tell (quartz watches usually are).  The value for money is just off the charts, even Bill Gates wears one and he can afford like...any watch...company, he can afford a whole watch company, he could afford a bunch of watch companies, multiple factories, the people to make them, stores...and yet, he wears one of these....so yeah....The value is there.  Anyone who wants to get into diver watches should really look at these, give them a try and see if you like the style.  There are also plenty of colors to choose from and lots of NATO straps out there to help complete the look, if that's your thing.  Somehow, this piece manages to have it's cake and eat it to, and then go back for seconds.  It looks amazing, works very well and yet, is so cheap that you wish you bought another one, just for fun.  Other than my design dings, there isn't much to dislike about this watch.  Right about now I wish I'd bought a solar model, but that's only so that I'd never have to change a battery.  I'm also very surprised by the following that Casio has on Reddit.  The Casio subreddit is loaded with people who love their cheap, yet incredibly accurate, amazingly tough and truly capable watches, and now, I'm one of them.</span>

<span>Context. Two months ago, my Timex Ironman died. I like to go sailing, so I needed a new watch. That sent me on an unexpectedly enjoyable journey, exploring my options. After visiting numerous websites run by 'watchies' and reading countless reviews, I settled on the blue Casio Duro. Why?<br/><br/>I had these criteria:<br/>1. Waterproof. Sailing makes this non-negotiable. 200M is just fine.<br/>2. Analog. I'm done with digital watches, that just show me numbers. I find it boring. Call me old fashioned.<br/>3. Accuracy. When I buy a watch, I want it to tell me exactly what time it is. This doesn't go without saying. A watch with an automatic movement easily loses or gains 2 minutes per week. This means that you have to adjust it very regularly (and still manually wind it at least twice a month). Quartz watches are highly accurate, i.e. they lose or gain one to two minutes per year. AND they are much less expensive. So why do people opt for an automatic? What they say is: loving the intricacies of the mechanism, the tradition, and the longevity, passing their watches on to the next generation. Well, my next generation looks at her fitbit or smartphone if she wants to know what time it is, so good luck with that. I suspect the real reason is ......love. True watchies are not satisfied with just looking at their watches; they want to touch them, work on them, play with them. And that is what you HAVE to do with an automatic.<br/>4. Looks. I wanted a fairly large 'dive watch' in my old age. Why? It just appeals to me. I also wanted a simple, uncluttered dial and bezel. The colors of the Duro blue are absolutely gorgeous and always changing. Hues of dark blue early and later in the day, bright royal blue in the sunshine, and black in low light.<br/>5. Price. I needed  a 'beater' watch, i.e. cheap enough that it's OK if it gets badly scratched or lost. To me, that means a max of $100 (although I could be tempted into paying $150, maybe even $200).<br/><br/>After my research, the blue Casio Duro is a clear winner, at an incredibly low price of under $50, with the Orient Kamasu as a more expensive ($176) runner-up. And I look at her fondly at least 80 times per day. Love after all...</span>

<span>I like really like the Blue colour I chose for my second Duro.<br/>But that's about all I like for this particular Duro!<br/>This particular Blue Duro is so uncomfortable on my wrist vs my other new Duro which is just fine. I couldn't figure out exactly why. I suspected the lugs are not well aligned on the horizontal plane, so I flipped both watches over put a plastic rule over them and then ran my fingers along both case edges. Wow, what a difference, this Blue Casio Duro is way sharper all along the case edges. I changed the strap to a softer silicone strap but it is still irritating to wear. The engraving on the Blue Duro case back is far less legible, not nearly as deep or even vs my Green Duro where the engraving is very even, deeper and well executed. I think the case back on this Blue Duro may have been opened at some point because the case's engraving alignment is way off vs my original Green Duro which is perfectly square to the 12o'clock - see the photos attached. Also the bezel has a very tiny burr or nick in it at the 12 o'clock mark, see photo attached - which is almost invisible, but it grabs my finger when touched. For a new watch that is a tad strange. The other marks in there are dirt that I have polished off since I took the pics ( sorry about that ) It will probably be possible to buff that nick out with a soft buffing wheel and fine mesh cloth later. Also its not nearly as accurate good at keeping time vs Green Duro which is remarkably accurate. I set time every day, no need for the Green Duro to be reset its jsust fine. Please note - I do not think any of this is in any way the fault of the seller. At first I thought the watch was a very good copy, but it is the same weight as my original Green Duro at 92 grams. So, this one will now sit in its original box until I decide what to do with it. I may open it up and check the movement later when I modify my Green Duro. At this point it seems I just got a "runt of the litter" Casio Duro. But at the price I paid its not sheep stations, it will make a real beater watch or a gift. Sorry I couldn't be more positive about this one.</span>
