<span>In the first place, I was intended to re-layout my desktop, which was crowded with big bookshelf speakers.<br/>After surveying Audio Engne A2+, I think this is the one I could set on my desk.<br/><br/>The sound of DAC is loud and crystal clear, even when I play music with spotify(PC).<br/><br/>And its bluetooth support up to aptxHD!! although buetooth music is somewhat weaker than usb dac, but the quality is acceptable, I suggest use DAP to connect with A2+, will be much better.</span>

<span>In my younger days, I was a serious audiophile.  I loved spending time listening to music through high-end speakers, every detail.  Later in life, I gave in to Sonos for the ease of having music throughout the house.  I used to have so-so PC speakers.  I've been on a quest to update my workstation (I'm a photographer) and after reading many reviews, I bought the Audioengine A2+ speakers and was impressed from the first second of listening.  It brought me back to my younger days of critical listening.  The highs are so crystalline and clear.  I love these speakers!  Highly recommended...and I'm very picky.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I want to preface this by stating that this review does not come from the account this product was purchased under, rather a family member who shares the account.<br/><br/>BACKGROUND/CONTEXT:<br/>  I owned these speakers for a total of ~8 months.  I had my first pair from July 2021 till about November 2021, which then ended up being replaced with a new pair that I owned till February.  The reason these were in my possession for such a short period of time was because both speakers suffered the same fate of blowing out.  These speakers also blew out at relatively low volumes on my computer (around 50% volume on Windows, and about 50% on whichever streaming application I was utilizing).  Initially, I believed that my first pair had been faulty, so I ordered a replacement; however, the same exact issue occurred on my second pair, so I knew that these speakers were simply problematic for me.<br/><br/>TL;DR: I had these speakers blow out on me twice, which is why I currently do not own them.<br/><br/>FIRST IMPRESSIONS (Build quality and sound profile):<br/>Note:  These were around $260 at the time of purchasing.  These are not my current opinions.<br/><br/>  These speakers were an upgrade from the Creative Sound BlasterX Kratos S5 2.1 Gaming Speaker, which was a muddied and lack-luster 2.1 system.  At the time, however, they were average sounding to me.  I wanted to upgrade to something of the same size profile that had a clearer and fuller profile.  I gravitated toward the A2+, as I believed in the misconception that these were phenomenal sounding high fidelity speakers (They do not claim to be this, but certain reviews of this product facilitated that idea).  I had also seen them on a multitude of setups and thought they fit aesthetic of my own.  Upon opening these speakers, I was surprised by the overall weight of these, as they were relatively small.  The heftiness only contributed to feeling of "premium-ness".  I give props to AE for their absolutely exceptional packaging and inclusion of accessories.  The setup was unique to me, as I had never used speaker wire prior to getting these.  After having connected them to my computer, I was blown away by the sound.  I had never owned "premium" audio equipment, so my only frame of reference was sub-par gaming speakers.  These speakers felt warm, rich, and just overall clean.  I even got to rehash the subwoofer from the old 2.1 system before upgrading to a Klipsch 400W 12" subwoofer (which was very much overkill for 3" desktop speakers).  One thing that I initially really appreciated about the speakers were their very defined mid-range.  Even as someone who was significantly less knowledgeable in audio reproduction, I was still able to appreciate the sound these speakers put out.  I will not go too in depth about bass, as I had only used these speakers without a subwoofer for about a couple hours total, just know that it is fairly average for casual music listening but sub-par if you decide to utilize it for film/bass-dependent music.<br/><br/>CURRENT PERSPECTIVE:<br/>  Disregarding the fact that these had blown out on me, I currently believe these speakers are not worth the absurdly high price.  Although I still believe the mid-range is warm and quite rich, both the low-end and high-end struggle to reproduce sounds nicely.  This leaves you with a speaker that lacks clarity on two very crucial frequency ranges.  Even after the addition of a subwoofer, the lack of EQ options on the speaker do not allow you to setup an appropriate crossfade, which in turn create bass frequencies that cancel.  These speakers still look phenomenal though, and packaging is premium enough to justify a higher price tag, but not $260.  For reference, as soon as I refunded my A2+, I went ahead and purchased a pair of KRK RP5 G4 Studio Monitors for the exact same price (These monitors are also fairly controversial, but I personally really enjoy their soundstage and less colored sound).<br/><br/>WRAPPING THINGS UP (Pros and Cons):<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Spectacular packaging<br/>- Additional cables that allow for multiple ways to connect to a source<br/>- Rich mid-range for small profile<br/>- Premium build quality (hefty with a clean finish)<br/>- Smaller setups will benefit from the size<br/>- Volume does get relatively loud<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Highs are lacking clarity<br/>- Bass is quite average from 90hz to 200hz, anything below that is quite awful without a subwoofer<br/>- The speakers do not do a great job at stereo imaging<br/>- Speakers are impossible to EQ without a 3rd party software<br/>- The price is absurd for over glorified desktop speakers<br/>- Subtle details in music get lost, making these speakers terrible for mixing/mastering (This is not what these speakers are intended for, but it is something to keep in mind)<br/>- Personally, these blew out on me twice at pretty normal listening volumes.<br/><br/>A few notes:<br/>- I do not believe these speakers are horrible, I just think the price you pay for them is not justified.<br/>- I had a quite negative experience with them because they blew out twice, I've never seen that happen to anyone else.<br/>- If you really want something in a small package with a multitude of connection options and a sound that's fine for almost all music genres, I'd probably recommend these if you can get them for cheaper.<br/>- If you are looking for accurate sound, stop looking at high fidelity monitors and take a look at studio monitors.  They tend to be in same price range (or a tad higher) but are much more sonically accurate.</span>

<span>The biggest complaint I read was that these speakers have issues after a few months or the first year. I purchased these 8/25/22 so we will see. aesthetically they look great and the A2+ is exactly what I was looking for in terms of form factor and aesthetics. The sound is pretty good and I would recommend purchasing this if it the speakers hold up. I am no audiophile so I am not sure if its the mids or highs that seems missing. I didn't expect that much bass from this, but it does the job. Slight delay on the bluetooth but nothing that will bother anyone. They can get pretty load without any distortion and if you spend anywhere from $100-200 more there are plenty of options out there with better sound quality, but then again those were precovid prices.</span>

<span>These speakers have a smart appearance and the sound is very clear, sharp and louder than expected with very little distortion. I plugged the USB port into one of the powered charging ports on my power strip. I was not expecting them to be so loud and precise. Very clear, a bargain for the price paid. Perfect for a kids computer but not for a main gaming PC. Gaming PC needs moar RGB!</span>

<span> I've purchased a few audio products from Majority in the past, and have always been very impressed with the premium experience and the strong performance-price ratio. The DX10's are no exception, and with the market for inexpensive desktop speakers saturated by cheaply made no-name products, these are an outstanding option at a very reasonable price.<br/><br/>PACKAGING: The speakers come in clean, well-designed packaging. I'm personally a bit of a sucker for nice-looking boxes, but it's always good to have your first experience with a new purchase start off on the right foot (and good packaging makes for a nicer gift option).<br/><br/>DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: The speakers themselves are an all-plastic construction, but they feel quite sturdy--no creaking or cracking. The design is fairly neutral black, but with a little bit of character in the subtly angled speaker grille, and a few other curved "swooping" accents. They look and feel nice for my desk at home, but certainly would not look out of place in a professional setting either. The Majority branding is simple and not too intrusive, appearing in small font only on the left speaker.<br/><br/>The volume knob turns smoothly, has a satisfying click, and is anchored to the internal mechanism (so the cap won't slide off, like on some cheaper speakers). The legs of each speaker have a pair of thin foam strips to add some friction and prevent sound from reverberating through the desk, so you don't feel your keyboard buzz while audio is playing.<br/><br/>FEATURES: As entry-level desktop speakers, the feature set is pretty simple. The two satellites are tethered, and the rear of the right speaker has the 3.5mm cord and USB connection. As far as I can tell, the USB is used exclusively for power, so the 3.5mm connection is the only option for audio input. However, there is a front-facing headphone jack as a passthrough, so even if your device only has a single 3.5mm connector, you'll still be able to plug in a pair of headphones for quiet listening. The cords are all sufficient length to allow you to maneuver the speakers on a desk freely.<br/><br/>AUDIO PERFORMANCE: Really stellar audio quality. Reproduction of the full spectrum of mids and highs is remarkably good for a basic pair of stereo desktop speakers, with very crisp, clear sound. There are no equalizer settings or audio presets on the speakers themselves, so any tinkering needs to be handled digitally; however, the default soundscape is very pleasing to the ear, and does a nice job with a variety of content, including video calls, dialogue-heavy TV shows and news broadcasts, and music (see my video, in which the vocal and instrumental portions of the track are very cleanly delineated.)<br/><br/>The slight upward angling of the speakers helps to produce a more satisfying and immersive stereo experience. As to be expected for compact desktop speakers, the drivers are a little too small to create potent bass, but there is enough for the low-frequency components of percussion instruments and human voices to sound full and true.<br/><br/>As for output, 10 watts of power is plenty considering the distance at which one typically sits from desktop speakers. That said, if you have a larger space and really want to crank the volume, these are definitely capable of audibly filling a small- to medium-sized room.<br/><br/>OTHER: If you register the product online, the warranty extends to three years. Given their build quality, I would be very surprised if I encounter any issues in that time frame, but a free extended warranty is always nice to have in your back pocket, and adds to the overall premium-feeling experience.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS: Overall, I strongly recommend the DX10's. They provide everything you could possibly ask of compact 2.0 desktop speakers, and simply feel like a higher-end alternative to other basic speakers, while matching or beating them in price. 5 stars for a definite winner!</span>

<span>Speakers use 3.5mm jack for audio input and are powered through USB.<br/>All three cables (USB power, 3.5mm audio, and cable going to the other speaker) come out of the RIGHT speaker and are about 4 feet in length. If your computer is on the left side of your desk consider how you will set up the speakers so that the cables reach.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/> - Cheap<br/> - Look good<br/> - There is space under the speakers to snake through other cables, saving you some desk space<br/><br/>Cons:<br/> - Audio quality is not great<br/> - There is a headphone jack in the right speaker, but it's not usable due to the noise.

R19U is equipped with Edifier's latest 2.75” full-range speaker unit, engineered to deliver wide and detailed sound with just two speakers. Skillfully designed, a subtle 10 Degree tilt not only greatly reduces interference caused by sound reflecting from the desktop but also projects the sound directly at you. The result is more clear, lifelike sound for everyday audio needs.  Manage volume and power on/off with the integrated front control. Less fuss, more fun. With R19U's black wooden enclosure and elegant grey base, Edifier has created a transformative listening experience as well as a stylish addition to any desktop .Setting up R19U is easy. It connects to your laptop or desktop computer with a single USB cable for both power and sound. Fewer cables mean less clutter for your workspace, and it frees up your audio port. Not only can you connect a computer to these high-quality speakers, but the complimentary 3.5 mm AUX cable allows versatility in connecting smartphones, tablets, and game systems for a detailed sound performance.

<span>Update:  Equalizer is a must for this speaker.  I finally turned on the Media Player Equalizer after breaking them in and testing for a few days.  The sound is much richer now.  Before turning on the equalizer, I was 50/50 on keeping the speakers.  Now, I'm definitely keeping them.  I stuck with the 'Home stereo' EQ profile in Media Player.  The other profiles were okay, but weren't my taste.<br/><br/>These are fantastic small desktop speakers for the price!  I wanted small speakers to not clutter my workspace but didn't want to sacrifice sound quality too much.  The Edifier R19U is replacing the Edifier S2000MKIII on the desk.<br/><br/>I first tried living with the built-in speakers in the LG 32UN500-W monitor for a day, but it was very fatiguing to listen to anything with them.  I stepped up and tried the highly rated Sanyun SW208 speakers.  For the price, the SW208 are a hot mess and sounds no better than the built-in monitor speakers.  The next options were between the Edifier R19U and the Micca MB42X/PB42X/RB42.  I’m happy to report after two straight hours of listening to various genre of music, the R19U is perfect for my needs.  Vocals sounds clear.  There’s hint of low end.  They’re not meant to sound as good as the S2000MKIII, but I have no idea how Edifier made such a small speaker sound so pleasing.<br/><br/>I read some reviews about low volume and was initially a little concerned.  However, I read/saw somewhere to plug the USB cable into a USB charger and use the 3.5mm cable for audio input to solve the issue.  I have my PC audio at 80% and the volume dial on R19U at 40% and it’s plenty loud and filling a 14’ x 14’ office.  I tried to turn the volume to 70% and it was way too loud for me.<br/><br/>The only con so far is there is piece of wire behind the non-removable fabric grill of the left speaker.  It's currently sitting next to the port in the image.  I'm not sure where it came from, but hope it's not detrimental to the lifespan of the left speaker.  I’m going to keep the R19U and test them for a week, and hope the small defect can just be ignored.<br/><br/>In summary, if you need good sound in a small package, give the Edifier R19U a try.</span>

<span>Firstly the sound quality. They get plenty loud and decently crisp. There is very little low end, however its good for vocals and audiobooks.<br/><br/>But the best things about them is that it runs off 1 cable. No power cable, no aux, just USB for data(sound) and power. Which is exaclty what i was looking for. They perform better than most soundbar mostly because of the angle and imo has better stereo separation.<br/><br/>That being said, if sound quality is what you are after and don't care about simplicity of 1 cable, then i am pretty sure you can find better speakers for just a few bucks more.</span>

<span>A decent desktop system considering the low price.  Certainly better than the cheaper plastic ones, and for my purposes a $100 Bose wouldn't make that much difference.  Would be nice if the aux input were on the front but I doubt I'll be using it much anyway.  It does benefit from an equalizer, like the Chrome plug-in or the one in iTunes.</span>

<span>Cute little computer speakers that are well worth the $30. Comes with a 3.5mm that I use to take advantage of my motherboard, and I used a usb wall outlet to power it, as with both connectors connected to my computer I had static. Even with the perfect setup, a little hissing can be heard when you max out the volume, but otherwise is inaudible. Most likely sound the same as other speakers in this price range, but I bought them for the looks and I like Edifer as a company overall.</span>

<span>My first exposure to these speakers came after a former boss bought them for several of us in the office to supplement the weak internal speakers of our Dell desktop PCs.  I am a lawyer, and because of COVID we do almost all of our depositions, mediations, and even court hearings by Zoom these days.  That is where these speakers come in clutch.  I liked them so much I bought a pair for my home computer and it is a definitely improvement for my Lenovo Yoga laptop once I created my home office.  These are not Bose $500 speakers, so be realistic, but for watching the occasional movie in your room, playing video games, and watching YouTube clips, this gives me all I need.  If anyone complains because these speakers cannot make your ears bleed then they are just being unreasonable and somehow expected these tiny speakers under $20 to do what a surround sound system does.  Remember, these speakers are not meant to replace your home theater system. Relax. But if you need some decent, clear, moderately loud (for those without ear damage already who will be sitting in front of the computer), you cannot go wrong with these speakers.  Go ahead. Buy them. You won't regret it.  And if you get a defective set, then just return them and get a replacement.  Every product is bound to have some defective examples.  Just exchange and stop being a Karen.</span>

<span>Respectable power and quality for this price of USB powered speakers with the simple volume control and the convenience that comes with USB controlled audio on the computer end. Modern USB-C cable but comes with a type A adapter with was nice since my dock didn't have any other free C ports.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth mode is annoying however as it's easy to accidentally hit the toggle button next to the volume dial and it used the same blue LED color for both regular operation and bluetooth. I thought the speakers or cable had failed before realizing that the flashing blue means it's in bluetooth mode. The LED is also capable of displaying green which it uses to signify that it's in low power mode but it would be better to clearly have different colors based on the mode of operation.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity plugged it into a phone(Pixel 6) to see if it would power the speakers and it played audio perfectly, albeit in low gain mode.</span>

<span>I recently acquired a retired all in one POS touchscreen terminal from work for free. I put Linux on it and use it as a side computer/tablet hybrid. It had no speakers so I snagged these up for under $20. I expected sub par sound from these USB powered speakers....<br/><br/>I turned them on, turned them up, played a song and I was blown away. The mid-range is a little heavy, but the bass is GREAT for something this small (they have subwoofers in the backs). Treble isn't incredible, but it's not bad by any means. I would have been happy with something 1/3rd this quality for that price. I didn't expect to be using these for anything but basic Linux usage/web browsing/etc but due to the quality of the sound I'm finding myself using my side computer as a Jukebox, lol.<br/><br/>If you're worried about how these perform considering the ridiculously low price, don't be.

<span>I'm a musician and definitely an audiophile(r) for sure, listening to mostly metal, yet all types of music, from 70's, 80's pop/rock/Jazz/Prog, some 90's etc. I had a pair of Altec Lansings last for about 14 years, then finally go bad this year. So I wanted something similar. I read these were the best in the class of desktop speakers and watched all of the youtube videos about them. I wanted great clarity, without TOO much bass, though I use Windows Media player and just use the equalizer on it. These things for $44 dollars just knock it out of the park/and then some. Super loud, just enough punchy bass from the subwoofer and GREAT clarity. Though that also depends on what your listening to and how it was produced. They don't sound muffled at all like others I've used. I mostly use a Jam Heavy Metal Bluetooth speaker for my laptop and it's also amazing for cheap. Had it for 2 years. So with these, I'm set. Should buy another pair just to have 10 years from now when they won't be around anymore for purchase!! ha. Love music? Clear loud sound, and just "enough" bass? Get these. Don't waste hundred on other brands. As most have said these have no right to sound this good at this low price!!</span>

<span>I wasn't sure they'd do the job. But they have a very clear and strong sound. The bass is good, but you only really notice it when playing a movie or music. For the price, they're a great little speaker, and they match my MacBook Pro, perfectly. I read a lot of comments about the blue LED light had no off switch, so you could not be turn them off. First of all; it is such a tiny bit of light (not a light-show). Second; contrary to what some people complained, it will not keep you up at night. And if that tiny bit of blue light does bother you, just pull out the USB plug, and the speakers (and light) are turned off (easy solution)! These speakers a definitely a 4-5 Star out of 5.</span>

<span>Based on previous reviews I decided to try these.  I love the small size and the sound quality is really good as others have stated.  My previous speakers were much bigger and had the on/off switch and volume on the speaker.

<span>These are better than I though they were going to be.  The sound and volume are far above average at this price point.  The compact size easily allows them to slide under most PC monitors.  There is ample wire to allow for differnet placements on a table or desk and the LED lights on the bottom are subtle and not annoying.  The only con is the volume control which is part of the wire rather than built into the speaker.  In a laptop/tablet situation it may be more accessible but for a PC it is better to wrap it around the base of the speaker; so that it does not slip behind the desk.  That aside you can do far worse at this price point and probably a selection of speakers in the $30 range.</span>

<span>I wanted to get some new computer speakers for work and I found these.  I was a little skeptical of the price because I'm so used to the "you get what you pay for" mentality; however, they are for work so I went with it.  I just plugged em in tonight and I have to say, they are not bad at all.  Right out of the box, I noticed they were a little heavy, which is a good thing as I was reassured that they weren't just garbage and they won't be gliding across my desk or falling over all the time.  They are small and not in the way of anything, and they are really loud without compromising sound (currently listening at 25 / 100).  Bass and treble are as good as you'd expect a some computer speakers to be.  The sound won't and shouldn't compare to speakers from audiophile categories.. they weren't designed for that.  If you are looking for cheap, simple, small, and just practical computer speakers for work or school then these are pretty great!  Added bonus, there is a volume control switch attached to the USB / AUX wire (both connections needed)....just incase you'd rather manually control the volume rather than hitting the volume on your desktop.</span>

<span>generic audiophile here. decent sound for the price. got these for my remote work from home desktop setup. bass is more than i expected. does sound tinny, but work with your preference of an equalizer and you're golden. would buy again for a work laptop, help me hear video conferences for work, plus better than expected sound from online surfing. yep, would recommend and buy again if needed. definitely not my 200 watt 2.1 setup, but that's expected for this low price. &lt;3</span>

<span>I looked up what songs to listen to for a decent appraisal of the speakers. Here is the you tube title:<br/>"our-8-favorite-songs-to-use-to-test-headphones-and-speakers" Very interesting evaluation. Good learning tool.<br/>Anyway, my "Dell S2721D" is a great monitor. The sound is utter trash. 1.1 speaker rating. Mice running over the carpet make more noise. Thus these "Cyber Acoustics 62W 2.1 Stereo Speaker with Subwoofer"<br/>I already have a GREAT sound system hooked up to my computer. I simply plugged this set, the 3.5 mm standard jack, into my monitor. (these is a jack in the monitor specially for this type of device)<br/>I can turn the volume down to where the monitor speakers can barely be heard but the CA 3610s but still strong. This is how I evaluated the speakers. Now to it:<br/>The cables are thicker than systems 15/20 years ago. The length between the dual 2” satellite is about 3 to 4 feet per speaker. Same with the woofer. Same with the puck. I used bread ties on every line. In other words, there is plenty of length for ANY SIZE ROOM.<br/>The twin tweeters are OK. Nothing to write home about. But they are as clear and as loud as you need. You will never max out the sound....unless its party time with your friends. The big gun is the 5.25" subwoofer. Booming sound. Even my "civilization 3" game sounds super. It really makes this system a joy to listen to.<br/>The puck (central control) is very interesting. Volume for 2" tweeters, a second volume just for the barking woofer. Add a on/off switch to the puck and all is great.<br/>Warning: The puck is the weak point. If I can glue it down I will. One web site took apart the CA 3602, a 2008 older version. The connections are crap. Every element looks like crap. These speakers are 2017, a much newer version. Still, made in Chine...sigh.<br/> The system WILL NOT LAST if you kick it around several times a day. Treat it well and I'm sure it will last.<br/>If the system contained decent midrange speakers it would be a 9.9. As it is I still give it a 8+ rating.<br/>Again the meat is the subwoofer. Turn it down 50% and you will get clarity and still retain heart stomping sound.<br/>The value of paying $45 on sale marked down from $50 is over the top one of the best deals you can find anywhere. Don't bother with $150 Bose. This system is all you need.<br/>Enjoy, Bob</span>

<span>The sound quality of these speakers (especially the sub-woofer) really surprised me! For this price, I didn't expect this much OOMPF!! The sound card and speakers on my all-in-one desktop leave a LOT to be desired. When turned ALL THE WAY UP, you couldn't make out what was being said on a video, and music? Forget about it. But these speakers REALLY changed all that. Easy install, takes up minimal room on my desk, and excellent sound for the price. RECOMMEND!!</span>

<span>Bass is more than enough, especially in a room corner. Only rolled it up about 1/4 on the bass knob.  The 1/8” jack is angled, nice.</span>

<span>Moved to a tiny desk without room for my speakers, and didn't realize how lost I would be without sound. I was looking for something compact and inexpensive that would still do the job. This speaker is awesome, really.  Soinds great with lower volume seaking, or  goes bog and loud for music.  Having the mute and volume buttons onboard is a bonus, as is the clip.  I clip it to the top of my laptop, but let it just sit under my desktop monitor.</span>

<span>I typically use headphones with my PC, but when I get sick of them I'll run built-in monitor sound. Monitor speakers are underwhelming to say the least, they don't get very loud and sound very tinny. At the cost of the CA-2890 I figured it was worth a shot. I'm able to plug the USB speaker into the monitor itself to keep the layout clean. As others have mentioned - it has to be a very specific monitor that you clip this to. My bevels are too small and the back of the monitor is not flat so I can't mount it to that. Fortunately, my desk has an overhead horizontal bar that this nicely clips to.<br/>As far as the sound quality, it is certainly more full and bassier than anything I could get out of my monitor, but it's not quite at the level of 'sound bar' or portable bluetooth speaker in the $~100 range.<br/><br/>Overall I'd absolutely recommend as an upgrade to monitor speakers, and the volume/quality is surprising for being USB powered.</span>

<span>Just got it and seems to work. Wasn't expecting much for the price as I wasn't looking for anything fancy.<br/><br/>Other reviewers were right- the blue light is too bright. Looks like the goal was to burn your retina to pieces. I'll be putting a small piece of paper over it so it shouldn't be a problem.<br/><br/>Only other nit is packaging.

<span>I do like these, they do what they’re supposed to and for the price point have really nice sound quality. I would not use them for gaming, though.

I had to cover it with not one, not two, but three stickers just to dim it, and it is still bright.</span>

<span>It’s decent for the price you pay for. It goes up louder than I thought and it’s alright. The quality isn’t amazing and you hear a soft static BUT I am content with the sound. However, stay far away if you’re an audiophile or care even a little bit about quality. If you do, save up your money and buy other speakers! Besides the sound quality, it lands between light and heavy in weight. They don’t go super far apart from each other so it was a little hard to figure out how to set them up on my desk but I managed to figure it out. Rather average overall, but the price was exactly what I had and it does its job.</span>

<span>Using the speakers in my RV to replace the factory soundbar. The RV soundbar sound quality is very poor. The Logitech is a big improvement with clarity of TV audio. I hooked to the earphone output of the RV television so the volume control on the TV operates the Logitech speakers. Bass is not great but as I'm watching TV in an RV, I was happy with the sound quality and limited bass. I have a larger Logitcech 2.1 system I've used before that has a subwoofer that has great bass, but it's too large to use in the RV as it takes up space for the subwoofer. I prefer this simpler Logitech speaker system for my RV application. Takes up very little space and produces good quality sound for TV watching.</span>
