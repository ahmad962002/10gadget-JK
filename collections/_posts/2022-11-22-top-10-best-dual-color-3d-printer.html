<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I've only had it for a couple hours but have already printed several things on it. It was incredibly easy to set-up, though the instructions were a little unorganized. The FlashPrint software is super user friendly and the print quality if amazing. I can say much about longevity yet or reliability, but my first impressions are that this thing is DEFINITELY 5 stars.<br/><br/>UPDATE #1: After 2 days of pretty continuous use, I discovered one major flaw in the filament feeding system. It doesn't line up well with the feeding tubes and has a tendency to bind up and prevent feeding (had multiple prints fail after several hours of printing, which is super frustrating). That said, I only docked it 1 star, because there are several solutions available in the form of filament guides on Thingiverse, you just have to make sure to watch the printer closely for the few hours it takes to print the guide. Once the guide is in place, it solves the feeding issues. (one of the best things about a 3D printer is that you can use it to make solutions to most of it's own problems). Overall, the print quality is still excellent. I haven't gotten to test it in dual extruder mode because it only came with one filament (I thought it was supposed to come with 2), but I have a few more on order so I will update once I've tried multiple colors and filament brands.<br/><br/>UPDATE #2: So, I've had some feedings issues with certain filament but I'm not sure if that is the machine or the filament. I've also tried the dual extruder mode, which is super finicky but once you get it down, it's pretty great. I'll leave it at 4 stars, because after troubleshooting and experimenting it still works well.</span>

<span>If you’re not handy with computers, or are a tinkerer at heart, this may not be the machine for you.  I do like this machine, though it may not seem like it from some of the following comments.  These comments are mainly given in the hope that improvements will be made to the supporting materials.<br/><br/>I was looking at the Creator Pro and when I decided to pull the trigger, it was not available. The FlashForge site showed that the Creator Max was new the replacement for the Pro, and was a step up – hence the extra $150.  So I ordered one here on Amazon.<br/><br/>I received the machine, and performed the initial assembly and bed levelling.  I then copied a model that I had sliced with FlashPrint onto the provided SD card. I then discovered that the SD card reader was not functional.  After several emails to customer support, their solution was to send a new motherboard.  I suppose this was to save shipping a new Max, and return shipping mine.  But that meant I had to disassemble the bottom half of the machine to replace it.  In the end, it would’ve been better for everyone had they just replaced the printer.<br/><br/>FF customer support is quick to respond, I give them kudos for that.  But they do assume a good deal of technical savvy on the part of the customer, and if they don’t have the answer, they need to check with their engineering team (in China it seems).<br/><br/>In the meantime, I thought I’d test the printer using WiFi.  The print came out great, but it was completely stuck to the provided “sticker” on the plate.  Going back to the user manual, there was nothing about how to free a build from the plate.  Really?  And why is there not a decent plate provided?  After much searching on YouTube, and trying several different methods, I settled on a glass bed (purchased separately on Amazon) coated with AquaNet.  As long as you put the plate in the freezer for a few minutes (once it cools down from printing), the print falls off the glass.  A little up front guidance from FF would’ve been greatly appreciated here!<br/><br/>One of my reasons for purchasing this machine was the dual extruder so that I could print different filament types that require a different nozzle size.  So I purchased some nozzles, and again returned to the user guide for help with how to replace a nozzle.  Nothing.  I went to the FlashForge site.  Nothing.  Great.  I returned to YouTube and found several videos including the one from FF.  OMG. You have to completely disassemble the print head to replace a nozzle.  Really?  Why, if you *know* that customers will eventually have to replace a part, would you not design it to be easily replaced?  Not only that, but once reassembled, you need a balancing block to make sure the two heads are exactly level with each other.  This part is not available for sale!  Wait, what - really?  You have to go to Thingiverse, find one that some random person designed and print it on your printer.  Wow.  If your machine is torn down, how are you supposed to print a part?  And trust that the random person did it correctly!  So I was forced to devise another way to balance the nozzles.  This process needs to be much, much simpler!  C’mon FlashForge!  You can do much better!  How about a simple bolt that allows Z adjustment of the head plus using gravity?  And a written step-by-step?  That is not too much to ask.<br/><br/>Oh, and on the topic of YouTube videos, there are none (at least yet) for the Max.  For the print head disassembly, it’s not exactly the same as the Pro.<br/><br/>I went to try wood filament (once I had replaced the nozzle) and realized that the reel holder was not long enough to support the wide reel.  Well crap, back to Thingiverse. I didn’t see one I liked so I designed one and printed it – a 10 hour print job.  It printed well and functioned well.  The printer did a good job with the wood filament after all the work of replacing the nozzle and making a new reel holder.<br/><br/>I got the replacement motherboard, and again, no instructions anywhere, only YouTube videos. There were a few problems following installation, in that the Z direction was reversed and there was an error on the TF card.  Turns out there was no TF card in the replacement MB, and even installing new firmware from FF didn’t solve the problem.  After 2.5 weeks of back and forth with customer support, I finally gave up and exchanged it on Amazon for a new Max.  If they had just sent a new unit up front, it would have saved me lots of time disassembling and reassembling the printer, and lots of their time trying to diagnose why it wasn’t working.  A win for everyone…<br/><br/>For a machine that approaches $1,000 in cost, you may not expect it to be Push ‘n Print like an Industrial grade printer, but you shouldn’t have to rebuild half the machine for every maintenance or upgrade task, that you do expect with a low end machine.  That’s my opinion anyway.<br/><br/>I have received the new Max and it is functioning well so far.  I expect that it will continue do so!<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>Machine – Very good.<br/>Customer support – Also very good, but they may not initially have the answer. They should be more willing to solve a defect problem in way that doesn’t create extra work for everyone.<br/>Availability of user information – Almost non-existent. Mainly, only user videos are available.<br/>Ease of maintenance/upgrades – Difficult.  Don’t expect to do anything without lots of up front digging for info.</span>

<span>I was very excited when the new creator max went for sale, hoping it might be the ideal prosumer intermediate printer we have been waiting for that would build on the best features of contemporary printers like Dreamer , Creator Pro &amp; Adventurer. Unfortunately the printer was a huge disappointment in this regard, the print quality is about the same as Creator Pro. It seems like a slightly refreshed version of the former, so it won't be worth upgrading for minor bells and whistles. The printer is quite noisy, and it was astounding a 2020 Pro model doesn't even have a detachable print bed, or auto leveling, and subpar setup/assembly experience. It's really doesn't justify the premium price.</span>

<span>I printed some fun things and my kids enjoyed it. My biggest issue was that the platform isn’t removable, and as a result it requires frequent leveling which is not automatic. I had a number of prints start ok but before long the extruded is dragging across already printed areas pulling it up. The idea of the dual extenders was great but I didn’t really do any multicolor prints.<br/>I returned this for an adventurer3</span>

<span>bought this wonderful thing bout a month ago it is amazing any negative review is coming from people who clearly do not understand what they purchased in terms of a 3d printer and probably should not get into 3d printing it is pretty much plug and play and once you mess with it a little you can do some amazing things the only problem is the shoddy filament you get from flashforge not the best but works for all you folks who feel forced to stick with the filament from flashforge there is no need you can download some extended spool holders for normal 1kg spools i ordered three 1kg spools from hatchbox they have great color selection and price is great plus awesome reviews just like the dreamer and creator pro. research any other 3d printer on amazon and you find they all suffer from the same problems the only difference is that the dreamer and creator pro has more reviews with way less negative than positive and most of the positive reviews still mention the minor things that go wrong with any 3d printer except the other ones tend to fail more often even when they may have a decent amount of reviews unless your building your own 3d printer or spending way more for the same set of problems just reduced the is the best bet for the money check out youtube or any other community thats not just one company and you will find that the dreamer and creator pro are typically preferred over most other consumer level printers. the customer service through amazon with mr. tang is excellent you should have a problem getting help or anything else you need from him just remember the 12 hour time difference and factor that in when expecting an email , late night emails almost always will be answered when you wake. back to the filament which i see lots of good reviews list as the only drawback making the cost to use more expensive if you do not wish to print the extensions which can be screwed in the place of the originals you build your own cheap spool holder out of spare wood or pvc pipe and fittings and run any size spool or brand of filament through either side of the printer its come with 2 grilles one for each side that has slots in them you run filament right through there and to the feeding tubes which lead to the extruders so you leave the filament that comes with it in it and have 1 of whichever size and brand filament  coming in through the side grilles which negates the complaints and you can get good bulk filament for cheaper i like hatchbox filament the price is right and i works great and is well reviewed all around not just on amazon and to anyone looking to get one please go to youtube and search for flashforge dreamer you will be impressed you can also search thomas james he has lots of dreamer videos i suggest watching them all for future knowledge and ease of use i do not know him but i found his videos by searching for flashforge dreamer and that sealed the deal for me plus he has cool aussie accent when he says dreamer you will also find some mods in the videos they will greatly increase your printers potential and you can see whats possible also you be learning about the different slicers the ones that come with dreamer are good but simplify 3d is the best i have seen for the dreamer really makes a difference in what you can do i will be getting that program soon but it is not needed the printer comes with everything you need when it arrives plus there was just an update to software and firmware which makes it that much more proficient once again this printer is amazing i love it have made at least 25 different things so far there are tons of sites to download models to print thingiverse myminifactory and lot of others that i cant remember at the moment enjoy your future purchase here are some pics of thors hammer i printed in black and red abs from hatchbox oh and my punctuation is horrible i know . :)</span>

<span>This is my first 3D printer, and was selected because I wanted a novice-friendly printer for someone who's all thumbs when it comes to assembly.  I've been through most of the two spools it shipped with and have had very few problems.  Using "rafts," I have had little problem with "bacon" and the only couple of hairballs I've printed are down to me making stupid mistakes.<br/><br/>OOBE:<br/><br/>Pleasant surprises here<br/><br/>1) The guide stresses that you should set the voltage switch on the power supply.  Couldn't find it.  there wasn't one.  Had an EE look, and he told me that the power supply looks upgraded from what's in the manual.  It's now voltage sensing, or at least has been working fine.<br/><br/>2) the manual says it comes with printer tape for the print bed.  Actually, it came with three of those blue bed stickers, the first already installed.<br/><br/>3) Cute little toolkit with a couple spare parts in it.  And includes more than what you need for assembly, including a putty knife for levering finished prints off the bed.  And, a little knife that you can use to stab your hands and fingers multiple times while trying to remove the raft from a print.<br/><br/>4) Bed leveling was trivial<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1) Doesn't take a full-sized 1kg filament roll.  Head to thingiverse for multiple solutions to that problem<br/>2) Seems to have referred to adjusting four filament guides, but there are only two.  Doesn't seem to make much difference<br/>3) The assembly (installing extruder assembly and fan duct) was beyond my meager hardware skills, resulting in me dropping a nut into the innards, requiring removal of the bottom plate for recovery.  I should have sold tickets.<br/>4) one of the built-in test models (provided on the SD card) is a 2-filament (2 color) mini traffic cone.  No raft, so I got bacon on my first print.<br/>5) It took me about 85 tries to get the PLA filament loaded correctly so it would actually extrude (see above reference to me having a rusty thumb).<br/>6) with no prior experience with printers, I can't say whether I really don't like this printer's PLA print quality, or if I just don't like PLA print quality from any printer.  Way too rough.  I've been printing mostly using ABS, which anyone with experience will know can lead to other issues.  So far, I've been lucky or the printer has been that good<br/>7) The vertical axis makes a horrible squealing noise<br/><br/>One of the things that's prevented me from buying a printer before now is knowing that I'm really not a tinkering type, and I've been put off by the DYI feel of a lot of other printers.  This is why I selected the Dreamer over the Creator, for instance.  I also wanted a dual extruder printer without having to go into bankruptcy, so it's nice to see the prices have come down considerably.<br/><br/>As a first-time printer user and first-time printer purchase, this far exceeded my expectations.  But, it still gets dinged one star because of the filament spool size issues.  Seems like taking .6 Kg spools is just a way to force you to buy their in-house brand without resorting to DRM.  And, I should have sold tickets to the spectacle of me trying to install newly printed spool mounts.<br/><br/>But, I've been through the initial spool of ABS that came with the printer, and am about 2/3 through the PLA spool.  The printer has been running nonstop since I got it, and the results have been mostly successful.<br/><br/>I am VERY happy with this printer<br/><br/>Update: one year later<br/><br/>Over the last year, I have found a few shortcomings with this printer.  One is that the left hand extruder (default for PLA) jammed, over and over again.  Another is bed adhesion: either not enough or too much.  And, if you made the mistake as I did in scraping the old bed covering off with a metal putty knife with the power on, you run a very real risk of shorting out a board that's going to cost $100 to replace.<br/><br/>Most of all, for all the disassembly/reassembly I had to do to replace the motor driver board and unjamming the extruder, it's just not a very easy machine to work on.  Throw in the usual disadvantages of dual extruders (one extruder lays down a layer, the other comes along and knocks it over) and my year of ownership ended in frustration.<br/><br/>But two months into the ownership of my second printer has pointed out one very important positive aspect of this printer that really shouldn't be overlooked:  It makes it stupid easy to print PLA.  Why?  Because the heated bed can actually reach 100+C in a reasonable amount of time.  Because it's a completely enclosed printer.  Not just passively enclosed: there are fans to keep it from getting too hot inside.<br/><br/>I have printed several spools of ABS and had a minimum of the normal problems you expect with ABS.  Seeing all kinds of ludicrously priced printers that you can buy that are not fully enclosed (much less temperature regulated), and you start seeing what a gem this printer can be.<br/><br/>Not only capable, but pretty decent print quality, too</span>

<span>Only about 5 days in.....<br/><br/>I have had a CR 10 for about a year.  It's a good printer, but I was interested in something that was easier for the beginner and just always worked correctly.  Well, I can't say that is true, but when people say 3D printing is a love-hate relationship, believe it.<br/><br/>First, if this is your first printer, I think it is a good purchase.  It solves some of the initial things that take time.  Most notably leveling.  While I really wanted a printer with auto bed leveling, I decided the dual extruder was a good trade-off.  I'm glad I did, bc the size of the bed and their easy bed leveling almost replaces the desire.<br/><br/>Which I guess brings me to the first con for me.  Most people won't care about the build volume, but I use this to make a product, so sometimes the CR10 comes in handy.  My product doesn't have much height, but I can get more than 100% on a CR-10 in the same print.  Again, most people won't need this, and it is def big enough for most things.<br/><br/>So I unboxed it, and plugged it in.  Right away I loaded up some ABS to do a test print.  I grabbed something from Thingaverse and leved the bed.  sliced it in Flashprint using all standard settings, and hit print.  It came out pretty darn well.  On my CR10 it took me weeks to get this type of quality.<br/><br/>Next I went to my product, which is made from TPU.  There wasn't a preset for TPU in the slicer, but there was one that said Dreamer Flexible.  I tried it and..... fail.  It wasn't sticking to the bed, and the movement of the nozzles to print were not what I was expected.  No worries at all, all I did was email their support.  Which brings me to the reason I think you should buy this machine......<br/><br/>Their support was amazing.  Quick responses.  Easy to understand.  Solved my issue.  (It seems that the Dreamer Flexible might have a bug in it).  The support not only showed me how to fix it, both written and in a video, but actually took my stl and made a gcode himself.  Above and beyond.<br/><br/>There are many other pros to this machine, and I am glad I spent the extra money getting this one then just another creality.  This by far is my favorite machine to use and honestly to have in my office.<br/><br/>Will definitely buy other things from Flashforge.</span>

<span>Serious love affair for this printer, unfortunately I got a bad one.<br/><br/>Extruders not in same plane and no amount of shimming resolved the issue.  Wrong parts in the bed leveling assembly, leveling would not hold. USB connection dropped frequently.  Old docs came with the unit.<br/><br/>As a one extruder unit it worked well, but I bought it for the dual.<br/><br/>Took one star off for getting a bad machine  added it back for the exceptional service by Mr. Tang.<br/><br/>Once this one is credited, I'll be ordering another.  Hopefully this time I won't get one made on a Friday or Monday :).<br/><br/>Amazon and Mr. Tang made this experience FAR better than it could have been.<br/><br/>Edit:  In case you are wondering why I gave the unit 5 stars after all the problems and frustrations.  The unit itself is decent as reflected by all the positive reviews.  Amazon made it good when they really didn't have to and the support from Mr. Tang was what customer service should be and rarely is.<br/><br/>Being an engineer, I know that these kinds of things do happen from time to time, what makes all the difference is how it was handled all around, for that I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Will be ordering another now :-) and am more than reasonably sure I won't have these problems a second time.<br/><br/>Edit 2:  I was right the second is stellar and I have been printing all sorts of needed goodies with EXCELLENT results.<br/><br/>A couple of VERY minor problems.  Bed tramming didn't hold well but Tang sent me a set of replacement springs and hardware and that seems to be holding quite nicely.<br/><br/>Suggestions:  Get a dial indicator and mount for it off Thingverse (Flashforge one for Creater pro works just fine), and magnets to fit.  Mou night have to drill it out slightly to get the dial indicator shaft to fit, but that is trivial.  Makes tramming the bed much, MUCH easier to record to value after you have trammed it with the blue card.<br/><br/>There are a number of useful mods for the Dreamer on Thingverse.<br/><br/>I'm looking at printing some replacement spool mounts that might allow Hatchbox sized spools internally, report to follow.  If this doesn't work, there is an item on Thingverse to raise the cover and keep dust and such out which will also help with keeping the interior warm and free of breezes which helps.<br/><br/>If you have to leave the top open to feed full sized spools, a cleaner / lubricator has been recommended.  It was also said that a couple drops of mineral oil in the cleaner sponge helps too.  Plenty of spool holders on Thingverse.<br/><br/>Linux software leaves a bit to be desired but they are working on this.  I did purchase Simplify3D and am happy with that but still learning it.  Recommended :-).<br/><br/>I've been using the Hatchbox filament I found here on Amazon with excellent results.<br/><br/>Throughout it all Tang continues to be amazing, just wish all my customer service experiences were half as good.  Amazing man, fast response and totally knowledgeable about the unit.<br/><br/>Get one, you'll love it.  Not quite a Startrek replicator but I am more than pleased especially after all the horror stories I have read about a lot of the other printers out there.<br/><br/>About all I would like to see in a similar unit would be a greater build volume and auto bed tramming (AKA: leveling).<br/><br/>Yep, very pleased with the unit and especially so with Tang.</span>

CEL Robox 3D Printer Robox is a 3D printer that combines the best next-generation features at a fraction of the cost. Designed totally from scratch with performance in mind, it's an exciting and much-anticipated model. But it's not just hype - CEL has delivered a truly stunning product at an equally attractive price point. Precision Creating objects that are accurate to the software model requires extremely precise motion and the highest resolution possible. All Robox motors and axes are attached to a single stainless steel frame which is a reference surface for all motion; this is rigidly attached to injection molded parts which form the body of the printer to create a super-stable platform. Additionally, the Robox boasts a surreal 20 micron maximum layer resolution, allowing for the smallest details to be created flawlessly. The nozzle valve system created by CEL cuts off filament completely, eliminating ooze and contributing to a much smoother surface finish - meaning less time spent on finishing work. Forward-Focused CEL uses powerful custom-designed stepper motors in the Robox, meaning that your printer won't become obsolete just because there's an updated head available - the motors are equipped to handle it. SPECIFICATIONS: Print Technology; Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF); Build Volume: 210x150x100mm/8.3x5.9x3.9in; Best Layer Resolution; 20 microns; Filament Diameter; 1.75mm+/-0.05mm; Nozzle Diameters; 0.3mm (0.012") and 0.8mm (0.031"); Material Compatibility; PLA, ABS, HIPS, Nylon, PC, PVA; Internal Lighting; Full RGB; Print Bed: Tapeless Heated Polyetherimide; Power Requirements; 100-240VAC, 50-60Hz; connectivity USB 2.0.

<span>Ok,<br/><br/>So I have had my Robox for a week now. I can say I'm very impressed.<br/>I have to admit I bought it on amazon just to have the option of returning it, since I read mixed reviews, and in general there is still not much real world info on this printer out there.<br/><br/>The intention of this review is to be as objective as possible, but to be honest I'm already in love and printing like a kid with a new toy.<br/><br/>After using it EXTENSIVELY this week I can tell you that the SW and FW upgrades on the last few months have done their job.<br/>The printer just works.<br/><br/>I've used other printers before, (stratasys profesional, makerbot, printrbot, etc...), but this is the first one I own.<br/>I wanted something fast for fun, yet precise enough to prototype my engineering work. I did not want to fidget with it too much, and I wanted to be able to teach my wife to use it, without having to earn an engineering degree.<br/><br/>I got everything I wanted.<br/><br/>I have done side by side comparisons on THE SAME MODEL printed on Form 1, Makerbot, and Robox. Of course the laser Form 1 does not present evidence of layering, but the actual dimensional accuracy of the parts was tighter on the Robox on both the Normal and Fine settings.<br/>The layer quality is better on the Robox than any other printer I've used. If you print on fine you can barely see it's there.<br/><br/>Be aware that Draft is just that... Quality is decent, but it does sacrifice a lot of detail. That being said, I use this mode the most. It is super fast and usually good enough. Then, if all is well, I do the print on the desired quality.<br/><br/>Again, quite impressed. Kudos to CEL.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend buying this printer.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, robyneil's review here on amazon of this item is a MUST READ, it'll save you a lot of worrying. Follow that, and like me, you will have absolutely no issues.</span>

<span>After having this printer for 1 week now, I am sorry to say that it is no longer functional.  I purchased this printer because it had the highest resolution "20um" utilizing a 0.3mm and a 0.8mm dual nozzle head assembly.  The dual head is a little misleading because at first impression you would think that you can use to materials at the same time.  But that is not the situation with this printer.  You can only use one material at a time.  The dual nozzle allows you to have the larger nozzle printer fill volume and it uses the 0.3 nozzle for printing the perimeters with finer detail and control.  At first I would give this printer a 5 star for their ingenuity, however, reliability and support forces me down to a two star.<br/><br/>Problems that I have found with this printer are listed below:<br/>1.  When printing objects that go to the high limit of the Z axis, causes problems with the homing sequence on the next print.  I.E.  The printer drives the head into the body of the machine and you can hear the motors grinding.<br/>2.  Door interlock - After printing, the bed does not always go far enough forward to release the door lock.  You can not do a home because your part is still inside of the printer and the head will have a potential to crash into the part and then bind the entire system up.  I believe that there is no position feedback on any of the axis, so it tends to loose position and because of that the door can not open.<br/>3.  Advertise that you can use Nylon and Polycarbonate as well as HDPE, however they provide no spools for this.  One of the other reasons I bought this printer is because I want to run nylon material.  Since they don't sell the nylon spools, I did not want to take a chance on putting a standard spool into the printer.<br/>4.  Material wiper sucks - At the start of every print, the system will eject material out of the fine nozzle "0.3mm" and the out of the course nozzle "0.8mm".  If the material does not stick to the very edge of the bed, then it will fall into the Y axis motion track!  I don't know why they did not put a small plate at this end of the printer to catch the material.<br/>5.  Advertise a true "dual head" - They advertise a true dual head in which you can print with two materials, however they currently do not have any such head available.  They don't offer the dual spool holder either.  Apparently it is a "future" enhancement.<br/>6.  Support is difficult - At $1500 cost of a printer, I would expect support to be a quick turn-a-round.  I have read other people complain about having issues with the print head and that they had to "pay" for the shipping to return the print head over to England in order to get a replacement head.  Really!!!!! This is an expensive printer and the owner has to pay for shipping on defective parts, to an overseas company!  Thank goodness for Amazon returns!!!!!<br/>7.  Ability to change mater mid build is not user friendly and problematic at best.<br/>8.  Small Z build height.<br/>9.  They claim that the reason for using "their" smart reels is to have better control over the material quality to prevent jams,  well that is a load of crap!  After the first 20 hours on the supplied white PLA, the material would not feed.  The extruder feed would just grind and grind.  I changed out the white PLA to the supplied green ABS and I could printer for another 20 or 30 hours and then, it would not feed as much volume through the printer and the material got thinner and thinner on the printer surface.  Eventually I could not print at all.  I could not use the remaining PLA and I could not use the ABS.  The spools was still more than 3/4 full.  When I tried to put the white PLA back in after the green ABS stopped printing, the extruder feeder would just grind at the material and refused to feed it.<br/>10.  The extruder feed can not keep up with the print speed.  I tried to run the printer at higher speeds, 40mm/s and the extruder just could not keep up with that speed.  I had to reduce it to 30mm/s to prevent missing material.  I would say you can't really run this unit faster than 30mm/s when using the 0.8mm nozzle.  Maybe if you have small layer height it would be possible.  &lt; 100um.  But at layer heights of 100um, it just could not keep up with anything above 30mm/s.<br/><br/>Positive Items:<br/>1.  The machine has potential, they designed it so that you can remove the print head and snap in another head that would support true dual nozzle, two material and dual material reel system.  On top of that, they designed in in such a way that you could turn it into a CNC and put a cutting head on it with either a knife or router head.  Although, I am not sure it could take much torque.  But, that is future and this in now!!!!<br/>2.  Print quality is excellent when it works.  Since it can use the 0.3mm nozzle for perimeters and 0.8mm for inside volume and build functions, it allows the printer to have nice high quality prints at a faster speed.  However, material warping can quickly erase that nice high quality.  FYI use nylon when it is available!!!!<br/>3.  Has ability to do 20um layer heights.  I don't really see the need for this, after seeing the results from a normal 100um printer using the fine nozzle for perimeters.</span>

<span>This printer does not work at all.  I downloaded the latest version of the software before starting (Windows 64-bit).  The software delivers an endless stream of error messages.  Will not print; will not purge the nozzle; will not eject filament once it is loaded.  I had to return it with the filament reel still in place.<br/><br/>The graphical display of nozzle temperature to the left of the graphics window in the software, and the text display of nozzle temperature in the graphics window show completely different values.  On an HD screen (1920 x 1080), parts of some of the pop-up windows in the Settings menu are clipped and the windows cannot be resized, making some of the settings, and their labels, inaccessible.<br/><br/>After the first error, the software instructed me to immediately shut the unit down, eject the filament, reseat the head and restart.  The filament would not eject because the nozzle would not heat up enough to allow ejection (even though it appeared to heat up beyond operating temperature at times when it was not supposed to).  I shut it off and reseated the head.  After restarting I was warned that I had shut the unit down while the head was still hot, and that could damage the head, even though the software had instructed me to shut it down when I did.<br/><br/>The hardware and design appear to be of very high quality and well done.  The problem may be with the software.  The latest version of the Users Manual and the Quick-Start Guide from the Robox web site do not match the latest version of the software, downloaded at the same time also from the Robox web site.<br/><br/>Does not deserve even one star, but that is the lowest rating allowed.</span>

<span>Danger Will Robinson Danger!!!! Amazon has been saddled by CEL with very old stock, the production dates on both the units I received were from 2014. My research indicates new production units from CEL have different: print heads, extruders, control boards, etc than these early units. These early units could be fully updated, but CEL is unwilling and probably financially unable to do so. I know this because I asked directly if they would prefer I ship a DOA unit to them to be brought up to current production specifications in lieu of just returning it. The response was to lie to me and claim the unit had been fully updated. Unfortunately for them I have high level Amazon contacts who confirmed the unit I received had not left Amazons warehouse since it arrived. (The unit could not have been updated before arriving in the warehouse as the second generation heads, extruders, parts, did not become available until sometime in 2016.) After catching the rep in this lie and trying to go around him to corporate in hopes they might care about their customer service reputation I was told they were "very happy with the support" the lying rep had provided to me.<br/>Please be aware that if you buy one of these early units CEL support is going to try to slow walk you out the end of the warranty without ever addressing or acknowledging the fundamentally defective nature of their early production. I suspect the positive reviews on here are from biased kick starter supporters, other shills or people with current production printers. My research on the forums indicates the most successful users of these early units are having the same experience you get with an old British motorcycle: ride for 30 minutes wrench for two hours, wash, rinse, repeat. I am going to refrain from posting names and screen shots of the actual emails unless CEL posts some stupid response.</span>

I am new to the 3D printing, and decided to get this printer. 2 colours, based on great design and backed by support.<br/><br/>For last 3 months, I have printed PETG, PLA, and wood. Total 8kg filament and 1100 hours of printing and 500 hours of maintenance. But the printer keeps going on. What was more surprising was that how easy it is to upgrade. Most of the designs are up on thingyverse and the FB group is even more creative.<br/><br/>The mainboard of the printer is also a gem. It’s a 24V system with 6 drivers!!!! 3 for axes and 3 for extruders. Which means that you can even upgrade to 3-in-1 diamond extruder with ease and print without tinkering with circuits.<br/><br/>If you are planning to get it, get it from amazon coz 1) you can return it (duh amazon) 2) get support directly from geeetech (low price A10M notoriously lacks that function like that from Banggood)<br/><br/>Also budget for a few upgrades down the line,<br/>1) Capricorn tunes,<br/>2) nozzles<br/>3) TMC2208 drivers (all 5)<br/>4) quiet fans and blowers<br/>5) raspberry pi for octoprint<br/>6) pi camera or webcam<br/><br/>Happy printing!!</span>

<span>I got this printer from my wife as a birthday gift. First the filament sensor was working , then the board kept flashing a thermal runaway error. I emailed the manufacture 3 times 3 months ago and still no response. The printer works great when it’s wants to. But your own your own for repairs. I disappointed with the company. If you want a printer that does good quality prints and your a tinkerer then this maybe the printer for you since the company doesn’t wanna help the customer and your only line of tech support is forms and Facebook pages</span>

Unfortunately, one spool holder filament senor was broken off and the other one was bent. Also, the build plate scraped on something when moving back and forth and the back rollers were too wide for the bed rails making the back of the build plate extremely loose. So disappointing!!

<span>So I had bought a JGAroura printer before, and it suited me fine. But this printer is one I do not recommend.

Whether it was a fluke or not, the sound was extremely loud and I could hear it on all three levels of my house.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have owned a Dremel 3D45 since the first week in October, 2020. Since that time I have built 40-50 parts. These are usually quite simple. Some I have experimented with building in different orientations to see how that affected the build quality, particularly in terms of filament support.<br/><br/>I was new to 3D printing. In examining printers to buy, I wanted something that 1) got good reviews, 2) had good product support, 3) could print with different materials, and 4) was enclosed to reduce noise. So although I could have purchased a decent 3D printer for $500, I opted for the $1900 3D45 because it met the above criteria. I thought over the long term, it would pay for itself.<br/><br/>However, I have had a LOT of trouble with the nozzle clogging when printing with Dremel PLA for parts that needed some filament support. I show an example in the photo. The part is a simple wheel with a short axle at the back center. You can see a bunch of horizontal defects, where the nozzle was starting to clog, but the build ended with the wheel only partially finished when the nozzle totally clogged. In a half dozen tries, I was not able to successfully build this part. I could build it with PETG, but not with Dremel PLA.<br/><br/>Dremel did give me good product support, and suggested using different temperatures for the nozzle and the build plate. This did not solve the problem. Eventually they sent me a new spool of PLA, and I was able to build the entire wheel but not without some defects. I note that I was able to build the sample parts (with my Dremel PLA) included with the printer, such as the frog, but these parts did not require filament support, which seemed to be related to the problem.<br/><br/>I have had no problem building with Dremel PETG, and since that is the material I intend to primarily use, I have been happy with that. The second photo shows a failed build with Dremel PLA on the left, a mostly successful build with new Dremel PLA in the middle (green) and a successful build with PETG on the right. Certainly I expected to be able to build with PLA with a $1900 printer.<br/><br/>Now, other things. The documentation is a curious blend of clarity and obscurity. For example, the user's manual says, "Dremel3D cloud based software can be accessed on www.digilab.dremel.com." As far as I can tell, that is not the case. You can find the manual and FAQ, etc., there, but to access the cloud software, you have to go to printcloud.dremel.com. This, by the way, appears to be a website run by Bosch, who appears to actually be the manufacturer of the printer. To register the printer you must enter a "token," not the serial number. You get a token through the touch screen. This is buried a couple of levels deep in the touch screen, and on my screen says "Clouds" but in the user's manual says "Tokens." I have had to enter tokens now several times to keep the cloud stuff working.<br/><br/>I had to search on-line to find documentation about unclogging the nozzle--that is not included in the user's manual. Eventually I found a five page document, written by Dremel, on this. I will say this a little scary the first time you do it, as it involves using a pair of pliers to yank out the filament from a precision, $1900 machine.  At some point I was pleased to find a short YouTube video, made by Dremel, that shows this. However (and at this point I had carefully unclogged the nozzle several times), I was very surprised the video doesn't show the user pressing the filament release lever--an important action. It actually has a sign that comes up and says something to the effect, "Make sure you press the release lever but we are not showing that." What?? They can't show the proper steps in their own video?<br/><br/>Another important action you can do through the interface is nozzle gap calibration. Nothing about this is explained in the user's manual. Again, you have to hunt this down on-line to understand what it means and what the user is supposed to do.<br/><br/>So to summarize, 1) I've had a lot of trouble with the nozzle clogging printing with Dremel PLA, 2) the documentation is incomplete or confusing in spots, and 3) I've had good success with PETG. For $1900, it should be better than this.</span>

<span>As a mechanical engineer myself, my expectations were extremely high to begin with.  I have interacted with 3D printers before and have seen a few different models in action.  We even have one in our office (Prusa i3 MK3) and I can honestly say that this 3D printer is a great purchase.  I am 100% satisfied.<br/><br/>Below is the criteria that was important to me and the basis of my evaluation;<br/><br/>Ease of Use:<br/>It took me just a few minutes to pull it out of the box, clip the build plate in place and we were up and running.  I have seen my colleagues at work struggle putting the Prusa kit together with parts not fitting 100% correct or braking in the process.  It was a great experience with the Dremel being ready to go out of the box with not adjustments needed.<br/><br/>Prints are easy to setup with the included slicer software and entry level folks can easily print without spending hours trying to make it work.  For advanced users, the advanced options are available where every parameter can be adjusted.  The slicer is Cura based.<br/><br/>Enclosure:<br/>One of the big selling points for me was the fact that the printer comes with an enclosure.  With other printers that are open you have to worry about breathing the fumes, ultra fine particles, temperature control issues (particularly when printing ABS and Nylon).  I have small kids that can inadvertently stick their fingers in the printer while it is operating.  Having an enclosure ads an extra layer of safety that was important for me.  I have the printer located in my garage where temperatures can get cold but since the enclosure keeps the internal temperature well control, I don't have much of any issues with the prints warping or the first layer not sticking.  It just simply works!<br/><br/>Filtration:<br/>It comes with a built-in filter and fan.  The fan is properly sized and built into the electronics.  As a result it can be easily controlled.  You can easily and quickly adjust whether it turns on or not and the speed.  The enclosure comes with mounting provisions already integrated in the event that an external filtration system is desired.  The user can also use those same mounting provisions to vent the fan output to the outside by connecting a hose and adapter to the mounting provisions.  The printer comes with the file needed for the adapter, you can just print it, bolt it on to the back of the enclosure and hook up a hose.<br/><br/>Quality of Print:<br/>This printer is just simply amazing.  The quality competes with the best in the market for the given price point.<br/><br/>Filament:<br/>The Dremel proprietary filaments work great.  There are a lot of folks that complain about the cost of the filament and the fact that it is half of the amount you get from other filaments.  So you pay more for less literally.  However, the user can actually use any filament they want.  The settings are adjustable and the printer itself has the capability of handling any filament brand.  You just need to adjust the settings and the spool itself will have to sit outside of the printer.  Not a big deal at all.  A simple online search will yield several videos showing how to do this.  My understanding is that Dremel no longer disqualifies your warranty for doing this.<br/><br/>WiFi/Web Cam/Cloud:<br/>These features are just simply great and extremely helpful to setup a que of various prints, monitor prints remotely, and track filament usage.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it?<br/>Absolutely YES!</span>

<span>I’ve never used a 3D printer before, so this is my first, which is important because I’m a newbie.<br/>This review has four parts: unboxing, quick setup, printing, and result.<br/>1. Unboxing<br/>Neat packaging, easy to unpack, but I wonder: what is the separate plastic-surrounded glass plate for? (I found out in the next step, despite the quick setup instructions which omit it)<br/>2. Quick setup<br/>I immediately connected it to a wired ethernet connection, and then turned it on for the first time. It put me through a wizard to connect to one of the many wireless networks around, but this was completely unnecessary as I suspected. I finally saw an indication on the small touch screen that suggested that it was connected to the internet (despite not being connected to wifi), and it was.<br/>The firmware update was smooth.<br/>The quick-start guide does not mention the build platform (the glass plate mentioned above), but then shows it in a picture so I guessed that I was intended to install it. I did place it on the platform with the DREMEL label on it before starting a test print, and IMO that’s an important step; I guessed correctly and a good thing too.<br/>I used the black ECO-ABS filament that shipped with the printer. Threading the filament was more complicated than the quick-start guide let on. I had to go back and do it again because I thought I was following instructions, but I hadn’t threaded the filament enough. I wish the quick-start diagram showed clearly that the filament has to be manually threaded through the white plastic tube, and then over to the print head assembly, through the black plastic slot and then down into the shiny metal hole until it stopped.<br/>It was unexpectedly challenging to thread the filament and place the filament spool so that I was confident the thread stayed inside the spool boundaries before being drawn into the white/translucent plastic tube; this is probably important, so it doesn’t get hung up on the outside the spool.<br/>Connecting to the printer from the printcloud.dremel.com site is relatively easy and an important step.<br/>But, how do I enable the in-printer camera?<br/>3. Printing<br/>The Dremel 3D45 is about as noisy as the year-old 2D paper printer I have, right next to the 3D45 in my study. It smells a tiny bit, but there is a small muffin fan running constantly to push air out of the printing area and through a filter.<br/>I first tried Dremel_Test_Print from the printcloud.dremel.com site (a cartoon frog I think) but it failed the test print because of two mistakes that I made for which I blame the Quick Start guide: first, I didn’t use glue, because the Quick Start guide doesn’t mention that until too late (see above) and second, I hadn’t clicked in the build plate correctly, because the guide does not mention the build plate AT ALL until near the end when it describes build complete.<br/>Second attempt was a test print “the builder” from the printer menu. From the printcloud.dremel.com site, during this print I went to PRINTERS tab and clicked the DETAILS button for the job to open the “DREMEL STREAMING” page for my 3D printer, and it showed these log statements which were emitted at different times during the print:<br/>[15:49 04.16.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from offline to idle<br/>[16:20 04.16.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from idle to heating<br/>[16:24 04.16.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from heating to printing<br/>[20:57 04.16.2020 PDT] Printing progress: 10%<br/>…<br/>[13:32 04.17.2020 PDT] Printing progress: 100%<br/>[13:33 04.17.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from printing to idle<br/>[13:33 04.17.2020 PDT] Object printed successfully in 23:20:59<br/><br/>Note the 4 minutes heating (for heating the build platform, and heating the extruder tip), plus the total printing time which was more than 23 hours.<br/>It was challenging to remove the print from the build plate without damaging it, but the tool included with the printer eventually worked. A sharper and wider scraper might help.<br/>But, it was worth it…<br/>4. Result<br/>There were just a few stray bits of the black ECO-ABS sticking out in odd places, and it could stand a bit of smoothing, but otherwise it seems very paintable!<br/>Beautiful! My kids love this so one of the things we are working on for school-at-home is learning how to modify and create new objects.<br/>My brother sang for the MIT Chorallaries, so of course I thought of The Engineers’ Song.<br/>This is a great 3D printer, I recommend it!</span>

<span>When the corona virus hit in March 2020, my wife, son and I were stuck at home (five months later we still are).  We had never done 3D printing before, but we thought that it would be a great project while waiting for school and work to ramp back up.  After a lot of reading and talking with colleagues who do a lot of 3D printing, we selected the Dremel 3D45.<br/><br/>Being new to 3D printing, I needed a bit of help getting started, and the customer support was fantastic.  Five months and countless projects later, the 3D45 is still running perfectly.<br/><br/>If we use the "Mac versus PC" analogy, this printer is definitely on the "Mac" side of the spectrum.  It is very user friendly and works great for almost all beginner and intermediate 3D printer users.  And they have AMAZING customer support.  Seriously, the customer support phenomenal.  I think that the superior customer support is something that comes along with buying a product backed by an industry giant like Bosch, who owns Dremel.<br/><br/>That being said, like a Mac, it is difficult to make the Dremel 3D45 do something that is outside of its comfort zone.  I think that advanced and/or professional users may find that frustrating.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1.) High quality components and very well built.<br/>2.) AMAZING customer service!<br/>3.) Super easy to use right out of the box.<br/>4.) Very good quality prints using the Dremel-brand filament materials.<br/>5.) Although it will likely invalidate your warranty, you can definitely print with non-OEM filaments and even some materials that Dremel will cautiously tell you "we have not been tested yet".  There are sufficient advanced settings that allow you to customize the printer for other filament materials such as the very flexible TPU, or "real" ABS.  I have successfully printed both on my 3d45 with no issues.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1.) The Dremel DigiLab 3D Slicer software does not work on many Macs.  I have been told by several customer support experts that the DigiLab software works on "some" Macs, but they have a lot of issues with getting it to work on all.  The software definitely does not work on my Mac. The work around is using the Dremel print cloud and the web based Dremel 3D Idea Builder, which is easy to use and works fine for me.  However, if I wanted to use some of the more advanced features of the DigiLab software, I would be out of luck on my Mac.<br/><br/>2.) Dremel really pushes you to use their OEM filaments, which are more expensive and can be quite limiting when it comes to color and material selection.  For example, their "ECO-ABS" filament is not really ABS, but a modified PLA filament.  So if you want to print something out of ABS that will withstand higher temperatures and/or use an Acetone vapor bath to smooth the surface, or you want to print something out of TPU that is much more flexible and "rubber-like", you are not going to get help from customer support.  You are going to have to figure that out on your own (but both are definitely doable on this printer in my experience).<br/><br/>3.) You cannot change the print settings in the middle of a print.  After five months, I am starting to see why someone might want this option, but it is simply not possible with this printer.  Again, not something that a beginner or intermediate level user is likely going to care about, but advanced users will probably be frustrated by this.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that I am very happy with this purchase.  If you are new to 3D printing, this is a very high quality printer that is guaranteed to please with a minimal learning curve and great customer support.  That being said, it is expensive, and the Dremel OEM filament material is much more expensive compared to other brand filaments.  You absolutely can use non-OEM filaments, but you will need to set the print conditions manually and this may void your warranty (but eventually you are going to do it anyway...trust me!)<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>TMQ</span>

<span>For two grand, I was expecting a printer that just worked out of the box with no issues. Not even close. I've been fiddling with settings for a week and I've gotten nothing but junk quality prints. I've been in touch with makerbot support, I've been following a well-regarded guide to making better prints and I've printed now dozens of things, and maybe one or two things are what I would call "acceptable quality". Two times now part of the extruder has just *fallen off*. I had the printer for one week, had printed like ten things, and a print was ruined because part of it just fell off! I've had to use a piece of masking tape to make it stay on (pic included in this review).<br/><br/>Besides that, the makebot software, which you have to use, is terrible! If the program has been open for more than about ten minutes it becomes unresponsive. The slicing options are primitive compared to the other slicers out there, and you can't use them because of the makerbot's always-on DRM.<br/><br/>It takes like twenty minutes for the printer to go from being turned on to ready because it has to connect to their servers and make sure you're an authorized user! It lcd screen says "Reauthenticating..." for many minutes every time I use it.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and absolutely do not buy this junk.</span>

<span>For $2500, this is way over priced for the quality. I had the replicator 2 and it worked like a dream. I hoped this one with the smart extruder would be just as good if not better. Wrong. The auto calibration is a joke, as all it did was melt my build plate in the middle. It auto unloads the filament after each print but doesn't auto load it for the new one so you have to load it every single time. The camera for remote printing seemed like a wonderful new addition but it's positioned in the front, blocked by the extruder, so even if the video did run smooth playback (which it doesn't, it lags like crazy) you can't see your print. Also, addressing the auto unload of the filament, it renders the remote printing useless, since you'd have to be there to load the filament before your print. I gave two stars because I sacrificed quality for convenience, which may have been a factor in my printers performance. What Amazon failed to mention, was that yes it comes in a box neatly packaged with all of its parts and the promise of two day shipping, which made me purchase it here instead of directly from makerbot, but that it's not a brand new machine, it's refurbished. I never got a decent print out of it, the auto calibration melted a hole in my build plate, and the smart extruder got clogged (technology in the smart extruder is supposedly supposed to stop the print before a clog happens/detect clogs before they get worse) to the point where it was coming out of the top of the extruder where the filament is fed through and continued to try and print with no warning it was clogging up. The only reason I wanted to upgrade my replicator 2 was because makerbots new update doesn't support USB connections to the computer aka to their own software. It forces you to now use only an SD card, which at this point seems like less of a burden than having to deal with the replicator +. For a machine this expensive, I expected so much, and everything I had read sounded like a dream come true, but now it's just an expensive paperweight. I've never returned something to Amazon so fast. Again, not sure if it's the printer itself, or the refurbished one that I got (which was not disclosed to me at time of purchase or else I would have ordered the brand new one from makerbot and just been patient with the shipping) but I'm completely unimpressed. Why take a great product like the replicator 2 and make it worse and completely un-tinkerable? Also, makerbots desktop software is now completely not user friendly, and makes it so much harder to change settings, adjust your build, and they even took away the Thingiverse library so I have to save every file to my computer. Thinking about saying goodbye to makerbot all together. They ruined a perfectly good product and ruined their desktop software. Forcing people to upgrade to a new printer because you took away USB support for the replicator 2 is bad business. I already spent my thousands of dollars on one product, and I still only buy makerbot filament and parts when needed, why are you so greedy to practically force me to now buy a $2500 printer that's "better" and only holds one size of filament I only have 2 rolls of. So then I was being punished for buying bigger rolls of filament! Needless to say, this printer has been returned, I'm trying to find a new home for my replicator 2 since I can barely use it, and I will be taking my business elsewhere. You really screwed up, makerbot. And shame on Amazon for selling me a refurbished product and not disclosing that it wasn't new and for specifically advertising it as new. Only getting two stars instead of one because at least the two day shipping didn't disappoint me.</span>

<span>This thing prints everything, just as they are designed.<br/><br/>That's the most important thing.<br/><br/>But in a little over 2 years, I'm on my 3rd unit. The nice folks at MakerBot are pretty good about answering the phone, providing people that seem to know what they are doing, and once they understand the problem, arrange to send me a new one.<br/><br/>Perhaps they will figure out why they are coming back and fix the problems, but until then, they are very nice about swapping out whatever I have for a new unit.<br/><br/>This device is light years ahead of the 2X ABS units in terms of printing. Any print on a 2x required an hour of fiddling and adjusting, but with these units, you just send the print job and wait a while, then go pick them up.<br/><br/>Very nice<br/><br/>These units are all about network interaction, but that really is a joke.<br/><br/>You have to be on the same router as it is to start a print, or most, but not all, of the time, it says the printer if "Offline".<br/><br/>The concept of having an Android app is a great idea, but after you wrestle with it for a while, eventually you just give up trying to use it.<br/><br/>No matter how many times you define the printer in Android, after one or two uses, it says you have to redefine the printer, which has to be done physically at the printer, and the unit must be idle.<br/><br/>My more recent Samsung Tab S4 tablet is not supported, but newer phones and older tablets are.<br/><br/>If you contact MakerBot asking for any support for the app, you're told "We have no plans to make any changes to the app or the list of supported devices".<br/><br/>In other words, if you can get it to work, fine - if not, go away.<br/><br/>Again though, the printer prints great except for the vacation you have to take every few months to swap out for a new one.</span>

<span>I had high hopes after reading all the good reviews.  Unfortunately, the bad ones described the printer that I received pretty accurately.  It's a beautiful machine with a lot of would-be improvements over my old Replicator 2.  I bought it because my Rep 2 was acting up intermittently and I thought I should have a back up.  If only it had made a decent print that could be removed from the build plate without having to chisel the raft off.  Or, would print without a raft and not come off the build plate before it was finished!  Or, would not print a bowl of spaghetti on the bottom of the object, with or without a raft.  Things went awry from the start.  MakerBot Print won't run on my 32-bit Windows desktop machine!  I had to install it on my 64-bit notebook.  After a full day of frustration, I decide the build plate needed leveling.  The user's manual suggests contacting MakerBot Customer Support before performing the leveling procedure.  Surprise, they're only available on weekdays and then only until 6:00 pm.  I found the leveling option in the menu and started following the onscreen instructions.  It's much like leveling the Rep 2 build plate, except instead of using a feeler gauge, you turn the screws until a light comes on telling you it's at the right distance.  The light never came on!  However, the instruction kept telling me to tighten until the light comes on, then it would tell me to loosen until the light comes on.  Again, the light never came on.  Eventually, it moved to the next position and repeated the same nonsense.  No light ever and no way it was anywhere close to level.  I decided to power off the printer and try again - tomorrow.  Next day, I turned on the machine and went to the menus.  The level build plate option was gone!  I tried a print and got only air.  Time to call Customer Support.  This was Friday afternoon before Memorial Day on Monday.  The were closed for the holiday!  I had found online, that the new version of firmware (the one on this machine) didn't allow build plate leveling.  However, it had walked me through totally unleveling it before deciding not to allow me to actually level it.  I downloaded the previous version of firmware, installed it, and was then able to level the build plate by following the onscreen instructions and, yes, the light came on.  I tried a few prints, with and without rafts.  The results were the same - horrible.  Next, I updated to the most recent version of firmware that I had removed.  No change.  While I was waiting for these bad prints, I found the problem with my Rep 2 and repaired it.  Given the many good reviews of the Rep+, I assume that I got one of the lemons.  However, I'm not willing to gamble on a replacement, so I'm going to ask for a refund.</span>

<span>Searched the internet for the best beginner 3D printer.  Looked at the the Prusa and the Ender, but one of them was backordered for weeks and the other seemed especially particular about bed leveling for every print.  Ran across a review online about this one and and it sounded great.  I like the fully enclosed design since we have it set up in the kitchen with dog and cooking and sink nearby.  It's quiet in that it's not especially noisy.  You can hear it buzzing along quietly if you're in the next room.  If you buy the FlashForge filament it will fit inside the enclosure.  Most reels are bigger so I designed and printed an exterior filament reel holder and added some press-fit bearings and we just set it next to the printer.  All the reviews knock the small reel holder and say you need to leave the door off for the exterior feed of larger 1 kg rolls.  Duh, just drill a hole in the door and feed it though (picture).  Anyway, we were up and printing the test specimen within 20 minutes of opening the box.  The bed is always level.  The extruder nozzle is detachable and easy to clean.  The touch pad is responsive and intuitive.  The print quality from what I can tell is good and we are having a blast with it.  My kids got the free student version of Shapr for 3D modeling and are making all kinds of cool stuff.  This printer can't officially print flexible filaments, but some people have tried it printing really slow.  We haven't tried that.  Also, we bought a bunch of different brands of filament, including FlashForge, and just print everything at 220 degrees with no stringing issues.  We have printed at low quality and at standard quality with great results.  We have not tried the higher settings yet.  The FlashPrint slicer program seems decent, although the recent update resulted in some prints that mysteriously offset by about a 1/4 inch.  We went back to the original version and its been fine.  Overall we are very pleased with this little guy!</span>

<span>Needed some additional 3-D printing capacity.  I have 3 units (Dremel, Snapmaker, generic) and it seemed that at times I have more to print than those units can do.  I consider myself a bit more than a novice, but certainly not a pro with 3-D.  I do make my own drawings and print the items as well as download a lot from sites like Thingsverse.<br/><br/>The features I liked on this were fairly low price 150 x 150 x 150 print space, enclosed (quieter), ethernet ability.  I do not need the absolute best quality for most of my stuff.....and this one spec'ed out to match my needs.<br/><br/>First....out of box to printing test block was less than 10 minutes.  Block was pre-loaded, so it was easy.  First print was about 11 minutes and ended up dimensionally near perfect.  Two other prints (from my files--one thing verse, one mine) loaded via usb stick perfectly.  Both were items I have printed previously.....about the same time as printing with my Dremel and dimensionally (and finish) an improvement.  5 items on three prints all have been perfect.  Running a "torture test" print now and will up date with those results.<br/><br/>Flexible build plate has made removal of flat pieces easy with no tools.<br/><br/>I am using Flashforge PLA material....small spools that fit into the feeder build into machine.  Will feed from larger spools external to machine of other brands later.  Their material is pricey.....but it is very good compared to many other.brands....and the machine mount feeder is nice and quite easy to use.<br/><br/>I have used Flashforge downloaded software and it works ok but has limited options.  Will use a couple other slicers and update info.  The touch screen controls are very simple and intuitive.<br/><br/>For my skill level and expectations, it has been perfect out of box.  Will see if longevity is good as well.  I would think a new to 3-D printing hobbies will be happy with the machine.  I see them getting up to speed with basic stuff quickly.  For those like me, just above that level, it is performing well...no fuss and giving nice quality.<br/><br/>I should mention sound.  I have enclosures on my other three machines as well...but this one is quieter than the other three.....something that is good for all night prints.<br/><br/>OK.....unit has operated over 200 hours.  Most of time using ABS, the rest has been PLA.  Two failures out of all that (since original part of review) One was a design issue I created, the other I have not figured out<br/>Quality has been good but not spectacular.  Better than the Snapmaker 1.0.  I suppose it is due to time and adjustments, but the Dremel can do a bit better than this....but most will not notice the differences.  I have tried old and fresh filament, cheap and brand name and it has fed and placed anything I have run through it.  Snapmaker is really fussy and Dremel enclosure design provides some issues with using non-dremel internal mount filament<br/><br/>Changing the filament is quicker and easier than any of the other machines I have.  Removable flexible heated bedplate seems like a good design, looks new after 200 hours of use.<br/><br/>Would be a nice first choice as the learning curve is not steep.  Enclosure makes it quiet.  Variety of materials it uses has proven accurate in description.<br/><br/>Still happy with choice.  Not the most technical unit....and has some advanced feature limitations but for most users it will be just fine.  I have found the 150 x 150 x 150 volume a bit limiting so next unit will exceed that.</span>

<span>Tbh, it is beginner friendly. People just need to use PLA, not ABS even though it says you can do both. Can't keep the print bed hot enough for abs yet. The touch screen works okay, takes patience. It did not come with instructions for linking to the computer. Okay overall like I said as a first 3D printer.</span>

<span>Likes:<br/>- Size (1.5x Ender 3)<br/>- Excellent print quality<br/>- Simple construction, quick to put together<br/>- Accompanying tools much better quality than most other printer makers (forged wrench, not stamped, excellent big Allen/hex wrench with handle and case, very nice scraper with wooden handle, not plastic)<br/>- Documentation better than most other printer makers, but still needs work<br/>- Company support tries hard, decent response times, but advice not helpful even with photos I supplied<br/>- Nice color touchscreen (this is a force push screen, like a microwave, not a real touchscreen like a phone, bit still OK)<br/><br/>Dislikes:<br/>- First unit severely damaged in shipping, not evident from box.  Company quickly sent replacement parts (1 extruder head) but this took more than 2 weeks to arrive, did not address problem.  Apparently some of the driver chips had been knocked out of the driver board during shipping.  I could not figure out how to open the case without completely deconstructing the machine.  I ended up returning this machine and got another one that was perfect (and &gt;$100 cheaper!).<br/>- Leveling and calibration process is tedious, but it does make sense if you think about how the machine is designed.  Some people advocate removing the post in the middle of the bed, but if you follow the recommended leveling instructions, this is not necessary (IMHO).  End result well worth the setup.<br/>- The documentation is much better than others (Creality, Geeetech, etc.) but still has minor inaccuracies that are a little frustrating (see below).<br/>- The company is very responsive to support requests in my experience, but their engineer didn't look at the photos I sent of driver chips that had fallen out of the case.  He recommended that some of the cables were loose (NOT).  Weak.  I still don't know how to properly open the case, but hopefully I won't need to on this unit.<br/>- Best support is on Facebook group.  I had discontinued Facebook, so I had to create a dummy account just to browse this information.  Not well organized, and search capabilities are weak.  After MUCH scrolling I found the answer to my problem.  (This is the same issue someone else reported, of the printheads crashing into each other.  There is an "X-Mode" setting that controls this, and the default setting is if you want to run the printer with just one print head.  You must change to the second mode to allow the printer to swap between heads properly.  Why they would even have the first/default mode is beyond me.  Note that the documentation and the printer interface do not match, so just switch to the second mode.)<br/>- Louder than Ender 3, but it has 4 print head fans, not 2.  No big deal to me.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>I like it and will beat on it, will probably get another.  If you must have 2 print heads, get this machine if you're on a budget.<br/><br/>******Update 11/2021******<br/>While the printer worked great for a while, I am starting to experience the same problems that other people have:<br/>- The stepper drivers tend to fail.  This caused one of my extruders to slowly peter out, then completely fail.  Apparently this is a well documented issue.<br/>- The filament runout sensors are not reliable.  I was near the end of a 200-hour print and one spool ran out, the detector did not stop the machine, $80 of filament wasted.  I have remixed a better detector on Thingiverse that should address issues.<br/>- The extruders chronically under-extrude.  There are a number of mods that people have tried, but in general the consensus is that these extruders are just not very good.  There is still not a clear replacement path to more popular/reliable extruders, but I would guess this will come fairly soon (on the Facebook group, which is the only place you can get real support).<br/>- SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE!  Don't get this machine if you think you can get warranty parts.  The US support has no voicemail, and told me to switch the cables on the extruders to try and diagnose the stepper failure and the machine BURST INTO FLAMES the second I turned it on.  Apparently this is a common issue with this machine!  I went through a difficult process with support in China to get replacement cables and a stepper driver (US support has no authority to provide warranty parts), and they sent the wrong parts!<br/><br/>Very frustrating and disappointing.</span>

<span>Purchased the Artist D Pro via Amazon.  This is a very nice printer.  the IDEX printer works well out of the box, but perfectly once you have tweaked the settings correctly.  The YouTube videos don’t lie, you need to be patient when leveling the bed.  The first extruded isn’t that problematic, but the second one requires you to loosen four screws on the back of the extruder and then lower or rise the extruder itself.  The biggest issue with that is that when you loosen it and then you tighten it again, it moves a bit and messes up the leveling of it..  You have to be extremely patient to get it just right.  When you do get it right, it gives you nice prints especially in fine and super fine settings in your splicer..  I would highly recommend it..  Stick with it regardless of the difficulty of setting it up to have a pretty good printer.<br/><br/>D.</span>

<span>Printer looks good, don't know if it works or not though because the program that comes with it doesn't work just fails when trying to open it. Very expensive desk ornament.</span>
