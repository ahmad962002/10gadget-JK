<span>This device is worse than awful. It took 6 attempts to set up, the instructions are absolute garbage, poorly written and grammatically incorrect. There was no apparent way to disable the alarm from motion tracking, there was no apparent way to simply set up a recording and walk away, recording stopped when you turned off the screen for the device that you connected the camera to, there is no way to fully verify the resolution other than setting the mode to "FHD" which, yes, should mean Full HD, but with this devices track record so far, who knows. Attempting to remove the SD card is a nightmare in itself, the motion tracking went haywire when all i did was move my hand up and down.....and lastly, and perhaps the most troubling, were the permissions the app asked for...one of which was to "make and receive phone calls"....FOR WHAT???!!! NO!...and also, my phone began behaving badly after the app was installed...i could no longer bring up running apps (by hitting the square button...android) so close the app which was required for the numerous times i had to restart set up.....<br/><br/>this is literally a pathetic excuse for an electronic device....i am ashamed to have even purchased it....I am a technical guy, but after this, i feel like i know NOTHING. Do not waste your time...find another device and hope you don't have the same issues I did with this one.  just awful, awful, awful</span>

<span>I purchased this product Not only to keep an eye on my personal belongings but also as a deterrent for potential thievery.  I just moved into a Living  arrangement with a roommate and while I kind of trust him, he does allow some who are HIS friends to remain in the apt while he’s away. Not cool. So, as he refuses to inform me of this and for my own piece of mind, I purchased  this device.<br/>I’m giving this a 3-3.5 out of 5 stars here why: POWER source- it needs to remain plugged in at all times and has no alternative power source (ie. batteries). If the power goes out, the camera is ineffective.; WIFI Connection REQUIRED- At all times for this device to work. If you’re like me then you’re rarely home and have no need to pay for internet service when you can connect all devices using your phones hotspot. I now pay for internet service just to have security but don’t love doing so. Having said that, if the power is interrupted only briefly or if the device loses internet connection for some other reason, you would need to be there to reconnect. This is why I took more points away.  But if you can manage to keep this device powered and connected, it is a neat security device. The night vision isn’t the best quality but it gets the job done. Equipped with motion detection this camera also begins to capture And record a video clip once movement is detected. An alert is sent immediately and footage is available so i can see what’s happening in real time  The picture quality is pretty good, and there’s a two way microphone so your voice is heard loud and clear when  addressing any intruder. Good product but because there’s no alternative/backup power source<br/>Which means there’s a greater chance for malfunction and thus less confidence and piece of mind AND a WiFi network is REQUIRED for the device to do any part its job, I have to give this product 3.5 out of 5.</span>

<span>This is a great little camera for watching my puppy. The night vision is great, and the ability to rotate it remotely is super nice. I also like being able to hear what's going on, but found the speaker scared my dog. It's very clear, and load, but made him freak out. Would work fine for talking to someone though. Motion detection is a meh. It gives me an alert when I rotate the camera, but not when the dog walks into the room, or when I come home (I have it in my front room). Set up was a pain but that's because it requires 2.4ghtz wifi and most internet providers now combine it with the 5ghtz, so I had to call in and get that fixed before I could set it up.</span>

<span>REVIEW UPDATE<br/><br/>We recently lost our internet connection due to updates our ISP had to make.  What we didn't know is that Blink cameras are solely dependent on an Internet connection (not just a wifi connection) even if you don't have a subscription or just have the trial.  None of the outdoor cameras will remain active when you lose Internet connectivity.  My wrongful assumption was that ONLY your local area network was needed since it relies on a wifi signal.  Nope.  That is wrong.  The Sync Modules will flash the green LED and no camera will work.  Great job Blink/Amazon for putting customers at risk to thieves and other criminals.<br/><br/>We have 4 of the outdoor cameras on two separate Sync2 Modules due to the distance from the main router.  We have an extender (set as a repeater) which handles the furthest cameras.  As I said I never considered these would go offline if the Internet connection went down.  I figured if my LAN went down then it would make total sense the cameras would go offline, yet I was foolish in my thinking.<br/><br/>Again this is shameful of Blink/Amazon to have this even as a feature.  I get that you need an account to pay for the service, but why in the world would these be designed to FAIL if your Internet connection goes down?<br/><br/>It is not only misleading to consumers to not EXPLICITLY state that these cameras will fail to operate without an Internet connection.<br/><br/>This IS one of the WORST investments my family ever made in a product.  Would have been better to purchase a CCTV camera system and just hardwired everything on the network.  For what we've now paid for 4 cameras + the sales tax we could have gotten a 4 camera CCTV setup instead from a local box store.<br/><br/>As I have said in my original review, the cameras do work, and will suffice.  Keep in mind that an Internet connection is REQUIRED and not just your local area network connection.  I had to lower my rating to just one star because nothing is lower than that on Amazon's site.  I'd give this camera system negative stars it it were possible just based on our experience over the past few months.<br/><br/>Also I think I was far too generous with parts of my original review, but experience will change your mind when the experience becomes bad.<br/><br/>I no will longer recommend ANY of the Blink cameras.  Until they are no longer dependent on an Internet connection and will fully function on just your local networks wifi signal.  I will be researching a true CCTV camera system to replace the Blink cameras.  If I could get a refund I'd do it in a heartbeat, but that window has closed.  The price of this education is high!<br/><br/>---------<br/>Original review<br/><br/>Recently purchased the Blink Outdoor 2 Camera system, and it's a very hit or miss system.  I have several things to say about the security cameras and the Blink app that goes with it.<br/><br/>The base:<br/><br/>The friction fit mounting bases are not easy to snap into place.  I had to use a long and think flat headed screw driver to aid in connecting it.  Also I worried about crushing the sensor on the camera because of how much force it takes and where my hands are pressing on the camera itself (holding from the edges while mounting under a roof eave is moderately annoying).  Once it is finally snapped to the base it moves freely and the camera stays in place.<br/><br/>The Sync 2 Module<br/><br/>This is the brains of the system.  Each module controls up to 10 cameras and utilizes your 2.4GHz Wifi connection.  Now I mistakenly assumed that my 2 camera system didn't include the Sync 2 Module (I didn't notices a "what's in the box" on Blinks Amazon page.  So I ended up buying one which was a waste of money considering it's included.  The setup takes a while after you power it on you'll need the app to discover the device.  Initially the blue LED flashes and the green LED is steady.  Once it is discovered then then both LEDs are steady.<br/><br/>The app (Android)<br/><br/>At first the app to control this camera system seems simple, but there are some annoyances I've discovered.  The system will NOT discover the best WiFi connection on your network.  I have an detached garage with the camera approximately 75 feet from the Sync 2 Module, and my router is close to 10 feet from the Sync 2 Module.  So I picked up a WiFi extender and set it as a Repeater (firewall, DNS, DHCP etc. is controlled by my primary router) in order for the signal strength to be at a maximum.  It is recommended that you use the existing WiFi names (SSIDs) on your network (for 2.4GHz only) and append _EXT so Blink can see it if using a Wifi extender.  Also keep your password keys for your wifi extender the exact same that are on your main wifi router.  Now in theory (and based on Blink's own guidelines) the system should pick the best Wifi signal based on your setup.  Well it doesn't, and there is NO option in the Blink app for me to place my garage camera on the extender Wifi (again it's on the same network as all my devices are) while keeping the door camera on the primary router (same network once again).  This is not about changing networks, this is about discovering the extender on my main network (which I repeat Blink claims it will chose the best signal automatically).  Yes I could add the second Sync 2 Module in the garage, but then I'd have to create a second system for the garage camera.  Not entirely what you should have to do.<br/><br/>Batteries:  These cameras require the more expensive Lithium AAs you do get the batteries with the cameras (mine were Energizer Lithium AAs.  The cameras are equipped with a USB B mini connection which you can use to connect to a powered USB source as to not run off batteries.  In my case I picked up a motion detector LED flood light that offers a USB connection (this unit https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F9CNPVW).  I would remove the batteries from the cameras because I do not know if connected will it try to charge the batteries (these are NON chargeable lithium batteries) or it will it bypass the batteries?  I would err on the side of caution and remove them.<br/><br/>Local Storage (USB thumb drive) vs Blink Subscriptions<br/><br/>This is an Amazon product and you'd think that the Blink camera systems would provide free service to Amazon Prime members.  Nope.  You are nickled and dimed on a per camera basis at $6 monthly, and it's $100 annually (if I read it right) for one full system).  Again why is this NOT part of Prime Membership?<br/><br/>So to avoid saving to the cloud I bought a 256GB thumb drive to insert into the Sync 2 Module.  What I have discovered is ONLY clips are saved locally.  You are NOT able to save live recordings to the local storage.  Really?  Why?  What's the point of only having the clips (maxed at 60 seconds) on a local drive?  To me this is a rip off and not mentioned anywhere in the product details.<br/><br/>Yes you do get a "free" trial which unlocks all features.  If you; however, cancel that trial early or let it expire without buying a subscription than certain features are locked.  So again you pay a lot for the camera system and you are locked out of many features IF you don't buy their subscription to the cloud.  Talk about ripping folks off.  Sure you can look at live feeds, but you can't same them locally.  You can take a snapshot from the cameras, but it will NOT take a photo every hour UNLESS you BUY a Blink subscription.  Again this all goes back to Blink subscriptions.  Tell me what's the point of local storage if all you can save are clips?<br/><br/>Loading issues with clips and thumbnails.  So I've run into issues where loading a clip from the connected USB drive fails to load 95% of the time.  Again these are short clips and should pull faster than from the Cloud.  Nope.  Thumbnails are hit or miss.  These are generated when you press the camera icon on the home screen of the app.  I call them snaps, but I've noticed if I am sitting near the Sync 2 Module it can still fail.  Full wifi bars too and it still fails.<br/><br/>Alexa:<br/><br/>It is claimed by Blink that the newest generation of their cameras will work with Alexa.  I used the app from my phone, but she can't do anything with the cameras (even when trained to use them).  In this case you may have to buy an Alexa enabled device (like Show).  You technically don't need one they are NOT required for these cameras, but the Alexa app alone on a smartphone is limited.<br/><br/>Finally the recommend having minimum Internet speeds of 2Mb up and down for these cameras, but I believe that is ONLY if you are saving and storing to the cloud along with accessing from the cloud.  Locally your access to the Blink cameras will depend on your network speeds along with wifi.  The more stuff you have connected the slower it can be.<br/><br/>Conclusion.  The Blink Camera System isn't terrible, and they are affordable.  There are quirks as I mentioned and annoyances I have dealt with.  These are not high end systems but on a tight budget you can get a good start.</span>

<span>When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):<br/>PROS:<br/>&gt; #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams.  POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.<br/>&gt; So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.<br/>&gt; The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few "advanced features" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas  and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.<br/>&gt; Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.<br/>&gt; Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.<br/>&gt; Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.<br/>&gt; No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.<br/>&gt; Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.<br/>&gt; Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.<br/>CONS:<br/>&gt; So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.<br/>&gt; The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.<br/>&gt; You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.<br/>OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.</span>

<span> We've got some bad actors in the hood, so it was time to catch them with some irrefutable evidence. Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom.<br/><br/>Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home.<br/><br/>The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.</span>

<span>Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.<br/><br/>First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)<br/><br/>Blink Outdoor:<br/>Motion recording speed &amp; Delay:<br/>The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --&gt; Encode --&gt; Cloud --&gt; Decode. I"d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.<br/><br/>Motion sensor &amp; sensor distance.<br/>the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.<br/><br/>Speaker/Mic<br/>the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.<br/><br/>Wifi Wireless<br/>i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this "might" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage.  it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.<br/><br/>AC Wireless.<br/>part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.<br/><br/>Resolution/video quality<br/>the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield "some" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.<br/><br/>Storage<br/>ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup "from their cloud server" "once a day". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that "local storage" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.<br/><br/>Now onto Blink mini (junk)<br/><br/>Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it.  The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.<br/><br/>Software UI/UX<br/>the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the "motion sensor" distance (not wifi distance)  is well shy of advertised 25ft.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.<br/><br/>i will update the review on the battery life</span>

<span>So this happened to me in two different houses with two different sets of blink mini cameras. when i was setting up the camera, it would not connect to wifi. it would blink blue and green and then the light would go to a steady red and after a couple mins the app would tell me it couldn’t connect to wifi and that it’s usually poor signal or incorrect password. Sometimes the lights on the camera would just turn off and it would be unresponsive. I retried so many times with same outcome. I reset my wifi countless times and changed the password and reset the cameras and even got right next to my router for maximum connectivity, because according to the internet that’s what I’m supposed to do. Well it’s actually the complete opposite. After some research, these cameras connect to 2.4 GHz band. Some wifi routers give off both 2.4 and 5.0GHz, some have two separate routers for each band. I have spectrum wifi so my one router has both bands. Anyways the point is the 2.4 covers larger, further out areas but with lower signals. 5.0 covers less area with better signals. So in order for the camera to connect you have to go the furthest away from your router to be able to connect to the 2.4 GHz band. So if you have a similar sounding issue try connecting furthest from the router. Also i did contact blink support but no response and i went to Best Buy to ask and they didn’t know what to do. maybe blink should include this info in the instructions</span>

<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<span>I bought this to use as a baby monitor, thinking if the quality was good I would end up purchasing an outdoor set as well. I got it in this afternoon, and set up was super easy. The picture quality is excellent for the price point.<br/><br/>The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the "continue?" prompt. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have never purchased a Blink camera. I watch my daughter on a Fire tablet while I work at night, and it's really not feasible to stop typing every 30 seconds to press a button.<br/><br/>Maybe it's my fault for not realizing it, but I don't remember reading any information about the length of viewing time, so I assumed it would be like the Foscam I had sought to replace. If Blink ever adds an update for continuous viewing, I would repurchase in a heartbeat, but for now, I'm sending it back.</span>

<span>We purchased our first Blink Home Security Camera July of 2018. We were going out of the country and wanted to make sure our 18 year old son closed the garage door and locked the house. It did the job and we felt better knowing while on the other side of the world we could monitor our home.<br/>The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.<br/>A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom. The video and audio quality is great.<br/>A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.<br/>Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it. One, because it was blink and 1/2 the price of a ring doorbell camera. Two, because the doorbell that came with our new build home was so quiet, we couldn't ever hear the bell ring.<br/>In total we now have...<br/>3 Indoor battery powered<br/>2 Indoor mini corded power<br/>6 Outdoor battery powered<br/>1 doorbell wired to exciting doorbell.<br/><br/>Cameras purchased...<br/>July 17th, 2018<br/>Blink Indoor Home Security Camera System with Motion Detection, HD Video, 2-Year Battery Life and Cloud Storage Included - 3 Camera Kit<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018HC6PVA/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_E4N35AJJXM4QAYYN1S03?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>July 15th, 2019<br/>Blink XT2 Outdoor/Indoor Smart Security Camera with cloud storage included, 2-way audio, 2-year battery life – 2 camera kit<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MN67BCR/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_2VZV3YZ7F3X4F5WSF9SF?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>August 20th, 2019<br/>Blink XT2 Outdoor/Indoor Smart Security Camera with cloud storage included, 2-way audio, 2-year battery life – Add-on camera for existing Blink customers<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M8DTHGL/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_7XGZ93G8PTGGNHTNBGEK?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>November 22nd, 2020<br/>Blink Mini – Compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, 1080 HD video, night vision, motion detection, two-way audio, Works with Alexa – 2 cameras<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X27VK3D/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_dl_0CVS1GZCPQPJE577M0JV?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>August 3, 2021<br/>Blink Outdoor - wireless, weather-resistant HD security camera, two-year battery life, motion detection, set up in minutes – 3 camera kit<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086DKSHQ4/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_dl_9F09K8M142MATNJY1C7P?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>November 29th, 2021<br/>Introducing Blink Video Doorbell | Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free (Black)<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SG2MS3V/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_dl_JTH38J37N7ST707FMW4P?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Blink offers two subscription plans.<br/><br/>1 Blink device<br/>$3 per month or $30 annually<br/><br/>Unlimited Blink devices<br/>$10 per month or $100 annually<br/><br/>You do not have to have a Blink Subscription if you do not choose to, but you won't be able to store videos.<br/><br/>With the subscription you are even able to share your videos by text, or email. To neighbors, Friends, Family, and even the police department.<br/><br/>Cons/irritations<br/>When an outdoor camera faces the sun at any point of the day, the motion detection will go off, until you adjust the motion activity spots in the camera settings. This can take a few days to work out the kinks.<br/>Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling.  The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.<br/><br/>Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.<br/><br/>Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.<br/><br/>We highly recommend Blink to anyone who would like to have a home video camera system that works, and won't break the bank.<br/>We love that you can start out small and work your way in to as much as you want/need.</span>

Love that it doesn't make a shutter sound every time you open up the app and that it can withstand staying on for all hours. He gets really triggered (so smart!) when he sees me touching his old dog cam, and it would make a sound that would scare him.

<span>I was informed by my neighbors that I had someone peaking into my windows. I decided to get a security camera and didn't want that would be outside for fear of it being stolen. I got this indoor camera to just set in my main window. It has done amazing! It was also super easy to set up; both the camera and app. It picks up people and vehicles in the street and the pictures don't seem too bad either! The low night review is only because my window makes it hard to see at night, but the camera still picks up activity. I will purchasing a couple more later!</span>

<span>I own 5 Ring indoor cams, along with a Ring Elite doorbell and a stick up elite POE cam.  This is just my input regarding these cams as I have been testing them and using them for quite sometime.  First thing is not every indoor cam works the same, some arrive with older firmware and need updating.  Plug in close to your router and do the full set up and do your updates.  Once you add the cam to the app and it’s working well, unplug it and move it to the area you want to monitor.  Do your set up either by mounting it or setting it on a shelf.  Get the angle of view your looking for and then set up your motion zone and sensitivity.  Make sure you check the “health” box to see your signal sensitivity.  If you are using a mesh router network, you should reconnect to the closest link for it, if not you may have to reconfigure to the nearest of it isn’t automatic.  Make sure you turn on the snapshot option as well.  If you don’t want to have the indoor cams record or send alerts while your home, you can turn that ability on and off with the new quick access buttons in the app.  You will get 30 days of free recording for ALL your cams, with each cam you buy. So if you decide to buy one a month, till you cover all your angles in the home, you will literally get an additional 30 days for every cam on your network covering the 50 days of cloud storage for free.  Why not use this option while it’s still available.  After you cover your needs, opt for the yearly service.  I have 5 indoors cams, covering almost 4000 sf.  I love that I can drop in and watch over the home as well as hear and talk through the cams.  Night vision in a room is great too. Makes a great baby cam as well.  I have had 2 indoor cams give me problems in the past, either dropping off my network, or the snapshot option not working.  If you have read my ring reviews before, I am well versed in networking and I have found that some ring reps want to always point the finger at every else but their devices.  I can say I have found problems in a couple of their devices and once they were replaced, the problem was solved.  Don’t allow them to drive you insane, the community forums are good but they only can go so far for help as well.  Sometimes a quick swap of the unit with a new one solves the problem.  Amazon has always backed me and they are truly behind their customers.<br/><br/>4/2020:  I wanted to be able to watch the main entrance and hallway in my home, have an eye level view, no wires at all showing, and nothing that stood out of place.  So review the attached pics, maybe this install will gravitate people who are inclined to custom installs, know there is no limit to what you can do.  Just plan out your work and never rush.  I was able to recess an indoor cam into my wall, and still provide me with all the aforementioned needs.  I used a double electrical box as it provided me the necessary room without modifying the box.  I used an indoor/outdoor ring power supply and reused the indoor cam plug on the power supply as it fits perfect and locks in.  I obtained 120v power from a nearby electrical outlet, and brought my wire into the box from behind the wall.  I mounted the ring power supply on the back of the electrical box, and prepped the box to accept the camera.  I created a clear acrylic template and was able to use that to cut out the blank wall plate.  What’s really nice is I can still unscrew the wall plate and easily remove the cam if I need to do a reset or adjustment.  This solved many issues for me and still provided an eye level video shot of persons entering the front door.  Since the ceilings are 12’ high, mounting the cam at the ceiling with a downward angle wasn’t conducive in getting a good facial shot.  This is just one example of several I have designed myself to combat issues most of us have dealing with wires, angles, placement, etc.<br/><br/>11.21.20:  After almost a year of Ring use, I have to say I am disappointed in the Ring community forum, their tech support, and products.  Just recently, I had two of the ID cams drop offline.  No matter what I did, no luck getting them back to work.  I actually unplugged a back up ID can and went to move it, that one also dropped offline and never came back up.  Tech support was of no help, and the community forum mod just tells you to call in.<br/><br/>I would think using 10 ring cameras, I know a little about them.  Based on my research, they connect to WiFi, but can’t get to the internet.  It appears that there is a high probability that my ISP is blocking the camera for possible threats, even though I turned off my firewall, set up a DMZ zone, and just about created a WiFi bridge to push the Ring cameras too, they still won’t work.  They don’t play nice since the last firmware update.  So as they fail, I am replacing them with another company.  Honestly, I don’t care what brand I use, as long as it works.  Read the community forums, and see for yourself.  Setting up cameras is not really that difficult, troubleshooting isn’t either as long as you have full control of all devices.  Ring doesn’t allow for device control outside of normal settings.  Also, Ring devices CAN NOT, be wiped clear of stored memory setting for your home network.  It’s embedded in the device.  Even if you remove it from your home network, and sell it.  It still has your network mirrored in its memory.  Found this by pure chance.  At the very lease you should have the cams IP address to clear out stored info and reset it.  Wow</span>

<span>I was looking for a product that wasn't too costly, and not hard to install. I travel some weekends and like to keep an eye on my dogs while I am away. One of my dogs likes to go outside the doggy door and bark (probably out of boredom) I always worry about my neighbors getting mad. I don't want them to possibly hurt them because of them getting irritated. These cameras allow me to talk directly to my dog and call him from the monitor to have him come inside. The camera is clear, but the night vision isn't very light. I love the ability to change the direction, it lets you pan around the perimeter of where you have it sitting. I just put one outside and 1 inside. I haven't mounted them or anything. It's not very windy because I live in a basement apartment so that hasn't been an issue. I am very happy I bought these. I can watch them 24/7 without stressing out just by using wifi capabilities.</span>

<span>I love the ZUMIMALL Outdoor Camera Wireless..it gives you the option of charging every 3 weeks or so right where it is...or pair it with a solar recharging solar panel sold separately or combo-pricing..I have 2 on solar panels...1 inside plugged in (and I leave the battery for power outage).  The versatility allows you to add each camera to the zumimall app and you can name your cameras...(Patio..Living Room...Front Door are some that i have name..I see all cameras on my cell phone under one umbrella APP..pretty cheap and easy to set up.  I use SD Cards to record.  They have helpful and responsive support when needed.  You can opt for cloud storage if so desired.  I have 5 cameras all tied into one app. Pretty cool.  So the cons are they dont have Zoom or Tilt on these.  Sure there are btter and more expensive cameras out there but this fits my budget and ease of operation in one app on my phone.

<span>Purchased two on 11/22/2019<br/>Ordered two more on 11/29/2019<br/><br/>Reviewed 2/9/20 (Three stars)<br/><br/>I bought four of these cameras in November 2019. I was impressed at first. But before long, the quirks began to surface.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Wireless/Cordless<br/>Easy installation<br/>Can easily add additional cameras<br/>Good picture in HD mode<br/>Reasonably fair picture in SD mode<br/>Weather proof/resistant<br/>Camera mobility<br/>Can share access with family/friends<br/>Internal storage on micro SD card (not included)<br/>Cloud storage available<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Extremely unreliable*<br/>Software very spotty<br/>Poor wi-fi<br/>Terrible battery life<br/>Slow "wake up" time once activated<br/>Magnetic mounts basically useless if mounting outside<br/>$30 per year PER CAMERA cloud storage fee<br/><br/>If you don't need/want details, scroll down to the bottom line.<br/><br/>*The cameras I purchased have a tendency to simply shut themselves off completely, so that the only way to re-activate them is to dismount them completely, remove the back cover, connect them to a power source and hold down the  power button for five seconds. I have had this happen even when the battery still has an 80%+ charge. If I happen to be away from home when this happens, I am without coverage until I can get home and jump through the hoops necessary to resolve this problem. This has happened to me several times in the short time I have had these cameras. Using the "Reset" feature does not resolve this problem. For me, they continue to shut off, seemingly for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Even when these cameras do work, access through the software app, "CloudEdge" has been spotty at best. After opening the app, I tap on the camera I want to view... and wait.... and wait. The app will start a count up from 1% to 100% where at 100% it finally shows me what the camera is currently seeing. If it connects. Often I have to make several attempts to finally connect. This is frustrating when the software alerts me to movement and I can't connect to see what triggered the camera.<br/><br/>In case you might be thinking that the problem is wi-fi signal strength, it's not I purchased two wi-fi extenders and all other devices show extremely strong signals throughout my property. As I look now at the two, (out of four), cameras that I can currently connect to, the signal strength for these are 100% and 78%. The 78% is consistently the weakest signal of the four. The other two cameras are usually at 100% and 90%+, but at present, they have disconnected themselves again and must be dismounted and restarted.<br/><br/>The motion detection is very sensitive. Even at the lowest setting it is activated by small animals such as birds, cats, etc. Because of this, the camera is activated very often, which runs the battery down quite fast. I find myself recharging the batteries about once every two weeks on average. sometimes sooner, but not usually longer.<br/><br/>Also, when something does activate the camera, I sometimes won't know what did it. The camera takes so long to "wake up", that whatever triggered it is often out of sight before it can be captured on video. That kind of defeats the whole purpose, doesn't it? I've had packages delivered to my front door, and the camera activates just in time to catch the back of the delivery person walking away. There is also an approximately 15 to 30 second delay between the time the camera is activated and the time I get an alert on my phone.<br/><br/>The picture quality in HD mode is very good, however, The motion is ridiculously choppy, forcing me to use SD if I want to actively monitor a camera. The SD ain't bad, but it ain't great either.<br/><br/>======== The Bottom Line ========<br/>I think this system is a great idea, and I really want to love it, but it definitely has some rough edges that need smoothing.<br/><br/>I would/will not rely on this system for security purposes, (as it currently exists.) That being said, I bought these cameras mainly to monitor my pets when they are outside. Though I find this system to be too unreliable for any security needs that I might have, it suits my basic needs as regards the monitoring of my furry friends. It helps that I am retired and am home pretty much 24/7 and can tend to the cameras as needed.<br/><br/>However, should I find myself needing cameras for security purposes, I will purchase hard wired cameras that can be monitored 24/7.<br/><br/>I think that this system's biggest problem is the software and I will keep the cameras I have and hold out hope that the software will be improved.<br/><br/>I took away one star for poor battery life.<br/>I took away one star for unreliability (self disconnection, software, etc.)<br/><br/>These are my personal opinions based entirely upon my own experience with this camera system and software. Your experience may be different.</span>

<span>I bought two cameras, set up was little complicated for me as I'm not the most Tech savy.  After set up they both worked as I had hoped, (I went to a youtube video that really made it easier) and the Mfg. has had a few upgrades since.  The last upgrade did require some help from them, but they did help me solve the latest problem due to a recent APP upgrade and they were most helpful!</span>

<span>I’ve used this for months and have only charged twice. It tells you when you need to take it down and recharge. I’m a widow and I set it up, installed and manage it myself easily. I live in the country and what I really like is that I get an alert with each motion detection and I can check to see who’s at the door. I was able to talk through the phone with the camera even if I was in town, but since an update to the app- I can’t seem to get the live communication to work and the whole app isn’t as simple to operate as it was originally. Haven’t had much time to fuss around with it- but overall a good value for the money. Photos are better than the bank when they post robbery photos for sure!</span>

<span>These cameras are great for the price. We are really happy with them and have no complaints. They work almost too well with the motion detection. Bugs flying by will set it off even on low sensitivity. But I’d rather have that problem than it not detecting anything at all. The image quality isn’t bad either. I like that it has different modes you can switch between. I also like that it has 2 way sound communication. Like I said, not bad cameras for the price. Happy with our purchase.</span>

<span>This camera was recommended by a friend who wanted to keep watch on her pet when she was away. I was hesitate because of all the negative reviews but I went with it based off the recommendation and I’m glad I did. The setup was very easy on my apple phone . I haven’t used the motion sensor feature or night vision so I can’t speak of that but I like that you can save certain camera views so you don’t have to manually move the camera you can just click on the saved screenshot .

<span>This is great camera for those locations where you need active monitoring.  I carry a couple with me as I travel to use at a location doesn't need a full blown camera security system, but just a way to remotely monitor an area or employees.  For that these cameras are great.  Setup can be done in about 5 minutes, and the ability to remotely move the field of vision is a great feature on such an inexpensive web camera.  Picture quality is also great, and the night vision works well too.  I which the desktop software worked better and was easier to use, as I would rather store my video locally than in the cloud.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I recently adopted a one-year old dog through a local rescue agency, and, very dishearteningly, I soon learned that the situation from which my dog had been pulled was an extremely abusive one, where most of the dogs were left to fend for themselves or kept in groups in cardboard boxes. At only five pounds, Lily, my new (and most wonderful) friend, has had a great deal of anxiety as a consequence of these early-life experiences. When I leave my house to run errands on which she cannot accompany me, I crate her, and I have been (out of my own dog-guardian anxiety!) worried about how she handles my absence during those periods. A colleague of mine suggested Wansview, and she could not have been more correct.<br/><br/>Reviews of the application through which the Wansview camera works (I will discuss set-up momentarily) paint a curiously negative picture, some saying that recent changes in the application have made it difficult to sustain a connection with the camera. I downloaded the application, as the instructions requested, and I began the setup process. I thought I had done it properly and was thus surprised when the camera could not seem to establish an audiovisual connection between its recording lens and my cellphone. Here, two points must be noted, both of which will hopefully gesture toward the quality of the product and the excellent customer service Wansview offers.<br/><br/>First, the error on my part--the instructions say clearly that a new user must wait to hear certain phrases emitted by the camera's microphone to confirm that it is completely operational. Due to hasty reading on my part, I did not notice the final phrase for which one was supposed to wait, the content of which offered confirmation of a secure, steady Internet signal. Within about ten minutes of the camera having been installed, I received a notification to update my firmware to the latest version (this notification was not the consequence of any complaint I had registered; it was simply the application informing me that new firmware was available). I downloaded the firmware, and the feed began to work. Since then, I have never had a problem with accessing the feed, and I am able to check in on Lily while I am running errands. Never having owned a dog, I have had my fair share of first-dog anxiety, and I am now able to determine how long after my departure Lily whines (steadily decreasing and now only lasting a few minutes) and check in on her while she is in her crate to ensure that she is sleeping and safe. The relief of that knowledge alone makes the product worthwhile. The quality of the feed is also excellent, so much so that I play it in its SD variety (I haven't needed to go the HD route because everything is already clear as crystal). The application is incredibly easy to use, and since the successful installation I have not had to do anything.<br/><br/>Now, for the second point. Between my initial installation of the application and the ten to fifteen minutes it took for the firmwarm to update and for the camera to start working (during that time I could not maintain or open a connection between the camera's feed and my cellphone), I sent an e-mail to Wansview's customer service department. One of their agents, Melody, responded within 24 hours. Not only did she provide me with instructions on how to begin to assess what the potential issue might be and how she could help me address that, she explained that Wansview so stands by its products that if my camera proved defective I could return it at no charge or have it replaced. Because the camera was already working, I made a note to myself to reply to her e-mail later in the day.<br/><br/>When, due to my own error, I forgot to reply to Melody's message, confirming that the camera was indeed working, she followed up me with via e-mail to confirm that I had received her message and to ask what she could do to help ensure that the camera was working. I do not know if I have ever had a customer-service experience during which a company representative reached out to me a second time because I mistakenly failed to reply to their first message. In her second message, she reiterated her commitment to helping me ensure that the product worked properly and that Wansview's ethic was one that stood behind the quality of its products and the quality of customers' experiences with those products. I immediately replied, thanked her for her message, and explained how happy I was with the quality of the product.<br/><br/>In short, even if you experience any issues with this camera during setup, it seems like Wansview takes very seriously its commitment to customer service. As someone not altogether fluent in techno-gadgetry, the abundant interest in helping to ensure that I could use the camera with use certainly marks out Wansview as unique in my experience. And, the price is a terribly affordable one. All in all, I would encourage anyone to consider buying this camera, and, if they choose to do so, to buy it with the ease of knowing that there is an active customer-service team happy to interface with you and help resolve any issues.</span>

Very easy to set up, just make sure the back of you QR code is white, I had a bit of trouble since I had my phone in night mode and the back of the code was black, the camera didn’t read it like that but once I figured this out everything went smoothly. I have alarms set up for movement inside the house, sometimes it gets triggered by the change in light at sunrise and sunset which I like to see and it reminds me to take a look at the house every day. For me this has been one of the best purchases I have made. Excellent image and sound quality, specially night vision, also the sound and speaker system work great! Totally recommend this camera!<br/><br/>Esta cámara es fantástica para usarla dentro de casa! Tengo una propiedad en México, ahí tengo  de estas cámaras, me encanta poder ver lo que está pasando allá, me da mucha tranquilidad, esto significa que puedes instalar la cámara en cualquier lugar y ver las imágenes desde cualquier lugar del mundo a través de la app. Muy fácil de instalar, solo recomiendo que el fondo del código QR sea blanco, yo batalle al principio porque tenía mi teléfono en modo nocturno y el fondo del código era negro, la cámara no lo leía, pero cuando me di cuenta de esto, la instalación fue inmediata. Puse que me enviara notificaciones cuando hubiera movimiento en la casa y a veces la alarma se activa con el cambio de la luz del amanecer y atardecer, lo cuales me gusta ver y me recuerda a echar un vistazo a la casa todos los días. Para mí ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho. Excelente imagen y sonido, especialmente la visión nocturna, también el sistema para oír y hablar a través de la app funciona muy bien.

<span>I bought this to check in on my cats when I’m out for extended periods of time. It took me about 2 hours to figure out how to set it up, as I couldn’t get it to connect to my local network. This ended up being user error, not a product problem but my experience with customer support wasn’t great. Granted, it is a Sunday, I had to wait about 45 mins for someone to respond to me via chat and by that point I had finally reached someone via phone. After getting all of my personal info, she asked if this was my first time setting up a device (which it was) and proceeded to tell me she was going to send me a step-by-step instruction video. She didn’t ask any specifics and did not offer to help me any further. Total time spent with customer support was about 2 hours and I never even ended up receiving the video… or support. After some googling, I figured out what I was doing wrong and then it only took me about 10 mins to finishing setting up. Overall, I’m quite impressed with the quality of the product for its price point. I considered a Blink camera but ultimately chose this one for its ability to pan and rotate, which allows me to see different areas of my apartment. There is a talk feature as well. I’m excited to test it out when it is dark. Would recommend.</span>

<span>I have had security cameras about 20 some years now, first all hard wired then later wireless with cameras like this.  I think I had 14 setup at one time, now down to 9, soon to 10 as I am adding another one of these.  If you want to complain about quality and features not being the same as the much more expensive cameras, buy one, this is an under $30 camera.  Think I got it for $23 so even it it only lasts a year, it's $23-$30 you simply buy another one.<br/><br/>This is nice but it's a simple rotatable camera.  The image quality is very nice, make sure to check the settings as it's default is NOT 1080, much lower.  You don't have to worry about cloud storage or paying for storage as you can just get as many cards as you want.  These are indoor cameras, so not going to be hard to swap the card out if/when needed.  Mine is mounted in the top of a doorway so I can monitor 2 rooms, and I can swap out the card easily in seconds.<br/><br/>You need to tweak the settings and movements to "your" liking.  I have mine set to continuously record 24/7, also alert to certain movements.  Like I mentioned earlier, just let it record and dont be cheap and buy the smallest storage card you can, buy the largest one you can or even 2 so you can swap them out and save recordings "if" that is what you want to do.</span>

<span>Pleasantly surprised by this camera! I ordered 2 out of emergency since I have 6 pets 🫣 and I’m loving them so far. I used to have Conico, a similar one. However after a year it broke down. Was sent a replacement and then that one also broke down after a year. Surprise surprise, company no longer exists so I was in the market for something just as affordable and that also moved. I read the mixed reviews on this one but took the chance anyway. I received them same day and they were really easy to set up. I’m really impressed so far- I’m able to view from both cameras at the same time, night mode is automatic and very clear image, I get notifications when there’s movement. My only complaints are that the controls to move the camera around lag a little. So if you hold down, you end up too far one side so then you have to keep trying until you get a good angle. But you can pre-set certain angles like “favorites,” that when you press it it’ll move to it instantly. It’s a time saver. Very neat feature! Also the color on the camera isn’t as bright but it’s not a deal breaker. Overall I highly recommend it!</span>

<span>These are pretty good little cameras, wired (just for power, I mean) 2.5 GHz WiFi.. BUT, I'm giving them good credit because of customer support they have. Or at least 1 of them and that's at the time of writing this although, I don't see any reason it would change. (Just in the off chance that should change, we're not looking to hang that one guy who said on Amazon that these people had "good customer service") Mine wasn't a big issue but they were persistent in getting me taken care of. That's much better than the alternative. At any rate, it's just little light cameras in plastic cases but so far been reliable, nice app, and good picture and stuff so yea, I might get a couple more of them so they stay with one app. Much easier that way.. Imagine that, right..</span>

<span>Day or night the quality is good, the price of the camera  is lower and it has free features where similar cameras have subscriptions fees and add ons. No subscription fee for the app, but you have the choice to purchase cloud storage at good rate. They’re easy to install and connect to the internet. The seller emailed me prior to arrival with instructions for the wifi connection and a phone number if I had any issues. This is my 2nd order from LAView and their customer care is amazing. I have comfort knowing that my home is safer and that the company stands by their product.</span>
