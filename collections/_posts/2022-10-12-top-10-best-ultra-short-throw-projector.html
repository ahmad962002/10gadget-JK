<span>I tried really hard to like this projector, but I just can’t.<br/><br/>I bought this projector to replace the Optoma HD27HDR.  Well, I have decided to return the GT5600 instead for the following reasons.<br/><br/>1.  The GT5600 has a noticeable scratch on the INSIDE of the glass that covers the lens.  I thought it was on the outside, but when I tried to clean it, thinking it was just tape residue, I realized the problem was on the inside of the unit.<br/>2. I tried it for 2 days. At least once on each day, the unit would not turn on.  The light indicated blue, but the unit just would not power up.  I had to unplug and plug the unit back in before it would boot up upon hitting the remote power button.<br/>3. The unit DOES NOT project well on a white wall.  Videos indicated this was an option for this projector, but it is not.  For this to work well, you would need an ultra smooth wall with absolutely no dents, no variation in paint, no little divots in the paint, etc.  It must be flawless or this projector will cast a shadow on absolutely every little hole or raised surface on the wall causing your picture to look very grainy.<br/>4. There seems to be more of a blur or jitter with this projector.  Watching it at above 80”s caused me great nausea.  The nausea subsided a bit when I brought the screen size down to around 73”s.  My Optoma HD27HDR also projects at around 73”s and I have never felt nausea with that equipment.<br/>5. Comparing the projectors side by side, the HD27HDR casts a clearer picture on the wall and does not cause me nausea.  The GT5600 allows for a much larger screen and seems a little brighter than the HD27HDR, but the flaws with this unit are just too great to overlook.</span>

<span>Update Sept. 18, 2022 - Dropped down to two stars because the Optoma stopped recognizing the HDMI ports, so no more streaming! We tried with both our Roku and our Fire sticks, but while they would work on our displays, there was no output through the Optoma.<br/><br/>We would be totally screwed if I had not also bought the 3yr extended warranty from Asurion. It was a bit of a runaround with them at first too, but eventually they provided a shipping label and took it under examination. It took them 3 weeks or so, but they fixed it! The projector once more is able to stream from either of the HDMI ports. Hurrah for Asurion! However, for a device that is largely solid state and software it's pretty unacceptable that in addition to the trouble with the remote, that the device stopped recognizing that devices were in either of the HDMI ports. Now I feel like we're living on borrowed time and once the extended warranty ends, we'll be screwed. BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!<br/><br/>UPDATE July 28, 2022 - dropped a star based on the Customer Service snippiness.<br/><br/>UPDATE Jan. 22, 2022 - I'm still LOVING IT! Keep lens cover dusted off every so often.<br/><br/>UPDATE Nov. 2, 2021 - Remote "on" and "off" buttons began to stop working or work only after numerous presses. Obviously, we changed the batteries, but this problem has persisted. Finally ordered a replacement remote. Hoping this is just a one-off issue. Also, the LED lights on the remote are painfully bright in a dark room. Haven't found a way to adjust their brightness yet. Dropped it a star, but overall, I'm still LOVING IT!<br/><br/>UPDATE Feb. 5, 2021 - We continue to project directly on our bare wall and have placed the projector ~16.75" above floor and ~15.5" from wall (measuring from wall to front of projector) and we have a HUGE image (110"+) with fine resolution at 1080p!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW - Have been looking at this for a while as wife wanted a projector rather than a regular TV. Refurbished ones are sometimes available for under $900. Plasma TV finally died and after looking at laser UST at double the price, we went with the Optoma that still uses a lamp. Wife watches way more than 4hrs/day + falls asleep with TV on, so we figure we'll not get 10yrs from the lamp. If we get only a year, I'll know the lamp-life claims are a lie (so many of these bulb claims are). Meantime, everything else is grand.<br/><br/>Projecting on just the wall (not even a white wall) the image is bright and defined. At about 16" from the wall we have a 62" diagonal image. We're looking at ways to place about 25" from the wall so we can have a much larger image. There's a projector website that tells you how far to place the projector to obtain the image size you want. For 100" it's still over 2 feet from the wall despite this being UST. We'll figure that out.<br/><br/>I'll update in a year with my thoughts then. Oh, purchased that third-party warranty for $60, just in case.</span>

<span>It’s true HD 1080P , setup was easy. Everything works, plays blu-rays in great detail, even streaming services look great, has an aux jack out for sound to a surround system if your crazy audio specific about your sound, otherwise it has an onboard speaker. Overall a great investment. Even plays 3D movies with a pair of DLP link Glasses, just make sure you have a 3D Blu ray media and a blu ray player that can play 3D.<br/><br/>did not have the white around the LCD , that some complain about, where your picture on the wall ends and there would be slivers if light escaping around from how the LCD screen was installed in front of the lamp.<br/><br/>I’ve used it with a Mac, a PC, Apple TV, Google Chromcast, it just works. Do not expect a 4K picture from a 1080p device, cause 4K is like 4 1080p devices stacked around each other.<br/><br/>You can use a silver screen to improve screen image, but a smooth regular white wall looks amazing too!<br/><br/>I can have lights on in the room and it not affect the image, stays bright and crisp. But once you turn the lights off, the images get deeper and brighter.<br/><br/>If your looking for a large screen, but don’t want a Large TV, than I would totally suggest this.</span>

<span>First, I'd like to point out that before ordering the Gt5600, I had tried out the CinemaX P1 4k UST. The CinemaX had much better picture quality (being 4k), better color and was way brighter. Though I returned the CinemaX because it has a lot of problems with input lag on the laser unit, which is pretty much not a thing on bulb projectors. Not only did the lag affect input for gaming, but also audio synchronization between the built-in speaker and external receiver/speakers on that 4k unit.<br/><br/>The GT5600 has very low input lag, I just plug my PS4 into my receiver then to the projector and don't notice any issues. It just works and that's important. There is a little useless speaker built in which I just mute - there is no reason to build a speaker into a projector when most people buying a projector should have a proper surround sound system already.<br/><br/>The unit is bright enough to view content in the day time, though its definitely not great in day time and hard to see dark scenes with low contrast. I'm very happy compared to my previous HD20 projector which was not even usable in the day.<br/><br/>There are a few issues I'd like to mention as to why I docked a star. First, for all UST projectors it seems, you will need to invest in a pro screen because projecting onto a wall results in wavy/distorted image - this problem is really visible with USTs, where as the previous long throw projector had no such issues. Its not something wrong with the unit, but it should be noted as a requirement.<br/>Second, there is infrequent 'flashes' from the bulb when watching in Eco mode. I researched this and many others also experience the same thing with this unit. Sources say to run it on bright mode for a few months to fix it, which is sad because the fan is loud in bright mode. The fan is very quiet and not noticeable in eco mode.</span>

<span>I went from a Casio laser to this one, and it was worth it.<br/><br/>Picture is excellent.<br/><br/>Ease of use is easy<br/><br/>Google play and apps, if needed<br/><br/>On 100% brightness, it’s as loud as any projector on high output, but when it’s on less than 100%, it’s pretty quiet, and you’re quite possibly gonna have a subwoofer on so, the noise will not be heard.<br/><br/>Adjusting is easy once you figure out to make the picture big and make smaller because it doesn’t zoom out right out the box. That might not make sense, but if you have one it does.<br/><br/>Remote is like an Amazon fire tv remote, but less effective on fire tv.<br/><br/>Tv hdmi auto turn on link, that I have to work on. My PS4 will turn on the projector, but the fire cube won’t. I’ll figure that out. Lol<br/><br/>It’s not little like a long throw projector. So have ample space to set it up. It’s bout as big as a laser disc player or a Xbox controller.<br/><br/>It sits out in the open. So it you have kids that’s learning to walk, this would be a concern, other than that, the whole picture turns off if you enter the lasers path.<br/><br/>Overall, it’s a gonna work out<br/><br/>UPDATE: The projector has a standby mode that will let the HDMI auto link work better at auto turning on, but you still have to grab the remote and turn off the projector manually. I need to try harder at getting everything to turn off and on with one click. 😎</span>

<span>I received this projector only yesterday, had it for less than 24 hour but I am so impressed with ease of set-up and picture quality, I am rushing to write review.<br/><br/>It was a breeze to set-up. Just follow the step-by-step instructions that comes with the projector.<br/>Adjusting picture size, and shapes are unbelievably simple. This is our first ever projector of any kind so I can not compare with other UST or conventional projectors.<br/><br/>I also have seen numerous complaints about the fan noise, however, I did not find it as troublesome as others. We have less than 10 feet of viewing distance. At this distance fan isn't whisper quiet but it isn't overwhelmingly loud either. The fan is very loud when the projector is first powered-up but it quiets down in a couple of minutes. Another important thing to keep in mind is level of "light-output". At 100%, the fan noise is extremely high, but in normal viewing mode at 80% or below, it is pretty quiet. The picture is plenty bright at 80% light output level.<br/><br/>Regarding the picture brightness, contrast, HDR, color saturation: I found the projector excelling in all of these. We do not have an ALR screen, it is being projected on a beige wall. We don't find the colors off at all.  we have to try using it during day and see how it holds-up.<br/>It is bit annoying to set-up Google account for using the built-in Android TV. Not sure if you can use Android TV without Google account. Android TV supports many streaming Apps natively but not Netflix. Go figure!<br/>Netflix can be streamed one of the three ways: via YouTube TV or Chromecast or Roku or some other external streaming device. I was able to set-up HBOMAX, SHOWTIME, and PBS but haven't had success with using built-in Chromecast for casting Netflix. Currently only YouTube TV works for Netflix. Bult-in Google voice assistant works really well.<br/><br/>Overall, a great projector for someone looking for great picture and sound out of box without professional installation and special mounting, wiring, etc. It is full HD, we did not find picture quality lacking in any way, don't see need for a 4K yet. Portability is a definite plus. I would not recommend moving it often since adjusting image shape and size could be annoying on a less than ideal surface.<br/>I definitely recommend this projector.</span>

<span>WOW. Just wow I REALLY do love epson and I love what they did with this projector. It's the best UST in it's class and price range but 1 HUGE issue if not paired with a UST ALR screen is that you tend to need to run it in 85% or higher light output which in turn. Turns this thing into a mini jet. I mean it got really loud. Even 12ft away it was louder than my HC2150 that hangs right above my head. Which is sadly why I'll be returning it. Also the picture menu was nowhere to be found unlike that of my previous epsons. There was only 1 remote in the box and I did not find it useful at all for calibration. Set up wasn't as easy as traditional projectors either oddly enough since it sits below the screen. This is a light cannon for sure though. The true to life colors and the lack of motion blur made watching 2 movies and 2 shows very enjoyable at night and at 70% light output to reduce noise. Overall great unit but ONLY if you 100% need a UST.</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>- Short throw, yes it works well<br/>- Speaker embedded, Yamaha is not my choice of speakers but the combination of projector+speaker is good<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Noise, brightness is related to fan speed. Very noticeable fan noise when brightness is high<br/>- One one audio out option only (the optical one). Would give 5 star should it also has a regular 3.5mm audio output. Come on Epson</span>

<span>Update Nov 16, 2020:  Samsung finally reached out to me and a member of their engineering team who works on these projectors called.  Clearly knowledgeable.  We are working on the focus issue and how to resolve, if possible.  Seen some improvement but still not "perfect".  That said the LSP7T is far better than the Optoma P1 or P2 and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone vs any of the other sub-4k USTs on the market.<br/><br/>Update Nov 6, 2020:  Now going on 4 hours spent trying to find a Samsung technical representative that handles these projectors.  Spoke to over 10 reps, transferred every time and none say they know anything about these UST projectors.  Constant run around and there is NO WAY to reach anyone other than overseas who reads from a script.<br/><br/>Original review:  I received the projector on October 24th.  So far the experience has been pretty good but there are a few issues that I have with the projector that Samsung needs to address before I can rate this thing "5 stars" for the money.<br/><br/>First the good:<br/>1. Vivid picture with good colors for a projector.  I can compare this to the Optoma P1 and P2 and say that it has better picture quality imo, not by a huge amount but enough to give it an edge.<br/>2. Software platform is rock solid as you would expect from Samsung.  Again, comparing to Optoma it's a night and day difference.<br/>3. Connection/HDMI stability is also super rock solid with no issues whatsoever on a variety of sources.  In my configuration I'm using a Denon AVC8500H connected to a CAAVO Control Center (and also with the Caavo removed) with multiple sources tested at 4k 60hz and lower resolutions:  Xbox One X, Nvidia Shield Pro, Fire TV Stick 4k and Cube, Nintendo Switch and W10 PC with Geforce 2080ti at 4k 60hz.  All ran without a hitch.  Great!<br/>4. Used with an Elite Screens CLR (not the 2 or 3, just the CLR).  Great combo.  Daytime (slightly light controlled room) and night both looked great (with nighttime obviously looking fantastic).<br/>5. Fan noise is non-existent.  Completely silent.<br/>6. Projector turns on and shuts down perfectly with CEC control.<br/>7. Start up time is in seconds (haven't directly timed it but I would put it around 10 seconds).  Very good imo.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. Focus issues at the corners and edges from mid to top.  It's enough to be distracting on content with text, lines or other details where sharpness is important.  I'm working on contacting Samsung about the issue.<br/>2. Some shadow crushing in live content especially in scenes that are generally darkly lit.  Not "bad" but as with the focus enough to be distracting.  Could be due to calibration but I think it's the nature of the projector.  It is not enough for me to dislike the projector it's just something I wish was better.<br/><br/>Overall I like the projector more and more as I use it, especially when comparing to the Optoma units I had previously (the P1 and P2).  However the focus issue needs addressed and imo should not be present in a $3300 projector.  I will update once I hear back from Samsung.<br/><br/>Lastly I may move up to the LSP9T at some point depending on what I hear back from Samsung on the focus issue and how much better the blacks/shadows might be on the more expensive unit.</span>

<span>its good. Gaming does not have noticeable delay, but alot of these things are broken. Read the reviews. Mine came to my home and the 2nd hdmi port loses signal. Now the sound keeps cutting out. Samsung need to work the bugs out. I herd the 130 one is better built. I like this projector alot and I'm going to see if the 130 is better. If so im keeping it. But alot of them are defective. Be aware. Up date. I bought the 130. I got it used because 6,500 was just too much. All in all after taxes I paid 6000. Still high. Now. The three laser will blow you away. I've always wanted a projector that just did not have that washed out look. I want the colors to be as vivid as an oled or a qled. This thing is way more vivid than an oled. imagine having a laser pointer and point it at the wall. Those are your colors. You have laser colors. Deep vivid saturated blues, red,greens purple and the black are deep. Im keeping it. Now there are issues. The hdmi port has not gone out but the sound has stopped once in a while in the middle of a movie. The sound on the 130 is incredible. Oh my gosh this thing as speakes. Way way louder then the 120. I have gone through projector and projector to find the right one. I notice those small things that normal customers don't. There is no ghosting when playing games. The input lag is good. I dont know what it is but its very very reasonable. If you owned the optimal p2, its better then that one. I was impressed by the p2 as well but the game input lag was ridiculous. Oh and the Epson ls5000. Thise colors are sooo washed out but game lag is almost not even there. The ls3000 has better colors but you won't get a 4k picture. Its pretty crisp though and the colors are good. Not as good as the optima p2. You want amazing looking colors deep black crisp picture and a banging sound system the samsung is it. Its good. Samsung needs to iron out the kinks though. Once they do. Wow just wow.</span>

<span>This is probably one of the best UST projectors you can buy for $2,500 -$3,500. The picture quality is really good. It's also very quiet. The only issue was that I had to play with the settings and adjust the frame rate speed for watching sports. There was a bit of a blur when the players moved. Now that I adjusted the settings I don't notice it anymore.</span>

<span>I like LG a lot, from AV stuff to washers and dryers, they rarely disappoint.  I am still quite happy with the OLED TV I bought in 2017.  This projector, however, is a mixed bag and it is not clear which niche it is meant to fill.  It is not really portable, it is dim, it is rather expensive, it is difficult to align.  Less wiring is required than for a ceiling mounted projector but that is hardly the justification for the price tag.<br/><br/>This projector is difficult to align, given that the throwing angle accentuates any misalignment; therefore, it should really be bolted down, not sitting on a dresser as pictured.  The speaker is very weak, I am not sure why it is even there.  This projector is also quite dim; it ok for my daughter's cartoons but no gaming can happen during the day because of the small amount of light getting around the blackout curtains.  So, while it is technically "portable" it is not really portable.  The set up is laborious, extra speakers are required, and the room has to be very dark.  Not to mention, if the goal is to show a presentation, there are far cheaper and more compact options available.<br/><br/>Now, of course, the short throw feature is very impressive.  However, it also accentuates any wall imperfection.  Our house was built in 1901 and, due to many remodels and the natural settling, our walls are not 100% flat.  Looking at the projected picture, one might think that the wall is inches off from flat in some spots but that is just the consequence of the angled picture.  Of course, one could use a projector screen.  But, at that point, why not also get a brighter ceiling mounted projector for half the price?<br/><br/>Finally, maybe I am spoiled by the 4 K OLED, but 1080 P pixels are distinguishable even when the image is 8 ft or so in diagonal.  Gaming-wise, that is a turn off.</span>

<span>Buy at your own risk I love my projector and really enjoyed it for 8 months. I then noticed a tiny off-color spot that wasnt changing colors with the rest of the projector. Sent it in for repairs under warranty in original packaging with a microfiber cloth of my own over the lens and mirror to protect it. LG sends it back with the same off color pixel that that wasnt fixed.<br/><br/>Support Contact<br/>- First Contact Representative forgot to put in my repair and waited a week for shipping labels that were never coming.<br/>- Second Contact (Product has been shipped at this point) -  Representative says it will be 2 weeks longer than originally estimated. Not a big deal as long as its fixed yet<br/><br/>Intermission - Projector comes back with the same issue I sent it in for...<br/><br/>Third Contact with support -  emailed using LG's support center on there website, and received a phone number where the guy said he was only for TV's and couldn't transfer me to the projector department specialists as he didn't have his transfer phone number list at home. (Were in a pandemic but I mean give the guy a list of phone numbers.)<br/>Fourth Contact with support - I think it may be something with the lens at this point and contact online chat support again to be told they dont recommend I do anything to it myself and that I send it back in.<br/><br/>LG Paid for shipping each time, but at this point I have lost faith in there technicians to turn on and test a product that they "fix", and I have lost faith in there Customer service to provide me with a proper fix to my problem. No one was rude to me and every support member was professional, but running in circles isn't very much fun.</span>

<span>So many advantages. Great picture...maybe not the contrast depth of the newest TVs...but a great picture boneless, HUGE picture when down on your living room wall...I love it! Only be sure that you have either a white or very light color, smooth,  wall. Any paint textures take away from the picture quality. An inexpensive wall screen helps of you have textured walls. Very convenient in that is small in the event you want to move it to another room or across the country...and it can be placed on the same wall you want to project on rather than find a way to project it from the back wall or from a ceiling mount. If it had a leveling or elevation mechanism I would have given it 5 stars</span>

<span>I really loved this projector. This is my first projector and I am completely happy with it so far.<br/><br/>1. It's ultra short throw serves the purpose for use in medium sized room. Ultra short throw gives a huge screen just few inches away from wall.<br/>2. Very portable. It is light weight and small size, so you can change it's location from your living room to bed room or wherever needed.<br/>3.Bluetooth connectivity is great. It gets connected easily with my Bose Acoustimass V series (attached to Onkyo receiver using bluetooth) and powerbeats bluetooth earphones.  So only wire comes out of projector is power cord.. that's it.<br/>4. I hooked up my amazon firestick and chromecast. it works perfectly with both devices.<br/>5. Most important, brightness is perfect for dark room and fair with little ambient light. I have read many reviews saying that brightness is so bad with ambient light but I feel it is good with ambient light too. But yes, Lumens can be improved to use it with ambient light and then I can say it is best projector.<br/>6. Picture quality is very crisp and amazing.I loved it.<br/>7. WebOs 3.0 has enough app options to watch movies e.g. netflix, vudu etc. It's web browser is great, so you can enjoy the websites which does not have apps on webos. Unfortunately I did not find youtube app but if you use chromecast of amazon firestick then you don't need anything else.<br/>8. Magic remote is great which makes navigation easy. It feels like a huge laptop screen and you have a wireless optical mouse in your palm.<br/><br/>Generally I do not write such big and descriptive reviews but I loved this projector and wanted to describe as much as I can.</span>

<span>I am very pleased with this projector.  I love the ultra short throw...it's great not to have wires running across my ceiling as with my other projector.  The magic remote takes a little getting used to, but it's ok.  For my application, I only use it to control volume, since I have my HDMI inputs going through a video switch then up to the projector.  I highly recommend the projector.<br/>One other note: because of it's design, the lens and the mirror do tend to collect dust, so I keep a cloth over it when not in use, but I wonder if there isn't a better solution.  Of course, if you attach to the ceiling, then it wouldn't be an issue.</span>

<span>Update:  Had this for 2 months now and like it a great deal.  The problems mentioned below are still the same.  That is WebOS on this thing is slow to respond.  My guess is they put in little memory and a slow processor.  Streaming is also a bit rough around the edges.  I am 10 feet away from a 5Ghz router that can stream 4K to my LG tv upstairs with no problem but this projector has issues streaming and buffering.<br/>I found it best to hook this up to a streaming device like a Roku and just run channels from there.  The combination is perfect as Roku's can buffer video much better and are much more resilient.<br/>____________________<br/>Had this since Christmas and it works well.  It does require the projector to be quite close to the screen.  15 - 20 inches.<br/><br/>The chief complaint about this is the WebOS... I don't hate WebOS, but on this device it is very slow compared to the other LG tv I have.  Even going into settings take a great deal of patience.<br/><br/>It does work well with JBL bluetooth speakers and even paired well with my headphones.<br/><br/>The image looks good though the colors could be a little more saturated.  It isn't too bad and for a projector for this price it's quite good.</span>

<span>I must say this projector has surpassed my expectations for it. The quality of the image is definitely better than previous LG LED projectors I've had. The size, the weight, the carry case you can buy separately, all make for a perfect blend of good quality image and portability.<br/><br/>I use projectors as I find them extremely easy to carry around if you move a lot. Considering I'm moving to another country soon, I've found that transporting a small projector can be much easier than a large TV. That being said, there are certain trade-offs from ultra short throw (UST) projectors that people should consider when buying. Something that could be improved for this LG projector is Web OS. I've found that other interfaces such as Roku are easier and faster to use.<br/><br/>In my case, UST projectors are the ideal scenario as my room is large enough to have a big screen but is somewhat limited on where I can put a regular projector (and mounting on the ceiling is not an option). I've been using the LG PB63U LED Projector, but I have to place it in a some what uncomfortable place to have a good projection and the image quality is not the best either. One additional problem I've encountered with regular projectors is cable handling. I've had to resort to wireless (chromecast) casting to avoid the hassle of running cables across the room. For instance, when I want to play video games with the projector with my computer, I have to run the HDMI cable through the middle of the room which isn't ideal. Same goes for audio. UST projectors definitely fix this issue as everything can sit close together and the cables are no longer a problem.<br/><br/>There are three main inconveniences I can think off regarding UST projectors. First, as you probably have observed already, they are usually more expensive than regular projectors. Second, dust is a minor problem as it is easier for them to accumulate dust near the mirror and you want the mirror to be as clean as possible always (covering it up with a cloth should do the trick). Third, given the high angle they are capable of projecting too, they tend to show small defects on the screen you are using. For example, if you are projecting directly into a wall with minor defects, these will become more noticeable when using UST. As an example, I projected into a wall that had a hole filled with paste and was barely noticeable to the eye, but when projecting to it, the upper boundary of the projection was slightly bent downwards due to this defect. The same can be said for pull down screen. Usually these types of screens (at least the cheaper ones like the one I have) tend to bend a little in the sides after some time. This bending will affect the image displayed by UST while its not a real problem for regular projectors. If you plan on buying a UST projector, make sure that the screen you are using is suitable for UST projectors (for example, permanent screens are a much better option than pull downs).<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps people who are deciding on what type of projectors they want to buy, but don't get me wrong, this projector is great!</span>

<span>I have had my HU85LA and 120” Grandview UST screen for two weeks now. Here are my impressions coming from OLED:<br/>Pros:<br/>-Very bright and vivid colors<br/>-Fan noise not very loud<br/>-Does not give off a lot of heat<br/>-120” is very immersive compared to my 65” OLED<br/>-ATSC Digital Tuner<br/>-3 Lasers (1 Red, 1 Blue, 1 Blue with Static Phosphor for Green)<br/>-120" Screen at only 7.2" from wall to back of projector<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-No color black option<br/>-Ordered first one from amazon new and it had a very loud coil whine. Returned and bought open box from another authorized dealer and this one does not have coil whine. If it does it hardly noticeable compared to the first one. YMMV.<br/>-Placement is almost impossible to perfect. I’ve spent over 12 hours total easily adjusting feet, position and screen where I wanted to pull my hair out and how tedious it is to get picture aligned. See attached setup with less than ideal stand but finally got it 97% fit with NO edge adjustment.<br/>Advice: screen flatness is key. I had to remove tension from mounting bracket to alleviate most of the fit issue. Thinking Tightening the brackets would make the screen more flat but it did the opposite. Also if your wall it not perfectly flat, it will cause alignment issues.<br/>-Struggles to output video without static fuzzy and black screen flickering when ATV4K set to Match Frame Rate On. Have to restart the projector to fix video output. Hit or miss if a video plays with it turned on.<br/>-No HLG support (ATSC 3.0 when rolled out to US will use HLG format)<br/>-No Apple TV app, HomeKit, Disney+ app etc support for expensive mid-high end USTPJ (but most have streaming device to AVR so not complete deal breaker)<br/>-Blacks are sacrificed but Dynamic Tone Mapping takes what is bearable to watch and then makes dark scenes unwatchable<br/>-120" screen edges start to lose focus and appears to maintain sharp edges at 110" and not so much at the max<br/><br/>The cons seem big but this is my first projector and media room so it was a big learning experience. I installed myself so growing pains are expected. I do love the upgrade from OLED to Projector mainly because I wanted immersive viewing experience and could sacrifice the perfect blacks and dark highlights. In the dark, movies look very good after using calibration settings found online. Shadow detail is definitely lost compared to OLED and more grayish in really dark scenes. Dynamic Tone Mapping fails miserably and recommend to leave it turned off. Dark scenes are even harder to watch with DTM turned on and lose lots of detail to darkness. LG needs to provide a more precise way to adjust the projector on a mount of some kind and or recommendation for ceiling mounting (not sure if that increases alignment difficulty or not). Sony's USTPJ has some vertical/horizontal alignment screen adjustment which this LG sorely needs.<br/><br/>At MSRP, I find this projector hard to recommend against the competitors. Finding an open box is the best value as I did. As expected with new technology and LG first gen UST, you are paying for the initial R&amp;D.</span>

<span>Update 11/23/20<br/>It has been fixed under warranty.  Hopefully if it goes out again it’s within the one year warranty I have left.<br/><br/>Update 11/01/20<br/>The first customer service agent tried to charge me $600 to repair the projector claiming it was no longer under warranty.  It has a two year warranty and I have only owned it for one year.  The second customer service agent agreed to the repair under warranty and is sending me a return label.  Not sure why the first agent was trying to charge me but it worked out the next agent.<br/><br/>Original review<br/>The projector was great for the first year.  About two weeks ago it started showing this grid when I turned it on.  After a few power cycles it would finally turn on.  Then today it stopped turning on all together and after two minutes of sitting there it would display the color blocks again.  I tried to submit a repair claim but they have the feature disabled and it wouldn’t let me submit it.  I tried to chat but that was also disabled because of COVID.  I tried calling and no one answered.  I then resorted to email and hopefully they respond within a few days but I am not holding my breath.</span>

<span>while owning a lg uh80ka 4k laser projector for 2.5 years, i got a lg uh85la for the family room.  uh85la is much better than an already good uh80ka projector.<br/><br/>uh80ka has 3 laser lights so the color is pop and is so much better than uh80ka,  slightly brighter, convenient to install.<br/><br/>before screen arival, i project it to the wall.  i just realized the perfectly looking wall is so curved to UST image and i need to adjust every 12 of adjust points to make it close to square.  after got a nice but lower cost screen, i only need to adjust top line a little bit to make it near perfect.  compared to the front projector, UST is very, very sensitive to the screen quality / flatness.  i can notice when the temperature changed, the stand and floor changed a little, the image size changes a lot.  even adjust focus, the top portion image size changes.  so be very careful when try to install screen.  i had to drill 3 times to hang it right, although there are adjust feet and calculated carefully.<br/><br/>because it still only has 2700 lumens, during day time, i need to close curtains to get better image.<br/><br/>overall, i am 100% satisfied with my new projector.  pricey but worth it imo</span>

<span>My review of Ben V7050i short throw projector. Let me describe myself first. I am approaching this review as a film lover lens only. I am not a gamer.  I am a huge fan of Ben Q. I have purchase 3 projectors from them. The colors are amazing and product is high quality. This is my second 4K ( First one was HT3550). This projector is simple amazing. If I compare it to HT3550( my first review ***.5) to V7050i, this projector blows it away with brightness, detail, and presentation. Yet, it should for the price. This is a short throw projector. I have a small room so my 92 inches screen stand estimate 7-8  inches from screen. I did have little issues installing it. This was because I underestimated the room size and frankly I am in the basement so the floor is not totally flat. That can throw off alot when you install. If you have ideal room, this should not take you no longer than 10 minutes. All the installation issues were my own fault. Use the Ben Q calculator on their site to help with installation. You get two remotes, a machine and one big box. I received it in perfect condition. I purchase it through Amazon because no interest 12 month plan.Yea, another loan ( sarcasm) . Yet, I have no regrets. I will also recommend you if you want more reviews to check out Youtube ( Chris Mejestic, sparechange ,and  projector screen). Now back to review. This machine is a dream for 1st timers or people with limited space.  The instructions I thought were little confusing, yet this could be my inexperience with short throw . But When everything was done, the picture is simple perfect. I love the film making mode. Remember, everyone is different. You might like another mode or you can manually change settings. Right off the bat, the colors are vibrant and detail is astounding. I thought I had it good with the HT3550 4k , but this machine spoils me. It should, it cost twice as much. The brightness is very good. My basement does have ambient light, yet this does a great job with presentation. But when the room is totally dark, this is where it excels. From previous reviews, gamers might be disappointed with lag time. But for me, this is about movies and it does not disappoint. The colors pop out at you. The 3D is fantastic. The black levels are ok. Frankly I would not have notice unless I read reviews about it. They are mostly noticeable in Black and white films. Again, I would not have notice unless I did not read or watch reviews on product. The sound is ok. But guys, if you are going to buy this, get yourself a half way decent sound bar. The streaming devices are fine, but I have it connected with my Rocku. It is a laser projector so you have 20,000 hours of life. I like that it has a protector cover over the Lens when you turn it on and off. Everything about this machine is quality made. Compared to other projectors, this is little above average on size and weight. But not quality and presentation. This machine is an investment for movie watchers. It is a luxury item and you get what you pay for. If you want more for your buck for Ben Q , then you get HT3550. If you want the finest presentation and best movie experience, you get the Ben Q V7050i. Finally, I want to say that I am so happy with this projector. I have been enjoying my 4k films so much lately. The streaming looks fantastic too. Do your research on what you want. For me, This machine was the one for me. 5 stars: strengths: color,  clearity, menu,, brightness, set up, great for small rooms or apartments, remotes, overall prevention of the machine, 3D,  and a huge plus it does not project too much heat and minimum amount of sound. Weakness: price ( you get what you pay for),gaming time ( based on other reviewers ), sound (its ok, it's not Bose), black levels<br/>with black in whites ( yet good enough for me and I am a stickler on film presentation) . I hope this review helps you and have a good day.<br/>One year later: The projector works fine. I still love the presentation .. Yet, I will update  a few things. With this projector, you will not be able to connect a atmos soundbar or system. This projector does not support it. I wish this projector had a 3rd HDMI connector. It would make my life easier. Still, I don't regret getting it.</span>

<span>Picture and brightness are AMAZING. Very very happy with the picture for movies, sports, casual TV watching. 4K HDR is very vibrant. Film Maker Mode is very good for the deeper blacks and true color tones for your high quality cinema viewing. 60hz ref is meh. Would have loved 120hz, but for the price and quality, this projector delivers. Auto close top is a nice touch, adds some dust protection when not viewing. The projector is fairly large, so plan out what kind of shelf/stand you will be using. It needs to be sturdy, and the appropriate height/width.<br/><br/>Don't take lightly the measurements required to set this projector up at the right height, distance from the wall, and distance from your projector screen.<br/><br/>The BenQ Roku Dongle is okay... I don't like that they force your hand in using this streaming device, as there are only 2 HDMI ports, 1 is your ARC, the other is "required" for the "BenQ Roku Dongle". So you will need to get a multi function receiver if you want set up your sound through the HDMI ARC + include your various FireTV/AppleTV/Xbox/etc.<br/><br/>The settings menu isn't anything great, but it works. You're going to want to play around with the settings for a while. You get 2 remotes. One massive one for the projector, one smaller one for the BenQ Roku. I don't use their roku system hardly at all. But I plugged my Apple TV in to the HDMI that "requires" the BenQ, and my Apple TV would glitch out frequently. Very annoying. It appears that HDMI port truly is set for their Benq Dongle only.<br/><br/>This projector does put out a good amount of heat. After a 3 hour viewing of Avengers, the theatre room was significantly warmer. Very noticeable. The fan is pretty quiet for the most part. The front speaker is not great, you will want a sound bar at minimum.<br/><br/>I haven't been able to get my picture EXACTLY perfect. As there is some rounding happening along the top edge. And the bottom corners don't align perfectly. But this is where making sure your measurements are exact comes in, I assume. I plan to keep tinkering with it. Overall, I am HAPPY. Not perfect, but awesome for the price and the quality.</span>

<span>For the pricepoint I wanted to buy at, this projector has worked great.  I use it every day, and am typing this review on it.  I do need to turn on all the shades by day in order to see a clear picture.  As other reviews noted, the dark black is so black sometimes the projector is on and I don't even notice (I'm guessing there's a screensaver option I haven't figured out).  I sadly do notice the "rainbow effect" on this projector when watching high-motion video.  I have played computer games on it without the "rainbow effect", so I only noticed it on a few action shows I watch.  I had no idea what the rainbow effect was before researching it, but basically it's a problem that will come with any DLP projector.<br/><br/>All in all, the purchase left me wondering if there is a better model for $200-300 more which would have been fine for me to purchase.  Overall though I am happy with it and no major complaints.  Zero regrets buying a projector though I am sure with as much use as I get from it I'll expect to change the bulb or projector within a few years.</span>

<span>I’ve done a lot of research and this is definitely one of the best purchases I made. Because of the size and shape of my living room, I had to get a short throw projector to make the image fit my 100” screen from about 5 ft away. The projector is pretty bright even during the day. I like the 3X fast input feature that makes the gameplay more responsive. I can also connect my phone, or laptop directly to the USB-C to mirror my screen. The built-in speaker also produces decent sound that I don’t need to use external speakers.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Bright<br/>Short Throw<br/>Quiet<br/>Decent built-in speaker<br/>USB-C connection with power<br/>Auto keystone<br/>Low input lag and gaming mode<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Remote is not backlit<br/>No horizontal keystone<br/>No USB type-A power<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>I highly recommend this product for any home entertainment system and it works great if you have limited space.</span>

<span>This is my second projector and we have a dedicated theater set-up in the basement that is totally light controlled. One problem with our set-up is we have ductwork right where a projector would typically be mounted on ceiling. This being short throw makes it possible to mount on ceiling in front of ductwork. For now we just have it on a table.<br/>  Great super sharp image. Colors really pop. I didn’t notice any issues with brightness uniformity but I’m no video-phile. Zero noticeable lag when gaming on ps4. The speaker is not too bad but we have surround sound hooked up. One thing I did notice is if you have any slight wrinkle in your screen it will be more noticeable on this short throw vs normal throw projector. I’m using a diy blackout cloth screen.<br/>  So after 2 days use I’m super impressed and would totally recommend this projector. I have to tinker with it a little more and get it hung on ceiling yet. One feature I did notice is there is a setting to select the color of the wall/screen you’re using. If you’re looking to buy this to break out for some quick gaming/movie action and you’re just using your wall this would be helpful.</span>

<span>Got this last year after a lot of research and focus on the negative reviews, so had some idea of pros and cons and limitations going in.<br/><br/>Getting the picture to fit on the screen was a challenge, had to buy furniture that was only 12" from surface to floor. The grid with the corner handles is your friend for fine adjustments. Picture quality is very good, brightness and black levels are really good (I have a Samsung HDTV and this projector beats that all the way on black levels, not quite OLED TV level black colors but still really good). The interface and app support are klunky but manageable. I use a Roku for streaming so all my remote use is on the Roku, I only use the device remote to turn it on. If you don't get 4K quality check your connection speed (if it's not fast enough you can't even choose the HDR modes - they are grayed out). I use the browser in the app section to check download speeds. Sound quality from the built in speakers is also very good.  They missed some design cues - the legend/symbols over the LED lights on the device are impossible to make out. But after all of that, it was really delivering great picture quality and sound for an immersive experience.<br/><br/>Then I downloaded a firmware upgrade and it said applying update and went dark - I had no idea what was going on except one of the LEDs was red. Left it overnight, and tried to restart the following morning and it would not restart.  Called customer service and received a bin file (with same upgrade) that I put on a thumb drive and plugged it in to the projector. It still wouldn't work, the LEDs came on and flashed and then went to steady red. Sent it to them and they said the equivalent of the motherboard was not working. So I am getting a new projector now. Kevin Mackie was excellent, courteous and professional in handling my request from start to finish. Can't say enough good things about him.<br/><br/>I will update this review once I get the new one and get to enjoy it for a bit longer.<br/><br/>6/19 - Update<br/>I have had the new replacement for a while now, really happy with this purchase. The picture is stunning in my set up dark walls, no/very low natural light. I have a purchased a custom made cover as well, you will need that if your projector sits out in the open (costs about $30).<br/>5 stars from me</span>

<span>I bought this projector on Amazon and returned it after nearly a month. These are my impressions.  This projector was to be a replacement for my 2019 chinese made Xiaomi Mijia 4k projector.  The P2 was superior in every way to my Mijia projector except one .  The mijia has surprisingly better contrast and  for me blacks were one of the most important feature of any projector.  The P2 washes out with the least amount of light and the blacks looked more like dark grey. It was almost unwatchable in my living room without closing the blinds, despite being paired with XY's pet crystal  100" alr screen.  Also there was a light bloom at the bottom center of  the screen and my OCD could not let me overlook that no matter how hard I tried.  I sold my Mijia before purchasing this projector and was beginning to have buyers remorse. I started to look at large screen LCDs over 80 inches and decided that I wanted to stick to  screen size of 100 or more so I gave projectors another chance.  While doing my research I came across the  Optoma Cinemax Pro on sale for $300 more than I paid for the P2 and bought it. After owning the Cinemax Pro, I could not recommend the P2.  While the picture quality, color, and sharpness looks identical, the difference is the contrast/black levels. Now I can finally view a watchable picture with my blinds open and excellent blacks when room is darkened. I would suggest to anyone looking to purchase a P2, save you money and get the Cinemax Pro instead. I don't think the Pros msrp is justified so wait until it goes on sale.</span>

<span>UPDATE: with my CLR screen from elite screens this thing is totally changed. I was skeptical so spending another 1500 on a screen but it made all the difference. Light or dark I love watching it. I often actually prefer watching at night with a lamp on which amazes me. In short with the right screen 5 stars, without 3 stars.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect for my first UST projector, but the p2 so far has been a good experience overall. I'm pretty picky with image quality and was on the fence for weeks about a 77 OLED vs the projector.<br/><br/> I'm using a matte white screen with 1.2 gain atm until my CLR screen arrives so I'm holding off on final judgement. In the dark room environment I'm generally pleased with it and there are definitely scenes where it's stunning and HDR comes to life. Shows like Emily in Paris really highlight it's stong output and HDR.<br/><br/>In daylight or low lighting it's pretty much a non starter with my white screen. Just not though light to create enough contrast.<br/><br/>However, I'm just not quite sold on its black level performance. Maybe due to my white screen, but when I'm seeing scenes with a pretty flat contrast variance, like in doors with lights, it can take on a muddy washed out look. Surprisingly in very dark mostly black scenes I tend to be less bothered.<br/><br/>No gaming yet so will defer judgement on lag. The software that comes with it is a joke so get a fire stick and don't bother complaining. The speaker is actually quite impressive and has been a real delighter, though don't plan to use it long term. Better than any LCD TV I had.<br/><br/>Overall I'll defer final call until my Aeon Starbright 120 inch screen arrives. From everything I researched it's pretty much required to get the right contrast levels. I'm a little nervous as to what it may do to the brightness though with a 0.6 gain. For the record I did try a CineGray screen as well with not not much luck. It did improve contrast over white but ended up feeling too dark.<br/><br/>Lastly in terms space configuration, be sure to have about 32 inches of tv stand depth. I have it running on the floor atm. Considering the screen is projected 12 inches above the projector for a 120 inch screen, your rather limited on console height unless you want your screen very high on the wall. Couple that with center channel placement and you definitely have some critical problem solving at hand.<br/><br/>Will update and add video once the CLR arrives.</span>

<span>I am coming from a BenQ HT2050, which is a $700 1080p lamp projector with moderate brightness. I also use a tab-tensioned, motorized screen that is NOT ambient light rejecting, but works great with the BenQ in lower ambient light. I also work in Film/TV so my eye is pretty picky and well trained.<br/><br/>First, the big elephant in the room that I think will impact your buying choice more than any opinions about image quality, brightness etc, is the flaw that caused me to send this projector back to Amazon - because these laser-based UST projectors are firing from directly below, they will DRAMATICALLY accentuate every single flaw in your screen (or wall). As mentioned above I have a $600 tab-tensioned screen. It's not the best screen on the market, but it is quite taut and the image is completely distortion-free when using a standard front-firing projector. With the CinemaX P2, the image looked wildly distorted and wavy on the outermost 6-10" of the left and right sides of my screen. This projector also managed to pull out strange fold lines across the width of the screen and other flaws that you literally cannot see with the naked eye unless you have the upward-cast lighting highlighting those details. Needless to say this is not a flaw with this particular projector, but rather a major concern for UST projectors in general - unless you have an absolutely PERFECT screen, ideally a flat, permanent, wall mounted, tensioned screen, the experience will suffer greatly. Roll-up screens and projecting on walls that aren't perfectly smooth AND even are probably a complete non-starter for USTs. You have been warned!<br/><br/>As for my impressions of the projector overall:<br/><br/>- the improvement in brightness/contrast vs my HT2050 was merely okay, especially considering it is rated at 3,000 lumens vs the 2200 of the BenQ.<br/><br/>- The improvement to perceived image quality going to 4k was not anywhere near as dramatic as I had hoped. When watching demo videos via Blu Ray designed to showcase the beauty of 4k, the image quality was maybe 20% better than what my HT2050 could offer despite being 1080p. I'm not sure why this is, perhaps it is because the CinemaX P2 uses pixel-shifting and therefore is NOT "true" 4k despite claims to the contrary that persist.<br/><br/>- Focusing to get the middle of the screen perfectly sharp leaves the upper corners a little blurry, probably a result of the physics of trying to project a square image onto a wall from directly below.<br/><br/>- This projector is really big. It will stick out several feet from the wall and must be at least a foot below the bottom of your screen in order to get a 100" or larger image. You can either try to place the projector the exact correct distance, which is tough, or you can use its built-in software to adjust the image alignment on the screen, but this adjustment will go away if you try to use the projector's game mode to improve latency.<br/><br/>- As mentioned above this projector is really big, and a major part of that (and no doubt a few hundred dollars of the price) is consumed by the front speakers. I think the vast majority of people spending $3k on a projector have a sound system in place, making this a total waste of resources all around. This would be much less of a concern if the built-in speaker could be used as the center channel in your surround system.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that these minor improvements were not worth paying 4X the price for, especially once I realized that I would absolutely HAVE to spend another few grand on a better screen just to get back to the same viewing experience I was currently getting with a $700 projector. If you have (or are willing to buy) a light rejecting screen you will almost certainly get better performance, but that will add another several thousand dollars on top of the already high price of this projector.</span>

<span>The unit turns on by itself once plugged in.  Great.  Then shows a screen that says Power Only code 03.00.06.01.  The power button on the unit and/or the the remote do nothing.  10 attempts with LG to troubleshoot.  Chat disconnected me with 15 second lack of response time and kept transferring me to a different line of business which disconnects me upon transfer.  Phone - put on hold to be hung up on all three times.  I have owned and loved LG products before but was the biggest joke I have ever experienced with a product and customer service.  Don't buy it, trust me.</span>

<span>PRO<br/>-Amazing picture quality on a ALR UST screen like, the one by Silver ticket. But, beware, ALR UST screens are hyper sensitive and dent/scratch easy and permanently (not be the best choice if you have small kids/drunk friends that act like small kids)<br/>-Great built in apps<br/>-Auto-focus is cool<br/>-eARC support to hook up to an amp to use built in apps<br/>-Very good remote, but read cons for some negatives<br/><br/>CON<br/>-Takes a ~20-30 seconds to warm up and have network functions enabled. Minor gripe, but its a bit annoying.<br/>-Cannot use the built in search on the remote to search for items in Plex, the voice search directs you to only paid video services and YouTube. For use in YouTube, it works great, like really great.<br/>-Phone support people are not the best trained. I was used to Yamaha phone support, which is amazing.</span>

<span>Little bit heavy but easy to move because nothing is needed except it, so very useful for multi-use - home theater and TV. It provides enough brightness in ambient lights.</span>
