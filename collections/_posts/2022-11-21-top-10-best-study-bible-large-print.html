<span>I am very excited to dive into the Life Application study Bible. Great size easy to read. Be gentle with the pages. I already have taken a highlighter felt pen that is no bleed and it did not go through so while these pages seem thinner than my daily Bible. They are not cheap. This is a beautiful cover the pink and gray. I like the size of the print. Its so much easier to make notes and really dive in with the LARGE PRINT. My eyes don't get as tired. My lighting is not the best. So much information you will really get amazing insight. I researched. This is the #1 study Bible in the world. So I had to go for it. NIV third edition is updated for life today. Over 10,000 life application notes. Good thing I drink coffee ☕ I will be able to stay up late exploring this. I'm believing it will help me better understand the Bible and bring me closer to God. I'm just a girl trying to walk in her divine purpose.  This seems like one of the best tools to help me. Give it a try. There are other covers if you want something less girly.</span>

<span>I love my new Bible. As I’ve gotten older (55) I realized my other Bibles were hard to read so I ordered this large print one. I’m glad I did I love it plus it’s a study Bible with alot of other stuff. Now the larger print does make it heavy but that wasn’t an issue for me. I love it.</span>

<span>I'm very happy with this study bible. It has all of the "extra" features that I have been wanting while studying the holy scriptures. The explanations and graphics are very easy to read and understand. I am building knowledge about background and perspectives every time I open the pages.  It is also absolutely beautiful! Definitely a fantastic purchase!</span>

<span>So I purchased this ESV Study Bible to enlighten myself in God's word. I recently found myself dealing with the most spiritually profound event of my life at 38 years old and decided I wanted to look deeper into my own faith and into God's word. I purchased this beautiful ESV Study Bible in TruTone Brown/Cordovan, Portfolio Design in order to help me along my journey and am very excited about the content within.<br/><br/>The is a cosmetic flaw with my particular copy, however. You can see that the first page was dog-eared when the corners were rounded and sprayed so that page has a slightly larger and square upper right corner. This is really not a bother to me as I bought this for the content more than the fit and finish. I have no reason to believe that this Study Bible will not suit my needs for many years to come and am happy with my purchase. The price was fair and I look forward to taking a deeper dive into God's word and becoming a better son to Him.</span>

<span>As a pastor's wife and Adult Sunday School teacher I have been searching for a complete study bible. We are KJV readers and users so buying another version I was a little skeptical. I found it easy to read and I like that in a study bible. I wanted one that had charts, maps, timelines, outlines, facts, commentaries and applying scripture to everyday life. This one has it all. I ordered the large print which is easier on my older eyes. The print is good size with the notes in a smaller print but still easy to read. The cover I bought was imitation leather but looks very nice and the binding is sewn not glued so it lays flat when opened. Because of the gold edges on the pages I had to separate most of the pages by hand, which took so time, but it also gave me an opportunity to see all of the gems hidden in here. The overview before each book of the bible is very helpful and informative. It is a heavy book but I am using it for what it is...a Compete Study Bible, not the one I carry to church. I only have one complaint and that is the words of Christ are not in red. This is the reason for only 4 stars. I did not spend the extra money to get the genuine leather or indexed edition either. The pages are thin and you can see some bleed through the pages is there is a map or illustration on the other side. If I put tabs in it they will have to be the smaller, light weight kind and not the custom tabs I have in my regular bible. I own several bibles (about 20) but this will be my go to bible when I study or need to do research. So far, I LOVE it! Also, there is a free Kindle version so I can use it, too.</span>

<span>Ok…yes, it’s heavy!  But, I bought a carry case/cover for it and that makes all the difference. I can easily carry it into church and Bible study groups using the handle on my lightweight cover/case.<br/>I really enjoy the Introduction of each book of the Bible that includes the timeline, theme, maps, notes and any other information to make it easier to understand.<br/>I love the large print.<br/>I do wish the pages were a little thicker or heavier, though. The pages are very thin and sometimes stick together. I’m not sure if that will improve with use or not.<br/>Overall I’m glad I bought this NLT Application Bible.</span>

I was disappointed in the craftsmanship - it is on the large side which I think may add to some intimidation.  The print is small - it didn't go over well for the recipient but that has nothing to do with the Bible.</span>

<span>Thai giant print is perfect for my ageing eyes. I love the filament Bible app that goes along with this Bible. The one I purchased actually had a genuine leather cover. It looks great but it’s kind of plane. I keep it in a Bible cover anyway so it doesn’t really matter. I think it was $90 for it originally and I got it for $48 on sale. I could’ve got a different Bible with a cover but they weren’t genuine leather so I stuck with this one really being it was on sale. Hopefully it’s holds up well like I’m expecting it to. It smells nice, like leather! I like everything about this Bible. Well one thing I could say I wish it was a little different would be the indexed tabs I wish they were silver with black writing but these are black with gold writing. I find the silver ones easier to read. I’ll get used to them though. There’s not one bad thing I can say about this Bible. It’s pretty awesome.</span>

<span>I recently decided to become even more officially middle aged by buying large print Bibles to help with the middle age bonus of worse vision than you already dealt with your whole life. It’s great isn’t it?  I decided to take the opportunity to try out new translations as well. I still have almost a dozen options in the house between me and my husband’s collections, but they weren’t meeting my want for an easy to *read* and just *enjoy* the Bible more like a general book to read… they feel more like reading a textbook (NASB, ESV, NET, etc) or they have undergone one too many revisions to where I no longer like what’s currently in print (NIV), or just clunky (AMP, KJV).  So I found a free online Parallel Bible website and tried a bunch and the NLT kept being the column that I was most enjoying. It was just easy and comfortable and enjoyable but most of all inviting… I wanted to keep reading without effort, it was just different enough to my “ear” to feel new again without being so new/different to feel foreign (like paraphrase translations like MSG, Passion, the original Living Bible).  It also didn’t feel like I was being given a simpler translation like I was a kid (NRIV).  This was the Goldilocks translation I wanted as my daily bedside reader. I also really like the NLT’s use of subject/transition headings so you can more easily find specific stories/events and have a better idea of when/where is a good stopping point when reading for leisure.<br/><br/>I picked this specific edition for when I want to read without study notes for minimal distraction or for when I want to leave the house with a printed Bible.  The phone app is easy to use and it’s not too much added time to occasionally load up notes on a verse I’m reading. (Although if I wanted to read a lot of notes while researching a topic or reading through a difficult Book of the Bible I would prefer to use the Life Application Study Bible which is available in large print.  That version is just not very portable or easy to hold while casually reading without support.)<br/><br/>As for this printing I find the font size to be comfortable to read the text and the notes. The cover is beautiful and feels sturdy enough. The dimensions are really nice. A little larger than an average non-study Bible but similar to Bibles with devotional or added Helps/Note content. I can easily read it in bed and even one handed reading is possible.<br/><br/>The paper is decent enough quality. It’s a little on the thin side to reduce weight and size of the book. Ghosting is not an issue in good lighting and hardly noticeable with a good clip on book light. In bad lighting you may need to lift up the page you’re reading and let it gently fall back into place so it’s not completely pressed into the underlying page, or use a blank piece of printer or cardstock paper (which doubles as a bookmark) as a blotter page behind the page you’re reading if you’re really sensitive to it. I use pencil and Frixion Pastel Highlighters in Bibles and that works well on this paper with minimal ghosting (especially if you overlap coats) but no bleed through (however, erasing Frixion Highlighter causes the paper to pucker and a faint amount of discoloration will remain).<br/><br/>I do wish the publisher had taken the time to do line matching throughout the text, which is frustrating because it would have reduced ghosting to almost none and would not have been difficult but it seems like more than half the pages already fell into close to line matching. So it’s weird when you hit the page that stands out as the noticeable oddball, which seems to be about every third page. I also would have tweaked the kerning of the font for a little clearer reading experience but my eyes got used to it pretty quickly. I debated getting a larger font to read completely without glasses even in lower light but found that the larger giant print fonts either made the Bible too large to hold comfortably or made my eyes have to do too much flicking back and forth that it causes even more eye fatigue and headache. I discovered my clip on book light often helps make this font more readable enough that I rarely need my reading glasses.<br/><br/>I really like the bonus features in the app.  It seems equivalent to the NLT Study Bible notes with some additional devotional/reflection articles from the One Year Unlocking the Bible, the One Year Book of Discovering Jesus in the OT, the One Year Book of Encouragement, Dancing in the Desert, Sacred Questions Journey, and more.  It would be nice to be able to buy on additional content so you wouldn’t need to buy multiple Bibles that have the exact same translation. However there’s currently no way to easily move from one author’s article to their next one, you are stuck flipping through the verses until you spot a new article from that same author. Sadly there is no way to read the NLT itself in the app when you’re away from home and have a few minutes to spare, unless you go online or download the NLT from other free apps that provide it.<br/><br/>I really think they did a great job overall. I wish the paper was a tad thicker but I understand the decision in terms of price and overall thickness/weight of the complete Bible. I do wish they would make a Psalms + Proverbs + NT in this font size in a more compact body for even more portability.<br/><br/>Another thing worth noting is I really enjoy the NLT 365 Day Reading Plan which gives you a lot of the most important passages in chronological order while minimizing repetitious/overlapping content and “dry” sections of history/lists that many new Believers or new readers struggle with (and often abandon trying to read through the Bible before Leviticus is even over).  For an even faster survey/summary/Big Picture View of the Bible check out the Wayfinding Bible “routes” in the Partial Bible Reading Plans in the Filament app.</span>

<span>I purchased this Bible because the description said that it has book tabs in it. I believe it even shows it in the picture. But it does not have the tabs in it to do by the books. It was very disappointed with that I had to purchase tabs separately that took me 3 days to go through and insert all of them. Other than that I love the Bible I love how it has descriptions of each book in the beginning of the book what you're going to be reading about what you should learn from Genesis Matthew Ephesians it's awesome it also has cross references. I can't stop reading it</span>

<span>The Bible was full of wisdom, and I was able to read it without getting a headache because the font was large enough.<br/><br/>The Bible tells of so many exciting adventures that Jesus went through and the disciples too! You have to get this Bible because it’s so awesome if you love short stories. It hooks you in the very beginning with Adam and his first son, their ages and how they didn’t even start their families until they were very old! Can you imagine doing that at this day and age?<br/><br/> I can write notes without worrying about it bleeding through also. I love how I don’t have to search because it has the tabs.<br/><br/> I am going to get three more so I love in the beginning where it has  the to and from, date, and where you can write a personal note!<br/><br/>It has all the information that you could possibly dream of and it answer questions I did not know I had. So with that said, I am using it for my one year reading goal …the Bible.</span>

<span> This is such a beautiful and amazing Bible. It breaks down almost verse as far what the meaning of the verse is trying to inform us of. I love the little paragraphs that are associated the almost each section of the Bible, as far what God wants us to know of explain further the message of that specific book you’re reading. It has maps in the back of the Bible, as well as an index, a table of weights and measurements, and a concordance section. I also bought these super cute tabs to be able to find the sections / book faster since there is no thumb index, and I just think it puts my personality into the Bible and just makes that much more beautiful. And I also like that the actual hardcover of the Bible looks exactly like the paper covering it has on, it’s not just a plain hardcover. I hope this review helps someone if they’re considering the purchase of this Bible.</span>

My page's are not too thin nor are they stuck together as some have posted. Superb quality.  If you make notes or underline, don't use a gel pen. It will bleed through.  For highlighting I use Mr. Pen pastels. Excellent product to pair with this Bible. It's a heavy Bible. But I don't have to tote it everywhere.  It's my at home study Bible.
