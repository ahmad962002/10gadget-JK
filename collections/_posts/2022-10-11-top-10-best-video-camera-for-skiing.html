<span>This rating is not compared to a GoPro. This is not anything close to one.<br/><br/>It is a fine sports action camera for ~ $50.<br/><br/>It of course comes near 0% battery, so charge it first. Then make sure you get a nice sized micro sd card. I've figured the data rate to be about 9gb per hour of hd video.<br/><br/>Also the screen eventually shuts off so the battery should last a while.<br/><br/>If you're particularly adventerious , you can add or replace the batteries with hobby rc 3.2v lipo batteries for more run time.</span>

<span>I took a shot on trying this model out because the 9 was a lot more expensive. I found the price of the 8 to be a good deal and I have no regrets. The display is crisp and easy to use and the camera quality is excellent. I like the different modes you can shoot in and take stills. The app makes it pretty user friendly too. My only complaint is the battery life. I hear that's a pretty common thing (Wanting longer battery life) but for the quality you get it's pretty worth and can record long enough for most situations. Otherwise spare batteries help. I'd highly recommend this if you are still shooting on the hero 3 or 4.</span>

<span>Received the GoPro Hero 8 black and I have it configured just the way I want it. Videos are great now that I have watched a ton of settings videos on You Tube. Everything seems great except the voice control. Yes. I do have all voice control settings turned on. The camera will not respond to the voice command "GoPro turn on" which I guess is not a big deal. I can always just turn it on but for what I paid for this camera I would expect "everything" to work. I have recently ordered "The Remote" so using that should be an easy work around for the voice command "GoPro turn on". So far, so good except for the voice control issue. I will update again at a later date if necessary. The voice control issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</span>

<span>I was debating between this and the off-brand version, so I bought both.  The off-brand doesn't hold a candle to the Go Pro.  Absolutely perfect.  Used it under water in the ocean, dried it off and used as a dashcam, took on a catamaran trip, and more.  Worked great and captured some excellent memories with the family.</span>

<span>I really liked these glasses, but they lose 2* for three reasons:<br/>1) Like the GoPro 9 4K video camera, it breaks your video into separate files once some limit is reached. I don’t know what that limit is, but @ least it keeps recording!<br/>2) You HAVE to use the USB-A to micro cable that comes with the glasses – I tried several other ones, but none of them worked. This one seems to function as both a USB-micro &amp; USB-C cable, in that it provides power as well as transfers data. That’s great, but what that means is DON’T LOSE IT! I guess you can get a replacement, but I hope to avoid that hassle.<br/>3) No micro-USB card slot, so you have no choice other than the internal memory.<br/><br/>The $190 price tag was high, but I liked the sturdy build, &amp; the quality engineering. I thought that the glasses were tight for me, so I can’t see using them for more than ½ an hour @ a time. Also, I’ll never have a need to use the sunglass lenses, so I replaced them with the clear ones. Replacing the lenses is as easy as they claim. Last, I liked the hard-sided case. You sure don’t want these glasses to get scratched or damaged!<br/><br/>RECOMMENDED, as long as you’re aware of the limitations.</span>

<span>I wasn't sure how to rank this. So the good first:<br/><br/>- Video OK<br/>- Audio OK for the camera man not good for anyone else or outside filming<br/>- Super easy to use just press the button it start press it stops<br/><br/>The bad now:<br/><br/>Iview if you are reading fix the Micro USA make it USB-C. The micro usb is deep so most cable will not connect and as you put in the cable it goes deeper. After 1 month of use I have to press the thing and hold it to get the file. It's a horrible design.<br/><br/>Also no Micro SD card. WHY?<br/><br/>And I can only  have it on me for 30 minutes it can't be adjusted like normal sun glasses it presses your head really tight and it's uncomfterable.<br/><br/>Contact me if you want me to explain and show you so you can fix it and send me the new model I'll give an honest update on the new one. This one is pretty much useless to me.<br/><br/>I hope this helps make a better product you are so close.</span>

<span>These glasses are extremely underdeveloped and for a $200 gadget, not good quality, too cheap materials, the camera is less than great and the way to code the image and FPS quality on the .TXT file is for advanced users so get away if you’re not a computer savvy user. This is not a plug and play. Gave me less than the advertised 1 hour of battery  (47min after charging 8 hours NEW PRODUCT)…<br/>Not a great buy. Too expensive for the quality offered. Maybe $79 would be an expensive price for these, at $200 is out of the game.<br/>I’m returning them very disappointed after watching all the reviews this is way less than expected.</span>

<span> I bought this camera to see if I could use it to record what is behind me on bike rides. Since most crashes are from the back it gives me a little peace of mind while I'm biking. I uploaded a short video of part of my recording while biking.<br/><br/>As you can see the picture quality and amount captured is really good for $18. The audio is a hot mess since there is a lot of movement of the camera (there is no audio in the video because I screen recorded the small part of the video.) Luckily I didn't buy it for the audio. It records continuously for 20 minutes tops. So on my commute that day I rode 20 minutes out and then started recording to see quality.<br/><br/> I attached the waterproof case to the left side of my rear rack basket (see photo) with the provided velcro strips. It comes with a lot of pieces for mounting and carrying the camera in different ways. For stability and to get the best image of the approaching cars in the lane next to me I found the velcro was better. I might order another one and mount it to my front handlebars.<br/><br/>If my ride is more than 20 minutes (it typically is) I stop every 18 minutes and restart the camera to make sure I capture the whole ride. The camera holds a charge for quite awhile and I have had success using it to record two hours of biking round trip. I charge it nightly so I haven't really tested the full extent of the battery.<br/><br/>Mine did come with a micro sd card. I bought a small usb converter for my mac book dongle. Due to the file type (.avi) I did need to download the free app 'omni player' to play the files on my macbook. For that app you just drag and drop the video into the player to see it. They have an app for converting to different file types called 'omni converter' as well.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this camera for outdoor recordings.</span>

<span>Totally awesome. Snorkeled with this on my full face snorkel with gopro adapter for 1 week and captured the most unreal movies and never once fogged up or stopped working. completely waterproof. Crystal clear, easy to figure out. Also bought the 'selfie stick' and I walk around now recording everything I do like all the other lunatics on youtube.<br/><br/>Totally fun and 4k video is UNREAL!<br/><br/>You only live once so GET ONE!<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Update: Been using for over 1 month almost non-stop. And, forgot to mention; I had this camera attached to the bodi-floaty all day long, floating in water without any case what-so-ever and did that for 7 days straight. Totally waterproof out of the box. I have been posting vids online and editing on the gopro cloud (too easy) and everyone loves the vid's/images. Actually had a relative think we hired someone to shoot vids of our condo lol.<br/><br/>I went straight for the Samsung Pro Plus 128GB MicroSDXC Memory Card and it works flawlessly and holds TONS of video in 4K.<br/><br/>-----last update for newbies like me that don't know what else to order or what they might need. I got lucky as all of the addons I bought worked out excellent. Take a look and maybe this will help you pick a handy accessory:<br/><br/>start----<br/>1-29-17<br/> My new memory came in and works perfect. Different model than my first 128gb but I see no difference other than price.<br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DOB6YUQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>My addons - took with me on the trip.<br/><br/>1) Extra Thumbscrews: Perfect fit and look cool in alloy purple. Nice rubber washer on each one too for snug fit -&gt; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CUAEOJ6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>2) First 128gb mem I bought works perfect. Tried a new brand (up top) for the hell of it. Can’t tell the difference between either – both work just fine and store major amounts of movies and/or a billion images. -&gt; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CO48M36/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>3) 2 extra batteries kit. Identical to the stock GoPro Batteries and last all day doing scuba and taking shots. Never left the recorder going for more than 15 mins at 4k so cant say exactly how long you will get out of these but I easily recorded over 1 hours worth of 4k movies with images tossed in. -&gt; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWKCIQN/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>4) Floaty was awesome. Keeps the camera boyant if you drop it under water and does not get in the way of shooting at all. Easy to see and fit perfect. Looks cool too. -&gt; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ETXS4MO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s03?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>5) Dual charger for my 3 batteries. Works fast charging two at a time in about 1 hour. No problems and shows green light when batts are charged. Small and fits nice in my accessory bag -&gt; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ETXS4MO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s03?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>6) Perfect accessory bag fits everything and more. Mine is packed! Small slots for mem, all my batteries, charger and cables. Holds my floaty, my short gopro stick (the fat one that comes with the accessory kits) and my extended type selfie stick. Nice and light and zips up. Good quality. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PMMB4X8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s09?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>7) Not really a gopro accessory but if you are going snorkeling you MUST get one of these. We had them sucked to our face for a week and got some awesome underwater footage of kids and fish that look like ‘finding nemo’ movie. Try them out – they are awesome. Not cheap $$ wise but I sent so much on crap for my trip that I said what the hell, just do it. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K3Q16AI/ref=od_aui_detailpages02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>9) Lastly, this kit has more crap in it than you can imagine. I don’t know what half of the parts are for but maybe someday I’ll have a need and reach in the bag to figure out what to do with what. The floaty stick in this kit is good for snorkeling. The selfie sticks are too skinny and both of mine are metal so I didn’t want to take them underwater. The fat floaty stick in the kit compliments the bodi floaty (above) and again, looks totally cool. A few of my thumbscrews wound up rusty after 2 days in the saltwater and I cant remember if they were the ones that came with this kit or what. Either way, get some extra thumbscrews – longer the better. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PLBXUMS/ref=od_aui_detailpages05?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Thats it!</span>

<span>First one was a charging dud, this one started up right away!  One reason we buy through Amazon is the great customer support regarding returns.  Our first GoPro ordered a couple of weeks ago refused to charge no matter where plugged in and we couldn't get the Hero main screen to show even with just small battery amount it came with.<br/><br/>We returned and requested a replacement GoPro which arrived today.  We turned on before charging the battery fully to check due to the previous issue and this one started up and showed the main screen immediately.  Kudos to Amazon for prompt replacement!<br/><br/>Now to the camera.  We are senior sometimes "geeks" and enjoy tech things.  This is our first GoPro so we were excited to receive and start testing.  I will say that unpacking and removing the camera from the box top mount was more challenging than expected LOL.  We love the touch screens but had nothing in the included "how to" booklet related to sound.  During test video recording we weren't able to hear anything, saw nothing in preferences to help adjust volume and ended up using good old online "search" to find out that we needed to swipe up during playback mode to check the volume.  Once we increased this we heard the sound recorded.<br/><br/>This is just a preliminary report as we plan to record more and save to my Mac to use IMovie and then create a DVD.  We will use the camera for our cruise vacations, especially beach and snorkel time.  We always create 1-2 hour movies to bore our friends and family.<br/><br/>The reason for the 4 star is that the battery seems to drain quickly and also wish the camera was just a little bigger since we won't be mounting to a helmet or chest, just a small float type stick.</span>

<span>Great camera. GoPro's products are legendary in the action cam world. But what makes this new Hero5 stand out is the telemetry data. As far as I know only the Hero 5 and Hero 5 Black offer this option. The camera is super easy to use, charges quickly using the included USB-C cable, uses a standard Micro-SD card (I recommend a Lexar high-performance one at least 32GB), comes with a mount and works with ALL of the GoPro mount products both from GP and third party.<br/><br/>My only complaint is battery life, between the GPS for telemetry, wifi to aim and check the views, the battery itself don't last as long as I'd like. I can get one good bike ride in before its near dead. I found that not using the wifi connection helps, get the camera aimed (easier when on your helmet if you do via wifi) then turn it off.<br/><br/>Getting telemetry onto your videos is a little daunting, as it requires you to go out of your way to do a bunch of extra steps before popping the video into GoPro Studio, but its worth it to see the speed, direction, path etc overlayed on your video. My recommendation to get from Quik to Studio is to do the following... copy over your video segments, don't let the software do it for you. Aim the Quik and Studio software to the same location. Manually import the segments into Quik, double click one and turn on all the telemetry items you want to use, then it uses that setting for everything else. Trim that clip (CMD-T on Mac), it will overlay the telemetry data and offer a Save button, add on -telem or something at the end and save it, repeating this for each clip. THEN import the new -telem clips into Studio and lay them into order, add music etc. Just my preference. Quik offers only 2 means to export otherwise, FaceBook and YouTube.<br/><br/>I am loving the Superview super wide angle, it's my most favorite, and yes it does distort the view a bit but it makes more of the scene fit on screen and gives a sense of speed to bike rides etc.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it offers all the wonderful stuff you expect from a GoPro, rear touch screen, voice control (awesome for turning on and off recordings and shutting off the camera when done while its helmet mounted), works with all the mounts, takes top notch video including 4K for those who want to get the ultra high quality video. I find personally that the 1080p is more then enough for my needs and can do 60fps as well.<br/><br/>It's not super heavy, so when mounted you don't notice it, and it doesn't want to move when you hit bumps if you use a good tight mounting kit. Overall, well worth the money, and for GoPro fans, its a no brainer.<br/><br/>I use this along with several Sessions to record car, bike and motorcycle rides. And I wear it with the chesty on walks/hikes. Another great GoPro product with tons of features, making it a no brainer if you are upgrading or getting a new GoPro for the first time and want all the bells and whistles.</span>

<span>Ok. now that I've gotten more experience with my GoPro Hero 5 Sports camera. Mostly with time-lapse. Here are some things I have learned.<br/><br/>1. GoPro only takes photos in RAW format if time between photos is 5 seconds or greater.<br/>This is not good for those of us who like to use RAW information to edit photos. Or, prefer not to lose information while converting from JPG to DNG. Time-lapse with 5 seconds time frames are ok for time-lapse videos that are meant to be at a fast pace.<br/><br/>2. Aperture on the GoPro is a fixed F2.8. For those who don’t know. This is the iris of a lens. On a real camera, you can adjust the size of the iris to control the amount of light to the camera sensor. F2.8 is a very wide iris. It is allowing for as much light as possible to pass through the lens and on to the sensor. And, another note on F-stop. It’s also used to control the Depth of Field in a photo.<br/><br/>3. GoPro uses ISO to try and adjust the sensitivity of the sensor to light. The tradeoff is that too much of an adjustment, that allows more light, creates noise in your photos. Or an adjustment towards less light makes your photo too dark. If you are wanting to compensate in post editing, its best to go adjust from light to dark. There is still noise in the photo. It is just not as easily seen.<br/><br/>4. GoPro Shutter speed. Absolute no control. You could be making the best time-lapse you’ve ever made, and suddenly, the shutter speed on the GoPro changes right in the middle of your time-lapse. Forcing you to make the choice of either deleting or shortening your time-lapse. I would say that this is the most frustrating part of the GoPro currently.<br/><br/>Overall. If I were to ask GoPro to make changes to their cameras. It would be to have better control of light with shutter speed. Maybe have them create advanced software for those of us who would like more control over the camera. I understand the fixed lens, as it is a sports point of view camera. Usually, sports activities are in well-lit areas without too much change in light. ISO control for the moment on the camera seems to be ok.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I’ll continue to play with the GoPro until my new toy arrives sometime in February.  I’ve learned quite a bit about camera gear since I’ve gotten my little GoPro.</span>

<span>I purchased this camcorder a while back, and despite my low expectations, this device has exceeded them all.  Tremendously.  I'd say this is on-par with my 2001 Sony Handicam (that cost me about $800 at the time), only without the night-vision option, and not as good in less-than-optimal lighting.<br/><br/>At the seller explains (repeatedly, to a bunch of people who seem to think they won the lottery and are getting a $1,000 camcorder at this price), this is NOT a professional-quality camcorder.  I compared its video quality to my DSLR, my go pro, and my compact digital camera under a variety of lighting conditions.  Under good lighting, I believe it meets its stated 1080p/24MP performance.  Where I noticed a difference was in shooting in low light (including natural light indoors).<br/><br/>To make a long story short . . . if you're looking for an easy-to-use and easy-to-carry inexpensive alternative to a smartphone for shooting video, I think you'll be pleased.  If you think you just won the lottery when you looked at the price, you're thinking about this all wrong.  In good lighting, it performed well, and when frame rate and resolution were the same, comparably in most regards (though the white-balance was a bit funny in that my Nikon DSLR and go pro both have similar white balance, I had to edit it somewhat when doing multi-camera edits with this camera, as it tended to be a bit warmer).<br/><br/>Shooting indoors under high-intensity lighting for a professional photo-shoot, this little camcorder does surprisingly well.  In outdoor full-sun, the same.  I wouldn't put it against a full-frame DSLR, but for this price, who would reasonably expect that?<br/><br/>In short, here's the scoop:<br/><br/>*Works great in good lighting, still and video<br/>*Gets grainy fast in low lighting, just like (most) cell phones or inexpensive point-and-shoots<br/>*ABSOLUTELY worth the money if all you want is a utilitarian camera for good light conditions<br/><br/>Perfect for:<br/><br/>*Someone just playing with a dedicated camcorder for the first time, or the first time in a while<br/>*Someone with a child that dreams of being the next big YouTube content producer (it may delay their asking for all the expensive garbage that YouTube content producers are now telling all the masses are just-the-thing to make it big, but probably not, since the current band of YouTubers is so convincing to malleable young minds)<br/>*Someone looking for a camera/camcorder that they won't cry if it is destroyed<br/>*Someone looking for an inexpensive camcorder for any reason, who is willing to live with less-than-optimal performance under low-light conditions<br/><br/>Not perfect for:<br/><br/>*Someone expecting studio-quality, or even DSLR-quality, in lower light</span>

<span>First there was fast shipping from Amazon, this time, every time.  A strong, neat box held my new camcorder which I was so<br/>eager to try out. Contents were 2 batteries, a multipurpose usb/AV/Charger cable, a nifty padded bag w/belt loop, and a usb wall power device, and of course-a manual. I popped open the rectangular door underneath the camera and inserted a 32g SD card with the contacts facing the short end and clicked it in. Then I unwrapped a battery, pulled back the small spring loaded lock latch and with the arrow pointing up on the battery, I leveled it and slid it about an eighth of an inch and let go of the latch. Now, I hit the power button, went to the menu utility and formatted the SD card. After this, you are ready to read the functions in the manual and set up a couple of parameters such as still picture resolution and movie size. I chose 5 mp for still shots and chose the middle setting for AVI movies. I tried everything out for pictures and movies and it all worked well. If you slide your finger to the right of the menu button and push that button, you will be able to review your shots. There is also a menu setting for holding a snapshot-set this on the max of 3 seconds to glimpse your pictures before they disappear from sight. Well now, all was going along fine until I tried to connect to my computer. My computer was not installing this device correctly. So, after reading about why USB devices might not install correctly, I also asked a question about this procedure on Amazon's product page. The seller responded lightning fast with the correct procedure to install the camera's driver. It worked and I was able to see the camera as a drive and view files. And while you are connected to your computer, the battery is also charging. This battery is lithium and it hangs in there for the long haul! If I can add pics and movies later, I might do so, but you will see some movies that others have posted. My advice is to use that strap so you don't drop the camera. For still shots, you have many resolution choices. You will find one you like, and with a 32g SD card, you can shoot a heck of a lot! I got this unit at the right time because my hummingbirds will be here within 3 weeks.  I get 2 to 3 dozen a year, and yes they drive me crazy. They empty 4 12 oz. feeders 2 times a day. I already know that I will<br/>get great pics and movies with this camera. I really don't know how you could ask for more for the money. Happy shooting!</span>

<span>This is a nice little camcorder!<br/>I compared it to another brand that I bought recently, an Ordro in this same price range. This is the much better buy! The image quality and audio are better, and overall the user interface is easier to use. Just make sure you buy an SD card with this and also make sure the little gray switch on the side is pressed fully up, otherwise the camcorder will say "card error." Here are some pros and cons of the camcorder.<br/>PROS<br/>Great image and sound quality<br/>Good fill light<br/>Decent zoom<br/>Easy to set up and use with a tripod<br/>CONS<br/>Build quality doesn't seem the best<br/>Audio is OK from far away, but if you talk right next to the mic it sounds horrible. Also, it picks up the sounds from the buttons you are pressing, so you hear that in your videos as well<br/>Overall, this is a good buy and I am super excited about it! I've only owned it for a few days, but hopefully it will keep holding up!</span>

<span>With the standard settings on this camera I can still see blurring and JPG compression artefacts in both the front-facing stills and 360 images and videos.<br/>The worst thing is the intrusive software. The mobile apps are OK but you will get spammed for further purchases when you least expect it - when you want to take a picture! The desktop apps are equally bad. They are used to load media from the camera to your computer. Many people have reported an inability to download them at all. You certainly cannot download them without logging in with an email to either the Microsoft or Apple stores.</span>

<span>I like the 360 mode for photos. The stitching seems flawless. The voice command is helpful and helps with quick photos absent a lanyard. I like the toughness of the housing and the plastic protection lenses for the lenses. I’m always hiking in rough terrain and I would be pretty mad if I tapped the bare glass lens on a rock. They stick out like all 360 lenses and are vulnerable. Make sure to push them all the way down to avoid stitching errors. I have used it under water, but the light play from waves and water don’t allow for equal distribution of light which again causes stitching problems. A large plastic globe may solve that problem, but the way the lenses are offset from the center would probably again cause stitching errors due to globe distortion. I believe it’s best to use on land in rugged situations. No direct link to Google Streetview, but the work around of downloading to the phone then uploading to the app maintains the GPS data. Overall this is my second Max, the first overheated when I accidentally charged it under a blanket. Definitely buy the underwater housing if taking underwater. It will take great standard  photos.</span>
