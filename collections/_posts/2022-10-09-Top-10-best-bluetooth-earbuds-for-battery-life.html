<span>The pros:<br/>Very good sound quality for less than $50<br/>Long lasting charge and battery life for hours of uninterrupted listening<br/>Easy to control<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Bulky, tend to fall out of my ears if I’m moving around a lot<br/>Will disconnect when slightly out of range. If I walk from one end of our small home to the other without my device it starts to distort or just disconnect altogether.<br/><br/>I’d recommend them to anyone who just wants a good pair of wireless buds for on the go or without the hassle of plug ins. These are awesome for when I’m cooking, working, or walking. Music sounds high enough in these, not as strong and clear as apple earbuds, but fine enough that I’d repurchase if I lost them. I just wish they were a bit smaller.</span>

<span>JVC Gumy Truly Wireless Earbuds Headphones, Bluetooth 5.0, Water Resistance(IPX4)<br/><br/>Do not underestimate these headphones jut because of the $30 price: as basic as they seem, they are an excellent purchase for anyone who is budget conscious and looking for better than fair sound in a set of ear buds.  I found the sound to be really good, and although the controls take a little time to get used to (basically, one or a series of clicks on one or another of the two buds), once you get used to the routine, the results are always flawless.  I had a tough time keeping them in my ears while jogging, so for me, they are not really great for working out.  They are really awesome for listening to music from my Apple Watch and phone: pairing is easy and never fails, and they do not hurt my ears in the way other brands did.  I did have a problem in that my buds got soaked in the rain and when I placed them in the charge cradle, all of the charging lights began flashing non-stop and I could not get them to charge.  I was honest with JVC - I told them I dried them best as I could for several hours and they told me they would contact me with a solution in 15-days.  Much to my surprise, a new set arrived in the mail 4-days later - no questions asked.  The second pair has taken a beating for 4-months now - they are still working just fine.  You cannot even get a decent meal for $30 these days - these headphones are under-priced, sound good, come with an awesome charging case, take a beating, and sound really good.  The product description is accurate and JVC stands by their warranty  - no questions asked, no hassles.  I bought second pair for my spouse!</span>

<span>Great price, battery life, and quality.  I’ve purchased  other jlab products and have been satisfied with my purchases every time. My only complaint is a non-issue. These do have better sound isolation than other models I’ve purchased from jlab and that is my minor issue. I sometimes just hang them over my ears in order to better hear outside noises and this isn’t as comfortable as the others I’ve used. Obviously this isn’t the way they are designed to be used so it’s just a personal preference issue. Other than that they are great sound and quality for the price.</span>

<span>I used the Fit Sport 3 nearly daily. They were comfortable and the sound quality was average. I could get two days of workout on one charge, so that would equal about 3-4 hours of power, not the 6 hours advertised. Overall, I was happy, but a few weeks under a year old, the volume up and down buttons No longer respond. I would not buy  at the current listed price of $28 again.</span>

<span>I had the original galaxy buds for a long time and they just recently gave out (One wouldn't turn on at all). I loved those earbuds and they were the best I had ever had. I have weirdly shaped ears and the hard headphones dont work for me and most cushioned ones don't stay in my ear so I was looking really hard for a nice pair to replace them. I found these and not only do they fit wonderfully in my ears, they are amazing quality. (Though if you have an iphone and want to use touch controls, you have to connect them to a samsung device to set the controls up first and then you will be good to go, as they don't connect to the wearable app on iphones like some other models.) The sound is great, noise cancellation works better than I thought it would, and the touch controls aren't too senstive. All in all, if you're looking for a good pair of long lasting headphones (with great color selection), these are the buds for you.</span>

<span>This is my first pair of wireless buds, so I don't know if I'm the best to compare it rate their quality. However I have been enjoying them!<br/><br/>The only couple of things that I have a problem with is that they can only connect to one device at a time (can't connect to both my computer for streaming and my phone to take calls). I have friends whose much less expensive buds do that, so I'm not sure why these can't.<br/><br/>The other thing is that they are quite large for my ears, so I have to constantly readjust and put them back in as they fall out. I wish they were just a little smaller for a better fit.</span>

<span>Overall satisfied with this purchase, the sound quality is noticeably superior to cheaper bluetooth headsets and the battery life is extremely competitive.<br/><br/>The only drawback is the range seems a bit low. I could walk from one end of the house to the other and only downstairs or out on the patio did my $30 bluetooth lose connection. These Samsung lose connection 1 room away- it is not a huge issue but since I tend to do chores listening to podcasts I now have to remember to bring my phone with me.</span>

<span>I will start by saying I only bought these because I dropped my original galaxy buds and lost them. I LOVED the original buds. I wore them 8-10 hours a day every day. Even when Android 12 was released and the Bluetooth started acting weird I loved them. Even when using 1 ear bud at a time started not working properly I still loved them. Mainly because I believe it was the android update that broke them, not the buds breaking.<br/><br/>Fast forward to buying these. The fit is horrible. I have tried all 3 sizes. The large ones made my ear canal itch like crazy. The mediums allow the buds to turn and fit awkwardly and fall out. I didn't attempt the smalls for more than 5 mins.<br/> I have seen many many people say they had to buy foam tips to make them fit right. The old buds hardly ever fell out unless I was doing a bent over exercise at the gym for a couple minutes.<br/><br/>The touch sensors are horrible. I don't know if it's because the fit is bad and I can't hit the right spot, but I have to tap them several times to get them to register that I touched them. Then on the other end they are way too sensitive to non human touch. I was wearing a rain jacket a week ago and the hood kept making the buds start and stop just by barely touching it, but as I said before, my hand barely registers when I touch them.<br/><br/>The sound quality is fine, the noise cancelling is fine, all the functional aspects of them are fine, but the fit is so terrible I don't even know how Samsung released them this way. The touch sensor is so inconsistent I almost wonder how they are the same brand as the originals.<br/><br/>I would not recommend buying these. I would honestly just buy the original buds if I had to go back and do it again.</span>

<span>Edit; After all I went through, when I was putting them back in their packaging to return, the right headphone magically works now. I'm going to keep them for now to see what happens<br/>I purchased a pair of the Misty gray a few days ago. When I receive them I noticed the charging never finalized telling me it had finished charging. Didn't think much of it. Went to use them the next day and the right headphone does not connect to the base. It doesn't show any sign of charging or register being placed in the base whatsoever. I called JVC and had them walk me through some troubleshooting options and the headphones didn't act at all how the customer service representative on the phone expected them to act. The initial pair I got, I already did a replace on and have received the new ones. They have the exact same problem. A friend of mine has the same pair and I put her headphones in my charging base and they charge just fine so I know it's a problem with the headphone itself. Amazon won't let me replace again so I have to do a hard return. Maybe it's for the best...</span>

<span>I had a 1st gen pair of AirPods whose battery failed so thought I would try these as an alternative for a fraction of the cost.  They sound better than my AirPods...they are NOT noise canceling (passive or otherwise), which is what I wanted for outdoor use so I could hear surrounding traffic, etc.<br/><br/>The sound is excellent, with frequencies that I can normally only hear on my 50mm over ears audible.<br/><br/>My only complaint isn't the fault of the headphones as far as I know and is a moot point if you plan to use with a single device - if you pair them to multiple devices, be prepared to have to toggle bluetooth off on all but the desired one until they have connected.  There is no hand-off like you get w/ Airpods (perhaps this isn't part of the bluetooth spec, but it seems like this could easily be implemented in software the same as it is for Apple's own hardware).  It never fails that these things pair with the device that is physically farthest away from them first (did I mention that they have good range?) and I'm running all over the house turning bluetooth off on different things.  The JBL app I downloaded seemed out-of-date and served only as EQ for different (older?) models, and perhaps is a missed opportunity to make up for Apple's shenanigans here.</span>

<span>I had some Klipsch ear pods I had to return. Sure they had the metal case and metallic earbuds and all those sizes earbud tips but internal quality was bad a constant buzzing sound from a bad chip so I ordered a second pair still bad so returned both of them. I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser  of course. When I bought these they had just come out no Amazon reviews but I took the chance cause I love my HD-25s and I haven’t looked back. I’m an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.<br/><br/>Now yes these are 100% plastic but they don’t feel cheap and that plastic also means they don’t feel cold touching your skin<br/><br/>Yes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause I’ve had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.<br/><br/>No wireless charging but who cares it’s USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work day<br/><br/>And the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but that’s inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.<br/><br/>Could you get better sound sure but why it’s Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better sound<br/><br/>If you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then you’ll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones you’ll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0</span>

This is my first bluetooth earbuds but I've used in-ear and standard earbuds regular from Etymotic in-ear earphones to earbuds bundled with products like iphone. These have a great sound. Treble not hyped and bass just right. One thing I do not like about consumer earphones and headphones (low impedance 18 ohms and lower) is their minimum volume can be too loud already (depending what you are listening to - especially podcasts). One negative is that the XS attachment isn't really smaller than the S.</span>

<span>The sound quality and noise cancelling compared to my usual Airpods Pro, are significantly of lesser quality. Loud noises (metal hitting metal, air coming out of an air compressor, nail guns firing, anything I normally encounter while at work) tend to result in static sound coming from the buds, and are extremely annoying. The audio has a slight delay from video being played on my phone, which is annoying considering I'm using a Samsung phone with Samsung earbuds, and my Airpods Pro don't have any such audio delay.<br/><br/>The buds are comfortable while being worn, and pretty durable. After using them for nearly two months, I have dropped them in metal shavings and oil, and haven't had any issues so far. They don't fall out of my ears when I'm tossing and turning while sleeping. Phone calls while on the floor at work tend to be painless, and I haven't had anyone complain about audio quality while on the other end. Battery life is pretty good, I usually can go about 4-6 hours without having to put them in the case. I sometimes wake up in the morning after wearing them and they still are playing music that I put on when I went to bed 7 hours before. The case holds maybe 2-3 full charges, which is good enough to only charge them once every two days, give or take.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd probably rate them 3.5 stars of 5, but will raise it to 4, based partly on being able to get them at a reduced price during Prime Day. I'd still probably pick Airpods Pro over these, and still usually bring them both to work. If you had choose just one, I'd go with the Airpods, even though they're more expensive. Even if you don't own an iPhone, they work pretty much the same overall.</span>

<span>I hesitated to buy these because NOTHING ever stays in my ears, it's so annoying they're always falling out. But UNFORTUNATELY in this day and age phones don't have a plug in for me to use my millions of sets of plug-in ear phones (now what am I going to do with all those?), so finally I gave in and bought these on prime day, and got a little discount. Still expensive with the discount but that's life these days. They are beautiful, I got the purple ones.<br/><br/>When they arrived I saw what other people are talking about, they are a bit slippery and so is the box. Since having them I've already dropped them several times all over the floor. I use little alcohol wipes to clean them.<br/><br/>I am happy to say, they STAY IN MY EARS. I don't know if there is a technique that I'm supposed to do, but I put them in, and then I twist and they seem to be staying in.<br/><br/>The noise cancelling option and the white noise, is something I never knew I needed. I work in healthcare, and let me tell you some of the units are so annoyingly noisy with bells ringing and people talking loudly or shouting, I get very burnt out from the noise which makes me cranky and in a bad mood and just grinds my nerves and I'm screaming inside.<br/>This noise cancelling helps allot with all that,  it's drowned out and muffled so it's more tolerable.<br/><br/>I'm glad I gave in and bought them, I'm one of those old school people that thinks everything is too expensive and I don't want to buy anything anymore. I'm happy to say, this was a good investment. I hope they last for the next 10 years because I don't want to buy more.</span>

<span>So I recently upgraded from a note8 to a s22 ultra. Seeing that the s22 ultra doesn't have an aux port... I needed some ear buds for music. Now I do have some skull candy crushers which are amazing with sound quality and Bluetooth but the size of them can be a bit much. Thus my purchase of these ear buds.<br/><br/>What can I say... right out of the box they connected instantly to my phone, no set up required. The ear buds hold about a 6-8 hour charge playing music and the case holds a charge of 13 hours.<br/><br/>The buds are interesting they have interesting modes to them.<br/><br/>Ambient mode - almost like a hearing aid, it boosts up the sounds of the background so you can pick up noises such as nature, birds, streams, etc.<br/><br/>Noise cancelation- the noise cancelation is alright. It does suppress noise but it's not super amazing comparer to the skull candy's.. the music is good though.<br/><br/>The program for it on the phone has a built in equalizer,  base boost, tremble, etc. Instant seemless connection, touch on/off and other features.<br/><br/>The touch aspect allows you to pause the using just by tapping the buds. Holding it bud switches it from noise cancellation to ambient. They also have a feature for ambient on voice so when you or someone else talks it switches to ambient so you can hear them and switches back to the music afterwards.<br/><br/>For the price the music quality isn't super amazing but the features outweigh the lack of music quality. Most people won't notice the difference in quality. My brother is a music producer so I tend to notice a little differences in them.<br/><br/>If you do decide to purchase them keep in mind they work specifically with samsungs and I believe other androids through Bluetooth I don't believe it has any apple support.<br/><br/>Lastly if you have a newer Samsung it has powers hare and you can charge the buds by placing the case on it. These out of the other buds are the best and most durable ones. They have the best water proof that can be allowed swimming for up to 30 minutes. Which is more than enough for heading to the gym for lower end water resistance such as air pods or other buds.<br/><br/>Hope this review has helped.<br/><br/>Included with the device is<br/>1 charging cord (USB c)<br/>Charging case<br/>Pair of ear buds<br/>Spare tips for the buds of different sizes</span>

<span>My new Galaxy Buds Pro are like a small slice of heaven for me.<br/><br/>Being an audiophile, a musician and recording artist, I have had the chance to wear just about every type of headphones and earbuds out there. I have paid far more than $200 for headphones, in-ear monitors, and ear buds in the past.. but I have to say that this purchase I was very tentative about. I did tons of research while looking for a pair of wireless earbuds, and I was honestly stuck between 3 different products, all from different companies.<br/><br/>In the end I chose these galaxy buds pro based on the size of their driver, and the fact that they had a 2nd tweeter driver the size of most earbuds only driver. I figured they had to be the best, with the size and combo of the two drivers (which are basically the speaker itself for those unaware of what a driver is) and I am glad to say that I was right. The sound clarity and range are almost perfect. The only issue I have is more or less with my body, and that is that when I move a very specific way the earbuds shift ever so slightly and it breaks the seal the rubber cups create. The result is a noticeable change in sound quality, but all I have to do is give them a quick push in and all is well again. Thankfully this only seems to happen when Im listening to music while sitting down, and again its a very specific movement with my head that causes it.. my ears sort of move a little, and the earbuds have to shift around a bit due to the movement of my ear. Normally this happens with any type of earbuds, and with most the loss of sound quality is extremely drastic. With these buds pro, the loss is noticeable but far from distracting.. its the difference between perfect sound, and a sound that is slightly lacking and a tad hollow. But one push in on each ear, and the seal suctions the cups in and the sounds is just impeccable. Then again, AKG are the ones behind the tech in these buds so its not a big surprise that they are excellent for music.<br/><br/>I listen to all types of music, and have a vast collection of high res music files (the kind that are very large and take up far more space then the typical MP3 files do). The regular MP3 files I have sound better through these buds then they do when put through expensive floor speakers. And the high res music files suddenly jump to life.. I actually heard things I've never heard. Pink Floyd comes to mind immediately and my finally being able to fully understand what they are saying in the background. Even things that were never meant to be heard, like the sound engineer telling them to start playing.. little things in the music can finally be heard and it is just fantastic. I honestly couldn't be happier with my purchase and knowing now what I know, Id happily pay more for these things.<br/><br/>What shocked me was the noise reduction and ambient sounds features. I had to download some updates through the app, but once I had it all current those features really shined. Even the voice recognition is exciting to experience. Its sort of weird to have earbuds in, and all sounds are totally blocked off.. until you or someone else speaks and with the buds still in you can hear as if you didn't have them in at all. The television was right next to me, I could hear it quite well when my buds were first put in.. I could hear the TV perfectly then all of a sudden I could barely hear it.. the buds were just in, and nothing was playing through them. But they had turned on, and the noise cancelation thing kicked in or I might have switched it on in the app playing with it at first. I started the updates and when it finished suddenly that same noise reduction was drastically better. It was shocking. I kept talking about it, and then getting shocked that I could hear with the buds in. I sort of lost my mind for a bit raving about them, then I played music and lost my mind a lot more.. and in the end I am now wearing them about 5 hours a day, totally addicted to music all over again that I've heard countless times before this. Now the experience is so much better, its just like I said.. a slice of heaven.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the app is wonderful too. The equalizer is rather limited but still makes some very nice changes and is a step in the right direction. Would love to see a full range equalizer with more flexibility, but I'm just picky with those types of things. I used the app to change the bass range, and when I switched over to my Sony walkman the sound remained and it all worked rather flawlessly. I cant say enough good things really.. go get a pair, do the updates, make sure the fit in your ear is proper and that a seal is made with the rubber cups (they ship with different sized cups if you need them), and adjust the features in the app.. boot up spotify, youtube, or your favorite music files.. and voila, heaven enters your ears and serves you slices of musical glory.</span>

<span>I purchased these in early 2021 for traveling with. These are perfect for traveling on airplanes and in airports to listen to music or watch movies on airplanes and mask the noise of people around you, or even if you want to sleep. I dropped them on a Delta flight so I overnighted a replacement pair to my hotel. The headphones are perfect, except the microphone picks up the smallest noises that are far away and amplifies them for anyone I talk to on a phone call. I had them warranty replaced this week. Had them within two days, and customer support was great and very understanding. Only problem is the replacement pair has the same super sensitive microphone and it picks up foot steps or water running in the background and I get told it sounds like someone is banging a wrench on a something. I bought a the JLAB GO Air as well to try($20 on their site) and the mic is a bit better on those.<br/><br/>Keep in mind my first pair had perfect microphone quality. Possibly just a bad batch or microphones or something wrong in the manufacturing process.</span>
