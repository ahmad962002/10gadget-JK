<span>TLDR: Spectacular neutral-oriented headphones. Not for bassheads.<br/><br/>These headphones have a sound signature very few people are familiar with, and that is absolute neutrality. There hasn't been a single person that I've showed this headphone to that has been wowed by how it sounds at first impression. The usual reaction I get is "why so little bass?". Yet this is still my favorite headphone, the first time I put them on my head I immediately knew these would be my closed back endgame and I strongly believe this is one of the greatest headphones I've ever heard, right up there with the best of them.<br/><br/>"But Dog" I hear you ask, "why would anyone want a headphone with ' no bass ' "?<br/><br/>And I repeat, this headphone is not for everyone. However...If you're one of those few souls looking for neutrality in a world of bass boosted headphones, this is it. The most neutral closed back I have ever heard and there is really not much else I can compare it against, much less for the price. This is not a headphone that will take your music and it will make it sound pretty when it is not, it won't emphasize the bass notes, it won't emphasize the treble. It won't hide sibilance. It won't embellish sound in any way, It'll give you the song exactly how it was intended to sound.<br/><br/>"Well, that sounds boring"<br/><br/>These will sound boring if the music you're listening to was recorded and engineered in a boring way. Sadly most music is not mixed well, so you will definitely have tracks where you won't have as much oomph as you like. And that is not the point of these, these headphones are not trying to impress you with bass and treble.<br/><br/>What's that I hear, you like cringy analogies? here's one: These are the equivalent of a good friend who always tells you the truth without sugar coating it, but at the same time he's not trying to hurt you or make you feel bad. Sincere, truthful yet careful in the way he speaks to you. That's the Elegia in a nutshell. Truthful, revealing but buttery smooth in it's delivery.<br/><br/>They're incredible to look at, they do look like they cost as much as you're paying for them. You get a beautiful hard case to carry them and a 1.2m cable. They're supremely comfortable, my comfort reference has always been Beyerdynamic DT990s ( which sound awful for music listening, but are super comfortable ), and these are second to none.<br/><br/>Above these you have the Celestees which cost a lot more, but the color scheme makes them look dated. They do a couple things better than these, they're more fun to listen to, more resolving imo but they're not as neutral as these. Once again, be very mindful of what you're purchasing here. This is not bass boosted, this is not treble emphasized, this is neutrality at it's finest. If you're into that, you have to try these before you die. They are discontinued now, so I wouldn't be surprised if they sell out eventually. They are simply spectacular. I own headphones triple the price of these, yet these are the ones I keep coming back to for music enjoyment because they just do music how music should be done.</span>

<span>I've Been a Music Lover Since The '80s - My Very First Set Of Headphones Were KOSS.  I Purchased The Sennheiser HD598 Headphones in Ivory About 8mos Ago For Just $149 From Amazon.com and I'm Quite Pleased By Them Especially Since They Are in the Less Than $300 Category.  I Watched Plenty Of YouTube Video Reviews On These Focal Elegias Before Pulling The Trigger On Them, I Definitely Have No Regrets!!!  I'm Running Them Through Either My Fiio A3 Headphone Amp From My Lenovo Laptop or From My Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G Smartphone via TIDAL Music Service and YouTube Music.  I'm Still In The 'Break-In' Period So Imagine These Elegias Are Only Getting To Sound Better Than They Already Do Now.  If You Can Afford The $400 They Are Definitely Worth The Investment in My Honest Opinion - 10/10!!!<br/><br/>Update 10/28/2022 - Ordered a Set of Dekoni Audio Memory Foam Replacement Ear Pads For $90 From Amazon.com - I Believe They Are Worth It, Slight Upgrade In The Soundstage, and Definitely More Comfortable...</span>

<span>Build Quality:<br/>One word: Exceptional.<br/>Everything you've heard about Focal is true. The box unboxing was like opening an Apple Product. Meticulous attention to detail. The plastic of the box was super high quality. The case the headphones come in is the same high end case that the 4000 dollar Utopias come in. Lot of people complain about the braided focal cables but this headphone comes with a black smooth cable that is 3 feet long and super high quality.<br/>The headphone design is wonderful. Clean design. The headband is half pleather and half velour (bottom half). Very comfortable against the head. The arms holding the headphone are hard dense aluminum which is so stiff and looks gorgeous with the black cups which are against high quality plastic. The logo is aluminum and supremely crafted. You can see the drivers inside the cups.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that the clamping force of these headphones is no joke. The headphone is very solid and substantial. Not too heavy but not light like say a HD600 either. But the clamp is pretty tight and you should wear it a notch looser which breaks the seal a bit but improves the comfort if you wanna hear for a long time.<br/><br/>Sound;<br/><br/>Bass: This is the only let down of this headphone. Ive heard quite a few headphones and Iems and compared to the HD600, HD800s, Aria, LCD2, these are on the light side in this respect. The bass is definitely there but its this super clean bass that you can hear more than you can feel. Its not large, voluminous or thunderous. It feels light and does have much impact. I ran it off the Schitt Asguard by the way. The bass is just barely acceptable for me and I am someone who prefers a slightly more bass than your typical listener. I would say its similar to the HD800s which is also light in bass. It doesn't even come close to planar bass which destroys this headphone which really doesn't make sense to me because dynamic headphones especially closed back tend to do bass well. Maybe it has to do with the M shaped technology they are using for this particular driver. I read however, that the focal clear which has a driver of same size and composition resolves all these issues and is OPEN BACK which is even more confusing haha.<br/><br/>Mid Range:<br/>Fantastic. This is the highlight of this headphone. Vocals sound superb. Absolutely beautiful smooth presentation. Nothing that is annoying or stands out in this range.  The resolution of this headphone is amazing. Mid range detail is great. Electric guitars and bass guitars are a joy to listen to. Instruments like piano, and string instruments come through extremely natural and beautiful sounding. This headphone is slightly mid-forward. Really one of the best mids Ive heard in any headphone.<br/><br/>Treble:<br/>The extension is there and you get some treble details but it doesn't have any major peaks in the treble range that I could spot out. I'm very sensitive to certain treble peaks. I get sound fatigue very easily. For example the HD800s is way too bright for me. I also had these electret IEMs shuoer tapes which i liked but can't listen to for long because they are so bright. This headphone is definitely slightly bright but does not bother me at all. It has just enough detail to make the song complete without irritating you. The treble is also smooth and easy to listen to.  Rock and heavy metal are very enjoyable because you don't get the annoying high pitched sounds. It does distorted sounds wells too. It plays poorly recorded music well. Also, Rap is great on this headphone. The only drawback is that I wish for a little more bass when listening to rap but literally all other aspects of the song are really solid.<br/><br/>Separation: Very good for 500 bucks. This driver is outstanding in this department. It has planar magnetic level separation. The presentation of rock, heavy metal is some of the best ive heard because the guitars are beautifully separated, the vocal is nicely centered and very natural sounding. Imaging is also pretty good.<br/><br/>The headphone has a slight smaller soundstage. Its definitely wide for a closed back to the point that someone would think its open if they didn't know but its not that wide. Most of the stuff happens close to your ears. The sound is intimate which is good because simple vocal tracks sound good. Its a bit wider than the HD 600 which is also pretty narrow soundstage.<br/><br/>This headphone can play many types of songs very well. Any song that isn't too bass focused sound fantastic in this heaphone. If you like mainly Rap, Rock, Heavy metal, this is a no brainer. If your a bass head don't even bother with this. You will be disappointed and don't believe what the other reviews say. The bass is honestly speaking: lacking a lot of volume. If you listen to classical, jazz, pop, this headphone is a go in those genres too. I specifically liked all of system of a down, "Laid to rest", "Walk with me in Hell", and others.  Overall very good sound and quality. If they had made the bass on this headphone better this would have elevated this to another level!!!</span>

<span>After reading a lot of reviews, many of which have opposite opinions, I wasn't sure what to think.  After listening to these for a couple of days over an iFi hip-dac2, I have to say, these are the real deal.<br/><br/>LOWS/BASS: Pretty even handed as many reviews have indicated, however, this is obviously dependent on the music source and what you're using to drive these.  Activating the XBass feature on my iFi hip-dac2 really brings the low-end out to a very rich, textured level, which the drivers handle with ease.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE: If you're looking for pure analog bass enhancement, there's nothing better IMHO than what iFi has done with their XBass enhancement.  I have a FiiO BTR5, Q5s, and Q3, which are all great and bring something different to the table, however, when you're comparing how the bass boost on each compares to iFi's XBass, they don't compare at all.  FiiO's bass boost basically turns the music into a muddy mess, which is quite unfortunate, since it's very clean without it.  XBass, on the other hand, is far more complex and basically enhances it based on the headphone's own bass response (or lack thereof).<br/><br/>MIDS: This is where the Elegia's really shine.  Vocals particularly, are flat out...WOW (tested mostly Country and Singer-Songwriter).  You can really feel the emotion, which translates to a real, visceral audio experience.<br/><br/>HIGHS: Very revealing, yet stops short of "hot", grating, or sibilant.  If you've tried the Fostex T60RP (planar), you'll know those can get a little piercing on some tracks.  The Elegia's, however, never get to that point.  It's like filling a cup to the brim, yet it never spills.  Very impressive.<br/><br/>SOUNDSTAGE: They're closed back, so it's not going to blow any minds, but if you prefer closed-back headphones, these actually have a very nice soundstage, which is enhanced further by the impeccable imaging.<br/><br/>CONS: The stock cable, while it performs well and is robust/well built, is very unwieldy because the kinks in the cable never work themselves out.  The newer Elegia shipments include a black rubbery cable, not the fabric covered black/white striped cable.  It's likely due to the fact the Elegia was discontinued and they had more headphones produced than cables for said headphones.  Given you'll likely want to go balanced anyway, the Meze Audio 99 Series Silver Plated Upgrade Balanced Cable 4.4mm works like a charm (and is beautiful, to match the beauty of the Elegia's).<br/><br/>100% RECOMMEND!</span>

<span>I am a headphone junkie, I used to always review and try out the next headphone out there trying to find my perfect set of cans. Well that was until 2017 when I purchased the Shure 1540. Shure is a company that does not put out a large variety of headphones, nor do they produce a new set of can's every couple of months. What they do seem to produce is quality for the dollar.<br/><br/>As soon as I tried the Shure 1540 I was done, no more shopping around. Yes I have tried a few newer headphones since but even at triple the money I could not beat the sound of the 1540's. I once let a friend try then on with one of his favorite songs and all he could say is "I am sure glad my ears don't have a memory because they will hate my phones" The 1540s are very neutral in sound, vocals are very clear and clean. These are amazing can's and as I write this review I noticed that I purchased them in late 2017 so they are almost 5 years old. I am amazed at how long they have given me great sound, considering I do not use the case that came with them but simply through them into my backpack when flying. I travel about 30 weeks per year for my job so these are very tough, quality made headphones.<br/><br/>I tend to like a fairly neutral sound and with the 1540s I sometimes EQ a bit of treble or base. Not much but some songs seem to improve with a slight EQ, I remember one youtube review of these when the reviewer was swearing saying that the 1540s are too Fing neutral and he would never use them. He felt only sound guys at a studio would use these. I am not shure (pun intended) if that is true but I love the sound and clarity of these amazing headphones.<br/><br/>Here almost 5 years later I have not purchased a new set of headphones. Everything under $1,000 just do not sound as clear as the 1540s. Are they perfect no, and I do realize they are mid not hi fi but to my ears they are nirvana, just amazing clear sound. Are they perfect NO but is anything, I have broken 2 sets of cables (they come with one extra) So I paid $20 for a new cable. They come with 2 sets of ear pads, I am still using the first. The earpads are amazing, so very comfortable and they keep your ears and head from sweating and feeling hot. 5 years in and I am still on the first set speaks to how good the earpads are.<br/><br/>I think a few have commented on the clamping power of the 1540s and if I could tweak them I would have them clamp a little harder. When I slightly push a little on the drivers towards my head the sound is even better. That said if that is my only gripe for the price they are amazing. 5 stars all the way.<br/><br/>Because I travel a lot I tend to go through headphones every couple of years. I also get tired of the ones I own and buy another set looking for sound perfection! Not anymore, for me these are what I have always been looking for and when they break I will just order and other 1540. 5 years of amazing sound for $345 (Amazon had a sale when I bought them) is a fantastic deal. Thank you Shure for an amazing listening experience and great build quality.</span>

<span>UPDATE July 26 - Replaced Ear-pads and replaced headbands. HUGE difference - already described ear-pads below but headbands made the whole thing to be SUPER COMFORTABLE - made headbands myself - did not received year one that i ordered so instead got myself soft lambskin , cut it to two pieces and add in between high quality high density ECO memory foam and sewed it myself by hand! Whole thing took me 2 hours (by the way you can unscrew headphones and place ends of leather inside and screw back) but now i have MOST COMFORTABLE headphones! Now last thing need to figure out is replacement longer cable - after that cans ready for ROCK and ROLL! See my photos of Shure SRH1540 with all upgraded parts below.<br/><br/> UPDATE - i added one star because of sound. Compared sound to Beyerdynamic CUSTOM ONE PRO, AKG 553PRO , Sony MDR, OPPO PM-3, Senheiser 380 Audiotechnica 50x, Akai , etc - just visited nearest Gitar Center and tried every can available there with music and i also took my headphones to compare sound and comfort. There WAS phones MORE comfortable than SRH1540 - like Audiotechnica 50x and AKG 553PRO. There was phone that i loved to listed but it came a little bit short in matching sound quality - Beyerdynamic CUSTEM ONE PRO - both cans sound very close with amplifier but WITHOUT it Shure SRH1540 DID performed so much better that if i had any doubts they all was gone! Here is brake down what is what. Rest of my lengthy review i am going to delete.<br/>NEGATIVE:<br/>1. OK for chipper phones totally not OK with phone of this price - i end up ordering one pair of Brainwavz Hybrid Memory Foam Earpad - Black PU/Velour - Suitable For Large Over The Ear Headphones<br/>. It DOES FIT but does require some practice to place them on. Comfort changed much! My large ears do not heart any more after hours of listening.<br/>2. Leaks sound in - not bad but does leak WITH ORIGINAL pads - again after i replaced them with pads i mentioned above sound leak simply NO MORE!!!! Changed whole sound to the better and bass and details – LOVE IT!<br/>3. Headband actually not very comfortable because of one of the most idiotic design i ever seen - especially for the phone of this price range. Please refer to photos i download that can show you what i am talking about. To target this i already ordered custom made memory foam and leather new headband that i can add to my SRH 1540 - still waiting for it also i ordered CUSTOM MADE headband with US made memory foam and same quality ear-pads - still waiting for them to arrive - but i am 100% sure that improvement over comfort will be huge just like this Brainwavz pads. The whole game changed for me! Actually sound leak so much none existent that it a bit spooky - i dont even hear/know what going on around me.<br/>4. Cables - replacement or longer cables of same high quality from Shure NONE-EXISTANT. So i am still hunting for matching in quality cables LONGER that original 5 feet cables. That’s REALLY big deal for me<br/>5. Price despite sound and everything else still very OVERPRICED . For this price you can buy Beyerdynamic model i mentioned above that sound great and buy another small amplifier and that still would be less that i payed for this SRH1540 and also Beyerdynamic does NOT require upgraded ear pads because they are MORE comfortable than SRH 1540. Cables are longer too.<br/><br/>Asking why i did not return these cans and did not buy Beyerdynamics? Sound in SRH1540 still a little bit better and i can NOT downgrade - just cannot.<br/><br/>POSITIVE and a BIG ONE!:<br/>1. SOUND!!!!! - best of all the phones i heard so far, even so much commented Beyerdynamic headphones. BEST sound period.<br/>2. AMAZING sound stage for closed cans like this<br/>3. Sound separation - u can hear EVERY detail!!!! DETAILS MAN IS AMAZING!!!!<br/>4. with upgraded pads - originals i just thrown to my garage box - leak disappeared and sound got EVEN BETTER! Insane!<br/><br/>Waiting for custom made head bands to arrive and that would seal the deal.<br/>.if only sound would not be so good i would not bother - but really when you have chance to compare side to side sound -wow - after them u dont even want try anything else ... no kidding. I am actually writing this and catch myself on moving my head to the rhythm of music so good it sound. ANYTHING from Earth Wind and Fire to violin of Vanessa Mae to Prodigy ...insane!<br/>But still HATE "genius" people in Shure corporate who made idiotic headband , short cable and somewhat smaller ear-pads ... one thing they did REALLY GOOD is sound. Fine – Shure gets 4 stars for sound.</span>

<span>This is really first impressions a few hours after obtaining the headphones.<br/><br/>Firstly, the use case. I already own a pair of SRH 1840's, a pair of SE846's and a pair of SE315's. I have owned several other open back headphones over the years, (including the Philips Fidelio X1, L1, AKG K712 pro) and have auditioned others (Senn HD 650's ...etc). I have also owned some close back headphones. (Philips fidelio M1, Senn Momentum, Vmoda Crossfade, Beyer Custom One Pro.)<br/><br/>Now, I have sold off most headphones except the SRH1840 for the simple reason that it was the one all-round performer. The Fidelio X1's, the AKG 712 pro's and HD650 are all excellent headphones, but the SRH1840 does it all, and does it all quite well. Vocals are fantastic. The bass is a little lacking, but it is a open back headphone. The high's are crisp and clear enough without being too sibilant or fatiguing.<br/><br/>I can however use the 1840's only at home. Colleagues would not be impressed if used at work. So, I picked up a pair of SE315's for work. While they are quite good, (no comparison to the SE846, but i'm also not going to toss a $1000 pair of earphones on my office table.) they fatigue my ears in a few hours. Also a pain to take off and put on. The SE846 fatigue my  ears even faster btw, but I only use them sparingly.<br/><br/>So, I wanted a over-ear closed back headphones for office, which have to sound good, and last a long time. (no batteries within headphones, thank you.) Enter the Shure SRH 1540.<br/><br/>In comparison to the 1840's<br/><br/>Appearance:<br/>* A little flashier than the subdues design of the 1840. If anything I would like my closed back headphone i plan to use publicly be more subdued.<br/>* Other than being a little flashy, very good. I like the look of it.<br/><br/>Accessories<br/>* The fatal flaw of the headband being the easiest point of failure still remains. My 1840 headband has worn off in about 3 years of use. The rest of the headphone still works wonderfully.<br/>* The cable is a little fatter than the 1840, for some reason. Hard to get it straightened out compared to the 1840's cable.<br/>* Alcantara pads - I don't dislike them, but I think I like the velour pads of the 1840 more.<br/>* Packaging - So shallow! :) The box is nicer, but the overall packaging is cheaper. Again, not sure why. The 1840 came in a huge hard cardboard box! But I guess it makes more sense to put the money on the actual product/case instead of the packaging.<br/><br/>SOUND!<br/>* They sound very close to each other. I can usually tell the difference between different headphones, and can point to where one is better while another is different.<br/>* I definitely like the sound signature of the 1840's a little more. The sound-stage appears a tad wider, and while bass as such might be a little recessed, it is definitely present.<br/>* Shure describes the frequency responses as 5Hz to 25kHz on the 1540 and 10Hz to 30kHz on the 1840. That is not to say the db levels are identical at the different frequencies. Also the impedances are different (so you will need to adjust the volume on the audio player when doing an A-B to get the same dynamic volume level.)<br/>* The 1840 definitely sound more airy. (I know that sounds like mumbo-jumbo, but you have to hear it to believe it.) They also might have slightly better high's.<br/>* The 1540 definitely has more bass than the 1840. (For e.g., in Brothers in Arms, the background rhythm drums sound, the bass drum sound more present on the 1540's, the while the snares sound more crisp on the 1840)<br/>* Overall they share the sound signatures fairly close to each other.</span>

<span>Let me first say this: I am not an audiophile in that I know the frequency ranges that are ideal for each genre, or anything like that. I'm just a guy who loves to listen to music with the most ideal headphones for my particular taste. And let me say this now - If you're looking for closed-back headphones with the sound quality of open-back ones, purchase these.<br/><br/>The presentation is just astounding. None of the parts of the headphones are cheap and make you question your purchase. Each part is high quality (Unlike some headphones with flimsy plastic). These are also very big (You may want to look up pictures or videos of people wearing these to gauge an estimate). You can indeed wear these out in public transit (Which is what I will do), but just know that these are not the typical sized headphones that people normally wear outside.<br/><br/>Also, the items aside from the headphones are just great - a very good quality case, which contains two cables and an extra pair of ear pads, and the headphones themselves. However, again note that these headphones are not really targeted towards users who are using public transportation, and so the case may be a little larger than you'd expect. Again, definitely check the size and dimensions of it before thinking you can fit it in any bag. Besides this "con," however, the case is absolutely marvelous, and it's great to see companies like this give you the accessories for the price you pay.<br/><br/>Now for the sound? Excellent. It's neutral (Targeted at those working and editing tracks), but for a person like me, I found that I can listen to these with any genre - hip hop, rock, jazz, dance, etc. The added "effects" of other headphones can be bothersome when changing songs from one genre to another, and a neutral sound quality presented by the SRH1540 is fantastic.<br/><br/>There is noise isolation for these headphones, and I found it marvelous. If you're listening to some music at a low level, you will barely hear a thing! Also, the comfort level of these headphones is out of the world! The padding is excellent, and will hug your ears - this can prompt you to wear these for hours without feeling any discomfort. I must add that after a LONG period of time you will feel some slight clamping pressure, but I did not mind this at all. (NOTE: This varies with each person because of the differing head sizes, so I would definitely try to see if you can test wear these out at a local electronics store that sells them)<br/><br/>Now of course these headphones do have some flaws. I find that at high to very high volume levels the headphones kind of "dip" and can be hard to listen to songs with vocals (Particularly female). However, I've only had these for just one day, and will continuously monitor and update this post if necessary.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't really like was the fact that the cables didn't have any volume control or functionality with the iPhones. Yes, I know that people like me aren't necessarily the target audience, but it would have been nice to receive some variations in the cables I'd receive.<br/><br/>IN SUMMARY:<br/>+ Amazing build quality<br/>+ Excellent sound<br/>+ Comfort is just fantastic<br/>+ Accessories don't try to cheat their way out<br/><br/>- Vocals (Particular female) at high volumes can be quite hard to listen to<br/>- Some clamping force after a long period of time (I was wearing these for nearly 5 hours before I really felt anything, mind you)<br/>- Cables don't have any functionality with your iPhones, Androids, etc.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 9.75/10<br/>A+</span>

<span>I live in an apartment with thin walls.  Sure I would love to play my music loud.  I'm a record collector and I really enjoy it, but there are limitations due to where I live.  These speakers are really nice.  First, they are very comfortable and that is important for long listening times.  And the sound is just lovely. They are perfect for apartment living or just a nice set up if you want to play the music loud.  The Meze 99 Classics are very beautiful looking as well.  I purchased the silver/walnut as it matches the faces of my vintage sound system and I love that.  Super worth the prices.</span>

<span>I can understand why these cans get so many rave reviews. The highs have the most beautiful texture to them. Crisp and detailed without any harshness or sibilance. The midrange is exactly right, with no bright peaks or perceptable recesses. I experienced no ear or head fatigue after 2 hours of continuous listening at high levels. They are surprisingly easy to drive. I like my music loud, and even running them straight from my Galaxy S8 without any external amp or DAC, I can get surprisingly loud, clean levels.

There is a cloudy bloom in this range that sounds like the resonance of the walnut enclosure.

I don't find this to be the case at all. They certainly don't have boosted highs like the Beyer cans, HE400i, or the venerable but grossly overrated ATH-M50X. I suspect that those who perceive the highs as less prominent are listening at low volume levels and their perceptions are colored by the Fletcher-Munson curve. This states that human ears are less sensitive to bass and treble at lower volumes.

Otherwise, recommended despite its midbass tonality. The mids and highs are that good. UPDATE: I received my replacement pair No channel balance issue with the second pair, so my first must've been defective. BUT, the small but noticeable frequency response discrepancy between the driver's still exists, as noted by ear with music and with a sine sweep test tone. Thus, the imaging could be better- some vocals, guitars, bass, etc. mixed dead center in the original recording will present slightly panned to the left or right depending on what part of the frequency spectrum they occupy. However, this is common in cans in this price bracket. Lastly, on my second pair, one of the two cables was defective. The TRS cable was fine, but the TRRS cable with the inline mic sounded like it was miswired out of phase, with a very hollow sound. The effect was similar to a plug not inserted all the way into the jack, but it was. source device was Galaxy S8. This phone works fine with other headphones with TRRS plugs and inline mic/remotes, so the problem is definitely in the Meze. I didn't test this cable with the first pair, so I'm not sure if this issue is a one-off manufacturing defect, or a design defect / incompatibility. Still really like these headphones though.</span>

<span>These headphones are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. They are very durable and portable. The sound quality is one of the greatest things that I have ever heard. Everyone I show loves them. They only have passive noise canceling so if you are looking for total silence this is not your set but the Walnut does a good job filtering out most of the sound!</span>

<span>I don't normally write reviews. Not an "audiophile", just a person who got few decades of experience with audio equipment and knows what he likes. When it came to headphones lately I use wireless, for convenience. Bose for the buds, Sony for over ear. I don't like active noise canceling because it distorts music to my ears, and only needed on a noisy plane ride or if you live in squalor. My solution to plane ride is a pair of silicone plugs and over ear headphones with a good seal, obviously closed back, and if you can't hear your stuff too well - crank up the volume.<br/>This isn't a review, this is a set up to give an idea why I bought Meze 99 Classic model. I was really looking into a good quality set for... GAMING. Yes. Something easily driven if wired without an amp, or a wireless set, because my Sony's omnidirectional mic picked up my desk fan, AC, and everything in between, and you don't want to be THAT GUY on Discord who gets ignored when you talk in a voice channel, because everyone lowered your volume. I watched countless reviews on a few sets and realized I might have to settle for a wired set, due to a list of specific qualities I was looking for. I tried multiple sets and was not satisfied for various reasons, latest one from Logitech, which came simply physically broken, with cracked plastic out of a brand new sealed box.<br/>I was tired, gaming was pure frustration, wife was nagging me to buy something because she wanted to give me money for it, since she was out of ideas for my birthday gift. I decided to get a separate USB table mic (I did and I might just write a review on it), and a pair of good quality headphones. I went to couple of stores in Manhattan, including B&amp;H and Audio46, to listen to some AGAIN. After hours of listening of various models and watching countless YouTube videos I suddenly was suggested Meze. I listened to Meze Neo but something was off. Maybe the plastic cups sounded too harsh or fake, maybe its just me. Also I wanted that longer wire that came with 99 Classics and the look. More mature, more refined. I thought the gold accents were gaudy, but when in Rome... or Romania. You know. I ordered a pair. Sure, the company is not widely known. Sure, gold and walnut has that 1970s vibe. But, they hit some of my many bullet points: easily replaceable and repairable parts, none of that glue/hot glue mess, replaceable ear pads, light construction and comfy feel, super smooth wooden ear cups, removable non-kinky cable of right thickness and length. When I listened to music on my phone I discovered the Meze had excellent mic for calls, built into the wire. All this came in an attractive box with accessories and a very nice storage case with a Meze badge. Finally, the sound. They obviously have a slight U signature on the EQ, warm, not overly bassy, nor trebly. You don't look at 500$ + expensive sets if you just want some gaming/music/Tv apparatus. Most of them have studio like tuning which is FLAT, because they're made for critical listening and not "I just want to melt into my chair after work" situations. Most have higher impedance requiring DACs and external amps and equalizers, making you tethered to one spot and feeling like another chore. Not these Meze 99 Classics. I normally listen to soundtracks, movie or games, don't matter, classical music, electronic, classic rock and metal to the extreme. Remember, the better and more expensive your headset is - the better quality files or original source of recording you would require, because they will uncover every hiss and dip, every rough moment will be heard. On most of my old timey punk, thrash and death metal records the level of original recording is crap, so the better your headphones are - the better you'll identify the problems and whole experience will become less joyful. But I digress. Meze has a warm, U shaped signature, as I mentioned, decent seal on the cups and it hides the ugly moments in my crappy old mp3 vinyl and CD rips quality, allowing me to sink into the rhythm and nevermind the bullocks. Meze emailed me soon after I received these asking for a review, but I considered 300$+ set a sizable investment, so I've waited about 2 months before writing this. I use these phones every day for gaming, TV and music consumption. I wipe the cups and headband every night with a damp paper towel to get rid of my skin oils. I love the looks, feel and touch, I love the sound and looks of jealousy in my wife's eyes every time I'm handling them, because I LOVE THEM. Could I afford something more expensive? Yes. Did I find something that better suited my needs and discriminating taste? No, and wouldn't waste any more of my time looking. They're here and hope they last... MY PRECIOUS-S-S!!!!!!</span>

<span>Just got these headphones today and here is my initial impressions.<br/><br/>Ok so i have always had starter gear here is a gear of stuff i have owned.<br/><br/>HD600 (current)<br/>MSR-7<br/>DT990<br/>DT770<br/>K712<br/>Hyper X Cloud<br/>HD598<br/>I will be comparing the HD600 as these have been my fav set and my reference for what is good.<br/><br/>Ok straight of the bat.. WOW! that low end is amazing coming from the sharp MSR7 and relaxed low end of the HD600, like seriously the sub bass this thing can manage is pretty amazing, especially on a track like James Blake 'Limit to your love' it really feels like there going to vibrate off my head!<br/><br/>But the best thing about the low end is that it feel so snappy and responsive and really does not bleed into vocals at all. The bass is so tight absolutley no feeling of muddiness.<br/><br/>Soundstage and imaging again is absolutely top notch, absolutely destroying the HD600 (which is famous for not great soundstage) really really impressive for a closed set of headphones.<br/><br/>Highs are also very nicely handled, they certainly do not have the crunch or sparkle as some of the Beyerdynamics i have tried but still sound very nice, I personally prefer the way my MSR7 handles the highs though.<br/><br/>Details are very nice i can pick up lots of subtle cues in the tracks that can be missed on lesser headphones, it doesn't quite beat the HD600 for that but it's not far off.<br/><br/>Overall i absolutely love what these headphones can do, they have a balanced sound signature with an absolutely slamming low end which adds great fun, and i know it might be new toy syndrome but i think i prefer it over the HD600.<br/><br/>I wish they were sold more easily in EU, i had to import from Amazon, but they sound awesome for the money they cost. I needed closed cans for an open office and they tick the sound box but....<br/><br/>I REALLY hate the headband and cup design, yes this is already well documented but i hate how the cups swivel around and twist up all the time it really does but a downer on the headphone but its worth living with. I was worried about the weight when i picked them up but the weight honestly melts away when on my head no issues at all.<br/><br/>Hope this can be of use to someone, im not technically minded and for sure dont have the most anaylitcal ears.</span>

<span>Good headphones very comfortable, sound is good, great bass, medium are forward, treble is fine not so refined like M570, soundstage is wide not many as an open headphone but fine, good resolution and clear sound as Monolith signature, M570 also is a great headphone, better than Hifiman XS Edition , at least for me.<br/>Edit after 1 year; After test others than Ananda, He400, Fidelio X3, Beyer T90, this Monolith is great!, Bass , mids and highs all put like a magic combination, Bass is powerful, clean, Monolith headphones are really my taste, I own also a M1070 and also sound great!, buy it you didn't get back.</span>

<span>The big issue here is that mine broke within 90 DAYS of delivery. Suddenly the left side just stopped working despite trying multiple inputs, cables, etc. I have just submitted a ticket to customer service for an RMA, so hopefully the next pair won't have the same issue. However at this price point there really isn't an excuse for this type of QC issue (and I say it's a QC issue because another of the more recent reviews from June 10th had the exact same problem). Beyond that, they just aren't terribly impressive, and the cons outweigh the pros.<br/><br/>For example, there are no shortage of reviews for this product that will tell you the same thing: The headband is horribly uncomfortable and they are heavy. Either of those things would probably be tolerable if not exacerbated by each other. I will say the ear cups are quite comfortable and they are really the saving grace when it comes to the comfort of these headphones.<br/><br/>Honestly these are at a price point where there is a LOT of competition, and frankly, they just don't stand out to me. The sound is good, but it didn't blow me away by any means. Apparently if you're willing to modify them (and void your warranty, which you may end up relying on, based on my experience), then you can improve the sound by making them open-back. However, do you really think you should have to do that to headphones at this price point? Don't get me wrong, I know this price pales in comparison to the price of some headphones out there, but that doesn't mean there aren't better options at this price, and that's the biggest issue.</span>

<span>Pros: Headphones come with a very nice balanced, tone, solid in the mids and bass, with non drowned out highs. Excellent all around headphones, from fps gaming to High bitrate audio. Sound does leak at higher decibels but very little,  Very happy with the sound upgrade from semnheiser 558 but...<br/><br/>Cons: The headstrap is just downright GARBAGE, its cheap and with its divided sections, all the weight is pushed on a single spot on your head, mind you this is. Not a lightweight headphone by any stretch, the headband exacerbates this problem to the point where i dont want to wear them longer than 30 mintues due to the pressure headaches and pain on one spot on my head. Its ridiculous<br/><br/>Build material seems fine despite the headband connections, some ,being plastic  makes you feel like it can break easily, not a big deal but paired with the fact that these headphones like to spin on a gyro and flip and twist all over the place, giving the chance of something plastic breaking. Its very odd, they are heavy but act as if they have no rigidity or stiffness to them. Can be good or bad depending if you prefer no stiffness handling headphones<br/><br/> I dont think they put a left or right on either cup, but they did color coat the headphone jacks green and red but its counter-intuitive because once you put them in, you cant see which side is what. Making you test where sound is coming from a lot.<br/><br/>Overall these headphones are a love/hate relationship, on one hand they sound great and I would love to continue to use these! But everything else is either a literal headache pain or a 'process' just to fit these off and on your head and for the price. You could mod it but for the price, you are better off buying something else.</span>

<span>I have owned the Audio Technica ATH-A990z for just under two months and have been using it daily. It really surprises me that this doesn't have any reviews considering the success of the previous iteration of this headphone, the ATH-A900x. I really don't often do reviews but I really think this headphone does deserve praise. Here is a bit of background and context of where I'm coming from. If you don't care just scroll down to the (SOUND) portion.<br/><br/>I mostly listened to open backed headphones. My first real headphone where my Audio-Technica AD900 (the original open back, non Xs). They had  an amazing midrange, soundstage, and imaging. But they had absolutely no bass and highs that were very accurate but on the edge of being sibilant. I ran them off a Yamaha AV receiver that had a decent headphone output and it really brought down the highs to acceptable levels. I used tone controls included in the receiver to bring up the bass up to enjoyable levels. I also added extra padding in the ear cups to stop the drivers from toughing my ears  That was my daily driver for nearly 3 years before I broke them from constantly sitting on them accidentally when ever I left them on my computer chair. I absolutely loved they sound of theses headphones (after modifications) and is partly the reason why I decided to get the A990z. I had gotten the raved Phillips SHP9500 to replace my old workhorse, but those sounded extreme boring and dull compared the AD900. Very comfortable and nothing sounded wrong on them, but they made my entire music collection sound the same and nothing stood out. I wanted to experience that Audio Technica magic again, and I also need a closed backed headphone this time (my noisy little nephew lives with us now!). I look into the newly refreshed Art Monitor Z series, the A990z being right in my price point. I also have the TEAC AI-301DA headphone out as my new source audio output. I mostly listen to electronic (Aphex Twin, BOC, Chris Clark, etc..)  music with some occasional instrumental orchestra or jazz.<br/><br/>(SOUND [with stock pads])<br/>Simply put, these headphones are fun and exciting sounding while still being very accurate and concise. The imaging/sound separation and soundstage is pretty good for this closed back headphone (These work very well with gaming!). Despite what the title and name say these are not that good for sound monitoring and engineering (although they are much better than ATH-M50x in that regard). The sound is V shaped, emphases on bass and highs but not overdone. The bass goes deep and has quite a bit of impact. These are not bass cannons but was I pleasantly surprised at much low end it pumps out (though maybe that's just my open back preference showing). Mids are still very present and wonderful, but not on front stage and like my old AD900. High are emphasized but nowhere sibilant like Audio Technicas of past and is very accurate. It also remained me of my AD900, but without the harshness. As with most closed headphones, these do indeed sound closed. There is soundstage, but not a whole lot and not enough to WOW most people like really good open backs. Imaging is very good, like AD900, but I clearly remember the AD900 being better<br/><br/>(COMFORT [with stock pads])<br/>If you know anything about AT's 3D wing system then you know that comfort might be a hit more miss (fortunately it's usually works with most people, myself included). There are some problems to note. The headphone will feel like its sliding off your head at first, though once you break them in and start wearing them after a while that feeling will subside. One thing that didn't subside was a pinching feeling on the pads. The pads themselves are quite comfortable and soft, made of high quality faux [?] leather. I personally don't like like any type leather touching my ears, I've been more inclined to cloth or velour pads.  But the real problem is that they are too shallow to offer any support on the head and the inner diameter of the ear hole is too small for most. My ears are not big and they fit uncomfortably tight in them. I would image anyone with larger ears would simply not fit in these. Fortunately, you can change the ear pads, thought most pads that are not made specifically for the Art Monitor series will be a REALLY tight fit. Some wont fit at all, but will some will (Like HiFiMAN Pads and Brainwavz Pads). The stock pads are the only flaw that come with the A990z.<br/><br/>(DESIGN)<br/>There not much to say if you familiar the AT design with their A series of Headphones. 3D wing design. Up, down, left, and right articulating earcups. Angled drivers. These also have a really nice fixed single 3 meter braided cable, which is curiously exclusive to the A990z within its own line up. The higher end models also don't have Up and Down articulating earcups for some reason. These are not the best in isolating sound, but it works well enough and keeps crying children noises at bay, more so that any open back. These are very efficient and not hard to drive. They can be driven off a most smartphones or a PC headphone jack to unsafe levels of loud. Be warned though, they are quite sensitive will pick up noise if your audio output is sub-par or dirty. These can actually pick up a constant low hissing in my TEAC AI-301DA, which I never realized was there with my Phillips SHP9500. I really have no idea if the A990z will scale well with high end equipment, but it certainly wouldn't hurt. The cool dark green and reflective chamber ring is very nice (the pictures don't do it justice).<br/><br/>(SOUND and COMFORT [with Brainwavz Hybrid Memory Foam Earpad])<br/>So I got tired of using the stock pads and constant pinching sensation it had. Brainwavz Hybrid Memory non-angled pads was one known pad that was able to (barely) fit on AT Cans. These are pain and will take like 20 mins as you struggle to get them on, but persevere though and you will get them on.  Having smaller hands also helps. I only hoping for a comfort increase and not much else, but I got much more than that. The sound did change for the better in my opinion. The soundstage increased, really helps it sound less closed and congested, not to really big levels like my AD900 but it gets damn close, especially for a closed back design. The imaging/sound separation and mids is now FANTASTIC and really reminds me of AD900. Highs didn't really change that much but does sound a little more spacious and accurate. Bass is much more tight and accurate, particularity in the lower spectrum. There is less low end bass slam which makes it sound more neutral over all (the low bass was quite accentuated for my taste).  Midbass still punchy and tight. Comfort is simply perfect now. My ear fit in the cups now, there is no sliding sensation with the headphones anymore. No more pinching feeling on my ears and the pads are much more breathable.  For just a little extra, these pads are so worth it.<br/><br/>(OVERALL)<br/>Again, the only thing that holding these back from a 5 star are the flawed earpads. The would be great if they gave it more depth and made more room for the ears. Other than that, these are fantastic closed back performer. The sound is really geared towards fun, but still that Audio Technica precision that most audio snobs will enjoy. AT struck a really good balance here, whether it was by accident or design.The lower end A550z are said to sound like a improved A700x, but are not made in Japan. The higher end A1000z is said to sound just same as the A990z, but with a littler more of everything (At double the cost no less!). And the flagship A2000z are said to be a VERY different headphone from all the rest. For the asking price, I say its well worth it. And personally, I will see no need to upgrade past this headphone in the coming years.</span>

<span>Greetings all, I hope to keep this short!<br/>I come from a HyperX Orbit S ~ 330$ base (sale 230$)<br/>so my comparison will be of ATH 990Z vs. HyperX Orbit S.<br/><br/>I want to explain my background a little;<br/>I game a lot, I used to game competitively but have recently fallen back to casual.<br/>I play OSU! which is a music rhythm game that relies on the timing of audio to be down to the low .3~.7ms range and being this headset has no software the range I get is .4~.8ms which is really good.<br/>Keep in mind, headset software causes a tad bit of audio latency from when a source is played to when you hear it because it needs time to add any after effects, it's the same thing of post production except in real time for audio.<br/><br/>Build quality is vastly better.<br/>It is much more comfortable to wear it is much lighter however it is not really an over ear headset. Yes it does go over your ears/around them however the clearance from the driver to your ear is much closer than I would particularly like being I have decently sized ears it can make it uncomfortable in that regard.<br/>The top of the headset only uses those 2 rubbery outer shell w/ a metal wire running within as a backup support, what rests on your head is 2 memory foam padded supports on both sides making is vastly more comfortable to wear, doesn't even feel like anything is on the top of my head.<br/>However as I stated before around your ears is where it will get uncomfortable after a while if worn for more than 6~8 hours.<br/>When shaking my head/swiveling fast it sits tight to my head, there is almost no looseness to it, now that's not to say later down the line as I break the headset it that there could end up being some kind of looseness forming.<br/><br/>The ear-cuffs that go around your ear are nicely padded, though it's made of the same cheap pleather like material most ear-cuffs use so after about a year of wearing/using this headset the pleather will start to fall off.<br/>There is not much else to say about the housing of the drivers other than it feels metallic but it probably isn't to cut on weight/cost making it a fairly light headset.<br/><br/>Now onto Sound Quality!<br/>I am a little sad here. Before purchasing this headset I had the childish idea that all headsets have gotten into the 7.1 surround sound business and made software or built software into the headset using a codec or something on the driver to give it 7,1. I am wrong, this headset is completely stereo and it almost in some cases can sound mono given if it encounters a bad audio source.<br/>In some scenario's I feel without any software to tune the headset it has a lot more treble than it does bass making things sound a bit washed out with higher pitched sounds. This is due to the higher frequency range this headset offers, so if you're looking for a headset in that spectrum, this is it.<br/>the audio EQ is not balanced well enough, but it's not balanced terribly either, I'm just not a huge fan on the current EQ this headset offers out of box.<br/>playing OSU! for a while I started to get used to how things sounded, and I was able to hear more than I usually would with my HyperX Orbit S which is a tad surprising given the specs on the Orbit.<br/>Both headsets have vastly good audio clarity however since the ATH 990Z has no 7,1 surround sound software some sounds are much more THERE and not faded away into the bulk of the sound inside of 7,1 which can happen.<br/><br/>Also a little reminder, the audio jack can be untwisted to a normal audio jack rather than thinking you need to buy an audio adapter for the larger jack, they just leave it on rather than giving you an extra little baggy with it inside as that could be easily lost.<br/>Yes I made the dumb mistake of thinking I needed to go buy one, luckily I had one at hand until as of writing this review I realized that it unscrews.<br/>There is no downgrade in audio quality just by using an adapter.<br/>I cannot speak for audio jack to USB/TypeC connectors.<br/><br/>I hope this review helps those looking for headsets.<br/>I think I'll stick with my Orbit S rather than going stereo. 7.1 just sounds so much nicer and gives depth to everything!</span>

<span>Appearance - A little bit ridiculous looking with the big Audio Technica wing support and otherwise very simple in looking, all black plastic, rubber and pleather with understated branding on the cups.<br/><br/>Build Quality - They do feel cheap when holding them, definitely a lot plastic involved. Bu seem solidly enough put together, I wouldn't worry much about durability, there's just nothing premium about the build. The cable is fixed (which is disappointing, not sure why Audio Technica is still so intent on making fixed cable headphones) and as mentioned very long.<br/><br/>Comfort - The A550Zs are very comfortable fit (I do have a large head so lack of clamp force may be an issue for people with smaller heads). They are quite light, I find the clamp force absolutely perfect (secure but I don't feel any squeezing) and the stock ear pads are quite comfortable for several hours continuous. I'd prefer a cloth earpad to leather or pleather but these are quite comfortable regardless.  They seem a bit smaller than the older models using the wing support, which will be good for most people.<br/><br/>Sound quality - They generally sound wonderful, especially if you are looking for detailed, vivid sound without over the top bass. Very detailed, excellent for gaming or complex music. Even the little flaws in recordings pop out from time to time. Decent soundstage, though not huge (My old AD900s have a substantially larger soundstage, but those are higher end an d open back) but better than expected fro a closed back headphone in this price range. The big thing with the A550Zs is exquisite upper mid range and treble. Vocals are beautifully lifelike and strings are an absolute pleasure. The bass is very typical of AT headphones, crisp, tight, precise if a little reserved. The bass is definitely more prominent when using a decent DAC than just plugging into a computer or phone, but they are easy enough to drive. Sound isolation good, but not great. All around a great sounding pair of headphones.<br/><br/>Value - Excellent. The A550z are probably the best sounding closed back headphones under $250 that I have put on (sound quality/signature is very similar to the A990Z, although the A990Z feels much better put together and has maybe a smidge more bass) and nothing else at its price point seems particularly close. If you need a ton of bass or really want a premium feel then you'll want to look elsewhere, otherwise if you're looking for something closed back its hard to find much not to like.</span>

Based on the DT 1770 Pro, it uses the latest generation of 45-millimeter Tesla drivers for a wide frequency range and a weighty, controlled bass. We smoothed The response slightly while retaining the punchy sound that's made the DT 1770 Pro a favorite in recording studios. With 32-ohm impedance, it’s easy to drive from portable sources without an amp, while the office-friendly closed-back design ensures your music won’t disturb your neighbor—and vice versa. The four-pin Mini-XLR connection allows compatibility with balanced cables. For unrivaled comfort, you’ll get two pairs of premium Dekoni earpads—one Sheepskin and the other velour.

<span>I love these. Not only are they comfortable, but they are by far the best sounding closed back I have heard. The soundstage is impressive for a closed back, music sounds delicate and fragile when it should and the bass slams you when it is part of the song. The mids are perfect and these cans leave little to be desired. They are easy to drive and these do not have the Beyerdynamic spike in the treble. Who knew Beyerdynamic could make a headphone that did not cause your ears to bleed?  LOL.<br/><br/>I encourager anyone looking for closed back headphone to put these on your short list. Try them. I would be surprised if you didn't love them as well.</span>

<span>I bought these for when my PC fan ramping up bothers me, because everything else I have are open-backs.<br/><br/>The sound is as expected from reading up on reviews. I have no trouble switching between my HD6XX (open-back) and these DT177X (closed-back) because they seem to have a similar sound signature. They don't wow me like my Sundara did, but there's nothing I can nitpick about the sound. I like how it sounds.<br/><br/>Originally I only wanted to buy it for gaming (because that's why my PC fans ramp up and stay at high rpm making a constant noise) but now I find myself using it as my go-to all the time.<br/><br/>The build feels solid and fitting for the price tag, unlike the toy-like DT770 Pros. The matte black design and elegant brading means I have no problem wearing these in public, although I would generally prefer to go wireless if I'm going to be mobile.<br/><br/>If you dig "Made in Germany", this is it.<br/><br/>The earpads are a little too small for my big ears. With thick-rimmed glasses on, they kind of sandwich my ears between my glasses and the earpad, and over long sessions could sometimes hurt. Otherwise they are surprisingly usable.<br/><br/>With the Brainwavz XL pads, though, these become super comfortable and I can wear them for hours at a time.<br/><br/>The cable, however, is just horrible and cannot be defended. It tries to maintain the loops it comes in, and there just doesn't seem to be a way to straighten them out. They also have microphonics, not so bad that they're not usable, but noticeable. The mini-XLR plug means replacement cables are extremely rare, and the rumored official balanced cable is nowhere to be found. So I went to Hart Audio Cables and ordered a set for these.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say they are worth their price tag. But they are by no means great value. If you need closed-back, if you like darker sound signatures, and if you don't mind shelling out another $100 to get aftermarket earpads and cables (well depending on your ears you could find the stock pads comfortable enough), then the DT 177X Go is worth serious consideration.</span>

<span>Update.<br/>I want to edit this. I didn't have sun light for my new pair that I just got. It's hard to see in my basement where I listen to my headphones. I hate to say this but those photos might have just been left over oil from finger prints. Both pairs of headphones look good now. Look at the top of my amp, its perfect and left the same type of marks. I assume everything was good and I didn't need a replacement in the first place. I would like to apologize because cleaning the paint must have made those marks. It did the same on my brand new amp as shown. Disregard the marks in these photos its finger print oil that was cleaned.<br/>OLD REVIEW BELOW..<br/>First view the photos so you know if you purchase this item to check the paint or powder coating flaws, I believe that for 470 dollars you shouldn't have any paint problems. First off I already have a new pair on their way to my house because of the imperfections. Amazon definitely took care of me to get a new pair. I love these headphones, closed with good sound. The thing I really like is how the BTR5 can power these unbalanced and balenced. That's 110 dollar Bluetooth amp and you don't even come near maxing the power out with the balenced 2.5mm on that dac/amp. If you need a balenced cable it's about 35 bucks on Hart Audio Cables website. I get all my cables from them and I recommend their system, I suggest you go check them out if you have never heard of them. Anyway great headphones for the money if you need a closed back.</span>

<span>As someone who likes to write music on my free time, I bought these headphones to help me improve my mixing decisions. I also wanted something relatively durable since I’m tired of replacing my $30-40 headphones every year. As a college student, these 569s were an investment for me.<br/><br/>COMFORT:<br/>The HD 569 is my first pair of cans over $40.  And it’s the first pair that I can honestly say is comfortable for long listening and mixing sessions. Ear cups encapsulate my ears, and the padding provides a nice cushion and passive noise isolation.<br/><br/>NOISE-ISOLATION<br/>I go to a military college and it’s common to hear yelling in the hallways. These headphones actually block out a lot of that noise, making it easier to study. I can still hear what’s going on outside my room, but it’s not distracting. Note that the noise-isolation is passive, not active.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY<br/>Sound quality is great as far as I can tell. It seems very mid-centric but that’s fine by me. It just took a little getting used to as my brain adjusted to this new normal. However, I wish the highs were emphasized a bit more so I could get a better sense of what’s going on up there. However, it’s also true that recessed highs means less listening fatigue. In other words, these headphones can work fine for mixing, while also being great for casual listeners who just want to enjoy music or watch movies. Soundstage is good too.<br/><br/>DURABILITY<br/>It looks and feels like it will last for at least several years. But take everything I say here with a very small grain of low-sodium salt, because my experience with headphones is limited compared to the many audio professionals here.<br/><br/>I appreciate that it doesn’t use a hinge-style mechanism to clamp the earcups because in my experience those can wear out or break easily. The build quality of this 569 seems better than the MD-7506s I’ve used at a studio. Bear in mind these are just my first-impressions. Regrettably, I missed the time-traveling lesson my friends said I missed in elementary school. So unfortunately, I cannot at this moment tell you how these headphones will hold up in the next few years. But don’t worry - if I remember, I’ll post a 4 month update when I finish my fall semester.<br/><br/>DUST PROBLEM<br/>This is not a huge problem, but I feel it is worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The smaller black circle on the outer face of each earcup easily attracts dust. The padding material on the earcups and headband also suffer from this. It’s frustrating because now I have to pick out/wipe off the dust every few days, especially from the outside. Again, it’s not really that bad if it’s just one or two day’s worth of dust (only takes a minute or so getting it out), but if I let the dust settle for even a week, I imagine it would be a nightmare getting it all out. I dust all horizontal surfaces in my dorm room every day out of habit, so it feels unnatural for me to leave something with dust on it.<br/><br/>This is purely aesthetic; it has zero effect on comfort or sound quality.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>So far so good. I recommend these HD 569s to anyone looking for a pair of headphones that is comfortable, durable, and has sound quality that is good for both mixing and casual listening.</span>

<span>The price was fair, and I like the closed back along with good reports on its sound signature much like the more expensive Sennheiser's. They have decent sound isolation and need very little power to drive them. They are well-made and light. They sound good on just about any mobile audio device. And they really sound great on A&amp;K cube.</span>

<span>I am using a G6 DAC with this and the default sound without any profiles used, etc.. sounds a bit muffled. Voices don't sound like they would in real life ( It helps to record audio from someone you know and play it back to help calibrate ).<br/><br/>With my previous headset, I had to tune it quite a lot and get it sounding good but the sound stage on those aren't as good as this. In games you can accurately pick out locations pretty easily but I still have to do more testing to see if it justifies paying this much, especially because voices sound off, music sounds muffled, etc..<br/><br/>Treble on these headsets is very sharp, similar to my previous headset ( which I tuned down ) but very slightly less. It is ear-piercing and hurts.<br/><br/>I don't know why noise-cancellation is an option as these are open-back and no mic.<br/><br/>The open-back design is nice as it expands the sound-stage.<br/><br/>The headset is about half the weight of my previous headset so that is a plus, however the major flaw is how it sits on the head. You want the clamping force to have the pillows apply even force all the way around your ears, but these are more /o o\ rather than \o o/ or |o o| which causes sound to escape out the bottom and actually hurts the sound stage. When moving my ears I can improve the sound quality a decent amount, but holding those muscles in that position is difficult for long periods. I loosened the headband so much that the headband barely touches the top of my head to make it somewhat fit but it doesn't feel secure and the cushions still don't fit right or help the sound quality.<br/><br/>Because this is made of plastic I can't simply adjust the headband to make it fit without breaking them.<br/><br/>I'm giving this 3 of 5 because of the sound stage, the decent sound quality ( when I move my ears ), how lightweight they are, the oversized area for your ears and the fact that it has a removable cable.<br/><br/>I am docking 2 points because these don't quite fit, and the sound is quite muffled even with moving my ears. I shouldn't need to use an equalizer for this headset; however, when tuning it the sound quality can be improved but moving my ears kills it and because it doesn't sit quite right it is easy to change how the sound enters the ear and ruining the immersion. The other issue is this doesn't have a removable cable on both ears, and I've owned many headsets and they typically fail when the internal cable going through the headband wears out as I tend to baby my headsets but just the motion of putting them on and taking them off causes rubbing.<br/><br/>I am currently looking for an alternative and will likely be returning these soon, but I'm going to see if there is anything I can do to help with the issues I've had.</span>

<span>They sound very spacious and have great resolution. Very deep and clean bass and good mids. Airy treble while remaining detailed.<br/>Build, lots of pleather which isn't terrible, you just know that it's going to be in shambles eventually.<br/>Creaky plastic in the headband is one of the biggest issues as you hear it inside the cups.<br/>Didn't come with a carrying case which is disappointing for this price and the build certainly doesn't feel like it's 500$.<br/>It slips off your head pretty easily as it has very light clamping force and the headband is very smooth with not much surface contact with your head.<br/>TL;DR: if you are only prioritizing sound, these are definitely worth considering and I love the way they sound, but keep in mind the build is underwhelming.</span>

<span>Source/DAC: Tidal, Modi 3+<br/>Amp: Asgard 3<br/><br/>Review warning: I own many headphones but don't really consider myself an audiophile, though my friends and family may!<br/><br/>Lows: Has some mid-bass bloom but due to the overall frequency response the mids and highs still come out. Good sub-bass and bass, great for hip hop, EDM, fast metal.<br/>Mids: Not recessed and not forward, perfect. For comparison I also find the Drop Sennheiser 6XX (650) to have perfect mids and the Focal Clear to have forward mids (though enjoyable). Sound tonally correct, especially male and female voices. I disagree with people calling this headphone V-shaped, it is not - to my ears.<br/>Highs: I can't hear over 14KHz so I can't comment there but the treble is there and present but not over powering (like a Sony MDR-V6). No treble fatigue here.<br/><br/>This is a value powerhouse and sounds like much more expensive headphones. This headphone would have been $1,500-2,000 just 3 or 4 years ago. I have heard a few in this range, including the Arya (didn't like, too technical for me), Focal Clear (like), 800S (like with EQ). I haven't heard anything else for $500 recently that sounds this good. In comparison to the old HE-500, this is a much more capable headphone, that headphone is warm and relaxed but this one is quick and warm-neutral. This is a better headphone in all aspects than it, in my opinion. Be sure to use a decent amp/dac.<br/><br/>Fit is good but I have a somewhat large head, very comfortable. Much more comfortable than the headband found on the old HE-400 and HE-500. Very light. I haven't had a HFM with this style headband before, looks similar to the Deva, probably is.<br/><br/>Quality control seems fine on my set, I have no issues and see no issues. Hope it holds up. I have replaced headbands on HFM products in the past so we shall see.<br/><br/>This is a very technical headphone without making your ears bleed with fatigue. It actually feels like a extremely solid deal at $500 in 2022, no regrets.<br/><br/>Edit: Unfortunately my right side failed after a month but HFM replaced it no questions, already received the new one and all is good. Amazing customer service, still a 5/5 from me. Quality issues can happen anywhere, thanks Hifiman!</span>

<span>These sound absolutely incredible. You feel totally immersed in the music no matter what genre it is. Soundstage is very good. You haven't truly experienced music until you listen with a good pair of audiophile headphones. These are the way to go if you're just getting started in the hobby.</span>
