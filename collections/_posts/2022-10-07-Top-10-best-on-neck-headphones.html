<span>I have had several pairs of similar type devices used exclusively for using SmartPhone, primarily to make and take cellphone calls.  The BEST featured was the LG30 model; problem is that after awhile the device will no longer take a charge due to wearing of the charge port.  The newer HBS-SL5 model works satisfactorily and is comfortable to wear, but battery life is short and the 'vibration' level for incoming calls is low.  Another shortfall is in software that does NOT advise when the device is connected or even on/off as did the LG30's.  The retractable earpiece(s) are nice and work well, but seem a bit flimsy.</span>

<span>I have purchased 6 of these. I bought 1 for myself a couple years ago it worked great for about a year.  I haven’t found a Bluetooth headset that lasts longer than a year. Then I got another one for myself then my daughter borrowed them and next thing I know I’m having to get my kids a pair. Then My wife wanted 1. Now the whole family has a pair. They sound great ! The noise canceling is not very good. It cancels for you to hear but on a call it doesn’t cancel background noise. I’ve had customers complain that they can’t hear me if I’m outside and a truck drives by or it’s windy. For listening they are awesome for phone calls they are meh.</span>

<span>These are really good for all day use and the only thing that's bad is the wires to the headphones seem to be a little thin they seem like they would break easily if your not carefull. But over all good sound quality, they don't fall out of my ears and they are easy to set up.</span>

<span>I LOVE the buttons for controls.  I lost 3 ear buds that popped out of my ear and either broke on impact or got lost in the weeds. The tap controls worked AT BEST 50% of the time.  Buy a better set, with wires that catch falling ear buds and buttons that always work.</span>

<span>I have had Beats and Beats Flex earbuds for years now. My last pair finally stopped wanting to charge and one of the buds fell in the pool so I couldn't use them anymore :( THEY ARE NOT WATERPROOF which is super sad because i love to shower it swim and listen to music or podcasts but I can't do that with these. I don't understand how Beats doesn't have a waterproof set yet. It's very sad since their quality is great. These types of rest buds are the only kind that I can get to stay in my ears comfortably. They have great sound quality for music and phone calls and the battery lasts through the day so I only have to change it at night. I like that it has the neck strap so I don't have to worry about losing one of them. I actually just bought two more pairs because I like them so much &amp; so I can always have a backup set that's charged. I just wish they had better waterproofing. Oh, and how could I forget..... THEY DON'T COME WITH A CHARGER!! Well they come with a USB C cable but not the part that plugs into the outlet. What's up with that??? I don't believe it mentioned that in the ad.</span>

<span>These are workhorse Bluetooth earbuds that I like better than Airpods, with a 5 star rating in every category except sound quality - and the only reason I deducted one star is because Apple is selling stuff that is truly audiophile quality now. They are "almost" wireless which is to say, no wire to device but there is a wire between the earbuds - for completely wireless you'll need Powerbeats at nosebleed pricing. No earhooks, but when fitted with the right size tips, they stay in place. You can keep them around your neck all day and only put them in when you decide to watch a video clip or take a call. They are comfortable for Netflix/Prime binging. They are hard to lose if you drape them over your neck. Apple Genius Bar replaces lost tips for free, but only in person.<br/><br/>These sound better than Airpods, are a close match to Airpods Pro but without active noise cancellation, drape comfortably from the neck so they won't get lost (ever had an Airpod mysteriously slip out of your ear and lost it?) and if you choose the RIGHT SIZE ear tip, have EXCELLENT SOUND. With an undersized ear tip - like I had at first - there is inadequate bass. With a proper air seal, bass is excellent in an honest way, not pumped up artificially like old-skool Beats, with equally honest, balanced, mids and highs (you won't appreciate what they can put out until listening to some Dolby Atmos sound effects videos on YouTube). NOT fatiguing to watch videos for hours. Good sound stage and special effects with Atmos capable devices (Apple iPad/iPhone with A10 chip or higher, Fire HD 10 current edition, Fire HD 8 current edition) on Atmos encoded sound tracks (FWIW, Atmos is Dolby's effort to provide 360 degrees of sound effect from just earbuds - and it's surprising how well it "fakes" normal surround sound from multiple speakers, front and rear). (Also try Windows Sonic for Headphones, free in Windows 10, buried in sound card settings.)<br/><br/>Where Beats Flex are outstanding is price - under $50. That's equivalent to knocking $100 off the first-release BeatsX which rolled out at $149.95 in 2017. And convenience. Unlike conventional Bluetooth earbuds, which have to be endlessly paired and re-paired to use with different devices, Beats Flex will pair with ALL your iPhones and iPads and Macs provided only that they are signed into the same iCloud (Apple ID) account. On Android, you download an app, and so long as you have the app you don't even have to be signed in under the same Google ID.  With Windows 10 - sorry, conventional pairing and repairing.<br/><br/>With a device you just used (or used yesterday), logging in and connecting is automatic - device power on, Flex power on, you are connected. If you move to a different device, whether Apple (with same Apple ID) or Android (with Beats app running), you first need to click on Connect (even if the device flashes a signal that it notices the Flex). It's easier done, than described.<br/><br/>You can also share audio with a friend's Apple device - two headphones paired to one phone or pad.<br/><br/>There are some controls, but all I ever use is the magnetic clip attachment between the rear of the two buds, to sleep and to pause playback on the iPhone or iPad. And the off button, when a session is over.<br/><br/>Battery life is great. I can watch videos all day and night, the battery lasts longer than I do. Or, on saner schedule, go several days without a recharge. Compare that to 3 or so hours from some indie, cheapo (but good) Bluetooth earbuds (hook over ear style).<br/><br/>Charges with a USB C cable (included) so one more cable to carry, but ultimately greater compatibility and fewer cable-wars (Apple is taking baby steps to kick Lightning to the curb and focus on C).<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Cheap, good sounding, wireless, over-the-neck earbuds with Apple quality. Wow.<br/><br/>Caution: I have some sync issues with VLC video playback (but not YouTube, Netflix, Prime). It's easy to fix by adjusting the sync delay setting in VLC. I don't have these sync issues with MPow Flame airbuds. I think the Flex emphasize audio quality over perfect sync, that or VLC and Flex don't play nice with each other. Anyway its annoying but easy to fix, and I suspect the programmers at VLC will eventually take care of it.</span>

<span>I accidentally dropped these outside the weekend before a hurricane through. I had no idea until I had pulled up on Monday morning at work and saw them where I park. There was so much rain and wind I thought for sure these things won't work. I turned them on and the light actually came on! Of course I am still skeptical whether they actually still function properly. After walking them in, cleaning them, and letting them charge a little. They still worked! I am not sure if they are meant to be water proof and I don't  reccommend trying but I was impressed! This is a solid product!</span>

<span>These buds have really good battery life. I use them mostly for spoken voice from an Apple Watch.<br/><br/>There are a couple of curious issues: There is an audible connect tone and a power-off tone, but no power-up tone. To go with that, it is difficult to see whether they are powered up or not if you’re wearing them; the tiny LED is at the top of one of the dongles, so you can’t see it. So you hold the power button down for several seconds, and it will probably be powered up and you can connect.<br/><br/>Very nicely, when you power up the buds, an Apple device will notice and give you a connection window. This even applies to an Apple TV. I use them mostly with an Apple Watch, though, and it works smoothly with them. When connected to the watch, the watch’s power display will show the state of charge of the buds. Other Apple devices will do the same; it’s more than just usual Bluetooth pairing. Call it “deep pairing.”<br/><br/>I think the buffer may fill slowly. If I connect to my watch and strike out walking, they cut out some when my body is between the watch and the buds, like when I swing my arms. That’s irritating, but I notice that this is a problem only when starting out; I don’t notice it happening after a few minutes.<br/><br/>The last noteworthy thing is that allowing the buds to magnetically attach to each other will pause your audio, which will restart when you pull them apart and re-insert.<br/><br/>Finally, don’t be put off by the USB-C charging port. You can buy a cheap adapter to USB-2 so you can use old charging blocks or USB ports on old computers, but USB-C is great for iPhones (8 &amp; up) and Apple watches. It’s fast. Get a USB-C charging block and a cord for your phone if it’s an 8 or newer. It’s the way of the future (for now).</span>

<span>THE GOOD:<br/>+ Discreet, insofar that no one will be able to truthfully make those "turn the volume down, I can hear your music all the way over here" comments. Get rekt, Mom.<br/>+ Safe. Even when listening to music at full tilt, you can still hear when you're about to be run over by a forklift or assaulted by a vicious kitten, or when your significant other is talking to you.<br/>+ Socially acceptable (or at least moreso than devices that cover/fill your earholes). In my experience thus far, people seem far less put off by this device when exchanging pleasantries or engaging in customer service duties (please refer to your employee handbook regarding this device's compatibility with your supervisor's personality) compared to traditional headphones, earbuds, or AirPods. In some cases, it can even serve as a nice icebreaker.<br/>+ Intimate. It puts music in your bones, man. Can't get much closer than that. Audio is crystal clear and overall of high quality (or at least as high quality as the file itself). It is a delicious experience, for lack of better terms.<br/>+ Stellar battery life. On the first day of use (I did charge them overnight), I wore these non-stop from 0800 to around 1800. There was approximately an hour and half of call time, and the rest of the time was just music. Volume was at roughly 67% throughout the day, and by the time I took them off, the Bluetooth menu on my phone was reporting that my Aeropex were still above 50% battery life remaining. Granted, overall battery life will degrade over time - as it does with all rechargable devices - but this is a phenomenal starting point. Doubly so when considering how lightweight and small this device is.<br/>+ Solid mic quality. Of all the headphones and headsets and earbuds I have owned over the years - and I have owned many - the Aeropex has one of the best built-in mics I have had the pleasure of using in a long while. People can actually understand what it is that I am saying during phone calls and on voicechat platforms like Discord. Maybe my excitement over this is tempered by the fact that I had absolutely no expectations for it, given that the last half a dozen devices I've owned had mics suited only for collecting dust, but still.<br/>+ Thoughtful. Well, AfterShokz, I mean. They provide not one, but TWO of their fancy magnetic charge cables. No brick, but to be fair it's a safe bet that the average person has at least one standard USB receptacle somewhere in their life.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>- Yes, bone-conduction as a means of audio delivery does lose out a bit on the lower frequencies. Bass drops will not be as phat, the double-kickdrum sprees may sound less intense, and certain bassy, sexy voices may not sound quite as buttery. This is the caveat in the "overall of high quality" remark in THE GOOD section, but for me it is a tolerable caveat.<br/>- There is a voice that announces things, like general battery level, connection status, and the "POWER ON" and "POWER OFF" announcements. It is not the worst robovoice I've ever heard, but I would have much preferred a variety of beeps or other, non-vocal status indicators. For volume change or pausing audio, it does play back a simple beep, which I deeply appreciate. Some folks report that this beep is inordinately loud, but that has not been my experience.<br/>- It comes with a silicon pouch... tote... thing... which smells about as good as the milk you found on the floor this morning, which your cat regurgitated either last night or the night before. Cold, sour, slightly rancid; 10/10 do not recommend. Mine also came with a so-called Sport Belt. While it doesn't smell absolutely vile, I have approximately zero uses for it. Not necessarily a bad thing, I suppose, but it is a "waist" of materials. (I'll see myself out.) In all seriousness, go get a hardcase, or use a small cardboard box, or really anything other than the silicon odor abomination it comes with. I recommend a case from Hermitshell, which are tailoired specifically to AfterShokz products.<br/><br/>THE UGLY<br/>× Fit may vary. I was comfortable all day (roughly 10 hours straight, for those of you not paying attention), but my coworker had to attach tiny cushions to the bits just behind the ears on his set because they were, as he put it, "a little clampy."<br/>× Sometimes they would catch on my hood when I'd be looking around, and so were shifted a bit out of place, which was mildly irritating. I've trained myself to adjust the way I look around as a result.<br/>× Amazon keeps bringing up noise cancellation, for whatever reason. Bone-conduction headphones, such as AfterShokz's Aeropex device, are open-ear devices. That is to say, they do not offer noise cancellation. In fact, the lack of noise cancellation is actually a selling point. They do ship with a pair of foam earplugs, which are quite effective in blocking out sound, but I am not about to rate the Aeropex on the noise cancellation properties of foam earplugs. Good grief, Amazon.<br/>× COVID-related mask experience may vary. With the ear straps of the mask in place first, my Aeropex sit nicely over my ears with no issue and no audio interference. With my Aeropex on first and the mask's ear straps on second, I am still comfortable and neither item is at risk of slipping or falling or otherwise vacating their place atop my ears. I exclusively use a cloth mask with a 3D-printed frame (which is basically a cup for your face), so I cannot speak to the experience one might have with, say, an M95 mask, or a rebreather, or an exclusion zone gas mask.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 4.7/5.0<br/>This thing is magic, as far as I'm concerned. Delicious, intimate, beautiful magic. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.</span>

<span>I have been using these daily since I bought the in 2019.  I was a bit hesitant at first, but now I would purchase again and again.  I take my dog for a walk twice a day everyday and absolutely love these. I have always had a problem with having earbuds as they make my ears itchy and noise cancelling blocks out things like approaching cars and other things I need to hear to maintain awareness of my surroundings. I have used these for running and they are fantastic, they stay in place and never move and again let me be aware of cars.  I like to think of it as if there is a sound that takes over my hearing while I'm listening to music, then it's something I should be aware of.  Part of my walks has me cross over a highway on a bridge and during that time it can be a little tough to hear, but I either just pause or accept it, because that's how they are.<br/><br/>These also work wonderful for podcasts, audiobooks and anything else spoken. It's as if it is my own head voice narrating.<br/><br/>  There is a slight grip/pressure to them at first, but over time I've either gotten used to it or they relax a bit.  You won't be getting deep bass on them, but I've actually come to enjoy music a little more without the bass. If you need a little more depth you can put in ear plugs and that not only acts as noise cancellation from the outside, but deepens the range of sound.<br/><br/>On airplanes I've used them with earplugs and had no issues hearing what was said and found them to be very comfortable over the duration of long flights.<br/><br/>The battery life three years later is still something to brag about, I'm really impressed on how long they stay charged. As with any battery it does not like the extreme cold. I take my dog on a walk in the single digits and after taking them off the charger I got about 15min into the walk and was getting the low battery warning.  I kept it going, since they auto shut off when they need to and they lasted the entire 45 min walk, but did warn me every few minutes that the battery was low. Slightly annoying, but it's also really cold out.<br/><br/>Overall extremely happy with the product and will purchase again when these inevitably die.</span>

<span>Long review but I think you'll find it worth it.<br/>I love just about everything with these and I highly highly recommend them. Even what you might consider negatives have a positive solution or viewpoint.<br/>They don't move at all even when I shake my head, and I can even wear them when I lay my head on my pillow without any discomfort either. I've worn them to bed a few nights in a row for some relaxing music to fall asleep to. They sit comfortably even while wearing glasses with no extra pressure, discomfort, or loss of quality. I've already worn them for the length of a full charge almost all day without discomfort. I even wore them in the shower this morning with no problem either.<br/>The power/volume buttons are easy to feel and press, however the multifunctional pause/play button is sort of hard to use as it's so sleek you really have to feel for it and it's sensitive, but if you look at the photo I put a small drop of hot glue on mine to make it easier to find and now I have no problem with it at all, and it's easy to feel, so easy solution. If they designed this button and it's placement like the power/volume buttons that would be the best solution, but again, the hot glue works like a charm.<br/><br/>They don't cancel out noise as they don't go in the ear, but that's not the purpose of these. They're designed to allow you to have environmental awareness while still having good audio quality and they do just that. I've worn them driving to work a few times and can still hear the cars around me, and I've worn them and had conversations with no problem.<br/>They also don't have as low of a frequency range so bass is lacking if you like that deep bass punch, but again that's not their designed purpose and If I want bass, I'll use my in-ear buds or my big headphones for that.<br/>Overall, these are now my most favorites headphones I have ever owned, so I hope you enjoy yours as much as I do. And if they don't work for you for some reason, they're easy to return and use the money towards a different pair to try.</span>

<span>First things first, I hardly EVER write reviews. Way too busy, and I don't typically care enough. Here's a short and sweet summary: if you can fit the extra $160 into this month's budget (maybe no fast food, pizza, or coffee...whatever), don't hesitate - you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Next, here's some helpful info from the included manual:<br/><br/>Wireless range: 10 meters (honestly, I get better range than that...I've used them from downstairs in the opposite corner of my house from my phone)<br/>Continuous play battery life: 8 hours (they must mean streaming to two devices simultaneously and nonstop, or maybe talking on the phone for 8 hours, because I wear and use it all day from 6am until around 9pm and have only charged it at night - it has never died).<br/><br/>...now on to why I love these things. I am a previous owner of the Trekz Titanium. I tried the Trekz Air but didn't buy them. I was waiting for a unit that handled dual Bluetooth devices and was waterproof - Aeropex was what I was waiting for.<br/><br/>Cons: You already know this, bone conduction headphones can't replicate the amazing bass of an expensive pair of earbuds or cans. THAT SAID, when you're under water (these are waterproof) or wearing earplugs these things easily sound at least as good as a "decent" pair of headphones (like $20-40 range...more than adequate unless you are an audiophile). WITHOUT earplugs in, with open ears that are alert to your surroundings, I'd say these are the same quality "ish" of stock Apple iPhone earbuds. Maybe a bit less.<br/><br/>PROs:<br/>1. These have the best battery life of any wireless headphones I've used.<br/>2. I now have a headset that simultaneously connects to my work laptop for Skype meetings and my iPhone for personal stuff. Amazing. No more multiple headsets. Mic is great. Clarity is better than my Plantronics.<br/>3. Sound quality is great. Better than Trekz Titanium, can't speak for Air. The feeling that there is music playing that everyone else hears BUT THEY DONT is pretty amazing. I get to work or exercise to the music that keeps me going, but I don't have to worry about not being alert. No, these don't have great bass (without earplugs in). But as someone who enjoys dubstep, I can at least say I enjoy my music, still. The benefits far outweigh this minor drawback, trust me.<br/>4. Vibration (the tickle common to bone conduction) is dramatically improved, as is sound leakage. People don't hear these things unless they are cranked.<br/>5. Touching on something mentioned in my one and only "Con" - if you want noise cancelling headphones, it would be tough to find a better pair. Since you can wear the highest grade earplugs with these things - THEREBY *ENHANCING* THE SOUND - they effectively replace any other noise cancelling headphones. AMAZING.<br/>6. I love, love, love the charging port. The magnetic charger just snaps into place and works - I now wish every device had a charger like this. BONUS: they give you two in the box, so you have one for home and one for work.<br/>7. Since this is a relatively "new" technology, it's a great conversation starter, and everybody loves it. When you tell them to plug their ears (and suddenly they hear it BETTER) the facial response is like magic.<br/><br/>...so there you have it. I will likely not review another product for like ten or more years. But you, dear reader, I hope this pushes over the edge, if you're on the fence. These things are great. I have worn them all day, every day, since purchase (manufacturer warranty of two years btw) and they are comfortable and so convenient.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!</span>

<span>For a person who wants to be able to listen to music or a phone call or GPS directions and still be able to hear what is going on around them, these are a great option without going too overboard.  They also do a great job of blocking out noise that people you are calling would hear.<br/><br/>Be realistic about what these headphones are and how they work and what you expect out of them.  They do not block out external noise from your ears (duh, they are called open-ear headphones for a reaon)reason.  That means at times your music will be drowned out by ambient noise.  Also, because they don't have a speaker like most folks are used to, you do not get deep thumping bass out of these.  It seems like the bottom end of the frequency range is cut off, probably due to them being bone conduction rather than having true speakers.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>1.  Battery life.  I believe the product page states 6 hours of talk/music.  I have only used them that much one time:  over 7 hours of music continuously and I did not even get a low battery indicator.  The battery is also going strong after probably 4 hours of phone calls and music and at least another 30 of being on.<br/>2.  Open ear design.  These fit well over your ears and do not interfere with prescription glasses, sunglasses,  or safety glasses.<br/>3.  Sound quality. Audiophiles don't buy these, but for what they are, the sound is really good.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>1.  Size.  I have the regular size (I know Shokz makes a mini version) and the band that goes around the back of your neck could be just slightly (and I mean about 1/4 inch) larger.<br/>2.  Control location.  The volume controls are tucked behind your ear, meaning you need to reach between your ear and skull to adjust the volume or turn on/off.  If the co tools could be moved to the back of the rectangular block they are mounted to would be helpful.<br/>3.  The amount the volume changes each time you press the volume button.  Mine changes 10% with each press.  5% change would be better.<br/>4.  You can't adjust the volume unless there is sound coming through the headphones.  That is, if you are using the headphones to listen to the GPS on your phone, you can't change the volume between directions:  very annoying.<br/><br/>In all these are really good headphones, just don't expect them to do something or be something they are not.</span>

<span>I wear hearing aids and when I play music through them I lose all mids aand bass. I thought I'd give this a try. The first time I put them on tears came to my eyes. I heard songs that I wrote and recorded in a way I only imagined, I had no idea they came out so good. The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is the bass still has room for improvement, they are too tight and become uncomfortable after a little while and finally you cannot lay your head back and rest. I would love to be able to lounge by the pool or at the beach and enjoy my music. Would I buy again? I would consider the higher line, buy yes, I would.</span>

<span>After buying a couple of "earbud" products that would regularly and irritatingly fall out of my ears, I happened on my new Shokz Bone Conduction headphones and eliminated that problem.  Note: hang them over your ears, not under if you would like them to work as intended.  (Yes, it's possible to do that if you have a low IQ like me).  They don't actually go inside your ear, rather along side and they work awesome!  I use them more to listen to podcasts vs music while I take my dog on three mile hikes, but when I do switch to music I am more than satisfied.  If you are an audio or stereophile you might notice a difference musically compared to high end buds, but if you are an average Joe and proud of it, you are going to like these just fine in the "tunes" department.  Of course, there is no outside noise reduction with these.  Come on, they sit outside your ear canal man, but that doesn't keep you from easily hearing whatever you are listening too.  It will however keep you from getting run over by a car or from hearing a wild animal or crazy person charging you from behind.  That seems like a win in the noise reduction debate.  Anyway, after wanting to stomp my earbuds into the ground with them falling out of my ears so often I find myself really jacked about this style head phone and you just might too.</span>

<span>Through what is likely the entropic process of my toddler and the "fings" she finds and moves around the house, I woke up one day and could not find my JBL LIVE 300 earbuds. Perhaps they will turn up one day and I can do a direct comparison, but frankly I never liked the way they fit, the touch controls or the whole "true wireless" thing. Ultimately my worst nightmare about them became a reality.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the Sonys. I wanted to go back to a set of neckbands with ANC, and these were recommended in a lot of places. Buy once cry once correct? Upon inital listen, I'm a bit disappointed. The sound is just a bit hollow. Sibilant sounds are scratchy and "slushy". There's no bass. Did I make a $200 mistake?<br/><br/>I keep listening and playing with the EQ. The highs get a good bit clearer and tighter, but the bass on some songs is overbearing. What is going on? I listen for a few more hours and things keep getting better. I eventually set the EQ to flat. I run through some reference tracks that I know well and realize....<br/><br/>These are actually really good! Maybe TOO good. Why do I say that? The variation in sound quality of recordings becomes way more apparent. Donald Fagen's vocals &amp; Bernard Purdie's hi hats cut through the warm flanged out Rhodes on Babylon sisters. Every time he sings the opening line my eyes widen. It sounds amazing. I can hear all of Keith Jarrets key strikes and primal grunts more clearly. The chatter at the beginning of The 1975's If I Believe You upgrades from background noise to more conversation. The S.O.L.A.R. process really shows the clarity and balance of The Whispers' Love Is Where You Find It album. But all the tracks on Roy Ayers' Virgin Ubiquity II sound like they have been run through a low pass filter. And the bass on Ahmad Jamal's The Awakening is even more overbearing. So these headphones kind of exaggerate the quality of a mix compared to other headphones I've used.<br/><br/>Overall though, I'm very optimistic about these and recommend them without hesitation, at least for the kind of music I tend to listen to. I'm still playing with fit- they go deep, which is good for sound quality but maybe not for extended listening session comfort. The neckband itself is not super heavy or noticeable to me. The simple button controls are great and more of what I'm used to. Startup + connection was super easy. Etc. etc. After about 48 hours no complaints. The real test will be how they hold up- I switched to the JBLs because all my neck bands seem to lose a channel after about 2 years. Would definitely like to get more use out of these. But the more I listen the more I like them which is all you can really ask for.</span>

<span>Comes in a simple box, contains everything that is needed. To connect is super simple. Turn on the headset, turn on the Bluetooth on the (android) phone. A box appears: "Hey, do you want to connect to sony xm...?" "Yes!" "There is a software to it, do you want to install?" Yes!" That's it. The companion app updated the firmware in 5 minutes. Great! I loved it!<br/>The audio, however, was not that convincing. I didn't love that. I tried with multiple phones (android and iPhone) but it was disappointing. The treble is overemphasized, the bass is weak. I tried the equalizer and the "excited" setting was nice, but still not what I was looking for. I turned it off and started to compare with other (much cheaper) headsets. Almost everything was better. For $300 this was very disappointing. I also compared with wired headsets, since this one also supports wired connection.<br/>As this was my final resort I cannot advise what to buy instead. The Bose quietcomfort 30 is discounted, Samsung U pro us discounted. The Jabra's and Plantronics' is not for listening music, but very good for office use. I read in other reviews that there is no such headset that excels in office use AND music listening. I start to believe this is true.</span>

<span>They sound good unless you want to turn up the volume.  They do not go high enough.  My main issue is that if they are connected and noise canceling is on the battery drains.  If they are powered on the noise canceling drains the battery weather you are using them or not.  You need to remember to turn of anc or else you will have a dead battery when you want to use them next time.  I would not buy these again</span>

<span>Im going to begin by saying I like to write reviews that will definitely help people out with their decisions. With that being said let me make this one short and sweet for everyone.<br/><br/>In general, if you want a great alternative to the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, then this is your best bet. They are comfortable, but i found them to be a bit ear irritating around hour number 6-7. They stay in the ear very well once you get the correct eartip. It does have two different styles, and to help you all out, the hybrid silicone eartips allow a more deeper insertion into the ear as the eartips are a bit longer, providing a better noise isolation when you have the ANC and Ambient Sound modes off. The foam ones that also come with this pair, theyre rather shorter and do conform to your ear a little bit better but they do not provide as good of sound isolation as the silicone tips but provide some better comfort.<br/><br/>The sound that these produce right out of the box, its not too bad, but with the app, you can make them sound even better. These can get super bass heavy, and the app provides a fully adjustable EQ with presets and whats called "Clear Bass", which adds quite some thump to any music. Take your time to tune the EQ and the Clear Bass, as some tracks I listened to had way too much bass, and others had too little. It takes some time but its well worth it in the end. Sony definitely put some work into the speakers and design and I say they did great.<br/><br/>The ANC, and Ambient Sound Modes... well the ANC is off the charts. I did not find it over powering, but at times it made me feel like I was in a vacuum chamber so to speak. It worked very well there is no doubt, but sometimes I felt like it may be too harsh for others. The Ambien Sound mode, is a great a feature that earbuds are coming out with. I love the idea of it, but on these, Sony missed something. Whenever I had the Ambient Sound mode on, it sounded like I was listening to the world with solo cups over my ears or even my hands. It had this weird hissing sound that made everything sound odd.. its hard to explain without saying put your hands over your ears and listen to everything around you. I mainly kept these earbuds in Off mode because they did such a good job isolating sound passively, without needing ANC, but remember the eartips will make that difference.<br/><br/>Battery life was on par with Sonys specs. I had them on for about 10-11 hours one day during work, and they did not even come close to having a low battery. I tested this with a mix of talking, music, watching videos, with all sound modes throughout the day.<br/><br/>Comfort.... well the eartips get them right and they are comfortable as I mentioned earlier but again, around hour 6-7 they started to hurt my ears and i had to take them out for a break. The neck band... ehh.. if you can stand having it around your neck all day long, or even at the gym, or whatever you may do, I would not hesitate to recommend these. But for me, the neckband got to me after a few days of wearing them. It wasnt that it was bothersome, its just when you do need to charge them, you have no case, so you have to physically set them down near a charging outlet, or put them back in the case, zip it up and leave the charging card attached and hanging out the case. It wasnt a huge deal for me, but not having a charging case, that will get to some of you who are like me, and keep them on hand everyday, as mine are always in my lunch box. The other thing that may get you is that the length of wires from the neckband to the earbuds its enough length, but it may cause them to snagged on things and yanked out of your ears.<br/><br/>The controls, they are friendly for the user, but I found myself having to double check which button I need to press due to they are super close to each other. Sometimes when I wanted to skip a song, Id hit the pause button. You cant see the controls by looking down so its always gonna be a constant feel for the right button.<br/><br/>Last but not least, call quality. The biggest downfall with these or at least in my case, i never heard my ringer go off in my earbuds, so I never knew if someone was calling me until I looked at my phone, and I unfortunately missed a few calls in the days I was using these earbuds. the sound quality was very good, very clean, crisp and clear. Everyone could hear me very well, as the microphones are inline from the earbuds to the neckband. No one had any issues being able to hear me in quiet or loud environments.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like the neckband style, and you want good sound/call quality, good comfort and good battery life these are for you.. But if youre someone like me, who would rather have completely wireless earbuds and a charging case to charge the earbuds on the go, but still have the same level of sound/call quality, comfort and battery life, I would recommend the Sony WF-1000XM4 over these for sure.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>My number one reason for loving these headphones is the fact that they are the first pair that has ever come close to fitting and staying in my ears while running. They come with 4 or 5 different bud sizes, and I use the smallest ones.  Unfortunately, the piece that goes around the ear is still slightly too big, so when I really work up a sweat running, the left one tends to fall off. I think most people won't have this problem and they are otherwise very comfortable and secure. The material is a little tacky (in a good way), but not sticky. It doesn't bother me at all when I'm exercising.<br/><br/>My number two reason for loving them is how easy it is to connect, disconnect and control media. It automatically picks up my phone and laptop beautifully. When I am in range of both devices, it tells me my "headset is connected" twice, so I know both have been picked up. I can listen to content seamlessly between phone and laptop. Battery life is great.<br/><br/>I don't use them for noise cancelling, so I don't really notice if they are doing that; however, I can always easily hear what I'm listening to...which makes me think the noise cancellation must be decent.<br/><br/>If I were to make any improvements, it would be 1. Offer a smaller size for the wrap-around ear piece; 2. Have some sort of indicator of whether the headphones are on or off...sometimes I forget if I've turned them off or not.<br/><br/>That's about it! I got on here specifically to write a review because I'm so happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>For no reason in particular, it took me a while to make the switch from wired earbuds to wireless. While I've had a couple of Bluetooth mics over the years, they were all the single-ear models with mini boom mics that only worked for phone calls and made you look like a stock broker or Hollywood agent about to throw a fit at the Starbucks barista. Respect your food service workers, they put up with a lot. In any case, I figured I might as well try headphones that I wouldn't fall asleep on/get snagged on a door handle and mess up my phone's headphone port/strangle me.<br/><br/>Not knowing what exactly I should expect with wireless headphones, I figured that for the time being, I should get something relatively cheap so I could get an idea of what I did and didn't want from a headset. Plus, I travel and run outdoors a lot, so the potential for losing something that was normally physically tethered to me and my device was high. I've paid good money for headphones before (I have a couple of very coddled Sennheisers for when I really want to try and feel impressive to strangers), so I was all for paying less than $20 for what was essentially a test drive set that I'd wear to death (see my history with headphones above).<br/><br/>PACKAGING:<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about the box. It arrived unharmed. Production value was fine enough. The logo and packaging wasn't that far removed from the Beats by Dre sets. As someone who saw a lot of knockoff Beats in bazaars in Afghanistan, it struck me as funny but not a red flag. Those ones weren't half bad either (or so some buddies claimed, during their mid-deployment career transition to retail wholesaler). Good enough branding to catch a well-meaning grandma shopping for her grandkids off guard. You'll end up with these and some Transmorpher DVDs.<br/><br/>The carrying case was nice, kind of a faux carbon fiber external and a soft fuzzy interior. Pliable enough to where you couldn't use it as a bludgeon, but firm enough to where you'd notice if you started to sit on it. Just don't sit all the way on it - it isn't really carbon fiber. It fit the headphones, and a 3-inch charging cable that I never really used because only Luddites don't have at least one micro USB cable magically appear in your junk drawer.<br/><br/>After the headphones, tiny cable, and case, the only other item was the instructions. They were not written by someone who speaks English as their first language. Probably not second, either. Whatever. Google Translate did the best it could.<br/><br/>SET UP:<br/><br/>Translation problems aside, the quick start guide was simple enough that you'd get the gist. Actually pairing them to my Galaxy S9 was also simple, although I had to do it three or four times until the two devices actually got to know each other. I'm an introvert, so I didn't hold it against them. Once paired, reconnecting was easier, but still not instant. I'd say the rate of automatically pairing on the first try was about 90%. I'd have to turn on the headset and set my phone to scan at pretty much the same instant, but that was easy enough to learn (I don't set my phone's Bluetooth to "always-on," so perhaps I'd do better if I had). Exact same experience pairing the set to my Alienware home computer and Apple iPad mini (4th gen, I think - it was a gift that was new in 2018). So, it pairs easily across Windows, Android, and iOS hardware as if they were the same.<br/><br/>CONNECTIVITY AND EASE OF USE:<br/><br/>The button layout is pretty standard if you've ever had headphones with phone control functions. There's a single multipurpose button on the right bud that handles power, playing/pausing, and answering/hanging up calls. Above that is a volume rocker that handles previous/next track with a long press. Each button has a satisfying, tactile click to it that leaves little to the imagination. Response is immediate, you know when you've pressed the right buttons. Sensual and effective. Good times.<br/><br/>The range is better than I anticipated for what I paid. I live in a 600 square foot/65 square meter apartment, and I've neglected to realize that I set my phone down on the table by my front door while listening to music in my bedroom down the hall and on the other side of a wall. It's never broken its pairing with my devices. That being said, I've probably never tested the range beyond 50 feet/15 meters. Beyond that, I'd probably permanently lose one or both devices to the ether. I won't risk it. I'm forgetful sometimes.<br/><br/>It will, however, skip repeatedly at random. This is my biggest problem with this set, and it loses half a star for it. I'd be listening to music with the phone in my left pant pocket and the sound will cut out or "skip" like if you bumped an old CD Walkman. Sometimes, it would last a split second, sometimes it would garble for five or six seconds. Holding my phone directly next to the headset would always improve it, but if I put it back in my pocket, it was 50/50 whether it stayed normalized. After fuzzing out for a minute or so, it would self-right itself and I'd be good for the next few hours until it repeated itself. I could never find a rhyme or reason for why it went when it did, but it seemed to get worse the more I used them for phone calls and not just music. Calls were a mess, and I had to ask a caller to repeat themselves at lease once or twice every conversation. However, as much as I listen to music, phone calls were a very small portion of the headset's workload. Honestly, it was a minor inconvenience, but given that it only has two functions (streaming audio and streaming calls), it's a glaring one.<br/><br/>Another small issue is the low battery warning. A voice tells you that the battery is low, and you'd be lucky to make it more than ten minutes before it shuts down. The battery's good for six hours, and since I'm pretty good at topping off my devices, it was rarely an issue.<br/><br/>AUDIO QUALITY:<br/><br/>As a disclaimer, I'm not an audiophile that can lecture on the specifics of sound quality. I can't debate the merits on one brand over another. I can't afford recording studio-quality. I've tried many headphones over the years, with price points ranging from "no-name-found-only-at-gas-stations" to "well-to-do-but-definitely-not-country-club-member." I do know the difference between bass and treble, and not much else. For reference, I have some Sennheisers that proved my all-time personal gold standards for headphones (an HD 558 for home use and a CX 300B MK II for travel, with a MX 365 for daily use).<br/><br/>These are not Sennheisers. They're probably not even Jbuds.<br/><br/>I'm not saying they're bad. Actually, they're quite good - for the price point. Basses are good (when they're occasionally there), but tend to get drowned out by normal street traffic. Everything else is sharp and vocals are clearly defined but it all feels muted to a degree. If I were to sum it up, it's as if I were listening to a decent headset through a dense pillow. I'm confident the problem isn't my sound settings on my phone. I've never really tried to fiddle with the equalizer, but I've used both my wired Sennheiser earbuds and a JLab J4 wired to much greater effect under standard settings.<br/><br/>Audio quality during phone calls is hit-or-miss, and I suspect a lot of that was because of the "skipping" issue mentioned above in the Connectivity section. Since conversations aren't constant streams of audio like songs are (mine aren't, at least - no judgment on you fast talkers), it's harder to gauge. Voices sounded tinny a lot of the time, but clear. I've been told I sounded fairly clear when I talked through them. I only ever had trouble hearing callers when I was walking down a busy street.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>I still don't know enough about the performance gap between wireless and wired headphones, if there is one at all anymore. It is 2020, after all. That being said, my experience with Otium was far more positive than negative. Despite connectivity issues that led to some occasionally garbled audio during music and calls, the ease of use, good battery life, feather-light weight, and solid construction make this a great choice for someone looking for a simple wireless headset at an entry-level price point.<br/><br/>Sadly, I lost my headset after accidentally leaving it in the back of an Uber. Considering I bought it for $17, owned it for about a year, and it would cost me at least $15 in fees to Uber to retrieve it, I chalked it up to a loss. That being said, if I still had it, I could easily imagine owning it for at least a year after that, something that I'd never consider with a wired headphone at the same price. The performance was totally consistent throughout that year. On the plus side, this gives me an excuse to get more in-depth with the range of wireless headsets out there. I'm using my $20 wired Sennheiser MX 365s for now, but I definitely miss the qualities of being tangle-free. Even if I don't return to Otium, they definitely helped me get my foot in the door. I'll definitely give them a lot of credit for that.</span>

<span>I have purchased a similar pair of Bluetooth headphones from another company that was at the time considered an “Amazon Choice” because of their high ratings and economical price point. I have actively used them for the last few months and was asked by Otium to try their product.<br/><br/>Shipping was fast (I received the headphones in two days), and the next morning opened up my shipment to try the headphones out.<br/><br/>Packaging was simple to get into—no tape or plastic wrap covering the product; only a cardboard sleeve with the box that contained the headphones. Upon opening, everything was neatly packaged, and there was no damage to any of the inner contents.<br/><br/>The zipper case containing the headphones displayed the Otium company logo on the outside of it, was black in color and had a carabiner attached to it so you could carry it on a backpack, purse, belt loop, or anything that you could think of to connect it to. Inside the case was the headphones, and two additional sizes of earpieces and a plastic cinch to keep the wire between the right and left side of the headphones from flopping around. Also, in the box was a USB cable to charge the headphones, a warranty card that gives the customer an additional 6-month free warranty for buying the product and an instruction manual explaining the use of the headphones, including troubleshooting, and also what is allowed and not allowed with the waterproof feature of the headphones, which I will get to later in this review.<br/><br/>The first thing the instructions suggest is to charge the product entirely, which takes 1-2 hours to charge. When I plugged the USB into my laptop, it only took a little less than an hour to charge the headphones fully. The one thing I noticed immediately about the headphones that the ones I had purchased a few months earlier were that the part that wraps around the ear to keep them in place was stiffer than my previous ones. I liked that because the other headphones had a very flimsy ear wrap.<br/><br/>Connecting them to my iPhone X was simple and easy. You hold the power button down for a total of eight seconds to pair to your phone. Then, you go to your Bluetooth settings, and either the name “Otium” will appear (depending on your phone), or you will need to type in a password for it, which is “0000”. After pairing your headphones to your phone, you are ready to go. You also have the option for “multi-pairing” to two devices, which I thought was a cool feature!<br/><br/>As far as the buttons, the power button (located on the right side) turns on/off the headphones, pairs the headphones to up to two devices and answers/ends/rejects phone calls/redials the last number called. You can also transfer/pause/play audio with the power button. The volume controls allow you to mute the microphone/turn up and down the volume and move forward/reverse audio tracks that you are listening to.<br/>You can talk up to 8 hours, which I will admit I have never tried, and they state that the standby time is close to 220 hours, which is all dependent on usage.<br/><br/>The headphones sound great! The voices come in clear, and there is a decent amount of bass, which I tend to like. The earphones stay in my ear, which is another feature I appreciate, considering that the Apple earbuds and other headsets I have tried in the past have not fit well in my ears (I must have a larger left ear canal, because that is the side that all of my earphones would fall out of!). The wire connecting the earphones stays out of my way, and I usually don’t use the cinch, because I am a bigger person in size, and do not like having something constricting in the back of my head. The ear wrap is comfortable around my ears, the only downfall is that they are not adjustable for different ear sizes, but they are flexible to fit around different ear sizes of most people. The earbuds allow a for some noise isolation – another great feature! The volume sounds pretty good at different levels; it becomes just a little distorted at higher volumes. I’ve seen a few negative reviews that have mentioned that they have difficulty pairing to their phone after a period using the Bluetooth headphones, but I have not used them long enough to experience that problem. The box does give information on how to contact them if there are any technical problems, so if anything does happen in the future, I will try to reach out to them and see how they handle customer service issues. Finally, the price point is perfect! With other higher-end headphones on the market, for an economical pair of headphones, these are great!<br/><br/>The only negatives are first, the volume buttons. I’m used to holding down on the button on older earbuds due to my age (LOL!), and I keep forgetting that it will skip to the next song or go back to the previous song. However, I’m slowly getting used to repeatedly clicking to turn up/down the volume, so it is something that is a minor complaint that I can quickly get over. Secondly, I was listening to Amazon Prime Music on my iPhone through these headphones and paused the music to hear what my wife was saying at the time. When I went to play the music as instructed in the manual, it would not restart the music. I had to open the app and manually press the play button to continue listening to music. That was frustrating. If I was driving down the road while listening to music, it is inconvenient to go to look down at my phone and keep driving down the road and risk having an accident happen. I did try listening to a podcast and tried pausing and playing using the same process, and it worked, so it is a software issue, which I hope Amazon would fix in the future.<br/><br/>Now, I told you that I would mention what you can get away with when it comes to water. The instruction manual states that you can get away with splashes, rain, snow, incidental exposure to water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes, and believe it or not, showering! Seriously! Who showers with headphones on?! I am nervous to try that, but it would be interesting to see if it would actually withstand a shower!<br/><br/>Situations it cannot withstand when it comes to water is swimming or any type of watersports, which makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>I would honestly recommend these headphones for the ease of use, quality and price point! I gave my wife the headphones I previously purchased and have used these full-time! These are great headphones! Buy yours today!</span>

<span>I’ll start off by saying that I traditionally haven’t been able to wear earbuds since my ears are apparently shaped strange and earbuds are constantly falling out of my ears.  For that reason, for many years I have avoided any kind of earbuds.  But, in the past I have been able to wear buds as long as they have the loop that goes over them.  The quality of buds in the past was always kind of wonky and I have stayed away from them.  These buds have the loop and a pretty good warranty, so I thought I would give it a try.<br/>Right off the bat, I’ll admit that I am not an audiophile.  When I listen to a decent set of headphones or speakers…they always sound good to me.  I’ve been using these for the bus to get to work, at the gym, and in the car for speaking on the phone.  I personally think they sound really good and when you consider all of the background noise you get from the bus, gym, and car, I really don’t know how you could tell the difference between headsets anyway.  But, in the sound department I am more than satisfied with them.<br/>For speaking on my cell phone, I have found them to be fantastic.  Everyone says they can hear me really well (so, apparently the mic on them is pretty darned good).  They fit in my ears well and the loop provides additional support.  The loop appears to be made out of plastic and even though it does a fairly good job of keeping the buds snug to my ears, I would think that if it was a moldable wire that was encompassed by plastic, it would work even better.  There have been numerous times when it feels like the buds are loose in my ears and I have to keep pushing them back in.  They are quite comfortable; after wearing them for a few minutes, I honestly forget they’re even on.  When I'm driving, I keep them on my head and I never miss any texts or phone calls now (for some odd reason, I used to never hear my phone ringing).  They say that you can wear them in the shower (although, I wouldn’t do that), but I did wear them last night for about 2 hours in a heavy drizzle and they worked fabulously.  I just kept my phone in the truck and was able to listen to music and talk on the phone without any problems.  I also like how they have a wire between them; when I need to temporarily remove them, I simply drape them over my neck.<br/>They hold a long charge, but I do recommend charging them every day.  I skipped a day charging them and nearly ran out of battery at the end of the second day.  To charge them, you simply use a regular black charging cable (nothing proprietary) that comes with the unit and they charge quite quickly (in about an hour).<br/>I was able to get them to sync to my iPhone, my iPad, Alexa, and a Bluetooth transmitter without much difficulty.  I did find that they do have difficulty switching between my iPhone and iPad (I usually have to disable the Bluetooth on one device to get it to connect to the other).  But, I’ve always had struggles with Bluetooth, so I really don’t know what the issue was there.<br/>The volume up and volume down buttons are easy to locate when they’re on my head, and skipping songs is quite easy as well.<br/>To turn them on and off, you need to press in the button on the right earbud.  It seems that pressing the button always want to push the bud into my ear canal a bit and I had to learn how to hold the unit steady while depressing the button.<br/>I have taken them to the gym a few times and they have fared well.  If you are still wearing wired headphones at the gym, you really need to make a move to the world of Bluetooth.  Trust me when I say you will never go back to a wired connection (no more accidentally knocking your phone to ground when you’re on the treadmill).<br/>All in all, I have to say that I am quite impressed with them.  I used to wear a $150 set of JBL Everest headphones all the time, but now I find myself reaching for these since they are far more convenient to lug around.  For the price, these are an outstanding value.</span>

<span>The good:<br/>The sound is good. The level of noise cancellation is good. I like the simplicity of the controls and the charge lasts a long time. I have used these earbuds all day and still have charge left.<br/>They are a little easy to lose. I have pulled them off several times by taking off a sweater or body pack. I guess that’s just a problem that comes with this style of earbuds, though.<br/>The bad:<br/>The real problem I have with them is that they hurt my ears.

<span>Sound good and do the job for playing music and making calls wo the phone in hand all the time.  Purchased to try help focus while working from home and not be distracted as easily along with being a big time Sony product owner (think back to the walkman no not the CD one but the cassest sports one) for both home audio and video among other things as they still work and provided great picture quality for the CRT's way back then.  Wasn't expecting much as they are sort of wireless and for the price under $30 at the time, but was pleasantly surprised and knew I lose headsets rather often so getting the Plantronics's for my desk could wait to see if I even ended up using these.  The only thing to be aware of (they don't make the claim and for the price and Brand loyalty I went w/o the ANC and charging case that the ear buds usually come with).  Do they block out sounds like people above me and other distractions?  Are they still working and am I using them still?  Do I wish I would have gotten the higher model, not so much since I've used a smartish phone since windows mobile (pocket PC 2003 when Motorola dropped one around 2006 along with their bluetooth headphones which were around 200 bucks then and mini USB was the standard and only came in black/red while it didn't go with my suit, I could go to the gym and use the mini SD card and play the bland mp3's while still doing rip and replace for 2nd largest Cisco contract leading teams and taking calls in MDF's to swap fiber links (old motorola not the China lenovo owned company) and was the only headset left standing of the 13 lost or wires ruined and actually one other of theirs that the clip for the ear piece broke, but couldn't find a replace for that size at the time and forgot about it till now.  These will do the job and with the around the neck cords I they make it easier to find when I forget I set them down somewhere vs. looking for just an ear bud which with physics I'm not sure that a driver that small can produce the sound they want for the amount I use these or my smart phone today anyway.<br/><br/>I gave them a 4 since 4.5 isn't an option and I'm use to audiophile purchases and hearing the color of sound, but realize how the supply chain works today and manufacturing that for the purpose they would do the trick and if I feel I need headphone's to play records or a physical media medium vs. UDP (best effort) streaming where packets are going missing with wireless to bluetooth and all the network hops before it, well then I'll just hook the turn tables up and order whatever vinyl or get a dedicated device for it, but chances are I'll stick to the home theater setup and speakers I had to drive to pick up where voice coils and speakers were still handmade for under 50k each.  Since I don't know if the ANC really works better as I haven't found a reason to upgrade and compare and the only issue I have with these is that on calls I sometime forget that the wire has the mic on it and or service might be a bit light down here that I'll have to turn them off and then your normal bluetooth pairing to the proper device and crowded unlicensed spectrum interference that I can't really blame Sony for what I've consulted clients on for a decade+ about with wireless speakers and other products when they say they want a setup that sounds better then mine until they'd have to actually spend the $ and not know what for as they don't appreciate the audio as I once did, but rarely find the time or content these days to be concerned with it along with the fact that networks drop packets and streaming via UDP not TCP is designed to handle dropped packets mixed with the fact that I realized the picture looks fake to me on certain displays at times, but that is because it is, since most is designed with digital tools and is just me being the old fart that one would argue on message boards that digital w/o the static in a lossless format is the best medium where the old timers would say vinyl and not let it go, but until I understood what the color of sound really was when listening to vinyl I had to search the globe for much of it and risk buying a used piece to get the 90's grunge or numetal I think it is referred to as today in a world of mostly rap and poorly mastered dubstep at one point where a mixtape CD ruined the competition car audio as the track was so distorted that lovely smell came, but the kill switch saved 1 sub which only from SPL and the smell that comes with fried electronics did I know to kill it, but had to be sure later and it was and fried the rest =/  Battery life on these seems more then suitable for the day, keep your ears clean and remember that others are around you and moving objects for some of you and these do the job just fine, sleeping in them might not always be the most comfortable, but I usually wake up drool down my face and someone yelling as I have my face smashed in the pillow when I sleep well, even though I'm not sure how I breath and sleep that way, plus w/o the cord I'm not sure I'd be able to those small ear buds out if I used it and had to grab it with scratching it with something if pushed to far in, for those of you heavy sleepers once you are asleep.  If they break I'll update this otherwise 4.5 and maybe wait for a CC promo or other discount as I see a lot close to the price point now that might be white label and have newer features or even the buds for about 20 more at time from the big tech names and most are fan boys anyway so you might just want those otherwise.</span>

<span>Sony WI-XB400 Wireless in-Ear headphones are great for my needs.

<span>I've recently found myself using neckband earbuds more often, and I picked myself up a pair of Sony WI-C200 earbuds. They were great, but they didn't have the punch I was looking for in my "on-the-go" earbuds. Because of this, I picked up a pair of these earbuds, the Sony WI-XB400.<br/><br/>They fit great in my strangely shaped ears, they fit around my abnormally huge neck well enough to suffice, and their sound is EXACTLY what I was looking for.<br/><br/>Sony's EXTRA BASS lineup of audio has always carried a reputation of "punchy bass without sacrificing other aspects of sound quality" for me. I've always been able to get aggressive bass from Sony's EXTRA BASS lineup of headphones, but never have seen a sacrifice in mids or highs as a result.<br/><br/>These earbuds are no different. Their soundstage is clear, well-balanced, and crisp, with some seriously spicy lows that I love.<br/><br/>For an on-the-go earbud, I would recommend these to anybody. They sound fantastic, they fit great, their battery life could be better but it's definitely acceptable, they're comfortable, and they seem to be built very rugged. Sony has a fan in me for these earbuds! I will use these until they crap out for sure, then probably buy another set.<br/><br/>(P.S. Forgive my ugly mug in the photos 😂)</span>

<span>Before I dive into my thoughts on the product, here's a bit of insight into my personal needs and usage to set the stage. There were a few requirements that the next pair of wireless headphones I bought needed to fulfill:<br/><br/>- Bluetooth<br/>- Lightweight<br/>- Good sound with noticeable bass<br/>- Decent microphone for phone calls<br/>- Needs the ability to stay in my ear<br/>- Durable<br/>- Good battery life<br/>- No over-the-head band<br/><br/>With these requirements, my options became somewhat limited. Every pair I looked at the reviews for there was always something wrong that turned me off. From durability issues to ear bud problems to just poor sound. This pair is no exception, the reviews are mixed (at leas there on Amazon). I'm coming from LG Tone Pros that worked well but suffered from poor bass and the inability to stay in my ears when doing anything with movement (even eating a bowl of cereal while listening to something on those caused the buds to fall out). I had high standards that needed to be met.<br/><br/>I purchased the Bose SoundSport Wireless over other products like Beats3 and such, but not for reasons people think. I purchased it on a gamble from the recommendation of my wife who has used several Bose products in the past and generally has been content. The packaging for the headphones was about what you would expect. Good box setup with ease of access to everything you need. It comes with a charging cable, 3 sets of buds (one set already on the headphones, with 2 sets in a plastic bag), the buds themselves, among other lesser important items.<br/><br/>When trying the pair on for the first time, I noticed that the mid-size buds were not the right size. I swapped out for the larger buds and found it fit well. I proceeded to shake my head and run around to try and shake the buds loose. I'm glad to say they didn't budge. The wing tips for the buds work great, however the real test will come when hitting the gym or workout session. Unfortunately, I've yet to try it in a workout session.<br/><br/>So far I've used these buds while at work and home for daily, leisure use. The longest period of time I've had these on was approximately 6 hours while sitting at work. The battery varies slightly between 7 to 9 hours for me, but that also includes breaks and periods of time where I turn off my headphones while working. I started experiencing some discomfort at about the 4 hour mark where I had to pull out the buds for a few minutes before placing them back into my ear.<br/><br/>As far as sound goes, I was impressed. Clear, crisp overall sound with good amount of bass. Unlike the Tone Pros where the bass was almost non-existent, I can hear the bass loudly and clearly that makes listening to some of my rock songs feel like an experience in comparison. I also used these buds to watch movies, tv shows and random youtube videos and it definitely sounds better. I'm no audiophile, but I've tested and used my share of headphones and the sound is high quality with the Bose SoundSports.<br/><br/>Another minor issue with the buds is the clip that's attached to the wire part. It is there to keep your buds attached to your shirt so they don't fall from your neck when not using the buds and to keep the wire from moving too much while using the pair. This clip, while does its job well, isn't attached very well to the wire. It's easy to pull off and in my case, has fallen off without me noticing. My wife found it once in the bed after I used it for an hour while laying down watching a tv show. The clip isn't necessary too much, however does provide some comfort so you don't have to keep readjusting the wire around your neck.<br/><br/>Just a little insert here, the mic quality is fine. I've gotten no complaints from family and friends that I've talked to about issues hearing me or disconnections. Not much to say as I've had very limited time with phone calling in the 2 weeks I've own this. I will update this part in the future if I run into any problems.<br/><br/>Just a last bit here, the connectivity to my phone and other electronic devices is easy. When I power on the device, a voice comes over stating how much power is remaining in percentages, then proceeds to say which devices (by name) it is trying to connect to. For example, my pair says its trying to connect to FRISINA-PC and will say each letter out since it doesn't know how to pronounce the name. I'm able to have the buds connected to multiple devices at once (at one point it was connected to my phone and laptop at the same time) and will attempt to connect to any previously connected devices after powering on. When connecting to the device for the first time, it was as simple as turning on the power, listening for "ready to connect" voice and then finding the buds on the device I'm trying to connect. There's nothing else to it.<br/><br/>Overall, the Bose SoundSport Earbuds fit what I was looking for in my requirements and it is my go to headphones now when I'm not at my computer (I use a SteelSeries Arctis 7 for gaming and general use while on my desktop). I highly recommend this pair if you're like and have trouble finding something to fit your ears. As simple as the "technology" is, the wing tips change everything. A solid 4 star buds, the minor discomfort, clip issues, and unsure battery life keep a star off for now. I will be updating down the line if I have more to add.</span>

<span>In spite of Bose's reputation, I was a bit skeptical of these headphones, not for any particular reason, but perhaps only because a link over Bluetooth did not inspire confidence in me concerning final sound quality. Looking at the photos of the headphones, too, made me somewhat concerned that these would be a bit uncomfortable in my ear, due to their design and my sensitive ears.<br/><br/>Well, I was proven wrong on both counts the minute I tried out these headphones. Without a doubt, these are the best earbud-style headphones I have ever heard. From the moment I started testing them, I was extremely impressed with their clarity, dynamic range, "presence," and, yes, even comfort. Most earbuds I have used over the years require a few days of use before they start to "break in" (and, yes, I know there is controversy about this issue, but I have experienced it myself on multiple brands of headphones at all price levels), but these sounded wonderful right from the first moment of play.<br/><br/>If it is helpful, let me be clear and say that I am pairing these with an iPhone X and using high-resolution (24-bit, 192kHz) files, and so some individuals might attribute my reaction to those factors. And there is, of course, a sonic improvement with high-resolution files, and the iPhone X certainly has a good onboard sound system. But after those initial trials, I "downgraded" to lossless rips of CD's (16-bit, 44kHz), and then, finally, moved down to mp3 files (128 bps). Although I could certainly hear the sound quality reduce as I went "down the chain," the earphones themselves continued to sound wonderful, bringing new life to even those relatively low-quality mp3 files.<br/><br/>All of this led me to conclude that these headphones sound so good, and are so comfortable to wear, that they are very likely best-in-class. Sure, you can spend over $1,000 on a set of earbuds, but I wonder if there might be a great diminishing of returns, where the tiniest incremental increase in sound quality carries with it a hefty, NON-incremental price hike. The sound from these Bose headphones is rich, easily covers the range from the lowest bass to the highest highs, has an exceptional presence, adds no noticeable noise from the Bluetooth connection, and presents a natural sonic quality that truly makes the headphones "disappear," leaving only the sound. I must say again, I was deeply impressed, so much so that I will now plan to use these with many of my audio players, not just my phone.<br/><br/>Some of the information that is easily available in the product section I will briefly mention here, as well. The length of the cord, which goes around the back of the neck, is just about the right length so that when you take the phones out of your ears, the earpieces hang in front of your chest, but don't go so far down that they become a nuisance. A nicely-placed small clip attaches to the back of your collar to further secure the headphones (and is easy to attach, remove, even when reaching behind you because it is shaped for a "rear-handed" grip) A very intuitive and easily-accessible volume and microphone control are on the right side of the cord in a single housing (see the photos), and a single button for on/off, paring, and charging indication are almost invisible on the one ear housing, but still easily accessible without having to look. Charging is accomplished but pulling a discreet rubber panel open on the earphone body and plugging in a micro USB cable (supplied, but perhaps too short for a lot of situations: you might want to use a different cable). Battery length is rated at about eight hours, although I have not yet been able to absolutely verify this value as of yet, it appears to be accurate.<br/><br/>The photos of the earbuds which led me to wonder if they would be uncomfortable in my ear (the skin of my ears, including my ears themselves, are sensitive, making many earphones uncomfortable for me to wear). Bose here has done a magnificent job of developing a form fit that is both comfortable AND secure. The curved plastic you see in the photos by the earbuds is actually not plastic at all, but a very flexible and gentle silicone. You simply put the earbud near your ear, press in and twist a little back and forth, and the curved silicone piece pops into the outer ear with just enough "grip" (for lack of better word) to very securely hold the earbud in place, yet are almost unnoticeable. In fact, since this curved silicone piece bears some of the body's weight, it turns out, unbelievably, that these are actually more comfortable than most all of my traditional earbuds which have nothing but the ear canal components (and which I have used for years because on-the-ear headphones hurt my ears in just a matter of minutes).<br/><br/>All I can say is that, after testing these out, I thought to myself that there is a reason that Bose has built a reputation as it has. I do not have any other Bose equipment (I did have some of their speakers back in the 1980's), so I cannot speak at all to their other devices, either good or bad. They certainly have maintained an excellent reputation over these years. What I CAN say that these headphones have easily won me over, and I am truly impressed with their ability to put our truly good sound. Seeming a bit expensive when I ordered them, I now view them as a "bargain" of sorts, due to their sound reproduction. Truly an EASY Five Stars, and well worth your consideration, fully understanding that headphones are a very personal choice. But I recommend you try them out if you have not already, because they truly are amazing, particularly at this price point.<br/><br/>NOTE;<br/>These headphones come with the Stay Hear+ tips, not the standard Stay Hear tips. You will currently (mid 2018) not find replacement buds on Amazon. However, you can purchase replacements directly from Bose at a very reasonable $10 for two pairs of replacement buds, with free expedited shipping. Make sure you get the "+" version when ordering replacement buds!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>These were mainly intended to be just for phone conversations, I rarely listen to music with them. The times that I do use them for music, the sound is less than ideal and leaves a lot to be desired. When it comes to phone conversations, the person I'm speaking with is sometimes hard to hear and they often state they can hear everything I'm doing in the background. If you're looking for a headset for just the basic purpose of conversations or if you don't really want good quality sound for music, give these a try, but I can't recommend them for anything more than just to get by. There are far better options out there. I would return them if I could.</span>

<span>I absolutely love these headphones aside from the distance in which they will continue working with my phone.  I had an older version that I was crazy about, but unfortunately lost.  After, I tried about 5 different types and just didn't like the button setup on the others or the length of the cord.  I bit the bullet on cost and bought these again and love them.  The battery life is not nearly as great as others out there, but it lasts me the whole work day so that's fine. The reach drives me crazy though.  If I'm about 10 feet away from my phone it'll start breaking up the connection.  Sometimes it happens at even shorter distances!</span>

<span>Ok, I'm no audiophile but for me, the sound quality is perfectly adequate for watching YouTube videos (including musical... look up Reina del Cid),  and watching movies without bothering others. If you *are* an audiophile, you probably wont be happy with these... get some over-the-ear phones with ANC. Phone quality is also very good both ways.<br/>Connects quickly and easily to my phone. Battery life so far seems very good. Build quality is solid, buttons are quality. I had a different brand previous, had to hold the button a full 10sec to turn it off, this one says 3sec but I count to 5 (maybe I'm a fast counter) but still, turning on and off is a quick procedure.<br/>Things I think could be better:<br/>1. Only comes with 2 eartips- small and smaller. I took the eartips off my old set and put them on this one, now sounds and fits perfectly. Dear LG, please consider adding a 3rd set of tips<br/>2. Like most of this type of headset with magnetically attached earbuds, the magnets are somewhat weak and do not hold the buds securely. I think a pair of stronger, maybe rare-earth magnets in the neck piece would be nice.<br/>Overall, a solid item, for $43 well worth the price, would buy again.</span>

<span>Sound quality is decent. But, there are no track skip buttons and the magnets could be stronger. The speakers fall out too easily.</span>
