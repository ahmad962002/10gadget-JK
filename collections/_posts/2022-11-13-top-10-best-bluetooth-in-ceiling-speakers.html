<span>These have to be the best ceiling speakers for the money on Amazon. Easy to install. I recommend plugging them to a switch Plug in your attic. For me, an electrician, this was very easy. To have an electrician install these shouldn't cost more then a few hundred dollars. Don't get me wrong, there are better sounding speakers. But me and my family have been VERY satisfied with the quality of these. So nice to not have bt speakers cluttering/taking up counter space!</span>

<span>Simple installation, incredibly easy connection, I’m buying more! The sound is great for the money.  I wish there was a sub woofer option to boost the bass, but the sound is still rich - these are perfect for background music. The only issue I had was my own - I had to run power into my attic - I should have thought ahead. Well worth the self-made hassle though!</span>

<span>I wanted speakers in my big garage/workshop to play music on from my phone.  These fit the bill nicely.  As others have mentioned, reinstalling the metal grille once you  install the speaker is a fool's errand.  I tried multiple ways and ended up with two dented speaker grilles.  They don't look terrible, but truly annoying that it was so difficult.<br/>Sound is great.  The are plenty loud enough for me and have enough bass for my taste.  If I crank the phone volume all the way up, it is loud.<br/>Some things that would have made it better for me... Automatically connect when I come in range of the speaker.  As it stands now, I have to manually connect to the speaker every time I go into the garage and want to use it.  Also, potentially add an additional input into the speaker controller, like a 3.5mm jack or something like that.  I'd like to be able to connect my garage TV directly to the speakers as well.  I can do this through a ROKU app, but it relies on wireless signal, and that is not very reliable in my garage.  I've thought of using a bluetooth transmitter from the TV to the speakers, but not sure how I would pair the two (you do this via the phone)?<br/>All in, a very nice speaker with great sound for the price.  You can spend a lot more money on a different solution, but I am very pleased with these and the fit my purpose perfectly.</span>

<span>This is the second pair of Pyle speakers I’ve purchased. They are an easy install and sound great.. The new Bluetooth software doesn’t require a PIN code. Normally this might bother me but these were installed in our guest room so for our guests it will make life easy.</span>

<span>These installed quite easily in sheet rock.  I'm driving them with a Pyle in-wall amplifier for music in my bathroom.  My only disappointment is that the bass response is lacking somewhat.  I don't know if this is a valid complaint; I guess I just expected more.</span>

<span>I'm honestly not one to write reviews but on these I have to!<br/>I just recently installed these speakers,<br/>1 in the master bathroom and 1 in our master bedroom. I daisy chained the speakers as directed and found power in the attic to tie into. I installed the bluetooth device above the ceiling next to one of the speakers and was completely impressed with the coverage, lows, mids and highs these speakers produced!<br/>My 2nd option if I had not found power in the attic would have been trying into one of the recessed lights.<br/>Very impressed by these speakers, hoping they have great durability.<br/>Will buy these again!</span>

This round Virtually Invisible in-ceiling speaker is engineered with one 7" woofer and two strategically positioned 1" tweeters, eliminating the need to aim the speaker into the room. It's engineered with exclusive Bose Stereo Everywhere speaker performance to provide balanced stereo sound over a wider area. Sound fills every inch of the room evenly, so there are no drop-offs. The ultra slim bezel is attached directly to the speaker grille allowing them to be easily painted in one simple step. And with no cloth scrim, there's no worry of excess paint clumping or soaking in. Plus, magnets allow them to snap on and off quickly. And with a near-bezel-less construction, they blend seamlessly into the room's design. Installation is quick and easy with standard dogleg clamps. Two in-wall and two in-ceiling models provide the solutions you need for nearly any installation.

<span>These speakers are ceiling mounted with cheap plastic red tabs that shear off during installation, rendering the speaker useless as the can’t be installed.  I called Bose to get replacement parts and they told me to buy a new pair.  This is what you get for $600?  So disappointed!  I wrote a review on the Bose website and they “moderated” it, i.e. they removed it because it was unfavorable.  Check out the picture and judge for yourself - I cannot believe they didn’t design these parts for replacement.  Buyer beware.</span>

<span>They are a great set a speakers but a bit on the high on the pricing. All the Bose speakers carry a hefty price tag, but I kind of wish i had the 500 series to compare them too. The do a good job of being low profile on the ceiling for their size, but not really sure they are worth the price.</span>

<span>These are great. We put in our store.  They are plugged into the ceiling outlet because wasn't another location. For some reason Amazon music drops all the time and I have to unplug them and turn back on to get the blue tooth connected again.

<span>Just got these today and "finished" installing. I'm renovating my barn workspace so currently they are hung with scrap drywall while I work on the rest of the building.<br/>Overall I would buy these again but the one con I had was the tightening system. Tightening with a screw driver the ears wanted to pop out resulting in not being able to tighten. Using an impact, I was able to resolve this by also holding the ear as I am tightening. Curious how this will go with the finished cieling when I can't reach around the 2x2 drywall square.<br/>Sound quality is decent but nothing spectacular. It is good enough to be satisfied with but there are better speakers out there. However, those speakers will also cost more.<br/><br/>Don't hesitate to buy these.

<span>Awesome light fixture with great speakers. One star off since the installation was akward and difficult because of the bluetooth wiring.

<span>I'm familiar with the Pyle name, so I liked the idea of lighting and sound from one unit, less installation hassle. Wrong. They are a pain to install. Power wires from drivers, way to short and very light gauge wires. I ended up with a junction box in the ceiling for each light. Speaker wires were a little short on two of the speakers. I assumed they would all be the same length, not so. I was running to a wall mounted server cabinet so I had power there for the blue tooth controller, yes it plugs in the wall for a power source. Everything works fine. I have lighting power run to a switch, a Kasa bluetooth wall switch, which connects to any Alexa controlled device, so never actually touch the switch. I haven't had the bluetooth issues that others are experiencing, connection dropping out and re-connecting. Bluetooth works great whether I'm connecting through my phone or desk top computer. Lights are great for my office compared to the fluorescent lights that are in ceiling. I installed near the four corners of a 16 x 20 office. Lights are great for using the desk top, but are a little dim for paperwork. two more lights would be perfect. The sound works good, volume adjusts with ease from phone, desk top. But the bass is very weak, yes I do realize these are only 4" speakers, but would have liked a better bass response, so maybe an 8" version would be better? I'm happy with the over all speaker/lighting combo, but could be much better if sound matched the Pyle reputation better. Good idea and innovation, just not perfectly executed.<br/>  Update: Ordered a second set to try to correct the lighting deficiency from the 4 in a larger office. What a disaster the second purchase was. I received someone else's taped up mistake! Unbelievable that they shipped out this product! Wow!</span>

<span>It's sad that when one browses items and see a well rated product, buys it, only to end up being a way bellow average item.<br/><br/>I bought this having high hopes, reading the reviews left by other. Unfortunately I can not write the review.<br/><br/>Living in South Africa, it was very costly getting it here safely. Nevertheless, it arrived in a good time-frame and in good condition.<br/><br/>Upon setting out the speakers/light to test everything before commencing installation, all went well. Until... around 5 minutes of testing, 2 of the 4 speakers ceased to function, only producing high pith sound, and treble.<br/><br/>I did contact Pyle Customer support. They did inform me that I would be eligible for a replacement product. I therefore asked them who will cover the return shipping, as it will not be cheap, and most definable not worth it. To this date, I have not had a response from them. I therefore can not and will not recommend this product to anyone, nor do I think their after sale service is good.<br/><br/>Whilst the product is neat, it is sub standard quality, but I guess you get what you pay for.<br/><br/>I had to make a plan to get them working as returning them didn't seem to be a viable option. My recommendation will be, Co-axle 2 way speakers, from a reputable brand. I went with JBL. Obviously the fit needed some tinkering, but all in all made a world of difference. Much clearer and crisper sound with great bass feedback. They Speaker quality of Pyle is light-years behind unfortunately. A thing to note, the 8ohm 280w rating is not close to what you will get from Pyle speakers, not running from that little digital amp.<br/><br/>The JBL speakers I went for are 4ohm and 180w and the amp will handle them very well, without straining at all.<br/><br/>Lastly, here is a picture of the Bluetooth/amp I received. Please not the orientation of the sticker.</span>

<span>Easy to install, I put them under a kitchen cabinet above the bar for the light and so we can listen to music while cooking, cleaning, just dancing around the kitchen really good sound for what they are, I wasnt expecting theater quality when I ordered them, but I built a custom drop down under the cabinet and makes them sound pretty dang good, we just love these speakers</span>

<span> These are well built speakers that have already survived a few torrential downpours. Only time will tell how they hold up in the long run but so far, so good.<br/><br/>The sound quality is incredible. I have other Sonos products so that wasn’t surprising. But I was initially concerned that I would need a subwoofer to pair with these. I was very wrong. They produce a great, full-bodied sound all on their own and easily fill our 400 square foot terrace with sound. Even at very low volume levels they produce an amazing amount of sound.<br/><br/>The mounting brackets are pure genius, allowing you to install them in a lot of different ways. It’s up to you to get the right screws but these brackets are fantastic. And it’s really easy to remove the speakers if you need to.<br/><br/>Wiring the speakers is very easy too.<br/><br/>Overall I love these and if you already have an amp the price on Amazon is great.</span>

<span>I come from the old school - wired speakers - massive woofers, sweet tweeters and mellow midranges.<br/>My first set of speakers were 3' tall and weighed nearly 100 lbs. each. That was in 1981.<br/>I had an impressive set up. Now, Sonos.<br/>It takes a while to get your get your head around the fact that there is NO LONGER a central location of an amplifier etc.<br/>Each speaker is powered by 110 VAC wall mains, so wires (of a different kind) are still present even-though this is wireless. It is wireless in the sense that all feeds of sound come in wirelessly.<br/>Everything, meaning all your music choices, come via a mobile device. I love this set up....expensive to cover the entire house, but easy to set up and the response time is nearly immediate.<br/>You can get a thing from Sonos where you can hook up a turntable and your old stuff. But I gave all that stuff away. I can have each speaker play something unique - a different music source feed. Crazy flexible.<br/><br/>Much love. Not really made for the outside, but I did buy some weather protection bags that hold the smaller speakers. I hung those outside under an eave. So far so good.</span>

<span>I have read the reviews on these and they are mixed i had a party coming up did not want speaker cables hanging so i bought 8 of these speakers and im 100% satisfied for 200 bucks i get good quality music at an average to above average volume u cannot blast them bc it will sound distorted the bass isn't great on them but turn the bass down to 45% crank the treble up and u can have a party or just light music while your cooking and hanging out. exactly what i was expecting for the price and would recommend them 100% to anyone who wants affordable speakers for normal application plus i bought the 80 dollar amp and it runs all 8 speakers with no issue and crisp quality dont let these reviews get to your head bc i almost did and im happy i just bought them</span>

Product Description   RCi Series In-Wall Speakers deliver incredible Polk sound to every room in your home without using any floor or shelf space! Now you have new options for more flexibility and performance from Polk Audio. Out of the box and into the wall (or ceiling), that’s how easy it is to install new Polk Audio RCi Series In-ceiling Loudspeakers like the RC80i. Dynamic Balance drivers and aimable tweeters ensure spacious imaging with amazing clarity as well as a well-balanced sound in any listening position, not just a small "sweet spot." Paint them to match your decor and they practically disappear, leaving you with nothing but high-performance sound! Installation is easy as 1-2-3: cut one hole, feed the wires, and simply drop the speaker in. Rotating Cams secure the speaker safely with no extra assembly or mess. Klippel motor optimization uses laser measurement technology to ensure a smooth excursion path at either end of the volume spectrum for uniform performance at both low and high volumes.   Amazon.com   -   
  From the Manufacturer          The RC80i features a beefy 8-inch woofer to produce the maximum amount of bass and a one inch dome tweeter for depth and detail, resulting in rich lifelike sound from an in-ceiling speaker—performance unheard of just a few years ago. An ideal solution for areas requiring big, room-filing sound without the big speaker cluttering up your room, The RC80i's wide dispersion capability means you'll hear great sound no matter where you are in the room.key featuresPaintable grilles allow you to make your speakers disappear completely into your painted walls (but you can always leave them white too).Out of the box into the ceiling installation. The RC80i uses rugged stainless steel hardware and powder-coated aluminum grille for years of dependable performance. (Please note that RCi Series loudspeakers are not suitable for exposed outdoor use. For outdoor applications, use our Atrium Series speakers). Swivel tweeter. The RC80i features a swiveling tweeter so you can aim it toward the listening area for greater accuracy.  take a look inside this product      technology Dynamic Balance® and Klippel Optimization Like all Polk speakers, the transducers in the RC80i speakers are products of Dynamic Balance technology and Klippel Optimization. A Dynamic Balance tweeter or driver has been designed using microscopic testing, materials science, and precision-designed interfaces to reduce or eliminate mechanical breakup that adds distortion and colors the sound. Klippel Optimization ensures the speaker will perform well at both low and high volumes levels.Blue Polymer Woofers with Rubber Surround Provide excellent damping and bass response while resisting deterioration. Your RCi speakers should last longer than your house. Other speakers use flimsy paper cones and foam surrounds that fall apart due to time and exposure.Timbre Matched The RC80i, like all RCi series speakers, is timbre matched to our freestanding speakers - such as Polk Monitor, TSi and OWM series, just in case you need in-ceiling surround speakers to match your freestanding fronts.    why you should consider this productIf you're looking to fill a room or your home with life-like sound, you should seriously consider the RC80i for its high performance audio, ease of installation, and amazing value.

<span>I've read the reviews before buying this setup. No on off switch, no volume control, not much base, all that. Well I decided on these for several reasons. Most of all better than what I had already. My phone is my stereo, and video player and can control the volume with that, the amplifier is plugged into a power strip and have an on off switch on it, I'm 61 and don't need massive bass and volume, yet the system is adequate for the volume I'm getting. Anybody with knowing how to read can install these. I'm pleased with my purchase, and have only one very minor complaint. The screwdriver that came with it to put the speaker wire in the amplifier is about as useless as can be. Not really worth mentioning at all since I'm a cabinetmaker and have a vast amount of tools. My movies and music is much better to listen to now. And for the price its outstanding.</span>
