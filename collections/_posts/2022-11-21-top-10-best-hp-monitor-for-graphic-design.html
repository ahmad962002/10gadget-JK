<span>Picture quality is great using an HDMI cable, but the USB-C features don't work on Apple MacBook Pro M1 Max running latest MacOS.  Though I wish the USB-C interface and USB-3 ports worked, its not worth the hassle of another round of returns. HDMI get the job done.</span>

<span>I really love the business class HP monitors, as they calibrate the displays for color accuracy, and they have amazing monitor stands (up/down, tilt, swivel support). I really wanted to love this monitor, but as I use a Macbook Pro (2016 and 2019) computer, for some reason the Mac doesn't like having 2 of these monitors.<br/><br/>Getting the Mac to output to both of these using the included USBC cable didn't work at all. Yes, this Macbook Pro can support multiple monitors - I had 2 LG USB-C monitors working at the same time. Only one of the HPs would work - I tried all the "no signal" troubleshooting tips online to no avail. I used a DisplayPort to USBC cable and eventually got both working at the same time (one using USBC, and other DP to USBC), but the problems didn't end there. I usually leave the monitors on and let the computer make them go to sleep, and they did, but sometimes both monitors wouldn't wake up.<br/><br/>With that said, I did try these monitors on a Windows Lenovo laptop that had 2 USBC ports and they worked just fine. So the issue above seems to be isolated to Mac laptops (I tried a 15" MPB 2016 and 15" 2019 MBP).<br/><br/>Side note - the HDMI port (using HDMI to USBC) looked amazing on OSs that support HDR. I had to go into the display settings within the Mac and switch to a different color profile, but the colors just popped.</span>

<span>It's fine on its own but as a second screen it is hard to focus on for me. The text is "smudged" and stretched compared to the laptop screen even after changing to similar resolutions. Just not as clear quality as I was hoping for. Really like the stand with the height change and tilt though.</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these for my wife's work station at home.  The monitors are easy to put together and set up.  The cable connections allow for VGA, HDMI, or Displayport.  The monitors have speakers and sound better than the laptop speakers.  They have a connection for the speakers but with the HDMI cable the sound uses just that connection.<br/><br/>Over all the monitors are reasonably priced, can be installed in 10 mins and look great for work.  The back is also set up for a plate to be used on arm mounts for a desk or wall.  I would buy these again.</span>

<span>I like this monitor. I love the height adjustment! It will be so much nicer than bending my neck to look down at my all-in-one. Hard to find a height adjustable monitor at this price.<br/>I did have a bit of trouble getting the operating manual. Spent way too much time looking for a manual for this model on the HP website. FINALLY noticed Get Product Support on the order details page. I soon talked with a very nice human being who sent me a cut and paste address for the manual.<br/>Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to use it much, other than to check screen quality. I ordered an HP desktop from another vendor at the same time. In my quest to get some questions answered about the computer, I found that HP had no record of the computer's serial number. After some googling, I found that is a thing with HP. They don't have a very reliable system for keeping track of their serial numbers. AND, if you have no serial number, there is no way to communicate with HP. Plus, you have no warrantee. Many people find out they have no valid serial number too late. Even the tech guy at the store where I bought the computer had had the same problem. He spent months (in vain) trying to get satisfaction from HP. I am still looking for a NON HP desktop.</span>

<span>This was by far one of the easiest monitors I've assembled.  Literally took me less than 5 min to attach stand.  Love the that height is adjustable and it has tilt as well.  Picture quality is great.  Some reviews stated poor picture quality or that screen was brighter on one side of that picture quality had to be fine tuned.  I had none of these issues.  I simply used buttons on bottom of screen to choose low blue light.  Had it up and connected to my computer in less than 10 min.  I highly recommend this monitor.</span>

<span>Easy to assemble stand and hook up via HDMI to my laptop.  I cannot call this component anti-glare; it's no different than the 32 in. TV I was using before that I can tell.  Not an issue though.  Two things very much an issue:<br/>1.  If ever a piece of electronic equipment cried out for a remote, this is it!  Navigation through the menu is frustrating and unnecessarily difficult, because:<br/><br/>2.  The controlling buttons are on the lower INSIDE right- hand corner and not even marked as to function! I knew this when I bought it and it seemed iffy then, but I thought I'd go ahead with it.  I'm not so sure I'd do it knowing what I know now, although I've figured it out thanks to the HP help site and patience.  So, I'll keep it.<br/><br/>Finally, there was no instruction manual - none - but I was able to download it from the same website as well.  It looks great, works fine, with good quality picture and definition, but is a handful to program.  That would not be the case with a remote, and a uni will not suffice.  Just FYI . . .</span>

<span>I mainly use this monitor for surfing the internet and multitasking such as online college course work.  i gave it 5 stars because the picture quality is excellent and the screen is big!  and it's better and cheaper than most hp qhd monitors and you can still use it for a hp pavilion computer tower!  i also like it because you can tilt the screen easily!  for my opinion, if you're looking for a monitor for multitasking, gaming, or browsing the internet this would be your second best option to get, but if you're wanting to watch 4k blu ray discs then i would go with a 4k monitor instead.  to narrow it down, 4k does have the best picture quality but, for just simple multitasking and surfing the internet(depending on your likes and needs) i would go with the hp fhd 32" monitor to start out with, and then later down the road get a 4k.</span>

<span>I’ve only had this monitor for a few hours and I love it already! Very easy to set up (took me less than 10 minutes from unboxing to connection) excellent picture quality. Big enough and yet small enough to fit on my desk in my home office. I was only THINKING about buying a new monitor to replace my old one, which had some issues with colors but still served its purpose, so I wasn’t in a hurry. Lo and behold, an ad popped up for monitors on Prime Day and it was like a sign! It took me an hour to really convince myself to get it and I’m so glad that I did.

<span>This monitor is paired with a new high-end desktop with separate video card. First thing you will notice is how little the monitor weighs. A screen as thick as a piece of glass is a big contributor to the weight reduction. The image extends almost edge to edge. My only minor complaint is that the power and other buttons are along the bottom edge of the screen where you are forced to feel your way around. I quickly adjusted to the location so it’s not that big of a deal.<br/><br/>Bottom line…. I love the monitor. Worth every penny.</span>

<span>If you get issues such the display settings resetting to default every time you turn on this monitor, don't worry about refunding it. That's part of the drivers that apparently get installed once you hook it up to your PC, if you want less headaches, delete whatever new HP branded app in through your control panel. Or you can be like me and use the application to just set the monitor settings without having to push the buttons each time. Could've been 5 stars tho had it just asked me first.....</span>

<span>If you are looking for a gaming monitor on a budget this is it! The screen resolution will amaze you along with its almost edge-less design. It is the perfect size for full HD; I used to use an 24" HDTV screen and to me this monitor looks way better, especially up close. You will enjoy using this whether you are gaming or doing office work. I primarily use it with my Xbox and the games look the best I've ever seen them. Only downsides I could come across was having no built-in speakers, only one HDMI port, and no volume controls which I found to be a slight issue when gaming using a console, although all games have volume settings that you can change. Overall a really good monitor for the price!</span>

<span>Let's go straight to the point.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-165Hz (Display Cable only).<br/>-Good picture quality.<br/>- Good color Vivid.<br/>-1440p resolution.<br/>-27inch is prefect size for gaming.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>- Colours out of the box is not great. You need to change or customize it to get the best out of it.<br/><br/>-Everytime you touch the HDMI or display cable it turns off the screen and it comes back up again.<br/><br/>-There's a little dull color area in the right side of the monitor. it's very small and you don't really notice it when you are watching movies and playing games.<br/><br/>-Also I one dead pixel (Not too bad)</span>

<span>I have four of these and they all work great, no stuck/dead pixels. I will say you might want to check and see what panel you have when you get it because there is one that is quite a bit better than the other. LG is the more sought after panel.<br/><br/>On the box, the label will indicate hardware revision such as LIM101 or BIM101 or something similar<br/><br/>On the back of the monitor's label, it will also show LIM101 or BIM101 or something similar<br/><br/>In the monitors menus, it will also LIM101 show or BIM101 or something similar<br/><br/>The service menu will tell the full model name of the panel like LGD something or BOE something</span>

<span>Bought this to replace my LG G-sync certified monitor when it was clear (at the time) I was not going to get my hands on an RTX 30 Series card at an even remotely reasonable price anytime soon (yes this was months ago). It's picture quality may not be quite as good as the previous but it works as expected and came at an excellent price well below what I paid for the device it replaces. Fast forward, i'm still not buying an Nvidia card now after the money already spend on RX, so it'll remain my daily driver for work, gaming and general browsing for the foreseeable future.</span>

<span>Got the HP X27q during the second treasure truck sale on July 13, 2022. As you see in some of the reviews after July 13 some have reported getting monitors with a BOE panel (BIM111) used instead of the LG panel (LIM101) in earlier manufactured models that got a lot positive reviews. There are other reports of people getting a newer revision LG panel (LIM111). It's a lottery at this point.<br/><br/>In my case I would be considered lucky and got an old stock manufactured Aug 2021 with the LIM101 LG panel and monitor FW 1.1.1.0.<br/><br/>No dead or stuck pixels. No flickering.<br/><br/>The colors after using a color profile file from a review and their recommended settings and in 10bit the general output from the monitor looks great. This is my first IPS monitor so it was a bit of a sensory overload with picture quality after using TN monitors for so long.<br/><br/>But that's kinda ruined as I got unlucky with the IPS glow lottery. The bottom left is pretty bad. If there's anything dark in that corner it will look washed out if sitting in the center. I can either sit a bit off to the left about an inch from the center or sit one and half arms length away to see that bottom left glow go away so things like watching movies from a further distance is unaffected. Included in the review is a pretty good representation of what I see using a solid black color and with the monitor brightness set at 5 at about an arms length away.<br/><br/>Horizontal viewing angles are good.<br/>Vertical viewing angles are only good looking from below. From above it's a bit washed out and gets worse when a horizontal angle is added. Looks like it comes from the IPS glow at the bottom. Compared to my Dell S2716DG with TN panel vertical viewing angle from above is much better. But honestly vertical viewing angles will never be a problem for me.<br/><br/>Buttons in the back is just bad. Having a multi monitor setup and needing to press any buttons to switch input or make any other adjustment means I have to keep pivoting away my side monitor which I'm glad I have monitor arms. Just have the buttons at come out the bottom of the bottom bezel.<br/><br/>The forward facing power LED design placement is questionable as the placement is just "there". By default on the white LED is not that bad during the day, but at night it will be noticeable and can be dazzling to the eyes. And it turns to a nice amber when it enters into sleep mode though I it's still a bit bright at night. HP does give us the option to completely disable it. But there seems to be a bug with it. After turning off the power LED and the first time the monitor enters sleep mode the LED will stay off. But when you wake it up and the next it enters sleep mode with the "no input" message pops up the white LED will come on and stay on. It doesn't turn amber and stays white. The LED will then turn off the next time you wake it up.<br/><br/>Warranty length is only a year. But for me after searching up my serial number my warranty started back in April 15, 2022 and ends May 9, 2023. So I have 10 months. Though I'm pretty sure they have to grant my warranty started at the time of purchase July 13 and not April 15 with the invoice.<br/><br/>So to rate the monitor. During the day time the IPS glow is not noticeable and the overall picture quality is great. In the evening/night the IPS glow is there but I've found a good balance of brightness that works well that it limits the IPS glow and haven't noticed it when just doing stuff. Though for others this might not be possible. The vertical angle that I'm not bothered about but should be brought up. And the bug with the power LED can be a major issue for some. Finding out that I may have less than one year warranty really sucks so I'm giving it a 3 star instead of a 4.<br/><br/>If this monitor was to ever drop down to the treasure truck truck price of $175 I would try and get another one and would recommend giving it a shot. It is Amazon so returns is not that much of an hassle. At the regular price of around $250 I would really be looking at other monitors in this price range before considering this X28q.<br/><br/>Something to note is other major electronic stores don't sell this model anymore and HP's own store website doesn't even have a page for it. Is it possible this treasure truck sale was to move the last major batch of these monitors before being discontinued?</span>

<span>I am ecstatic about this purchase for several reasons. I haven't had a new monitor at home for several years, and they have come a long way since my last, 15-inch, square, LCD Samsung. I'm not knocking the Samsung monitor; it was great when new, but now it's just rather old, tired and dull.<br/><br/>I did quite a lot of research before buying. My employer reimburses up to $75 for a home monitor to use for days when we work from home, so I wanted to come as close as possible to that price. I also wanted to step up in size to a maximum of 22 inches (to fit into the monitor recess of my bureau). Additionally, I had hoped to get an LED rather than LCD monitor. For inputs, I wanted VGA to use with my old desktop which doesn't have HDMI, plus HDMI to use with my work laptop. Since I hadn't been in the market for a monitor for a long time, I wasn't sure if I was asking too much.<br/><br/>Well, I whittled the many possible choices I found down to this HP and an Asus with nearly identical specs. The Asus was priced $10 higher, but offered a $10 mail-in rebate. Well, I hate mail-in rebates, and I couldn't see me actually getting around to mailing it in and waiting 8 weeks for a $10 check that I would then have to take in to the bank to deposit. So I chose the HP - and, boy was I glad I did!<br/><br/>I am so happy with this monitor! First of all, it fit perfectly in the space that was waiting for it, thanks to accurate measurements given in the product details in amazon.com. For setup, I thought I would be in for the usual new computer equipment nightmares where nothing works at first, then you have to jump through hoops, download drivers, reboot umpteen times, go back to the manual to find out what you did wrong, find out that the manual is only on disc but now you can't read it because your new monitor isn't working yet, yadayadayada... But no, setup was a breeze! I was done in about 15 minutes, the monitor worked first time on both my old desktop with VGA and new laptop with HDMI. There was one slight glitch that the initial picture was stretched sideways on the VGA connection to my old desktop, but after I installed the software from the supplied disc it worked fine. The picture via the HDMI connection from the new laptop worked perfectly first time, with no need to install anything. As for switching between VGA and HDMI, you just press a button on the underside of the frame.<br/><br/>The picture is great, for my needs, at least. Bright and crisp, with no evident lag when running videos. As another reviewer put it perfectly: "Is this a stunning, perfect display? No, not really. But it is perfect as a low-cost secondary display for a laptop.". I totally agree with that. My needs are average, I just only use it for work and for an occasional change from my personal laptop to look at a bigger screen to watch a video or something.<br/><br/>I mentioned the accuracy of the stated product dimensions earlier. Well, there was one thing that confused me a bit. At the top left on the amazon.com page the bottom image is a silhouette of a person standing at a desk with the monitor in front of him. There is a vertical measurement shown there of 20 in/49 cm. I assumed this to be the height with the stand (thinking that the height in the Technical Details was without the stand). I thought this would be a problem, as I only had about 19 in vertical height where I wanted to site it. Well, when it arrived, there was no problem, as the assembled unit with the stand is, in fact, 15.8 in, not 20 in, so I'm not sure what that 20 in in the silhouetted man picture represents.<br/><br/>This monitor is an outstanding value and I have no hesitation in recommending it!</span>

<span>This is coming from the perspective of someone who games and occasionally does image and video editing.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>  - Standard widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio.<br/>  - Standard zoom, this was my second monitors and compared to other cheap monitors I've gotten my hands on, this one wasn't deceptive. (Some would be a similar size but be zoomed in so you wouldn't actually get as much screen real estate.)<br/>  - Great horizontal viewing angles. There's a sweet spot, but the image is generally good as far as you go.<br/>  - Good color reproduction. I don't know anything about the fine details of color accuracy in monitors, but it seems pretty accurate out of the box.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  - Awful vertical viewing angles, such a small viewing angle. At least all that happens is that the image gets a bit dark, which is better than other effects I've seen, but the angle is crazy narrow.<br/><br/>Possible compatibility issues:<br/>  - Cables go out the back instead of the bottom. This is probably more standard among thinner monitors, but take note of the extra space that your cables will take up behind the monitor.<br/>  - No VESA mounting option. You're using the included stand, period.<br/><br/>The things it gets right are all things I care about, the compatibility issues are pretty minimal for casual use, my main gripe is with the vertical viewing angle, it's bad enough to lower my rating to 4 stars, but from my (very limited) experience, I think I'm happy with what I got for what I paid.</span>
