<span>This is a good looking watch that is very easy to read.  However maneuvering around the watch is a little difficult.  I have a Mudmaster that is more complicated but much easier to use.  All in all for the price its a good watch.  Everything I need is on the main screen.</span>

<span>Perfect watch for older eyes. Can be read in almost any light conditions. Huge improvement over previous screens.<br/>Cons: it is not a smart watch. It took me a bit of time to get used to the buttons and what they do.<br/>App is so so. Could use improvement. Maybe Casio will update it someday. Although I doubt they will.<br/><br/>With its shortcomings (no watch is perfect) I do wear this watch more than any other Casio watch that I own.<br/>Love the Teal color. Very unique.</span>

<span>Does more then ill ever need. Screen is easily seen in daylight not so much in lower light levels.  Im just a joy bicycle rider and take long desert walks at times and tracking seems to be very accurate.  Wich was the reason for this choice.  Im out of state a lot and when I choose an activity it automatically sends your safety contacts an email saying your going on a ride, walk, ect. Safety contacts can keep track of where you are in an emergency ( as long as you have your phone with you and it has service). If you do take a hard fall it also send them an alert. Its only happened once and was just some hard bumpy riding but my wife was aware something had happened. I didn't get the alert stopped in time so I sent a msg that everything was fine. I love the fact that someone knows where I'm at. Without it when I'm out of state no one would have a clue where I was. I didn't get the solar but battery with no activity lasts easily 2 weeks. Ive done 4 - 5 hour activities and batteries were still well over 50 % even with wearing a few days and not charging beforehand<br/>Very satisfied with the choice of the instinct 2</span>

<span>I bought this watch to track my mountain bike rides and have them automatically upload to the Strava app.  I now also use it to track my running, hunting, and weight lifting.  I absolutely love all the data it collects aside from tracking activities.  I especially love the ability to track with the app things like hydration, body weight, sleep quality, body battery, and training effect and load.  I didn't want a watch like this for a long time until this year and now It's my favorite piece of gear for every day life as well as my sports activities and outdoor pursuits.</span>

<span>"You had one job!"  Get used to seeing the "no tide data" displayed if you bought this watch for tide data.  If you google it, this is a recurring problem.  If you are buying this watch for HR, Step Counter, knowing what the current temperature is, digital compass, the "wave counter" (and let's be real you know you're just going to lie anyway about how many waves you caught) then this watch is for you.<br/>If you're buying it to be able to tell the tides, then this watch sucks.<br/>I got it to display the tide data for about an hour, then took it out on a paddleboard session and 15 mins in the tide data cuts out.  Tide data only displays while it's in earshot of the phone, which is pointless because how often do you bring your phone out while doing watersports?  How a $100 tide watch can store 100 years of tide data, yet this $450 watch can't store 2 hours worth of tide data, is beyond me.  The way this should work is either (a) the watch should store decades worth of tide data and when the gps signal recognizes where you are it snaps to that dataset and stays there until it recognizes that you've moved, or (b) the watch should pair with the phone and sync up and store at least a few weeks worth of tide data once it realizes where you are.  Tide data can be accurately predicted out hundreds of years, which is why the old school watches work so well.<br/>This watch could've been awesome because in my use case where I live on the bay and surf on the ocean, there are no tidal buoys that a surf watch recognizes here on the bay - so my hope was this watch would have displayed the tides in maritime areas where there is no surfing to be had, in addition to all the well known surf spots.  The watch not being able to store data and being so reliant on the phone is a known and glaring issue that IMO invalidates the watch for the use case it was set out to achieve.<br/><br/>Other gripes:  On other less expensive gps surf watches you also get swell period, swell direction, and surf height - which this watch doesn't have.  At this price point, it would also be cool to not only get present conditions, but some limited forecasting.<br/><br/>My takeaways on surf watches in general:<br/>None of them have what you'd really need to make a great forecast, so what they really need to come out with is an internet watch where you can just download all the apps you want and use those.<br/>The most basic of watches that just tell you the tides, sunrise/sundown, etc., are nice because they always work and that little bit of info is nice to have.<br/>Surf sessions rarely last for more than a few hours.  Currently no watch replaces forecasting on several different apps / websites, and a watch at present can't replace this.  So there really is no need to dork around with a watch mid-session, and doing so may actually prohibit one's ability to not only enjoy themselves but also to learn to read the water and the weather for changes.</span>

<span>Overall features of the watch are great if you want a waterproof fitness tracker with some great navigation aids. I just cant recommend spending the extra money for surf version, which is what I originally bought it for. First, the surf tracker is just a gimmick and generally nowhere close to accurate on wave count, speed or distance. It seems to be a very, very common complaint. Second, the tide feature relies on pairing with your phone for it's information. If I need my phone to tell my watch the tide times, I would just look at my phone in the first place. I understand there are plenty of other brand options that have the tide times built in. Look, feel, battery life, water resistance (so far) and every other feature has been great. I really like the watch, just save your $$ and don't buy into the surf version.</span>

<span>People listen to me well!!! Be This isn't just an unhappy review bc I got that one-chance random defective watch. The watch and ALL its other things are really really cool!! However I am a Surfer and I bought this watch specifically for Surfing, and it is the most inaccurate Surfing app ever. The tides are never correct (off by 3-4 hours) the wave count is completely bonkers. One session I counted 5 waves caught, the watch.......40!!!! Same with the speed, told me my top speed was 35 mph!!!🤣🤣🤣 etc.. THE SURFING APP IS HORRIBLE point-blank. For that kind of money this app should be perfected and its the farthest thing from it. If you're gonna buy a watch for Surfing buy a different one. Otherwise the watch itself and EVERY other app are amazing. Only reason it got any stars. Bc it is a cool watch!! Terrible Surf watch tho!  Garmin put that fugaze app on their watch for marketing purposes ONLY,  before perfecting its technology . Couldn't even get the tides right! Fooled me! Smh!<br/>Damn thing should surf for you for all the money it costs. SO ANNOYED!!!</span>

<span>Below are the factors contributing to my rating. This is a pricey watch. If it was a junk watch, my review would have been different.<br/><br/>1) I bought a solar powered watch. When I charged it first, it showed that I have 29 days of battery life. I went to Aruba with it where it was exposed to sun for 8 hours a day. 14 days later it was fully discharged. The solar power thing is just a gimmick to lure naive buyers to spend extra $$. The battery life figures are false.<br/><br/>2) A friend of mine has an CCC watch for 1/4 of the price with more features. It looks sharp. This one looks like a hunk of plastic. Why do I have to pay hundreds of dollars more for a watch that is better designed?<br/><br/>3) The watch doesnt have a stopwatch. Cmon, garmin, this is a sports watch.<br/><br/>4) The watch goes into various GPS modes by pressing a single button twice. This happens spontaneously when you do sports. The watch loses power quickly after that. It takes pressing ~10 buttons to navigate out of this in a complex menu on a small screen, while bounced around by the waves. I dont think the engineers who designed this ever used it.<br/><br/>5) I have disabled my twitter feed on the watch several times. It still appears from somewhere.<br/><br/>EDITS: Actually there is a stopwatch. I stand corrected.</span>

<span>I had read some other reviews and took note of the watch size but it is so much smaller than I thought. It was purchased for my 9-year-old daughter for camp and it looks ridiculous on her... maybe a good size for a 5-year-old and that's about it</span>

<span>This Casio watch, like another I own, offers great bang for your buck.  The only drawback is that the date is teeny tiny and therefore difficult to read.  If you need a watch to just tell time and don't care about keeping track of the date, this will suit your needs very well.</span>
