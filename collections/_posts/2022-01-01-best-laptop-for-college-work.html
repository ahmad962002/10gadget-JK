<span>I can't yet speak to how durable it is, but Kenneth Cole historically produces well made products, so I expect it to hold up very well. This backpack is much roomier than I thought it would be from the picture.  Plenty of room for computer, tablet, cords, pens, passports, etc.  Also, since the airlines only allow 2 carry-on items, my purse (a Baggalini travel purse that's full of stuff) fits in the bottom of the large compartment and there's still lots of room above for night clothes and underwear, in case of being stuck overnight due to cancelled flights.  I wish the side pockets were large enough to hold a good water bottle, but I've decided I can carry that inside the backpack.  The Kenneth Cole Reaction Sophie backpack does have side pockets with enough room for water bottles, but it's not as classy looking as this one, so . . . I really like this backpack.</span>

<span>This bag is made with high quality materials and finished. I love all of the thoughtful details and high end finishes. Great look and plenty of pockets for organization. I also got a matching suitcase from this collection and I love the set. By far my favorite luggage I’ve ever had. I look very sleek and out together when traveling for work with this matching set!</span>

<span>I love this backpack.  It has lots of space, and pockets, small and large, to place and organize many different items.  I used it to travel and it worked perfectly for my IPad, phone, portable charger, AirPods plus lots more.  It was rather heavy because I packed so much in it but not a problem carrying it when I put it on my back.  It fit nicely under the seat in front of me on the plane as I used it for my personal carry on. Besides practical and very functional it is a very classy looking backpack with the gold zippers. I highly recommend it.  And I purchased it during Prime Days so it was a real bargain.</span>

<span>It lasted the entire school year. The 1st backpack I haven't had to replace at some point during the school year. Impressed!</span>

<span>The best thing about this backpack is that the different zippers provide larger storage than I had thought. The inside also has a spot specifically for your laptop, which is always good for traveling or for students! The size of this backpack is overall pretty good.<br/><br/>However, I have to knock off one star because within the first few months of having it the handles attached to the zippers would break off. This is fine though because it’s an easy fix, but I have had the actual zipper part fall off before too, leading me to think I’d never be able to zip it up. It all worked out and I still use it to this day, though.</span>

<span>I’ve been using this pack for little over a month, nearly daily. It is thoughtfully designed and well constructed. I love the soft fabric on the shoulder pads, it doesn’t abrade my skin if I’m wearing a tank top. I have shoulder issues and find the padding does a great job of comfortably distributing my load. The pockets are well placed, the zippers work great, the main zippers travel well down the sides of the bag. It keeps the items near the bottom of the bag within reach while still holding 25 liters in a narrow profile. The fabric is water repellent. I did add a hang on water bottle holder from Nite Ize for my 32 oz water bottle as the side pockets would not accommodate a bottle that size, but they are perfect for large wipe packages.</span>

<span>This backpack (Targus Spruce EcoSmart for 15.6 Inch widescreen laptops) is truly great.  Its compact in the best way, as it looks a bit small from the outside and then once you start opening it and loading it up with stuff you realize is roomier than it leads on.  My HP ENVY 15 laptop (15.6 inch) fits quite nicely and feels secure.  The backpack is really, truly comfortable to carry around.  The padding in the back gives it a really nice feel and the shoulder straps are very nicely designed.  The backpack seems to have a supreme built quality but at the same time remains light to carry.  Carrying the aforementioned laptop, some papers, a book and a couple of personal items the back feels quite light on the back.<br/><br/>Every single compartment seems to have been thoughtfully designed with the utmost functionality always in mind.  There doesn't seem to be a wasted space in this thing.<br/><br/>I can't stress how practical this backpack is and how well made it is enough.  I also own a Targus XL Backpack which I bought for an 18.4 inch computer about 4 years ago.  While I never found that backpack to be lacking, this one is head and shoulders a better made product, the build quality is truly great.  The fabric made out of recycled plastic water bottles is of outstanding quality and it feels great to hold.  Also the backpack is truly nice looking.  I think it would be right at home in the hands of a corporate type as its elegant, but its not "boring" just as it is at home with me (a graduate Engineering student).<br/><br/>Elegant, super practical, incredible build quality, spacious (for what's a genuinely compact backpack)...what's not to like?  Highly recommended.</span>

<span>An excellent bag for travel and storage, except for the water bottle holder, which is comprised of bizarre laced nylon strings. Pretty disappointing, since that is such a crucial staple for just about any bag. Your nalgene, hydroflask will not fit in this bag.</span>

<span>The dimensions for this bag are actually 18.75" x 13" x 8.25," which is larger than those quoted in the Amazon product description.  This is a good bag I really wanted to use but I couldn't come to terms with the front pouch, which is a feature I use a lot.  The pouch is a little hard to open as you must negotiate a near right-angle turn on both sides.  Several of the accessory pockets within the front pouch are wwwaayyyy down at the bottom, plus there are only 2 pen holders, and they are open at the bottom (bad news if you've ever had a pen leak in a low pressure airplane cabin), and there's a goofy business card holder thing that catches on the zipper when you open the pouch.  Given that 99% of backpacks have organizational pockets high in the front pouch + at least 3 closed pen loops, this is a real disappointment. The bag is also thicker on the bottom, so that it tilts downward when the bag is flat on a table or desk, which I also found annoying.  Good points were styling, green interior, multiple large compartments to allow some file organization, which I prefer to the one giant sack you get with other backpacks, &amp; the fact that it is made from recycled bottles.</span>

<span>It arrived in new, sealed condition and shipping was way faster than expected. It's just as described, with plenty of space, straps and zippers that allow you to make great use of it and distribute your belongings inside so it feels comfortable when you wear it. Looking forward to using it in multiple trips, I'm pretty sure I can substitute my carry-on luggage for a 3 day trip with just this bag. Quality is quite good, stitching is reinforced in certain areas (as expected) and the fabric/material seems strong, for now.

<span>This medium sized backpack appears to be sturdy and is better quality than I expected for the price. It appears to be waterproof and I think it is well made. My daughter selected it for her first year at her new high school. It has a nice padded pocket for the school issued tablet. She does not have to carry a ton of books but she does have a large binder and several notebooks, workbooks, etc. The smaller front pocket is roomy enough for headphones, post it’s and a pencil pouch. Our only complaint is that the water bottle holders are too small to carry a 20 oz hydroflask or thermos. However, if you were traveling, a 16 oz plastic water bottle would fit fine. She is even able to roll up a hoodie a place it on top of the binders and the backpack zips up w/o issue.</span>

<span>Ok, start. This is not a promo quality bag. But you are looking at this because it's cheaper than other nicer ones. It's that way for a reason. It is padded but not on the bottom and not exceptionally well. More like I can put my tablet in, and things won't scratch the screen, or with my laptop, it won't scratch the outside. Do not throw this around reviews of people chucking this thing and drop-kicking it like a junior high kid who has no respect for their nice things. No, this thing is padded s,o when walking around or sitting on the ground or whatever, it won't scratch up stuff or get messed up.<br/><br/>If you want to throw it into the back of your car instead of putting it down on the passenger seat or floor of the car, get a shock-resistant case, you freaking psycho. Also, there is no padding on the bottom; just the excellent divider means my college books don't ruff it up as crammed into the bags. Other slots and corner rubs the inside of the pouch, and what would be the outside of my laptop or screen on my tablet when I was using it just for that. Another reason you SET IT DOWN, not drop it, not drop kick or chuck it; it lacks padding at the top and bottoms. This isn't a shock-resistant pack, it's padded so I can put books, cables, a mouse, and a mousepad in it, without it rubbing on the laptop as I walk, and it moves a little bit.<br/><br/>Because my college campus is large, the excellent parking is under the solar spots, but one of my classes was next to the solar on stuff another side. I was almost lazy enough to drive to another parking lot. That is how big the campus is instead walked that far. In the end, all the walking made me pretty sore but also glad, as I know from my youth in the boot that bag is moving. I know because I had a frame from my pack in the boot with too much wait digging into me leave bare spot one hike as they strapped some M16 to my collection; I could feel with every step that bag moving as it rubbed me. People don't realize the bag moves like that.<br/><br/>While not enough wait to bother me, a big collect textbook, a mouse with a cable attached, a power cord, and spiral notebooks, all that without cheap padding would rub and scratch my laptop's finish. So an excellent bargain bag, and I love that it has that dock on it, but I think it's faster not to use it, at least when topping off my laptop; for mobile devices, it's perfect between classes. I put it on the table in front of me or the chair next to me, and I don't get to take out the pack to charge my phone, for instance. But yet again, if you want to drop kick or throw your excellent expensive tablet or laptop, get a damn shock-resistant setup, not this thing.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Biggest case of buyers remorse in my life. Always bought HP with Intel hardware but figured with the reviews for this Acer Aspire 5 with AMD Ryzen 5 and Radeon graphics why not explore unfamiliar territory and see what the hype was about in the reviews. This Acer Aspire 5 for $489 Brand New shipped to the door I was astonished the laptop didn't come with an actual user manual. Was even more pissed that you can not setup and use this without first connecting to a WiFi network.<br/>For those who don't care about WiFi connections and just want a localized laptop with out brand manufacturers spying on you and gathering data your SOL. Wanted to read the user manual to see there if there was a way around this but for $489 you have to have the internet and download it. After I connected to the internet against my will the computer restarted and entered an error message that an error was encountered and it needed to restart. It did this twice with no luck just blue screens. It then went to diagnose repair screen attempting to diagnose the failure to start up with no luck only option was to shut down. After shutdown it actually loaded back up the and the very next screen was demanding to log in with a Microsoft account or sign up for one. Now there are ways around this with HP laptops. All you have to do is say no internet connection at 1st use and then you can sign in with a local account instead of logging in with a Microsoft account. For those who may not understand why this is an issue for some is when you login with a Microsoft account no matter what settings on privacy you think you can control you have zero privacy. Microsoft can see anything any everything you do on your laptop down to the keyboard typing and all activity. Oh well I know how to fix that later and I sign on with a Microsoft account. Finally get to windows and do what I always do download Firefox and Uninstall Microsoft edge. I restart the laptop to the same cycle of error loading operating system and attempt to diagnose that fails. Shut down the laptop and it loads again. Finally found out that anytime you restart the laptop whatsoever it cycles back to the same blue screens of error loading windows and diagnosing. Performed a factory restore back to complete factory settings so it was like the first time I opened the laptop up no difference. Still doing this cycle of device ran into problem gathering info, then diagnosing PC, PC cant be repaired, shut down, loads till the next time it restarts. Being upset is putting it mildly. I'm 38 and have been using computers and fixing them since I was 12, this is not a foreign language to me. This Acer Aspire 5 with AMD processor and graphics is total garbage. Brand new and it don't even work properly right out of the freakin box. I factory restored this thing 3 times and supposedly this wipes the hard drive completely and saves nothing but yet every time it re-installs it still has my name has the device owner. I started growing aggravated with HP but Acer is a complete joke. The display sucks also. Everything looks fine till you open a windows system or program property window then it's so blurry you think u have something in your eye, played with resolution and display settings and everything is clear and fine until you open a windows properties window and you can barely make out the letters. Same windows on my 3, 5 and 7 year old HP laptops zero issues but this brand new $500 Acer laptops display stops wanting to work properly over a properties window??? Who ever designed this model and it components and said yeah let's ship that out to the unexpected consumer needs banished from working in the information technology field. I wanted to get product support from Acer to address this issue but I couldn't even register this product through the preinstalled Acer Care Center software or their website, everytime I tried it gave me an error message and to try again later. So if you know a little about computers and want to fix a Brand New laptop yourself to get it to work properly I think you will be very pleased with the performance of this machine with the AMD components.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Found the fix for above issues. Don't use the operating system or ghost recovery drive programmed into the laptop. Download windows media creation tool and perform a full wipe and installation using the USB flash drive on startup.  The install will only load windows 10 but after 2-3 days windows update will automatically install windows 11.  I used Driver Booster 9 to update all the drivers for the hardware which always works flawlessly, best part its free and fast and has 1 click upgrades for all drivers. After a bunch of headache and wasted time I'm pretty impressed and happy with the hardware components. I bench-marked and stress tested this PC to some remarkable results. Too bad it couldn't work properly right out of the box, someone at Acer really dropped the ball. What I like about this Acer Aspire A515 45 is that it has 2 memory slots and comes with 8GB preinstalled and is up-gradable to 32 GB. The Graphics card takes half of the preinstalled 8GB and dedicates it to graphics processing which is nice in a way but its a give and take. I had a 4GB card of DDR4 with a 2666MHz clock frequency and threw that in the unused memory slot.  I was unsure how the PC would benchmark after this because the memory preinstalled was 3200MHz and that basically bottle necks the original memory card from 3200MHz down to 2666MHz but it still performed better than without it. Ideally you want to match the memory frequency with what is preinstalled to avoid this but like I said I had this 2666Mhz card already. In the near future I will match the preinstalled memory card with an after market 8GB DDR4 card with a 3200MHz frequency as well as matching the rank of the card (single rank/double rank) and all other specs. Ideally you want both slots to match down to the last detail including the memory capacity to prevent bottle necks between the processor and the motherboards ability to communicate with the memory. When I had the back off this the 2nd memory card slot was right there and accessibility but the original wasn’t visible so If you want to replace the original memory card it appears you have to remove the mother board and flip it over to get to the original used memory slot. While I was installing the added memory I scene that it has a space for an extra additional hard drive which is really great! I have a 500 GB Samsung 870 EVO SSD hard drive in one of my older HP laptops that will be going in this next. I thought I was gonna have to buy different brackets and sata cable to install the Samsung Evo SSD but they were included in the box with all the screws as well! If you buy a model with Intel products that stuff will be inside the laptop taped where the second hard drive goes. After setting up the additional Samsung hard drive so it was recognized by the laptop I used Samsung's "Magician" software to benchmark both drives and was astonished that the western digital SSD was 3 times faster than my Samsung EVO 870. My Samsung was doing almost 600MB a second read/speed and the WD was almost 2GB per second! My fastest laptop before this Acer was a HP Notebook 15 with an dual core Intel i3 processor. That HP ran me the same price as this Acer 2 years ago. It worked great but its a night and day difference between this Acer for multi tasking and for video and graphics capabilities. That HP didn’t have the extra bay for an additional hard drive either. I’m very pleased with this Acer after I removed the pre-installed operating system and software.</span>

<span>Great laptop for the price, I don't think you can find a laptop this great at this price point. Appearance looks great, great build quality, keyboard does not at all feel cheap at all and the keyboard backlight is a great touch. Very lightweight. Touch pad is large and responsive. I have not tried the fingerprint scanner yet. Decently fast boot up times given it has an SSD. Battery life is actually pretty great, too. I am happy with the ports, it even has a USB C port. Screen gets very bright.<br/><br/>It also took about 5 minutes to put in an 8GB ram stick in the easily accessible and open ram slot.<br/><br/>Some cons of course since this is a budget laptop (these cons can be considered "normal" at this price point):<br/> - Full HD display with 1080P screen, however the color quality, especially blacks and other colors is not great. It feels like white is overwhelming compared to other colors. But otherwise at this price point it is OK in my opinion, just that there is a very noticeable difference compared to my 700 dollar laptop.<br/>- CPU kind of sucks. I added 8 GB of ram which did make the computer faster, but downloading things or loading times can be slow with the CPU being the issue. However it is tolerable and I am overall happy with the speed for this price point and do not feel I have to crutch on my other high end laptops.<br/>- The acer 5 series is usually marketed as "slim", but this laptop is definitely not slim. It isn't bulky though, I think it is very average or more in thickness compared to actual slim laptops on the market.<br/><br/>If you have 330 dollars only to spend and are on a tight budget, don't hesitate to get this laptop. If you do purchase this laptop, I would DEFINITELY recommend adding additional ram (I got 8GB ram for 25 bucks at microcenter) since it is super easy to upgrade the ram in this computer, and it made a noticeable difference in browsing, loading, scroll speeds. If you have an additional 100 dollars more to spend, I would go ahead and purchase a more expensive laptop for a better screen, and the next price-tier laptops usually have additional ram.</span>

<span>This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.<br/><br/>Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.<br/><br/>The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.<br/><br/>The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.<br/><br/>This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.<br/><br/>Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.<br/><br/>Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.<br/><br/>Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.<br/><br/>The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.<br/><br/>I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.<br/><br/>The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.<br/><br/>This boots in about 15 seconds.<br/><br/>It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.<br/><br/>This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.<br/><br/>I can't sing the praises of this enough.<br/><br/>Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.<br/><br/>Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.<br/><br/>This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.</span>

<span>This is going to be a long and detailed review! Prior to purchasing this laptop, I did a tremendous amount of research so I know how important reviews are, as they helped me make my final decision. In order to help reviewers, I will say up front that I am not a gamer. I am a proofreader/copy editor, spend a lot of time on computers for internet research, including youtube work, and at any given time I have about 7-10 windows open and my computer is THEE primary source/focus of my work. I've had this Acer since mid-August. I waited to write my review in order to see how it performed for a couple of months, as some of the reviews I initially read did the same and I found that to be really helpful.<br/><br/>My 12-year-old SONY Vaio "died" this summer and I found myself in a position of needing a new laptop but also needing to be really budget conscious due to COVID job constraints. I read over 131 Amazon reviews of this Acer, read two other independent consumer review sites (PC Magazine, Tech World), and asked some tech people in my world what they thought.  This laptop came out in the top three for quality for the price. The price was $359 when I put it in my cart. I waited ONE MORE DAY and that was ONE DAY TOO LONG and by the next day, the laptop was no longer available by Amazon, only from independent Marketplace sellers. I contacted Amazon who could not tell me when/if the Acer would be in stock again. The NEXT day, I read that the Acer would NOT be restocked by Amazon. So I didn't wait and bought it from the Marketplace for $460. Grr.... BUT!!! I am TOALLY PLEASED and happy that I got it when I did. Please note that this Acer IS back on Amazon and you can buy it for less. What a deal.<br/><br/>The advice of many reviewers was perfect for my set up. I actually took notes and in the end, set up was incredibly simple and pain-free, and performance has been fantastic. I literally have NO complaints.<br/><br/>Based on reviews, I purchased an extra 4G memory stick. ($20) Know what? I still haven't installed it!! I keep forgetting. AND IT HASN'T MADE A DIFFERENCE. To that end, based on reviews, I decided that I would purchase additonal hard drive, but I haven't gotten around to that. Honestly, I may not purchase it at all because I have an external hard drive and I have cloud space. I'm content with knowing that I have the option if I want to purchase more hard drive space if I want. So I have NOT yet had the experience of removing the back of the laptop to install more memory or hard drive. There are plenty of youtube vids that will guide you through the process should you need to do this and I will install the additional memory. Maybe after writing this.<br/><br/>Almost no one wants "S" mode. There are a few protocols for switching out of "S" mode. Here's what I did: I plugged the laptop in, and it began set up. VERY QUICK SET UP. It will automatically be in "S" mode: 1. open settings 2. go to "update &amp; security" 3. In the "switch to" win home or win pro section, select "go to store." If you see "update your edition of windows" section, do NOT click the "go to store" that appears there. 4. Once in the store, you should see a "switch out of S mode" or some kind of similar message. Select "get". You should get a confirmation message that you've been switched out. SIMPLE and QUICK procedure. I read that some people had trouble with this, but it was a snap for me.<br/><br/>List of what I did in total:<br/>1. Took out of box, plugged it in. Set up began.<br/>2. Got out of "S" mode.<br/>3. Got rid of a lot of bloatware.<br/>4. Downloaded Google Chrome.<br/>5. Downloaded Avast Premium Security<br/>6. Downloaded Office 365<br/>7. Downloaded iTunes<br/><br/>Even with all of that, this computer is FAST and as mentioned, I still haven't added additional memory.<br/><br/>Powering up/down takes seconds. SECONDS.<br/>Navigation is super fast.<br/><br/>The computer itself feels solid and I haven't experienced anything with the touchpad that feels chincy or flimsy, as some reviewers noted. . I know what some reviews mean by the bottom corners of the touch pad feeling 'loose'. What it is, is that there are no 'buttons' on the touchpad for "left or right mouse" and the lower corners are a tad "floaty", as they need to be able to depress independently. I don't use the touchpad a lot, I prefer a desktop mouse, so this doesn't matter to me.<br/><br/>The keyboard backlight is great and I've checked with Acer and there's no way to extend the length of time it stays on. It stays on for about 30 secs. This is not an issue for me, as it's on long enough for me to orient myself on the keyboard if it's dark, and then I'm good to go. When typing steadily, the keyboard stays on steadily. Note: one of my cats walked across the keyboard and 'turned off' the backlight. I found that by hitting "FN + F8" and holding for 10 secs, you can turn the backlight back on.<br/><br/>I LOVE the keyboard. The keyboard feels both solid and smooth. I'm a typist so the "feel" of a keyboard and typing is very important to me. My fingers fly over this keyboard! The letters appearing as I type appear to be flowing as words form.<br/><br/>The little numeric pad to the right is great. Yes, the keys are a little smaller, so larger fingers may not care for this, but it's great when doing a lot of numeric work. I also love that the "backspace" button is larger- not like some keyboards I've had when it's the same size as a letter key.<br/><br/>Odd that there's no light showing "Caps Lock On"- other reviewers have noted this. Nor is there a "Num Lock" light, but that doesn't really interfere with my work. It just takes a moment to figure out what's going on if I accidentally leave the Caps Lock on.<br/><br/>The power button isn't a hard press button like I've been used to. It's a "key", which is interesting.<br/><br/>The sound is a big topic on reviews. I've found the sound to be a little low on volume, but it's been ok for youtube vids. Plus, I like using headphones, which make this a non-issue. I've examined the sound settings and done what reviewers have suggested to augment the sound. One reviewer spoke of switching from "music" to "gaming" mode to increase overall volume, but I haven't even found the setting to do that. No matter, I'm ok with the way it is.<br/><br/>The picture/screen is fantastic. Clear and sharp!<br/><br/>USB ports-- there are enough for me. I will be purchasing a dvd reader/writer, as this laptop does not have that feature, which makes it lighter and slimmer. In researching dvd drives, I've found highly reviewed ones for around $20. Very reasonable.<br/><br/>I have NOT tested battery life yet. I generally keep the laptop in one spot and keep it plugged in. Also, the battery in my SONY Vaio died 2 yrs into owning it and I never replaced it so I'm not even used to moving my laptop around and using a battery. The one time I DID bring this laptop into another room, the battery lasted at least the four hours I had the laptop open.<br/><br/>All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this laptop. I've loaded it up and used it CONSTANTLY for two months, haven't installed extra memory yet, and it hasn't given me ONE SECOND of regret or "hmm" or concern. It looks great, it's fast, it's light weight, and it can be built up to serve your computer needs. Do NOT worry about "S" mode, that's an easy thing to let go of. I have no doubt this laptop will last me years and will serve my needs admirably. If anything else comes up as I continue to use it, I'll be sure to update my review! Despite paying more than what Amazon is currently selling it for, it was STILL a deal. I literally have no complaints at all. I recommend registering it and keeping note of Acer's toll free number in case you need support.<br/><br/>Good luck and enjoy! It's a great purchase!<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's nearly one year since I've been using this Acer laptop and I STILL love it. It has not given me one second of issue or regret. I ended up installing my additional memory after I posted my review but I haven't purchased additional hard drive. I've loaded a LOT more software and apps and it's still fast, crisp and spot on. One of the best purchases ever!</span>

<span>I had and used this computer for almost a week.  It does works great and very nice to type on as I am a touch typist (meaning I don’t need to look at the keys as I use the keyboard).  The keys are nicely spaced apart even if it is just a 14 inches screen sized computer.  I did not miss the other larger sized models as this is just fine for the type of activities I like to indulge in with a personal computer or other electronic devices.<br/><br/>The track pad is very sensitive (although I personally prefer to use a “old fashioned” wired USB Mouse and the newest  Touchscreen option over the track pad).  I like the SSD storage over the old fashion magnetic one.  I been using the tiny USB flash drives for ages and prefer to store my resulting computer files locally on these than stuffing up my internal storage full for long term storage.  Flash drives are still far more cheaper and portable even today.  I like lots of options.<br/><br/> Which brings me to the cons of my new purchase.  The instructions which came with this computer is the worst that I ever used.  The print is way too tiny for even someone with good eyesight to read!  I am not sure where the HMDI Port is (although I do think it’s there-somewhere!)  I studied all the keys and there no place to put your finger to be read.  So I have to completely rely on my PIN to physicially in real time protect my computer and files from unauthorized users.  I prefer to have at least 2 levels of protection like the fingerprint reader AND the PIN.  Even my under 200 dollar smartphone has these options built right in!<br/><br/>Look at this list below copy/pasted from Amazon own webpage of this computer:<br/><br/>1x Headphone-out &amp; Audio-in Combo Jack; 1x Built-in HD webcam with microphone; 1x Built-in fingerprint reader; 1x Built-in media reader for simple photo transfer; 1x RJ45 LAN Jack for LAN insert; 1x HDMI 1.4b 4K Output; 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C; 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A. 12.75 x 8.89 x 0.78 in (323.85 x 225.81 x 19.81 mm), 3.25 lbs. (1.47 kg)…....”<br/><br/>I could not find the HMDI Output port  Where is it? Worst of all there could never be a LAN (Ethernet) port built in these more modern ultra skinny laptops. Why was something so obviously inaccurate stated as such on Amazon?  I had to go online somewhere else to find this out!  I paid good money for features that could not or would not ever be on this product?  Or pay extra for adaptors?  And the color was not the same pictured on the webpage.  I was sent a completely silver one, rather than a blackish one.  What’s up with this?<br/><br/> I decided to simply cut my losses and move on.  From what I read on some of these reviews, I luckily gotten away with a product that works at least for now.  The features that are extremely vital to me at least are present on the product so I can live with this purchase, though still a bit disappointed, and  feel a bit, well, cheated.  As you can see below also from their own Amazon webpage:<br/><br/> AMD Ryzen 3 3200U Processor (2.60 GHz base clock, up to 3.50 GHz max boost clock, 4 MB Cache, 2 Cores) Smart dual-core, four-way processing performance for HD-quality computing<br/><br/>14" Touchscreen, typical 1366 x 768 HD resolution. Natural finger-touch navigation makes the most of Windows 10. Energy-efficient LED backlight screen<br/><br/>DDR4 2400 MHz RAM Memory with Solid State Drive (SSD) combo brings the muscle for gaming, creating, and advanced multitasking, so you can do it all, anywhere. To smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once<br/><br/>So it’s not a complete let down, or worse, a huge disaster.</span>

<span>I use the computer for basic things like social media, email, and online board games.  It generally serves that function well.  The battery life is solid.  It was my first time getting a touch screen LED rather than an LCD and I was somewhat disappointed in the image clarity vs an LED, but if you value a touchscreen, it could be worth that tradeoff.  My main frustration is with the hardware.  About 1-2 months after getting the computer, one of the two rubber traction strips at the bottom peeled half off.  Its attached by adhesive, so there is no way to reattach it.  I eventually had to peel it off entirely or else there would just be an 8 inch long piece of rubber hanging off the computer.  Now 2.5 months after getting it the second strip is having the same problem and is falling off.  The computer gets very hot and I think this may have caused this problem. But it feels like they should have designed it so that the friction strips don't come off in the first 1-3 months.</span>

<span>I am a super cautious person when it comes to purchasing more expensive items (even if $450 isn't a lot for a laptop), especially being in college when money is tight. I did a ton of researching into cheaper laptops and compared that to what I needed to upgrade from my previous one till now.<br/><br/>That being said, I absolutely love this laptop. It's a lot faster than I was expecting and runs very smoothly and is also pretty quiet . I found it super easy to set up and use (mine did not come in windows 10s mode, so that was an added plus). It is able to handle games decently as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I am so happy I decided to choose this laptop and would highly recommend to anyone looking for something in the lower price range without skimping on quality!</span>

<span>I really like this Chromebook so far. Only disappointment, which may not be a big deal to some but, it's the wrong color. I specifically ordered white for a reason and it came in black. Big deal? Worth the hassle of the return? Not really but I am disappointed none the less. Hopefully the item itself makes up for it being the wrong color ;)</span>
