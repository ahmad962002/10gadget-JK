Immersive sound comes alive from all directions (including overhead!) with these Dolby Atoms enabled speakers. Add them to any monitor or tower speaker or use as surround speakers for a hemisphere of rich, detailed sound. Our exclusive Tractrix horn technology delivers the power, detail and emotion of the live music experience with the Cleanest, most natural sound possible. The exclusive linear travel suspension (lets) minimizes distortion for enhanced, detailed performances. Kapton is an extremely light and rigid material used in the tweeter suspension to provide high efficiency and improve resolution and detail. Let’s tweeters are a hallmark of Klipsch speakers, making it a core component of some of the best speakers in the world. Injection molded graphite (img) woofer cones are exceptionally light while being extremely rigid - providing remarkable low frequency response, with minimal cone breakup and distortion. When paired with the Tractrix horn-loaded lets tweeter, it provides speaker efficiency highest in its class. Exposed fasteners and low profile magnetic grilles give the speakers a polished, modern appearance. Stylish aesthetic with absolute durability that results in a seamless integration into any decor. Reinforced MDF construction reduces cabinet vibration for less audible coloration and improved sonic accuracy.

<span>Added a pair to up my Marantz SR50515 and they sound great. Currently, I  have them placed on top of my entertainment unit as I have vaulted ceilings and may eventually opt to mount them instead. In order to hear them, I had to turn up the settings on my AVR, and depending upon your room (and room correction EQ) you may have to play with your setup as well. My gripe is the price as $199-$250 seems fair but not $500+. My advice look for these on sale.</span>

<span>For my use case, I really only wanted to connect a record player. This system is pretty ideal for low count/simple connections. As a bonus in my case, not only was I able to use the RCA input section for the turntable, but I was also able to utilize the digital optical input for my TV which gave me some freedom to retire the soundbar which had previously handled the sound duties for these two devices.<br/>For the first week, I was really not impressed with these speakers. If anyone tries to tell you that speaker break in periods aren't real, then let them try to sell you a national monument, too. After using them for about 3 hours a day over the period of a week, I can hear a solid difference in overall tone. They went from considering a return, to a phenomenal audio experience by the end of that week. They're also pretty directional the way that I have them set up, so listening position matters in smaller spaces.<br/>I paired these with a 12" wireless Klipsch sub that I got from Costco. The speakers alone actually provide a decent amount of bass, but adding that in rounded out the thump of the bass drums.<br/>This system is for you if you don't have a lot of components, and you're looking to save on shelf space. They have PLENTY of headroom, and I'm pretty sure I've ticked off the neighbors a few times. On the downside, there's no EQ options at all, other than raising and lowering the volume on the sub... and I thought this would be a concern I'd have going forward (especially on day one), but I don't seem to mind it so much, now.<br/>From what I understand, this is a discontinued system, so if you're on the fence, I'd recommend pulling the trigger. I'm pretty happy I did.</span>

<span>I figured I would write a thorough review of these since the sole reviewer above decided not to answer other’s questions.  I have an open floor plan living room with 14’ ceilings. The room is not terribly large but about 20x18’ or so, square dimensions. But since the first floor plan is open, small monitor speakers would not fill the room. I had Klipsch The Sixes prior to these and although beautiful, part of their heritage series, the 6.5” mid/woofer struggled a bit. I have these paired to a Polk Audio 12” 300 watt powered subwoofer which I think is overkill. Unless you have a home theater in a much larger space like a basement, a subwoofer, even for movies, is not necessary. The dual 8” drivers have just enough  oomph in the bottom end , tight and precise. I feel this will be adequate for all but the most electronic or movie buff bass heads out there. My walls shake even with the subwoofer off. The tweeter handles only high frequencies, not midrange. The sound has the characteristic Klipsch horn sound and can be a little fatiguing at high volumes, which is easy to achieve with such efficiency. These are biamped with a virtually distortion free output and flat frequency response. They sound ultra noise free, even at high volume.  The driver frequencies are seamless, impressive at this price point.  They are very musical if a bit strident at high output but they sound terrific and full at lower volumes. I would’ve paid $1500 for the pair but at $899, nothing can touch them. Yes, the Elac towers are more refined and laid back but if it’s rock concert levels or movie theater bliss you’re looking for, look no further. I would’ve gotten the Elacs but couldn’t justify separate components. These have 130 watts per channel on tap and a Class D digital amplifier, crossover, and equalizer precisely matched to driver output.  The result is a very clean and open sound with little distortion. I’m not an audiophile and rarely listen to FLAC or other hi resolution formats because to my ears, I can’t appreciate the difference. I stream through Bluetooth or connected via USB to my computer, bypassing the inferior sound card. With average mp3s like on iTunes or Pandora streaming, I’m satisfied. Again, if you’re a golden ear nerd, get the Elacs but you’re looking at north of $2k with separates. In my opinion, you will not be disappointed. I only had a minor quibble—-when I carefully unpacked them, one of the speakers had a slight dog eared defect on the corner of the vinyl finish. I painted over it but it wasn’t worth returning these as they are more than 50 lbs each. Speaking of the finish, it’s not furniture grade like the Heritage series. But it is very modern and classy looking and the copper woofers really pop against the black.  They are solidly braced internally when you tap on them to reduce distortion and standing waves. The feet are removable but I find it makes the speakers stable on my plush carpet. Bottom line, unless you’re a super wealthy audiophile looking to reproduce the highest fidelity and have the money to do so, these are hard to beat</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>We ended up sending these back because of two major issues.<br/>1. Although it will "connect" to your TV via bluetooth, it seems to be one-way only. You can't actually have your TV audio play through the speaker unless you use a physical cable. That was really frustrating as I specifically ordered these bluetooth-enabled ones to avoid having to do so.<br/>2. Holy cow, these things are gigantic. I knew they were big when I ordered them but, honestly, seeing them in person is a whole other experience. These things will eat a ton of space so just be weary of that.<br/>3. Although this wasn't a factor in the decision to return, it's important to note that you're going to want to CALL THE SELLER for a return label. the one provided by Amazon says "1 of 1" but there are two separate boxes, each of which need a separate label. We learned that the hard way.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I still think it's worthy of at least 3 stars because the price is great and the build quality seems solid. I didn't really get the opportunity to test the audio very much but it sounded okay for what it was. It's got decent, rich audio with deep tones but you definitely shouldn't expect to offset the need for a sub-woofer.</span>

<span>I was looking for a large-format pair of powered speakers and these seem to check off all the boxes for me:<br/><br/>[X] Reputable Manufacturer<br/>[X] Built-In High-Power Amp<br/>[X] Bluetooth Connectivity<br/>[X] Large format, high-power speakers appropriate for a larger room.<br/><br/>These things sound great and really provided a well-rounded sound, especially when paired with a Klipsch powered 12" sub.  However, the pair I received did not operate fully as intended.  The LED display panel did not function, and the right channel would drop out intermittently while using the phono input.<br/><br/>I repackaged the speakers and sent them directly to the seller, Adorama.  I am happy to report that Adorama issued me a full refund within a few short business days.<br/><br/>As an aside, I do want to mention that Amazon's description on their website states that these speakers "Are NOT Discontinued By Manufacturer."  If you visit Adorama's website, it correctly discloses that they are selling the speakers as a closeout item.  A visit to Klipsch's customer service page of their website confirms that these are indeed a discontinued item.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  I am very impressed with the customer service provided by Adorama and I hope that I have an opportunity to patronize them in the future.</span>

<span>First off, I'm a very old guy, and I wear hearing aids. (So, technically, I hear as well as you do. And, apparently, a lot better than some reviewers.) I'm coming from an ancient set of Cambridge Soundworks Ensemble speakers, and I think speaker technology has really improved over the past forty years. These Klipsches are easy to set up, and sound great. I'm happy. (I listen to a lot of Mozart, the soundtrack to Northern Exposure and Bach.)</span>

<span>B200.  First pair of Klipsch I ever purchased.  Liked them so much, I bought 5 more pairs, 2 more pairs of just of this b200, plus another same size, better pair of 5.5 inch bookshelf with the titanium tweeters(RB51bll,) plus a 10 inch sub and also a tower set of their Reference Premier line with the dual 8 inch woofers and titanium tweeters.<br/>So far, in the past 4 months, I spent about 3k on Klipsch speakers.<br/>The pair of reference premier dual 8 inch woofers had a bad crossover out of the box.  The seller I purchased from here on Amazon, immediately sent a replacement, which is still working, thank you.<br/>I noticed one day a on my original b200 pair, a woofer was not moving, like the other channel.  I put my ear to it and it was dead.  Tried other speakers on that channel ruling out the pioneer elite receiver, no problems.<br/>I contacted Klipsch tech support, only an automated response a week later saying they had high volume and apologize for my delayed response.  Then a month or so later, after I ordered 2 more pairs directly from Klipsch, I get another automated response, "Can you please review your recent purchase?"<br/>Nothing from my dead woofer.  No reply for me asking for help.<br/>Finally about 2 months later, an actual human replies in an email, apologizing for the very late response.  He asks for my address, email and phone number and copies of my reciept.<br/>I have a Homeland security clearance and regulations to follow, including not carrying personal electronics in the field.<br/>So I send 2 screenshots of my Amazon prime reciept with all my contact info, except my phone number.<br/>My response, from Klipsch, yesterday, going on 3 months of not having a working speaker was, "can you please provide you phone number? "<br/>They may sound good.  The b200 speaker that had the woofer stop working, never sounded distorted or unclear.  In fact, it always sounded great.  But it failed.<br/>Bottom line, they sound great when working, but if you buy anything from Klipsch, have backups. Out of the 6 pairs I've purchased in the past few months, 2 speakers had bad crossovers.  I would have been okay with that, had they replaced them in a timely manner.<br/>Update 1/27/2022<br/>I was frustrated and gave up on recieving help with my speaker and ordered a different brand pair.<br/>I get another box in the mail a couple weeks ago and it's a brand new crossover from Klipsch!  They sent it to me after I already wrote them off and stopped checking my email.  I installed it and my little b200 is sounding great again!<br/>It took a while to get my speaker back up and running but am a happy customer again.<br/>When a person or company does me wrong, I write them off for good.  I'm glad Klipsch made good on the warranty because I love their speakers.  Not only does this little speaker sound fantastic, especially at this price range but the copper woofers are beautiful.  I push them to the limit and only back off when I notice even the slightest distortion.  They don't seem to fatigue and I'm pushing my 90 wpc receiver to 75%... sometimes more with a few drinks!  Anyway these b200 take almost everything I throw at them, unlike the new pair from a different USA brand, rated 175w continuous, 300w peak.  Without ever distorting, the other brands each blew within a couple months of each other.<br/>I  appreciate Klipsch correcting my issue and my faith has been renewed in their company.<br/>I'm in the market for a few new higher end pairs and at least 2 more subs and they earned back my business.<br/>Good save Klipsch</span>

<span>These speakers are great. Nice crisp sound. Decent bass. The only downside is if you are on the sides of the speaker, you lose a lot of bass. Standing or sitting in front of them, they sound great. It is not a big deal cuz they are in the front of the room so I rarely move to the sides of the speakers, but they do sound far less impressive front the sides. Again, just a very minor observation, but I thought maybe someone might find it useful. Overall, I am blown away from the full sound these little guys pump out.</span>

With its UV-resistant ABS enclosure and aluminum grille and hardware, the Klipsch KHO-7 indoor/outdoor loudspeaker is designed to perform for years under the harshest of conditions. Available in a white finish, the paintable KHO-7 comes with a rustproof C-style mounting bracket and port plug, making installation quick and simple. Also, its 8-ohm impedance is compatible with all amplifiers. The Klipsch KHO-7 speaker produces brilliant, lifelike sound through its 5.25" poly cone woofer and a 1" silk dome tweeter loaded with an exclusive Klipsch Tractrix(R) Horn. This advanced horn design dramatically increases efficiency and allows the loudspeaker to produce more output using less energy. When it comes to an all-weather loudspeaker, no quality is more respected—or more desired—than durability. The Klipsch KHO-7 indoor/outdoor loudspeaker delivers rain or shine.

<span>I am glad I looked over the reviews. I had purchased 4 sets of refurb units mostly because I was going to use this for a garage gym and wanted better audio quality and didn't care so much about appearance. I didn't need to worry about rusting or anything since they were going to be used indoors.<br/><br/>What I received was 7 almond colored fully functional speakers, and one white non-functional speaker. I am very happy with the sound quality of the 7 functional units I received. The one non-functional one basically was very muted and crackled when used. Fortunately I only needed 7 for a 7.1 surround system so I didn't bother returning the one non-functional speaker.</span>

<span>First off: outdoor speakers are not that easy to set up (unless someone has already run the speaker wire for you). This took some problem solving and I still had to go to plan #3. The sound of these are quite nice.  I had no expectations that these would be audiophile grade speakers, and they are not. They have some okay bass, but nothing that’s going to make your neighbors angry. The highs are a bit shouty, but a little tweaking with the treble and you’ll be fine. Buy an Aiyima T9 (Douk audio ST-1) and a cheap streamer (Amazon Echo Link or WiiM mini) and you’ll be listening to music outside in no time. That is, after you run your speaker wire. I like these speakers</span>

<span>The sound quality and build quality is exceptional at this price point. They also came with two 50' decent quality speaker cables, which I needed for the installation. The only issue is, they aren't exactly white to match the exterior walls they are mounted on. They are actually light almond or light beige in color. This isn't enough to knock of a star though. They look great and sound better.</span>

<span>We recently moved and our new entertainment room was smaller. I used these to replace aging Infinity surround speakers (24+ years old). They are reasonably priced and the sound quality is very good in our smaller, more open area. They were also much easier to mount since they are considerably smaller &amp; lighter. They do not drive the sound quite as well at the higher volume levels when listening to music, but are great for our intended use of music and surround for the TV/DVD &amp; streaming. I would recommend these as long as you are not listening to Metallica and trying to shake the pictures off the wall (which you can still do if you add enough gain to the SW).</span>

<span>Liked the price.  But the the midrange was a bit too loud for my tastes. Not sure if this is just a typical Klipsch sound or not. But this speaker didn’t blend with my non-Klipsch side speakers.  So I returned it.  It might be perfect in an all Klipsch  surround sound set up. Difficult to say.</span>

Built with an elevation channel integrated into the top, the R-26FA Dolby Atmos floorstanding speaker not only delivers stereo sound towards the listener, but also reflects sound off the ceiling to deliver the immersive, overhead Dolby Atmos experience.

<span>Amazing sound. I replaced an older bose system with these. I bought a Sony dolby atmos receiver to connect them too.  Unbelievable for the price. I am no audiophile but I have had some pretty nice audio systems over the years. If you are looking for a value priced home theater speaker setup this is the way to go. Dolby atmos really fills the room with the sound when watching movies.</span>

<span>First time setting up a speaker system and it was easy. Speakers sound great. Paired it with a Sony dh790 receiver. Only issue is that I can't get the Atmos speakers to register that they exist on my receiver. I've run new wire and still goes into protection mode during auto calibration. Sounds great as a 5.1 otherwise. But if I'm all screwed up and someone knows a fix, let me know<br/><br/>Update: user error with the speakers. Had the banana plugs in the wrong spot for the top speakers. 100% worth it. Sound is amazing with Dolby compatible movies or anything really.</span>

<span>These are loads better than what I used to have and I’m happy with them. The subwoofer does a decent job but I wish the speakers had a little better bass response. My main knock is at high volumes it’s very obvious where the center speaker is (below the TV.) at low to moderate volumes things sound fine.</span>
