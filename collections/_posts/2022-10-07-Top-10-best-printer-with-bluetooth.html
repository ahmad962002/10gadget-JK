<span>Great for documents and shipping labels which is mostly what we use it for, photos are on the blurry side but no complains for a $90 printer, ink is fairly cheap. The included ink only lasted about 50-60 pages for us but the replacement ink has went longer. If you’re looking to print photos maybe upgrade.</span>

<span>Ok works well - the reviews talking about difficulty in keeping a connection are correct - it drops connectivity really easily and temperamental to get back<br/>That said it’s a good printer scanner to take on trips - the 250 with scanner is deeper and heavier so be aware of bulk<br/>Bought Carrying case - that’s strong padded and keeps power cables and spare cartridges safe<br/>More bulk and weight but keeps printer safe</span>

<span>Once set up this printer worked great.  Though in a rural area it was clunky to download the HP app due to very slow Internet access.  However, once done it worked great in terms of print quality.  And the size is tremendous when traveling.  I did order a travel case separately (found on Amazon) and that enhances an already great product.<br/><br/>The only disappointment was when I attempted to print 6" x 9" catalog envelopes.  It did not recognize the size and I could not get it to print a mail merge.  However, that may have been operator error.<br/><br/>When my sister visited she loved the size due to space constraints she has in her home and is thinking about purchasing it as well.  Wi-Fi printing is an added bonus.</span>

Whether you’re an avid traveler, social influencer, nostalgic scrapbooker or on-the-go photographer, one thing is certain—printing pictures takes too many steps! Now, with the KODAK Step Printer, printing full-color photographs is faster and easier than ever. Just pair with any Bluetooth- or NFC-enabled smart device, and stunning full-color photo prints are in your hand in under 60 seconds. ZINK Zero Ink technology eliminates the need for expensive inks, toners and ribbons, delivering cool 2”x3” photographs you can peel and stick to any surface. Photos come out clear, bright, colorful and covered with an extra layer of protective coating to prevent smudges, rips and water damage. The KODAK app also lets you customize photos far beyond the usual ‘flip’ and ‘rotate’ of your smartphone. Use our extensive editing tools to apply flattering filters, cutesy stickers, decorative frames and other personalized flair. User Guide:  *The quality of the pictures can depend on the lighting conditions where the picture was taken. This can affect the saturation of the image after it gets printed.  *To ensure that the color of the picture is accurate, make sure that the blue calibration sheet is inserted with the bar code facing down.  *The blue calibration sheet has a unique barcode that is specifically only for the paper pack that it came in. Make sure that you do not mix paper from different packs together.  *Allow the printer a few minutes to cool down between prints and have the photo papers in a cool and dry place.  *To establish a Bluetooth connection, make sure to move the printer and your mobile device close together. Bluetooth signals can be weaker at greater distances. If the printer is not connecting, turning Bluetooth off and on again may resolve the issue.  *If you are experiencing a paper jam with your camera, make sure to turn the printer off and on again. This should eject the paper out. Do not pull out the paper by hand.

<span>I got this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend and she loves it! Great printer and easy to use. And it even comes with some of the paper it uses. All you have to do is download the app to print them off. And you can use that app to edit the pictures and add borders and things like that. Great quality product.</span>

<span>Me and my fiancé ordered this so that guests can print their own photos at our wedding. After testing it out today I love it and am so glad we decided to buy it. It’s so simple to use, just download the app, turn it on and print away. And seeing the small wallet sized pictures of us and our son come out is so exciting.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish this device had was Wi-Fi compatibility so that we can print from it using other apps (we have a photo booth app we’re going to be using at the wedding) Currently it uses Bluetooth so to printing has to be done from the devices Kodak Step app.</span>

<span>Replaced a printer of a different brand over 10 years old. This printer is amazing. Can go directly from my phone to the printer. The app they suggested didn't work, I had to download a different Kodak app. Once that was done, it works fine now. I especially love the last swipe of the print where it puts a coating on the photos. My other printer didn't do that and photos blurred and dulled. These Kodak photos are holding up nicely and I have family photos on my refrigerator. They're exposed to sunlight (not directly) and are as bright and clear as the day I printed them. Lastly this printer and paper are more affordable than the printer I had to replace. It's a keeper.</span>

<span>Love this machine. I have 2 other brother label printers but this, by far, is my favorite. I love that we can do so much more than our other Brother label printers. Bigger sized labels and best of all its wireless.<br/><br/>One issue I had is I can't seem to get the printing tool to chain print, but maybe its because I'm on a mac. If you print a lot of labels like I do, this can be a huge waste. I'll need to find a solution as my PT-2730 will print the first label with some overlay and then exact label sizes for the remainder. With the P950Nw the first label has excess label, but each additional label afterwords also has a small bit of wasted label. I've tried many different ways to resolve this, but haven't figured it out. May not be such a big deal but I go through at least 1 cartridge a day. It adds up to a rather large amount of wasted label.<br/><br/>Overall this printer is awesome and I love it.</span>

<span>This mini printer is great. However is a little bit overpriced in my opinion and you need to install its software to use it. But it comes with a USB stick that has the files and Bluetooth which is a great feature</span>

<h3><h3>Are there printers that use Bluetooth?</h3></h3>
    

Yes, there are printers that use Bluetooth. One example is the HP ENVY 4520 e-all-in-one printer.
<h3><h3>Which is a better printer Wi-Fi or Bluetooth?</h3></h3>
    

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on individual preferences and needs. Some people might find that Bluetooth prints faster or more reliably than Wi-Fi, while others might prefer the greater range of Wi-Fi. Ultimately, it is up to the individual user to decide which is the better option for them.
