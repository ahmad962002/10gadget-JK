<span>Great noise canceling. Great warranty! Have two that I swap as battery lasts three days at a time!</span>

<span>They're not perfect. Sometimes the connectivity is wonky, sometimes a speaker will fail, but I can't fault them for eventual wear and tear. The warranty is solid and anytime I have claimed a failure, they just send another no questions asked. One pair might last me about two months. The most common failure is the earbuds themselves break down, and it's really difficult to replace them. I have like seven pairs in the basement because of this reason. I rarely claim the warranty because for what I get out of them. Having said that, if another company made the same product that was better and more durable, I would likely switch. I have tried a few other brands that were more expensive, and the sound quality was absolutely terrible. In my opinion, this company has the market, but rather than except what works with a throw away and replace policy, why not try to perfect it?</span>

<span>I've had these for a while now and I absolutely love them. The only downfall is one of the earbuds is broken. Makes a crackeling sound when I initially put it in my ear. I'm not one to return items so I just stuck with them. They're undoubtedly one of the most convenient headphones for the shop floor.<br/><br/>The only thing I would want to make clear to anyone wanting to buy these.. no matter the circumstances.. DO NOT.. and I repeat do not use any other cable to charge them. They do tell you in the pamphlet but I want to tell you from my experience as I did forget mine and I used a different cable for only 15 minutes and it basically killed them. I have figured out a pattern to continue to use them but they don't stay charged as nearly as long as they originally did.</span>

<span>I work outside, on the ramp, at a major American East Coast airport. It's as noisy as you can imagine. I carry two radios for communicating with two different business partners, plus I need to be able to take phone calls from either, at any moment. The phone calls were the main issue, until I bought these.<br/><br/>They offer true -27dB noise reduction. I have tested them literally side by side, these in one ear and OSHA approved ear plugs in the other and these live up to their advertised noise reduction capabilities.<br/><br/>I don't listen to music on the ramp but will say that the sound quality for receiving calls is very good and I've never had anyone experience problems understanding me, even while standing within 20' of a 737 revving up its engines preparatory to departure. That said, I've worn them while listening to music on my riding mower, twice now, and the sound quality is decent, not audiophile quality but more than capable of handling any streaming music service or downloaded mp3 files without distortion.<br/><br/>Battery life is beyond expectations. I was thinking 2, maybe three days at the most. After 7, 12-hour shifts, I was only down to 60%. Remember, I only used these for taking calls while at work plus maybe 2 hours total while mowing the lawn. They will shut down on standby, which I only experienced once. Anyway, the battery life is nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>Edit: I have started listening to music during some of my shifts. Battery life is still remarkable and the music quality is decent.<br/><br/>As far as comfort goes, I'm not a big fan of this style of ear plugs. They tend to hurt to my ear canals, I prefer foam plugs that can be rolled into a tight cylinder that expands into the ear canal.<br/><br/>These became...uncomfortable...after about the 8th or 9th hour of wear? Not painful, just not...no longer noticeable...like I wanted to remove them but didn't feel I had to? Sort of weird, I know. My solution after a couple of days was just to take them out for a while during a slow period on my shift. Problem solved!<br/><br/>Elgin makes a variety of Bluetooth-enabled hearing products. I chose these as being the cheapest "risk" and I am very happy with my choice. Give Elgin and its products a close look, and if you purchase I think you'll probably be quite satisfied, as am I.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>These are really amazing wireless earbuds. I'm gonna do pros and cons along with some other thoughts about this product. This review is written 4 months after using this product.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Battery life. The battery life is amazing. I never had these die on me except when I play video games all night. They also have fast charging which is very useful if you need to charge them real quick.<br/>2. Fit. The fit is really perfect. They feel comfortable and they stay in my ears perfectly. I exercise a lot and these earbuds always stay in my ears when I'm at the gym and when I'm running. If you are looking for some workout earbuds, then these will give you reliable and beautiful performance.<br/>3. Sound quality. The sound quality is amazing. Nice, clear and crisp.<br/>4. The Apple features. The extra features that the Powerbeats have when using with apple devices are nice but don't let those features discourage you android users from buying the Powerbeats. The features aren't important enough for you to decide not to buy them (Not gonna list out the features in order to make this review shorter)<br/>5. Range. The range is amazing. I can be listening to music on my phone and leave my phone in my room and walk anywhere in the house and still be able to listen to the music. The music starts cutting out depending on the amount of objects blocking the signal.<br/>6. Ability to wear with glasses. I can wear these with my glasses with no problem at all. I can take my glasses on and off and have no trouble.<br/>7. Good microphone. I use these earbuds for phone calls and video calls and the person can hear me pretty good. I can hear them perfectly fine. My brother tells me that I sound muffled but he can still hear me good.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. Pain. After wearing them for a couple of hours, I start to feel slight discomfort. This only happens after many hours so it isn't something i'm complaining about. Just felt like I should mention it so everyone is aware. The pain that is the problem is the major pain that comes after weeks of regular use. I'm not sure what is happening but it's like the Powerbeats is making the skin inside my ear peel off. I think this is happening because they are too tight in my ears. This has happened I believe 3 times and the goes away after I left my ears heal. As i'm writing this review, I am experiencing the major pain and I adjusted the left earhook so it's not as tight in my ear as before (Problem is currently only in my left ear). I'm not sure if I'm the only one who experiences this but if you can deal with this then don't let that discourage you from buying the Powerbeats (It isn't that big of a problem for me).<br/>2. Bluetooth connection on Windows 10 computers. I'm not sure if this also happens on other versions of Windows and android devices but sometimes there would randomly be a 1-2 second cut in the sound about every two minutes. This doesn't happen at all on my iPhone. I would also experience random disconnections on my laptop. Another thing about the connection is that it is weaker on my laptop than on my phone. Not sure why.<br/>3. Bulky case. This doesn't matter to me at all because I usually have a bag that I carry with me when I go to places that I can slip the case into. I'm just mentioning it so people can be aware. You can put it in your pocket if you want but it will look weird because there will be a giant bulge in your pants.<br/><br/>That's it about the pros and cons. Now it's time to talk about the problems I had with the Powerbeats. I'm having flashbacks of the problems I encountered while typing this part of the review. Problem 1. This only happened once but I will still talk about it. I was connecting the Powerbeats to my iPhone and forgetting them in the bluetooth settings because I was enjoying the animation that pops up when you pair them with your iPhone. Then all of a sudden they would not pair again. Man I thought they were already broken and it was the day I got them. I thought my $200 dollars went down the drain. But luckily I managed to get them to pair again after a long time of research and trying different things. What fixed the problem was charging the case because apparently since it was at I believe 30 something percent, it couldn't pair. Problem 2. This was the worst problem. I've had this problem happen twice in the last month and a half. One of the earbuds would not pair and sound would only come out of the earbud that was paired. I had to switch back to my other pair of wireless earbuds that I previously had until I figured out how to solve this problem. It took days of extensive research and multiple solution attempts before I finally managed to fix the problem. I was about to return them but luckily I solved the problem before I did.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Despite the cons and problems I encountered, I would still recommend these earbuds to anyone. If you encounter any of the problems I did, I hope you can easily solve them and if you don't, you can reply to my comment and ask me for my solution. Hopefully Amazon has a feature where you get notifications when someone replies to your review. If you read this whole thing, thank you and I appreciate it. If you didn't then thanks for taking a look at it.<br/>Update: I no longer experience the major pain in my ears and the skin peeling off after I adjusted the earhooks to get the right fit (Update written on 8/18/21).</span>

<span>Thoroughly impressed with this product. For years I have avoided mainstream electronic brands like Beats, but now I am a believer. These things just work. They way that they're supposed to. 90% of the time, which is good enough for me. I have used wireless earbuds from other brands, like JBL, Sony, LG etc but none lasted very long or if they did, they did not work correctly most of the time. All had issues like connectivity, battery life, being plugged in but not charging for whatever reason.. issues of which do not exist with these buds. I was fed up and went back to wired earbuds for awhile.. until I "upgraded" to smartphone with no audio jack. I got these specifically because they have a loop that goes around the earlobe so it can never fall out. This was important to me since I am a cyclist and bike for long distances at times, so need something that will stay in my ears. The audio is good enough for most people. Not quite audiophile level, but im sure they do not expect that from Beats. Strong bass, crisp mids. Works very well for phone calls and people can usually hear what im saying, and I can hear them.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish I could change is the size of the case, its kind of big and bulky. if it was half the size that would be more ideal, especially for traveling, but honestly cant complain since the case actually charges the buds a number of times (not sure how many), and once they are full the battery can last all day long. Get them !! They are worth the money</span>

<span>These have some incredible battery life. Also the sound is excellent. Sometimes i do wish the sound would be louder to hear voices on movies, but it defintiely is sufficient. I like the different sizes that comes with to fit your ear properly and that the headphones magnetically snap into place in the case. Best part? They dont fall off when working out - Earbuds without fail always fall out when I'm at the gym - these don't! Some of the other reviews do have credence when they say your ear gets sore when wearing them for long periods of time. I find this to be true, but what pair of headphones does this not happen with? Honestly, these headphones are great - im very happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.<br/>I'd give these a "4 1/2 stars out of five"<br/><br/>On the good side:<br/><br/>1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone.  I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want.  Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional.  But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/>2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.<br/><br/>3)  As for the fit:  these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out).  The fit is perfect.  (See my notes further down for the "comfort")<br/><br/>4) I've rarely had problems pairing.  I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone.  I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.<br/><br/>OK, the "not so good" side:<br/><br/>1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.<br/><br/>2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life).  You "can" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.<br/><br/>3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure.  Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.<br/><br/>Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears "breathe".<br/><br/>Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5.  The three things I mentioned are not "deal breakers" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours.  As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Also, there is no ANC.  Yes, there's "noise reduction" but not cancellation.  I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC.  However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.<br/><br/>So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them.  I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking).  I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.<br/><br/>I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if "the grass is greener" with another set.  I have to be honest, after buying these,  my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.<br/><br/>Most reviews I've read are positive on this product.  Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive.  I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.</span>

<span>I am an online K-12 teacher, not just due to COVID but I was already in this job for years before COVID! The past few years I have been using a wired MPOW brand mic/headset, and every single day I'd be aggravated by the end of the day with the cord tangling up, getting in my way, the headphones getting uncomfortable when having them on for 4-5 hours straight each day...etc.<br/><br/>I decided to buy this set over the summer because it was wireless and because it had great reviews. I've been back to work for a few weeks now and this headset is an absolute godsend. It works flawlessly. I personally think the sound quality of phone calls and online meetings is fantastic. If I listen to music with Spotify streaming from my computer, I think the sound quality is very good but it's not going to beat out like, $500 Bose noise cancelling headphones or something. I am very happy that I no longer have a cord to deal with that gets all tangled up. The ear cups do not bother me at all and fit perfectly right around my ears. I can wear these for hours upon hours without having to adjust or give my ears a break. I have zero issues with battery life and recharging these despite very heavy use every day.<br/><br/>The first reason I am taking a star off is that when I am using the mic and talking, sometimes the end of my sentences fade out. I am not sure why this is. but I have to make sure I keep the mouthpiece very close to my mouth so that students and coworkers can hear me if we are having a discussion. It's not a huge deal though, sometimes I just have to repeat myself.<br/><br/>The other reason I took off a star is that the USB to USB-C adapter that comes with these to attach the wireless piece for the headset to your computer is a cable that is unnecessarily long in my opinion. I ordered a USB to USB-C adapter here on Amazon that does not have a cable at all, it just plugs right into the USB port with the C port right on the other side for the headset wireless to go into - just a piece instead of a long plug/cable. That works so much better and looks much better visually too! It's hard to explain what I am talking about in words, but anyone who orders this headset will know what I mean once they open the package and see it. If your laptop has a USB-C to begin with, you won't even have to deal with this issue, but mine does not. :)</span>

<span>..unless you're hard pressed for a headset you can use on pc and your phone..<br/>bought em Feb of 21. Only bought because of the usb-c dongle thinking I'd use it with my phone for music. shoulda just got some beats. these are underpowered, very little bass. Head Strap has thin foam, you'll start to feel the plastic. the foam ear cups lack in any sorta sound deadening, not dense at all, letting sound spill both in and out. the detachable mic is nice cause it doesn't hold it's position well when tryna move it outta your way otherwise. battery life lasts all day, but has very annoying low power warning. I regret getting these instead of just a new pair of Logitech G533's. finally got tired of these and am looking for something new.</span>

<span>Have had these for about a month now and love them after downloading and configuring them with software.<br/><br/> At first I was ready to give these a 2 star rating. I was playing first person shooters and was having issues identifying which direction players were coming from and the sound was very muffled.  Audio was fine for watching videos, but not gaming.<br/><br/>After just about giving up I downloaded the Steele Series GG software and enabled the sonar feature which replicates spacial audio. After a bit of fiddling around with settings, I am extremely happy with the sound quality and direction audio.  My gameplay has improved dramatically since enabling this feature. They have some nice pre-built sound profiles for specific games. The Warzone one helped with the footstep audio.<br/><br/>Not sure how these compare with the more expensive models, but I’m happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>Full disclosure: I have *always* disliked earbuds but was encouraged by my most recent pair (a Sennheiser neckband), especially with foam pads. Hoping to become unburdened by wires, block out at least some of the volume of my crying baby, and have a decent time while gaming, I decided to give these a try. Well, back to the warehouse they go; I can't find an orientation that is comfortable from the start, let alone after even twenty minutes. I gave all three included tips a fair shot, too. This might be better once aftermarket tip manufacturers catch up (please, Comply!) but there's absolutely nothing yet.<br/><br/>Here are some other annoyances that wouldn't warrant a return on their own but should be addressed nonetheless:<br/>-The noise cancellation is bad. Like, I can't really tell a difference between it being on and off with the adaptive level being on. I could hear a *very* slight difference between max strength manually set and off, but nowhere near enough for me to be willing to sacrifice battery life for it.<br/>-The app isn't great. It's unresponsive (though that very well could be my ancient phone), but my biggest gripe is that I can't really customize the touch control profile much. I'd like to be able to assign a particular command to a particular action (e.g. one right tap plays/pauses, two right taps goes to the next song, one left tap changes ANC profiles, two left taps goes to the previous song, etc.) rather than choosing an overall "profile" for each ear and deal with that learning curve/unfortunate control scheme.<br/><br/>These are marketed toward gamers, and that does indeed fill a niche that was wide open beforehand: portable, wireless headphones where the latency isn't absolute trash. It'd have been nice to see aptX Low Latency on the standard Bluetooth connection, but the dedicated 2.4GHz connection is far and away better than that, anyway. I didn't do extensive testing of the latency for either (because I can't bear to have them in my ears for long), though my brief tests were promising: there wasn't any noticeable desync between audio and video when streaming from my phone, and I could play Crypt of the Necrodancer (albeit poorly, but that's 100% a me problem) on my Steam Deck with the dongle attached. That didn't detect the headphones immediately until I went into Desktop mode and manually chose it, but at least I didn't have to install any drivers or anything.<br/><br/>Overall, all of these things could likely be fixed with firmware/software updates and the inclusion of better tips, so I'm disappointed that I had to return them. Maybe I'll give the Quantum TWS v2 a shot.</span>

<span>I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:<br/><br/>Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.<br/>Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.<br/><br/>Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.<br/>Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.<br/>Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.<br/>Cons – Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.<br/><br/>Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.<br/>Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.<br/><br/>My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.</span>

<span>This is the first set of earbuds that actually stay in my ear with my piercings. I have a big conch piercing as well as both tragus and I have tried to shake the buds out. They're not budging and I don't have to constantly readjust them. This alone is enough for me to give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>I am super impressed with the sound quality. Listening to O Fortuna was an epic experience. Noise cancellation provides for a great isolating experience and transparency is a welcomed option as well. Listening while being aware of your surroundings is always important and these do the job as long as you don't raise music level above maybe 75%.  I haven't had it long enough to know how good the battery life is so I can't really speculate on that just yet but the ease of pairing actually shocked me.<br/><br/>I will say I'm not that fond of the casing. It feels a tad flimsy and it doesn't handle well. It is that type of material that could easily slip from your hand so I highly suggest a silicone case cover. Also, fitting the buds into the case is almost like playing Tetris to me. Figuring out the orientation it should go in as well as trying to get a good grip on it to remove it from the case can be somehow daunting.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. It was on sale for $89 so this was a steal for such a great product.</span>

<span>Sweet and short: These are great if your intent is to listen to music and block out the world. Get AirPod Pro's if you want to make phone calls or hear the things around you.<br/><br/>I had the AirPods pros before these and they were great. I'd argue that these sound just as good. I think I prefer the controls on these because you don't have to actually grab them, just a tap will do. Haven't used them for a phone call yet, but have been warned they dont sound as good on the other end as the AirPods do. The transparency mode is pretty terrible compared to the AirPods. It doesn't really let any more noise through than if they were just off altogether. Happy its USB-C, sad that it has no wireless charging, but it has better battery life than the AirPods.<br/><br/>Edit: Another feature I'm really going to miss from the Pro's is the ability to take one out and have the music pause, and resume when its put back. These will continue to play, and play through both, unless the unused one is in the case. Not a big deal, but a feature I will miss.</span>

<span>O.K. I never thought I'd own a pair of beats earbuds, bud I do. And I have to stay, they're not bad. There's a (alright, there's a few) caveats, but not enough for me to return them. The build is the typically spun hardened plastic, of a oddly shaped buds that interestingly fit near perfectly. The buds are tiny, compared to many other brands. As mentioned they're oddly shaped, by two (also an oval shaped flat surfaced which is used to control the buds) angular sides and a round ball in front, where the canal protrudes that you attach your tips. The fit isn't bad, and once sealed it doesn't move around, or fall out whilst doing certain activities. I use XL sized silicone tips. I find they work best for me, for almost every bud I've owned or tested over the years.<br/><br/>If the fit is too short, you can always use double, or even triple flange tips. Which I use on occasion. Depends on the buds I'm fitting in question. That extra length can help get the seal you need for the most optimal sound reproduction.  Throughout this year I have tried a plethora of buds. From Sony's XM3, to Audio Technica CKS5TW And Nuarl (I plan to get them again, when funds permit) N6Pro's , which I actually (they have a really good sound, rich luscious bass, sweet and engaging mids, and to top it off, a sparkling treble, not over the top, mind you) liked, but the buttons were a little finicky. As to why I returned them.<br/>The biggest, most prevalent issue I came across was that most of them didn't fit properly, at all. I could barely get the XM3's in, and keep them in. As with Shures Aionic, another I liked and wanted desperately<br/>them to work out. Because they sounded great. The Studio buds are not a problem. It takes me seconds to insert and position them in my ears. The only (again, there's more than one) detraction I have, is that the  buds are easy activate whilst attempting to insert them into your ears. For me it's not a deal breaker. Oh, I almost forgot an important issue. And that is with the battery life. They average a minimum three plus hours. Which is not that long. Then again, who spends more than three hours listening to stuff ? Well, I do. These are for nighttime use mostly. I use them when my roomy has gone to bed. So I need to get an average fours plus. One night I got close to 5 hours. Guess it depends on usage.  What else can I say, other to try for yourself. . At the least, you can return them if you're not happy, right. I'm using them now, as I do at nights.<br/><br/>I'm going to buy the Philips Fidelio T1's. I bought and had to return for a replacement. But the delivery person did not deliver them, when they came. Why, I don't.. But I became infuriated and cancelled the order. to buy at a later date. I loved the sound. They have a hybrid configuration of a DD and a BA. For those who don't know the abbreviations, it's dynamic driver, and balanced amature drivers. That's , cause sound is impressive. And the price on them now, is 155$ A drop of a 100$ A good deal to me, for a worthy set of buds. all I'm gonna say for now. But I am going to acquire them I'll be editing removing any errors. But for now, enjoy. Hope it can help you decide</span>

Bose Sport Earbuds are designed to energize your exercise with acclaimed lifelike sound and a comfortable secure fit. Get ready to beat your personal best, again and again. Bose patented acoustic port design and premium, high-efficiency drivers combine to deliver big sound from a small acoustic package. Bose signature Volume-Optimized Active EQ automatically adjusts the bass, midrange, and treble based on how loud or soft you play your music. And Bose new StayHear Max tips create an airtight seal with your ear canal — critical for hearing the deep low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and for blocking the ambient noise around you so you can focus on your music and your workout. Bose Sport Earbuds come with three sizes of StayHear Max tips, so you can find the right fit for you. Every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep your Bose Sport Earbuds securely in place — without need of an ear hook — no matter how much you shake your head or jump up and down.Bose Sport Earbuds go through rigorous quality testing for durability. They’re also rated IPX4 for water resistance, which means they’re protected against sweat and light rain. The electronics inside are wrapped in special materials that protect them from moisture, so your earbuds stay in top shape, just like you. Bose Sport Earbuds feature a capacitive touch interface. On the right Earbud, tap to play or pause music and to answer calls. And on the left Earbud, double-tap to engage a Shortcut function of your choice like checking your battery level. If you get a phone call, instead of interrupting your workout, simply tap the right Earbud or press and hold it to reject. If you answer, you’ll hear the call clearly in both ears. Meanwhile, your caller will hear you clearly, too — thanks to the beam forming microphone array that separates your voice from surrounding noise.Bose Sport Earbuds provide up to 5 hours of battery life per charge. They’re charged by placing them in the included charging case. If the case is charged, it will automatically charge the earbuds. The status lights on each Earbud will pulse white, while they charge before turning solid white and then off when fully charged. When the case is fully charged, it can provide a 15-minute quick charge for up to 2 more hours or two full charges for up to 10 more hours.Bose Sport Earbuds offer complete freedom of movement. As long as you’re within 30 feet (9 meters) of your device, you’ll hear whatever you’re playing. And with Bose custom-designed antennas hidden inside each Earbud, dropouts are rare.Bose Sport Earbuds connect to the free Bose Music app, which lets you name your earbuds, set the controls the way you like them, check your battery, and more.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Update (10-29-21)<br/>I have made the decision to keep these and highly recommend to those looking for fit, comfort and sound quality. If you have the sound quality issue I had in the original review you could always return them.<br/><br/>Look, controls and app are kind of primitive, in fact once set up I deleted the app.<br/>However, the Sound can not be beat and this is what its about, sound quality. Now lets take this one step further, remember these are "work out buds" ?<br/>Well, let me say that they are comfortable as heck and the ear pieces that come with them are quite unique so no matter what you do you will always have a good seal and they will stay in your ear!<br/><br/>Long story short, I would highly recommend these to anyone, whether they want sport buds or not.<br/>The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 are the way the controls work (but you will get the hang of them) and the primitive app (which I dont really much care about)<br/><br/>If you want something smaller check out the Jaybird Vista 2, great buds too, just different ways.<br/>I am enjoying the sound of these Bose.<br/><br/>Update (10-25-21)<br/>I have seen some reports on the same issue I have been experiencing, I can not confirm this but its possible the sound quality takes a dive after the firmware update which when you download the app you are forced to do.<br/>Some have reported what I have experienced. (KEEP in mind at first I heard great sound then it went bad so returned them and got another and still have issues, sometimes good sound and other times bad.)  Out of the blue the earbuds sound quality becomes so compressed that some speculate phone compression in the earbud is being activated when listening to music. I have no idea if this is the issue and no experience in this area but it does seem plausible, for some reason the sound becomes warm and flat, void of upper midrange and treble.<br/>Anyway, some people said their solution would be to put the earbuds back in the charging case and then remove right away and replace them back in your ears. They say this fixes it. I dont know if this is true but I have tried it and I do know right now they are working great, the only thing is I cant confirm that placing them back in the case and removing is the reason.<br/>Anyway, what I have now is that "Bose" sound back and very satisfying I removed the app from my phone and using them without the app. I figured I would try them out this way for a while before considering returning them.<br/>I suppose a call to tech support could help, maybe they are aware the firmware update is bad? Possibly be able to replace it with the older working firmware? I dont know, we will see. It was good that I found other comments related to my experience. Who knows? maybe bad luck, but shouldn't happen.<br/><br/>I would recommend someone try them out, you have nothing to lose but if you have sound quality issues then just return them, dont look back and go to another brand, but if they work and keep working I think my long review says it is worth it or I wouldnt be trying so hard.<br/><br/>They are really comfortable and when working right sound great. I can easily overlook the less then robust phone app and touchy/flakey controls on the earbuds themselves.<br/><br/>Or you could just go right to the Jaybird Vista 2 which is another great earbud, that one is a keeper for me but I also like a second set and trying to make these Bose work.<br/><br/>(Original review below)<br/>So disappointed in these Bose Sport Earbuds,<br/>This is my second set after returning the first set directly to Bose thinking the set I got was defective. Well, guess what, this set will be returned to Amazon.<br/>These earbuds could have been great, super comfortable and best of all they fit perfect, even for me who sometimes has issues with earbuds coming loose in my left ear. I could do anything in these buds, working out, working around the house and they stay perfect, as well as super comfortable.<br/><br/>Just the fact that a company like Bose can turn out a product like this makes me loose all respect for the company and I have known their products since the 901 series 2 many decades ago.<br/>I also lost all respect for the so called "review sites" that praise these earbuds with links to sell them to you.<br/>Lets face it, the Bose name, makes people feel safe, well, they won't when people like me can show you products like  Jaybird Vista 2, Beats Power beats Pro, JBL Reflect Mini NC with far superior sound quality and much smoother operation.<br/><br/>Negatives =<br/>1. Sound quality is way to warm, percussion instruments sound like they are in the next building, muffled and distant.<br/>2. Touch controls are primitive, yeah, once you practice a week or two you can get it pretty good. But OMG I must activate SIRI on my iPhone XR a dozen times a day when all I want to do is adjust the volume, which by the way, adjusts in far too apart increments.<br/>3. I don't understand the equalizer, something I would expect from a third rate product, has hardly any effect on the missing midrange and upper midrange/treble.<br/>4. Just a miserable experience from the touch controls to the one size fits all app, to the obnoxious sound quality.<br/>5. Battery life isn't the greatest either.<br/><br/>Positives =<br/>1. Super comfortable and stays in place, pure genius the way these sit in your ear.<br/>2. Nice case<br/>3. Quality feel<br/><br/>Summary,<br/>If you REALLY need a good fitting earbud where other buds give you a problem these will most likely solve that problem. Don't expect much from the app which is ok with me. I just could not get over the over the top "warm" sound quality but maybe its something you make like but avoid at all cost if you like to hear the crips tones of percussion instruments, symbols ect.<br/>Voice comes out ok, front and center, even if warm, don't expect much emotion in the voice.  Everything else sounds like its in the next building.<br/><br/>Call me crazy, don't know what they were thinking or who was in charge of this earbud development because they forgot about sound quality. I think its so bad it will turn me off to the brand. Way overpriced if you are expecting top quality sound.</span>

<span>They fit perfectly in the ear, follow the instruction for better results.<br/>The sound is excellent, they are easily the best I have (earbuds style).<br/>They connect easily on windows, android and Mac, I even tried it on Linux without any problem.<br/>The battery lasts perfectly as long as the product indicates, I use them to work, meetings, video calls and of course listen to music, they are my favorite headphones right now.<br/>They are not annoying, they are light and the material feels of good quality.</span>

<span>Ordered these headphones two months ago when they released. I'm a pretty serious cyclist and I have used these nearly daily for my rides, which last anywhere from two to six hours. I also live in a tropical part of the US, so I tend to sweat a lot.<br/><br/>Before these earbuds, I was using Shure wired earbuds for my rides. Those earbuds were not necessarily meant for my type of training, especially when I sweat as much as I do when I ride. I landed on the Bose SoundSports for their proposed protection from sweat and their earbud design. I have used Bose SoundSports a couple of generations ago and I always preferred their emphasis on fitting the concha of the ear as opposed to the traditional inner ear canal fit.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>* The fit is quite comfortable for me. I cannot stand traditional IEMs for their extremely uncomfortable fit (just my opinion), especially if I plan on using them for several hours straight. The size earbud I chose is close to the original SoundSports I used four years ago. After a couple of rides, I could hardly feel them. The tight fit also prevents any wiggle room or potential for falling out, so when I'm in the drops or sprinting I'm not concerned at all about these running away.<br/><br/>* They are not completely sound-proof, which is great for me when I need to listen to traffic and other people while riding. This means I can start a ride wearing these and not have to take them off other than to talk to people and to take breaks.<br/><br/>* The automation is really useful actually. Automatically detecting when the right earbud has left my ear to pause music, then detecting when I put it back on to resume music is probably my favorite of this aspect. Answering calls by putting on the earbud is okay too, but in reality by the time you open the case and put on the earbud (plus the time it takes to connect to your device) your incoming call has probably already ended. But, going back to the first bit of automation, there's honestly no better feeling than riding up to a friend, taking out the right earbud, and stopping your music with little to no effort. I'm sure other earbuds do this too, but I'm new to the true wireless scene.<br/><br/>* The touch controls make riding without pulling out your phone an easy feat. The option to skip tracks with a double-tap on the left bud, play/pause with a double tap on the right bud, and now a swipe up or down to adjust the volume all help me keep my attention on the road.<br/><br/>* The call quality is amazing, according to everyone I call while wearing these. I speak softly and mumble sometimes out of habit, but these earbuds adjust and pick up even the softest of rumblings I might mutter. They also amplify my voice enough to be heard by everyone involved in a call, thus improving my ability to articulate points beyond belief. These earbuds have made it into my daily carry because of this.<br/><br/>* So far, these have been completely impervious to sweat. I'm almost afraid that I'm going to break them in time because since buying them two months ago I have not had a need to clean them in any way (besides the actual rubber earbuds).  Hopefully, these will continue to resist all the sweat I throw at them (which is a lot considering that I wear jawbreaker glasses and have helmet straps pooling sweat around my ear).<br/><br/>* The battery life is strong and perfect for my use. Since my typical training ride lasts anywhere from 1:45 to 2 hours, I never have to worry about battery life. Even during my extra long rides, I can very easily take a break from my music, let them charge for 30 or so minutes, and continue my ride without care for battery life at all.<br/><br/>In-betweeners -<br/>* The sound quality is a bit more trebly than the Shure earbuds I used. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I definitely don't mind more or less bass than usual. Some people might choose against these for this reason.<br/>* Being a Bluetooth device, the connection between the earbuds and your device cannot always be perfect. I went from using wired to wireless and I had to learn this the hard way. I believe it's a fact of life for me now, but this is something that will only get better with time (I hope). Intermittently, my music will cut in and out as if I'm getting a call, then resume as normal. My phone also seems to be the culprit with a lot of other Bluetooth issues. Using IP voice comm apps like Teams or Discord will cause the microphone to produce this "shrill noise". I can work around this by using those apps on my work phone instead, so I definitely don't blame the earbuds at all for this. Otherwise, the call quality is excellent.<br/>* These are very reliant on the Bose app. Because I am just getting into the latest generation of Bose products, I was really unaware of this aspect before buying the earbuds. Not saying this would've deterred me, but it does make joining the product to other devices a little more complicated. It's definitely possible to connect these earbuds to your phone without the Bose app, but doing so makes you lose out on all of the extra functionality and the earbuds play at a much lower volume than they're capable of with the Bose app.<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>* Taking calls with these earbuds while riding a bike is not possible. The wind blasting into the microphones renders them completely useless during calls, so every call I get (depending on the urgency) will require me to pull over and take a break. This happens at speeds as low as 10-15 mph, so really these cannot function for calls whatsoever while riding a bike.<br/>* While I praised the fit initially, in the beginning, I did have issues finding the perfect size earbud for me. The type of earbud has changed from the earlier generations of Bose SoundSports to now, so I did have a hard time adapting to the different fit. My ears were a bit sore in the beginning, but, as I said before, I eventually adapted and now I can hardly tell I'm wearing them.<br/><br/>There's honestly not a whole lot more I can say about these earbuds. This is all just off the top of my head... All in all, these earbuds have out-preformed in almost every way I expected. I bought them really only to listen to music on my rides without being burdened with a wire, and now I can't imagine not using them daily for calls and such.</span>

<span>Got these primarily for music while running/activity. And I am impressed as to how perfectly they fit. I have smallish ears and for whatever reason, only those ear buds with ear hooks (small protruding hooks on earphones) work for a secure fit on my ears. Although I am not an audiophile, I just love the sound quality. The bass by default is not great, but once you fiddle with the bose music app, it just gets so much better.<br/>I have yet to check on battery life, but its been just a couple of hours of music listening and I haven't charged the earphones. They came charged to 70%.<br/>I haven't used them for phone conversation, and would probably won't ever use them as it's not my need as such.<br/><br/>I am hopeful these will last for years to come. Time will tell.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend these earphones to someone who likes good fit and wants to listen to music while workouts/runs etc.</span>

<span>The noise cancellation was not great. The sound quality was good and the battery life was excellent. The sound when you are playing music is very good, but when they are being used for phone calls, it can be a little choppy and fade out. For phone calls I don’t really recommend them but for music I would definitely recommend!! They are the first ones that I bought and I was happy with them.

<span>Update:<br/>Knocking a star off. Still a decent headset. Discovered a couple, to me, significant deficiencies, since my original review.<br/><br/>1) Battery life is far lower than rated 12 hour. getting about 8, maybe. Mostly listening to podcasts.<br/>2) Lack of low battery warning. If there is one, I never heard it.  The other earphones I have used all have clear warnings , usually stating '20% battery remaining' and such. I have not had any warning, and ran out of battery 2 times so far.<br/>3) the buttons on the neckband are really not logical, or marked what they do.<br/>4) battery indicator is on the other side of the neckband than the charging port.  Not a big deal, just odd.<br/>5) no 'over top of ear' wire routing like others I have used. Just a preference.<br/>6) I miss having an add-on charged battery to greatly increase the use of the product without having to find a charging port. Not easy when out of the home/car.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I have found the phone function and quality is very good.  No complaints from anyone I have talked to about the sound quality on my end. Most headsets I have used were bad to very bad. These are very good.<br/><br/>From a dead battery, I charged about 20 minutes, got about 20% battery (according to the app).  I guess that is pretty good.  Using the headset as i type. Battery is now 15% after about 25 minutes of use (podcast listening)<br/><br/>Still don't like the neckband.  Prefer over top of ear, tight around the head wire style with nothing on my neck.<br/><br/>Still, the sound quality for music, when equalized using your music app, is very good. Sound and mic quality are very good for phone.<br/><br/>The business end of this set is there.<br/><br/>Original review below:<br/>Coming from an older pair of similar Jaybird headphones.  Purchased these because they seemed similar.<br/>Seems a lot of review are doing pros and cons. Seems reasonable. Impressions below pros/cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>lightweight<br/>fits my ears<br/>fast charging<br/>simple controls (also a con)<br/>good sound..well..after using your music app's EQ to adjust to your hearing level<br/>phone/mic seems very good.<br/><br/>cons<br/>disposable product. No adding/changing batteries that I can see.<br/>during quiet songs, you can hear sound transmitted from your clothing, etc. Not terrible. Just something new and odd.<br/>non-intuitive simple controls (simple to learn, however)<br/>no app to fine tune the headphones to your hearing level and tones to your ears.<br/>out of the box, sound is flat and zero bass. using your music app like Amazon Prime Music, you can tune an equalizer and greatly improve the sound<br/>relatively low volume<br/>not crazy about feeling the cord on my earlobes and the band on my neck.<br/><br/>Impressions:<br/>Not bad for the price.  Initially, I thought they were horrible. Turned on the EQ in Amazon Prime Music, which fixed that !  Out of the box , the sound is unimpressive, to say the least. Not crazy about the semi-rigid band. I liked the all wire of the Jaybird, as you could have it conform to your head with no movement for a real nice fit, making you even forget you had them on.  These, you always know you have them on, as you can feel them on your earlobe and on your neck.<br/><br/>Even with the annoyances, will give it 5 stars. Will revisit the review if there is any significant update<br/><br/>Nutshell, they are almost identical to a $15 set I have, in all respect except these do sound a lot better.  Is it worth the price... ehhh I don't know. As I listen to music writing this, I am liking them a LOT less than my old Jaybird Freedom.  The sound quality (after setting up the EQ) is better, however, but the neck band is getting more annoying</span>

<span>I purchased these to use when running and riding my mountain bike.  I've had zero issues with them and I'm quite impressed with the battery life.  The sound quality seems excellent to me, an average person with no musical skills.  My ONLY complaint is the charging cable, which is kind of a big deal and caused it to lose a star.  It would be nice if it were the standard USB connection instead of this weird thing that it is.  I can only plug in to charge if I have my laptop with me.  This is a huge annoyance since I also have no technical skills and don't know the first thing about what kind of adapter I might need.</span>

<span>These comments apply to Beats Flex released in late 2020.<br/><br/>I got this item to replace a set I bought in  early 2020 from another store. That set was great, but the left bud housing cracked when I fell asleep while wearing them. Besides that lack of durability and phone call quality, I liked the original product enough to repurchase it (at a sale price). Even so, I have some issues with the new set. My impressions are below.<br/><br/>Connectivity: These Flex does not connect as easily to my phone nor remain connected as reliably for listening (see the phone audio quality comments below). I use these Flex with the same phone as before, but the performance aspect of the new Flex is not as good. I believe that the Android Bluetooth settings and the Beats app (Android) interact differently with the new Flex. Where the older Flex seemed to connect quickly, these new Flex require different user actions. Finally, on this point, I have not linked these to my Macbook; however, my old Flex worked flawlessly--and sounded great with the Macbook.<br/><br/>Sound quality: These Flex sound good, but the bass is a bit wanting. I prefer a prominent low-end response, and the low-end on the Flex does not sound as good as the previous set. The highs and mid-range are clear, crisp, and not harsh or too bright, even at higher listening levels. I have not listened to Apple Spatial Audio content. The Dolby Atmos feature sounds about the same compared to the older Flex.<br/><br/>Phone audio quality: These Flex sound great and are superior to the quality of my older Flex. The difference is dramatic. The connection during phone use is stable and quiet with little noise.<br/><br/>Comfort: These Flex are less comfortable because the cord between the buds seems shorter or less flexible. I haven't concluded yet. The ear tips also seem harder and do feel as comfortable. If I find my broken set,  I will swap tips. My initial perceptions of (dis)comfort may be due to insufficient break-in time. If I determine this is the case, I will update this point.<br/><br/>Battery performance: The new Flex provide long listening time. I have frequently gotten more than 12<br/>ours of non-continuous use between charges. I am pleased by the battery performance.<br/><br/>Other features/Accessories: Flex comes with an assortment of 4 different-sized eartips and a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging Flex. The cable is much too short for my use, being only about 4-6 inches in length. I have not used the cable because it is inconvenient, and I do not own a USB-C charging adapter; however, I have a suitable adapter supplied with my phone. In the box, as they say, should be a longer cable and an appropriate adapter.</span>

<span>These buds have really good battery life. I use them mostly for spoken voice from an Apple Watch.<br/><br/>There are a couple of curious issues: There is an audible connect tone and a power-off tone, but no power-up tone. To go with that, it is difficult to see whether they are powered up or not if you’re wearing them; the tiny LED is at the top of one of the dongles, so you can’t see it. So you hold the power button down for several seconds, and it will probably be powered up and you can connect.<br/><br/>Very nicely, when you power up the buds, an Apple device will notice and give you a connection window. This even applies to an Apple TV. I use them mostly with an Apple Watch, though, and it works smoothly with them. When connected to the watch, the watch’s power display will show the state of charge of the buds. Other Apple devices will do the same; it’s more than just usual Bluetooth pairing. Call it “deep pairing.”<br/><br/>I think the buffer may fill slowly. If I connect to my watch and strike out walking, they cut out some when my body is between the watch and the buds, like when I swing my arms. That’s irritating, but I notice that this is a problem only when starting out; I don’t notice it happening after a few minutes.<br/><br/>The last noteworthy thing is that allowing the buds to magnetically attach to each other will pause your audio, which will restart when you pull them apart and re-insert.<br/><br/>Finally, don’t be put off by the USB-C charging port. You can buy a cheap adapter to USB-2 so you can use old charging blocks or USB ports on old computers, but USB-C is great for iPhones (8 &amp; up) and Apple watches. It’s fast. Get a USB-C charging block and a cord for your phone if it’s an 8 or newer. It’s the way of the future (for now).</span>

<span>I have had these for about 6 mnths now and i love, love, love..d them!! They last FOREVER charged and fit really snug! I love that you can be phone calls with either or both not just the right. About a month or so ago my right 1 is having ussues charging. I cant just put them in the charger and walk away now, i have to position it in a certain spot and make sure it doesnt slip from that spot. Ive noticed the left is starting to do this as well which prompted me to write the review. It sux if they will stop charging soon, i use them while working! I have cheaper 1s that i have washed and dryed in the washer machine and they have been tosseled, dropped and god knows what else and they still kicking!! Kinda sucky but i REALLY DO LOVE these! They definitely sound better and last longer than my cheap 1s, as long as i get a full charge in them lol that is the biggest complaint. 1 other small, tiny complaint is you cant answer your phone with them, you have to physically answer on your phone, but thats not a BIG deal lol i do recommend these but mabe baby the charging dock?!!!</span>

<span>There is such a wide variety of wireless earbuds on the market that can cost as much as $200.  As such, these are on the low end of cost but very big on features.  This is replacing an old set and the technology has come a long way.  It was so easy to pair and use.  I really like the recharging case that automatically turns them on and off.

<span>I bought these to use at work during downtime and breaks. I got the white to match my phone, but I work in a warehouse so the transfer of dirt and grime which is difficult to remove from the white (especially the case). The performance of these headphones has been amazing though. The battery life has been great. Between the usage time and standy by time and the fact that sometimes I forget to charge the case....I've never had a dead battery yet.<br/>Noise cancelation is good and still if the volume is low enough (or in my case if you only use a solo bud) you can still hear surrounding noise if necessary.<br/>Sound quality is high end. The bass delivery is rich with nice range in mids and highs as well.<br/>This is an excellent quality product. I'm very pleased with these ear buds without having to spend the high end of Bose earbuds. More of a mid level range... but excellent quality!</span>

<span>I'm writing this review after using this headset almost daily for work and gaming for a little under two years now. I bought these for gaming, streaming, and work. Let me start off by saying they look adorable and seem to be sturdy, but the quality is definitely lacking and I generally wouldn't recommend them to anyone who is trying to use them as a full headset, maybe as just headphones, but definitely not if they need to use the mic.<br/><br/>-------------Quick Summary-------------------------------------<br/>PROS: Cute, extension cord is handy (sometimes), comfortable enough to wear all day, sound quality is decent, separate volume knob on the headphones is convenient sometimes<br/>CONS: Mic quality is god awful, the mute button broke pretty quickly and I almost couldn't get it to unmute, headset is too loose and heavy to do any kind of physical activity or even lean forward without them falling off, extension cord is split between input and output so it can't be used as both input and output through one headphone jack i.e. for my laptop<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I was really attracted to these because they are cute, and there weren't too many options for pink headphones, and I really wanted to look cute for Twitch streaming and Zoom/Discord calls. Let me start by saying I have beat the crap out of these and they still work, but a lot of the features I liked broke or stopped working well after a few months and then I stopped caring about being gentle with them.<br/><br/>Most notably, the mute button/volume dial, it is so poorly constructed, you can feel the plastic moving around. The mute button itself often didn't mute or would get stuck muted, or half muted where it would make a humming or interference noise for people in my voice calls. It finally stopped working entirely after a few months and almost got stuck in the muted position. It was never reliable which lead to some embarrassing situations where I thought I was muted and I was NOT. There are also ridges on the volume adjustment that often get caught on clothing and it turns itself down or all the way up and I have to double check it. Ideally it would have been better if Razer put these buttons on the headset itself instead. It was nice to have volume control separate but it was more annoying than beneficial most of the time. It doesn't really have any amount of noise cancelling or anything, it feels similar to wearing earmuffs for the winter, I can still hear everything it's just a little muffled.<br/><br/>The mic on this headset is absolutely awful and I would NOT recommend anyone rely on it for quality voice input. I don't know if it's just built badly or if mine is slowly getting worse over time but I have a lot of complaints about the mic. First off, the mic picks up sound coming from your earphones, I feel like that should be a basic requirement for a headset to not do that.... I have to have the volume very quiet in order to avoid the mic picking up what I am listening to. This is worse while the mic is pushed in to the headset, and only a little better when you pull the mic out to be near your mouth, but it still happens so it kind of defeats the purpose of having a headset. There has been more than one occasion where my music was picked up in a meeting by my mic, so again very embarrassing situations sometimes. There is zero consistency on mic pickup volume, I have used this for Zoom, Discord, BlueJeans, Facebook Video, Twitch, OBS, and regular phone calls, and all of them have wildly differing volumes of pickup. I use Zoom and Discord the most. On Zoom the mic seems to be supersonic and can pick up sounds across the room, when I'm on Discord on the same computer I have my input boosted and have the mic literally touching my mouth and my friends can barely hear me most of the time, it is so frustrating. Annoyingly this changes frequently, a few weeks ago I was too loud on Discord despite not changing any settings and then this week I am too soft despite being boosted all the way up. If I use the extension cord it changes the whole situation again to where I am having to adjust my settings and test my mic constantly. The extension cord itself is nice but I almost never use it as it is split into input and output only, so I can't use these as a headset on things with a singular audio jack like my laptop and phone which is 90% of my usage.<br/><br/>Physically the headset feels sturdy, and I have dropped it more times than I care to admit, but overall the headset is heavy because the metal ear cups and headband, making it slip and slide off if I lean down to pick something up. If I shake my head with any amount of force the headset slips right off, so I can't wear it for anything but sitting at my desk, I have to switch to my old Sony bluetooth headphones if I want to work out, which I don't think I was looking for these to be an all in one solution for me, but it's still disappointing to take a phone call and have to constantly adjust these on my head if I do any amount of movement. It's comfortable to wear all day for sure, and I wear glasses so that's an achievement.<br/><br/>The sound quality is decent, I can't really complain about that.<br/><br/>Overall I would say these weren't worth the purchase. Granted the price point is pretty low for a corded headset but it is a constant headache to adjust the mic settings on every application. I would not purchase these again if I was in the market for a decently priced headset. They are cute and trendy, but really only work well as headphones if you sit still all day.</span>

<span>Upon initial testing, I was struck by how much muddier these headphones sounded compared to the set of corsairs they replaced. Music seemed to be too bass-boosted to the point where the high end was getting drowned out by the low frequencies.<br/><br/>However, after fiddling with my audio drivers, I ended up custom EQ-ing the sound to my liking - namely boosting the highs and upper mids, as well as the lower lows.<br/><br/>If you care about how music sounds through these headphones, don't despair. Fiddle with your audio settings to tune the sound to your liking.</span>

<span>The sound that comes from these is bass heavy and a little more tinny than the same offerings from Corsair. This can be tuned out with an eq settings adjustment but will still not sound as good as a set of good Corsair headphones. The only thing these Krakens have going for them is the huge head sizing. These fit my 7 3/8 head with no pinch or headache from compression. So if you are in a corner trying to find a decent headset with a big head look no further. These are for you.</span>

<span>I bought this headset when I realized my old set was on its last legs, hoping to make a bit of an upgrade. After trying the Razer Kraken for myself, I can tell you it's not worth it.<br/>Razer is a generally reputable manufacturer, and I thought the LED ears were cute, which initially drew me to this product. There aren't really any other gaming headsets out there with LED ears that come from manufacturers I feel might make a decent product.<br/><br/>Quick pros:<br/> + Audio quality is genuinely fairly good. Razer synapse settings can improve it further.<br/> + Headset is aesthetically very nice, and the LED customization adds to this. They look amazing! I got many compliments when wearing it.<br/> + The retractable microphone is a nice and convenient feature. Feels nice to use.<br/> + Easy installation, easy to use, easy to understand.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/> - Extremely uncomfortable fit. This set is adjustable, but that's not enough. The padding for the ear cups and headband are both far too thin and use a low-quality foam, despite product claims. The ear cups move in their frames to fit your head shape, but not nearly enough. They barely move. The range of motion is so small that it feels like their mere inclusion is some kind of joke. They don't help.<br/><br/> - Microphone quality is immensely disappointing. Out of the box, my friends could barely understand me. After experimenting with it to get the best settings possible, my microphone audio quality became serviceable. Just serviceable. My four year old, $40 headset that barely works anymore still has a significantly better microphone. This laughable quality for this price should be unacceptable from a big name like Razer.<br/><br/> - Razer Synapse needs to be running to get the best possible quality from your microphone and headset speakers. This isn't a huge con, but it bothers me a lot since Synapse uses more RAM than I believe is justified. The basic device settings should be able to function without third party software always running in the background, instead stored on the device locally. Many gaming mice do this.<br/><br/> - Overall build quality does not meet the expectations set by the product. It's rigid where it shouldn't be, and flimsy in places it should be tight and well-secured. The volume wheel feels like it's barely attached, and each increment in turning it is inaccurate to whatever detects it. I can turn it three pips and have my volume only increase once, if at all.<br/><br/>To summarize, Razer knows how to make good peripherals, and has in the past, which is why I use the Razer Kiyo webcam. Much of that shines here, but it still seems like the Razer Kraken is a low-quality, unpolished product that they slapped cat ears on so they could charge far more for it. It may fit better for individuals with very small heads. It's extremely unsuitable for gaming, which is what it was advertised for, and I will be returning it immediately to instead get a headset from a manufacturer who actually means business.</span>
