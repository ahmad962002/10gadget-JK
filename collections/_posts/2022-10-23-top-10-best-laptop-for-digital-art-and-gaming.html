<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span>I needed to replace my previous laptop after 5+ years, but I didn't want to break the bank. After researching different gaming laptops, the Acer Nitro 5 stood out as the best balance between price and performance.<br/><br/>I was nervous about upgrading to Windows 11 (I'd avoided upgrading from Windows 7 to 8 because of the terrible UI), but it's actually very clean and minimalist.<br/><br/>The Nitro 5's performance has blown my expectations out of the water. My previous laptop could barely scrape by the FFXIV benchmark on "normal laptop" settings, but the Nitro 5 scored very high on the "high desktop" settings. I've signed up for PC Game Pass to take advantage of my new hardware power, and it's been amazing playing Microsoft Flight Simulator on high settings.<br/><br/>I did end up buying an extra 8GB Crucial RAM, and installing that was a breeze.<br/><br/>Fantastic value for the price!</span>

<span>This was the first gaming computer I ever bought, so I had no idea that the plugs were different from regular computers. When I first plugged it in and tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I thought I got a bum computer! I called the number on the package and was told that gaming computers have different plugs than standard computers, and that I had to push the plug into the back of the computer all the way until I heard a click. I thought I had, but when I pushed on it again I heard the click and it started right up.<br/><br/>Onto the computer itself... the graphics are great, the speed has worked well for all the games used so far (Minecraft, Bloons TD6, etc.), the picture is vivid, and I have no complaints so far!</span>

<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!<br/><br/>Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!<br/><br/>The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.<br/><br/>Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.<br/><br/>Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.<br/><br/>I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!<br/>Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.</span>

<span>Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.<br/><br/>Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.<br/><br/>Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.<br/><br/>Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.</span>

<span>I wish I didn't gift this to my 11 yo, lol!! It is such an awesome little machine. Great screen quality for picture and clarity, even side viewing. She plays Roblox on it and Toca Boca World - it runs all other apps perfectly and way better than my IdeaPad 3 (2022) - that's the difference in price points. We use this for homeschooling, gaming (as mentioned above) and general viewing apps such as Netflix, Disney+ and of course Amazon browsing. The touchscreen is worth the price point. Still has a few more years of Chrome OS updates.</span>

<span>Note: This review is for those thinking about run a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.<br/><br/>Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri doesnt detect the Realtek wifi adapter that comes with this laptop which is an extremely common problem in the Linux world (in fact, I already know because there were reviews here that said they had to rely on a USB wifi adapter). I tried using a USB Ethernet adapter to connect to the internet and running [apt update/upgrade] hoping that it will install the correct drivers but no luck. However, even [lspci] doesnt event detect the wifi adapter so I just gave up. I bought a generic wifi adapter carrying the latest Intel AX210 for about $40. This new model allows for WiFi 6e and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and I tested this on a Windows 10 Pro laptop prior to bringing it over to this Linux machine so I know that the adapter I bought actually delivered these specs. So then I swapped the Realtek with the new Intel wifi adapter and reinstalled the same Ubuntu version. I had wifi even during setup when I was booting the installer from USB. But after installation, only bluetooth was detected. The solution was to [apt update/upgrade] and restart. Then boom now I have wifi and also Bluetooth 5.2 (I didnt include pics but when I ran [hciconfig -a] the version is 5.2) thanks to Intel AX210. I didnt need to manually install other drivers - it just worked after a system update.<br/><br/>Note that you have to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS/UEFI settings for the new wifi adapter hardware to be recognized by the OS. This means that the Secure Boot status should be "Inactive" (or something like that). Delete those stored keys if you need to.<br/><br/>So far, i dont have any issues with it running Ubuntu. The camera, usb ports, and m.2 ssd slots all work fine. I havent used the Bluetooth 5.2 though since no need for it. Also, doing basic computer stuff like web browsing and word processing is not lightning fast but also not slow. It takes a few seconds to open Firefox but watching 1080p videos is no problem. I tried running 1 Lububtu virtual machine and I didnt have any problems, but it is kinda slow - though tolerable.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>I was shocked at how snappy and decent this little Chromebook is. For the price you really can't beat it. My Father's Acer R-13 stopped working so I ordered this one for him. It setup immediately and even recognized his USB dock which allowed him to connect wireless mouse, keyboard and speakers. This is a great deal. I'll update if he runs into any issues with it in the future, but so far it's a 5 star winner.</span>

<span>I was installing Discord, steam, some other non-game related applications TWO at a time and it was overheating the left side of my laptop HARD. I haven't even tried a game or several chrome tabs yet. This was all AFTER I updated Windows and Nvidia.<br/><br/>Now we get to the gaming. Testing it with Baldur's Gate 3 and it automatically set it to ULTRA settings, minus DLSS, etc. The game is BEAUTIFUL (kinda running better than my gaming Desktop actually lol). But... just sitting at the main menu is 66 Celsius. (150F). CPU and GPU are pretty equivalent but CPU goes between 50-75C. You'd think that's fine, right? Well I had to use the loud as heck fan (Performance Mode) or it would hit 80C. Sitting at a somewhat avg of 71F in the tutorial area in the game and my keyboard is super warm to the touch. Especially the center. I am also kind of concerned for airflow since the bottom of the case is just... well let's just say bugs can get inside, or toothpicks, etc. No airflow... There is no proper covering for this. The 78C pic is when normal fan is going. 72 when Performance fan is going. This isn't even the big open world area in this game yet. If they fix the heating issue, honestly it's a 5 out of 5 stars. I think i'm going to need a cooling pad... As I am typing this, the center keys are really, really warm now. I do not think it is 71C in the center area of the motherboard.</span>

<span>It's possibly the best laptop I've ever owned by a landslide. It's honestly the best gaming laptop you could get. The price has gone up a little since I purchased it but it is still worth the money. Other laptops with the same specs have you paying almost double. One bad this I can say is that the battery life is poor as it usually is with these types of machines; I wish the manufacturer would provide better batteries but that would only bring up the price. Aside from that, it's an excellent laptop.</span>

<span>This MSI is quite the little powerhouse, it runs any game I throw at it at a steady 60 FPS with max graphical settings. I initially stress tested it with Doom Eternal, and it was as though I was playing it on my desktop. If there were any differences they were so negligible I didn't notice.<br/><br/>On top of that with the 16 gigs of ram as opposed to 8 gigs, which is usually put into gaming laptops, makes multitasking during gameplay a non issue. Whether you're recording gameplay, or listening to spotify, or both!<br/><br/>The MSI is also built with metal casing unlike some of it's competitors, such as the Acer Razor, which is pure plastic. This gives it a sturdy feel, and adds a bit of protection.<br/><br/>Now, I did say this is a powerhouse so it does suck battery life rather fast. Granted there are options to conserve power, but even then at the very, very most you may get half a dozen hours, but more likely closer to four, or five. This for me isn't a deal breaker since I generally have a power socket nearby, and when I do not it's only for and hour or two max.<br/><br/>I will also point out that this machine gets hot, real hot the harder you push it. So I highly suggest using a cooling pad with it.<br/><br/>Other than that it's been running magnificently over the last few weeks since I got it. If you're looking for a really good gaming laptop, this is worth the price, and then some.<br/><br/>I highly recommend!</span>

<span>Oh man, this MSI Nvidia 3070 Gaming Laptop is exhilarating. I have the capability to run Ultra graphics/ RTX graphics and 144hz. The storage is a bit small for my liking, I plan to soon upgrade my storage and RAM capacity. The CPU, Core i7 11th Gen, is a beast. I purchased the “Used “Like New,” so I obtained this at an affordable price ($1.2k). 2weeks in, I am experiencing no issues. Win 10 can easily be changed to Win 11 for free. The MSI Center application is very resourceful, that’s where you can change the keyboard color and configure/monitor other goodie’s.<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a gaming laptop that’s very powerful and has a decent price tag, I 100% recommended this rig.</span>

<span>I needed a laptop with a decent battery life, and room for upgrade. Mostly for office work and media consumption. Web surfing needed, strong wifi, I wanted S mode for security. I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things.

<span>I bought this laptop just to have something "mobile" when I want to get online or do some "light work" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)<br/><br/>I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.<br/><br/>The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GB<br/><br/>It does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.<br/><br/>It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothly<br/><br/>It came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).<br/><br/>It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!<br/><br/>I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!</span>

<span>This is an amazing laptop! I have had it for a little over a month now (from writing this review) and I have not had any performance issues that were caused by the computer or anything involving the computer itself. (Some programs I have don’t work properly but that has nothing to do with the laptop but missing files or improperly installed files. )<br/><br/>It is important to note, I have seen so many reviews given as one star because of a user fault. The most common issue is overheating. Here is some advice for the people who fail to research what they might need for a *GAMING LAPTOP*. GET AN EXTERNAL FAN PAD!!! The fans in the laptop are no where near strong enough to maintain proper cooling in a gaming laptop for prolonged periods of use. They are way too small and simply cannot keep the computer cool because of the power required to run all the hardware. If you simply did your research (which I hope is what your doing by reading this) you would know to get fans. They are cheap and they will assist in keeping your computer cool. Something else to note, gaming desktop PCs don’t generally have this problem (if ordered from and built by a trusted brand). I cannot guarantee that every computer will have a well built cooling system (in regards to PCs. Not laptops). In short, if you’re looking to get a gaming laptop, get external cooling fans. They are generally cheap and there are many for you to find.</span>

<span>I'm a huge fan of MSI. This notebook is probably the best purchase I made late last year. The performance isn't bad whatsoever. Playing games like Rogue Company, Destiny 2 Rainbow Six Siege at over 100 to 200 fps makes it a better option than that of most home console. But at 1080p at high or medium settings of course. Some cons that I have to address though. 1. The battery dies fast even while playing small, less demanding games and can clock in at less than 2 hours before needing a charge again. 2. Unplugging the notebook from the power cable can cut performance in half or more. 3. Not much USB connectors so you're limited to what you can use unless you shell out for a usb hub. It's  worth IMO. 4. Storage is murder if you want to install some if the best AAA games since it in only has 512gb out of the box plus the 16gb Ram is enough for gaming but editing needs more though. The best solution is upgrading to more storage and adding more ram once you feel you really need it. Check YouTube for any good tutorial videos once ready for upgrade. Finally 5. Temperature and noise levels. This notebook can get exceedingly hot and loud during sessions, I use a Tecknet cooler to help but it just manages to keep it a better temperature than reliying on the notebooks loud fans. Using headphones is only way bypass this annoyance, cause the "jet engine" like sound will put you off in just about an hour. Even with all these cons, I can't recommend this laptop enough. The performance is just too good and it's probably the best way to enter pc gaming at a decent price due to the ongoing GPU drought thanks to the chip shortage.</span>

<span>I use the computer for basic things like social media, email, and online board games.  It generally serves that function well.  The battery life is solid.  It was my first time getting a touch screen LED rather than an LCD and I was somewhat disappointed in the image clarity vs an LED, but if you value a touchscreen, it could be worth that tradeoff.  My main frustration is with the hardware.  About 1-2 months after getting the computer, one of the two rubber traction strips at the bottom peeled half off.  Its attached by adhesive, so there is no way to reattach it.  I eventually had to peel it off entirely or else there would just be an 8 inch long piece of rubber hanging off the computer.  Now 2.5 months after getting it the second strip is having the same problem and is falling off.  The computer gets very hot and I think this may have caused this problem. But it feels like they should have designed it so that the friction strips don't come off in the first 1-3 months.</span>

<span>I am a super cautious person when it comes to purchasing more expensive items (even if $450 isn't a lot for a laptop), especially being in college when money is tight. I did a ton of researching into cheaper laptops and compared that to what I needed to upgrade from my previous one till now.<br/><br/>That being said, I absolutely love this laptop. It's a lot faster than I was expecting and runs very smoothly and is also pretty quiet . I found it super easy to set up and use (mine did not come in windows 10s mode, so that was an added plus). It is able to handle games decently as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I am so happy I decided to choose this laptop and would highly recommend to anyone looking for something in the lower price range without skimping on quality!</span>

<span>I had and used this computer for almost a week.  It does works great and very nice to type on as I am a touch typist (meaning I don’t need to look at the keys as I use the keyboard).  The keys are nicely spaced apart even if it is just a 14 inches screen sized computer.  I did not miss the other larger sized models as this is just fine for the type of activities I like to indulge in with a personal computer or other electronic devices.<br/><br/>The track pad is very sensitive (although I personally prefer to use a “old fashioned” wired USB Mouse and the newest  Touchscreen option over the track pad).  I like the SSD storage over the old fashion magnetic one.  I been using the tiny USB flash drives for ages and prefer to store my resulting computer files locally on these than stuffing up my internal storage full for long term storage.  Flash drives are still far more cheaper and portable even today.  I like lots of options.<br/><br/> Which brings me to the cons of my new purchase.  The instructions which came with this computer is the worst that I ever used.  The print is way too tiny for even someone with good eyesight to read!  I am not sure where the HMDI Port is (although I do think it’s there-somewhere!)  I studied all the keys and there no place to put your finger to be read.  So I have to completely rely on my PIN to physicially in real time protect my computer and files from unauthorized users.  I prefer to have at least 2 levels of protection like the fingerprint reader AND the PIN.  Even my under 200 dollar smartphone has these options built right in!<br/><br/>Look at this list below copy/pasted from Amazon own webpage of this computer:<br/><br/>1x Headphone-out &amp; Audio-in Combo Jack; 1x Built-in HD webcam with microphone; 1x Built-in fingerprint reader; 1x Built-in media reader for simple photo transfer; 1x RJ45 LAN Jack for LAN insert; 1x HDMI 1.4b 4K Output; 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C; 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A. 12.75 x 8.89 x 0.78 in (323.85 x 225.81 x 19.81 mm), 3.25 lbs. (1.47 kg)…....”<br/><br/>I could not find the HMDI Output port  Where is it? Worst of all there could never be a LAN (Ethernet) port built in these more modern ultra skinny laptops. Why was something so obviously inaccurate stated as such on Amazon?  I had to go online somewhere else to find this out!  I paid good money for features that could not or would not ever be on this product?  Or pay extra for adaptors?  And the color was not the same pictured on the webpage.  I was sent a completely silver one, rather than a blackish one.  What’s up with this?<br/><br/> I decided to simply cut my losses and move on.  From what I read on some of these reviews, I luckily gotten away with a product that works at least for now.  The features that are extremely vital to me at least are present on the product so I can live with this purchase, though still a bit disappointed, and  feel a bit, well, cheated.  As you can see below also from their own Amazon webpage:<br/><br/> AMD Ryzen 3 3200U Processor (2.60 GHz base clock, up to 3.50 GHz max boost clock, 4 MB Cache, 2 Cores) Smart dual-core, four-way processing performance for HD-quality computing<br/><br/>14" Touchscreen, typical 1366 x 768 HD resolution. Natural finger-touch navigation makes the most of Windows 10. Energy-efficient LED backlight screen<br/><br/>DDR4 2400 MHz RAM Memory with Solid State Drive (SSD) combo brings the muscle for gaming, creating, and advanced multitasking, so you can do it all, anywhere. To smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once<br/><br/>So it’s not a complete let down, or worse, a huge disaster.</span>
