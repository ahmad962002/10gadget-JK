<span>The presentation and packaging was really terrible.  There was an outside sleeve which was covered in tape and stickers. When I tried to remove the sleeve , the tape was also stuck to the sides of the inside box making this gift look like it was already used and regifted. The watch itself is impressive, but it is expensive and the packaging had a lot to be desired for.<br/>I didn’t have time to return it and maybe purchase it again in the hopes that the presentation would be better. I went to a jewelers and bought a box to present it in which added to the overall cost of the watch itself. It was all so unnecessary !!!</span>

<span>This style band is great. Easy on easy off, super comfortable, and fits well. Love that the metal "strap keeper" doesn't move and randomly release the end like most bands do. Thinner than average bands but it makes it fit the wrist more closely and they're not expensive to replace.</span>

<span>I recently bought a Timex Weekender chrono and liked the leather band that was on it so I wanted one that would fit my Seiko 5. It is exactly the same as my Timex chrono band except it is shorter then that one. I have skinny wrists so it works out for me but for an average guy it may be too short. You can see in the one picture that it isn’t even long enough for me to wrap it back under the guide like a normal nato band wears. I’m happy with it because I like the feel of Timex leather nato bands but keep in mind it is somewhat short.</span>

<span>This strap has a security of NATO without extra steps (and bulk). In a typical Marathon fashion, it looks and feels bulletproof yet elegant. And it should complement any watch, maybe with the exception of some diamond encrusted gold bling piece.<br/><br/>A few tips:<br/><br/>– Trim it! Put it on (with the watch!), fasten the buckle and cut it close to the keeper. Then melt the edge with a lighter. There's absolutely no reason to tuck it the way you usually do with NATO, unless you also want to wear the same strap on top of your sleeve.<br/><br/>– Make it wet! At first, it's quite stiff and doesn't feel comfortable at all. So put it on, fasten as tight as you can, then soak it under cold tap. Pat dry and wear normally. In a few minutes (literally!) it will relax around your wrist and watch, providing for a very comfortable fit.</span>

About Casio : With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.

<span>I want to really like this watchband. The muted colors are nice. It is much softer on my wrist than expected. However, after limited wear, it is starting to fray around the edges. I work in an office, so I would say it isn’t being subjected to harsh conditions on the regular. I’m on the fence about whether I would purchase it again or not. If you are unsure about it for yourself, maybe try another option unless you only plan to use it once in a great while.</span>

This authentic Seiko replacement band works with a variety of timepieces. The brown strap certainly fits the dressy description with its exquisite leather materials, alligator grain pattern, and gloss finish. Medium padding ensures comfort while the striking silver tone stainless steel buckle maintains the formal appearance. Matching stitching completes the streamline look of this slightly tapered band. Regular length strap comes in unisex size 20mm.

<span>This was exactly what I needed in terms of a new watch band. My old one was worn and smelly, and would take the pins out of the bottom of the watch. So I always needed new pins. I bought this band, thinking that it was just the band and i got the pins instead. I was able to install them using a knife and I have a great look watch now that hopefully won't pop off. Though, if it does, it's probably the watch itself. 10/10 would buy again.</span>

Sweat is not that great for leather but for the use I got out of it, it's a great strap and price wise, it's about right. I think I am going to buy a 3rd one and keep it for later. The item was out of stock for a while and I was thrilled when I was able to purchase it again.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>How do I choose a NATO strap?</h3></h3>
    

The NATO strap is a versatile and popular watch strap that can be used with any type of watch. There are a few things to consider when choosing a NATO strap, including the type of watch, the size of the NATO strap, and the color of the NATO strap.
<h3><h3>Is NATO strap better?</h3></h3>
    

 NATO straps are typically seen as being higher quality and more durable than standard watch straps. This is because NATO straps are made from thicker materials and typically have more robust stitching.
<h3><h3>Which type of strap is best for watch?</h3></h3>
    

Leather straps are most common for watches and are the most versatile. They can be dressy or casual, and go with a wide variety of styles. Fabric straps are also popular, and come in a range of patterns and colors. They can be casual or dressy, but don't always have the same level of versatility as leather straps. Nylon straps are the most casual option, and are perfect for active lifestyles. They're also the cheapest option.
<h3><h3>Does Rolex make NATO straps?</h3></h3>
    

Rolex does not make NATO straps, but there are many aftermarket options if you are looking for a nato strap for your Rolex watch.
