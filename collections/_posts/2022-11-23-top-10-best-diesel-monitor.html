<span>Bought for my fiance to use as a second monitor, it does it's job well. If you can afford a 140hz monitor I would definitely say go with that but for this price this was the best thing we could find and it suits her needs. Solid colors, works great for having twitch pulled up on the side.</span>

<span>The picture on this monitor is great but I wish the speakers were a bit louder. It just gets on my nerves since I watch a lot of You Tube and some videos are just too low to hear clearly with this monitor. I use a browser volume amplifier and that helps but I really need to get a set of speakers.</span>

<span>This monitor for the price can not be beat for every day use. The colors once put in gaming mode look great. As well in 75hertz the monitor is smooth. You can still notice a big difference between this and say a 165 hertz monitor. But If you are using this for just browsing the web or watching videos it is great. I have two of them!</span>

<span>My old 15 year old HP 24in screen died. This was the replacement. I use this screen to type documents &amp; program. (The other is a Wacom tablet screen for art &amp; photography and the occasional landscape document.)<br/><br/>The screen is bright and easy to use. I played around with the color settings...it's easy to adjust, but since I rarely use it for art &amp; photography, it's not urgent.<br/><br/>I'm not used to the proportions. This reminds me of legal pad size. For 8.5x11 docs, it's a little strange. But it's wonderful for the Python program I'm writing.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it! Good price, too.<br/><br/>(Note: I don't game much. The most would be MS Flight Simulator 2000. I can't tell you about how this would be for games.)</span>

<span>I got this monitor because my desk space wouldn't properly fit two 1080p 24" monitors, and it's easier to stay focused when everything is all on one screen. I was surprised and skeptical when I found this monitor because it's a 30" ultrawide with good reviews, but a lesser known brand. I had a Sceptre monitor back in the CRT display era, so I decided to give it a shot, since the monitor I had back then worked perfectly fine throughout its use.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Surprisingly bright, I had to turn it down to 50% for white background windows/browser pages.<br/>- Very clear for colors and detail, it seems noticeably better than the monitors I had previously. I can't speak to professional color schemes, since I primarily use it for programming work and gaming.<br/>- Buttery smooth. I didn't think I would notice much difference between 144hz and 200hz, but it does seem even smoother. Competitive games like CS:GO will definitely show a difference.<br/>- PIP and PBP capability, which is fantastic for when I actually need two monitors. I can use the same source (main PC HDMI and DP) for both monitors also.<br/>- 4 ports allows me to have two setups with dual monitors, one for work laptop and one for main PC.<br/>- Supports standard 1920x1080p resolution, although the desktop will stretch and games/applications might have the "black bar" effect, which doesn't really bother me much.<br/>- 1 DP and 3 HDMI (the DP can support up to 200hz, HDMI 1 can support up to 165hz, and HDMI 2 and HDMI 3 can support up to 85hz)<br/>- OSD is extremely intuitive, and the buttons at the bottom make sense. I didn't even need the manual.<br/>- Costs the same as two budget 24" 1080p monitors.<br/>- I appreciate the blue light reduction settings, makes it easy on the eyes.<br/>- Has speakers and doesn't require headphones to use them. They have pretty decent quality for a monitor.<br/>- The screen is about as tall as a standard 1080p 24" monitor (which is what I'm used to), the screen size itself is 27.8"W x 16.1"H (30" diagonally)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- PBP for dual monitors stretches the displays to fit, making both look compressed, kind of annoying but not much can be done without changing both desktop resolutions. PIP mode can work well for fixing this too if you don't mind sacrificing part of your main screen.<br/>- "Black bar" effect on applications that don't support 2560x1080p, expected with an ultrawide monitor though.<br/>- The stand that comes with it is kind of short, raising the screen maybe 6" above the desk. Tilt works to fix this a bit.<br/>- Backlight is dim and only glows red, but it can be turned off.<br/>- FreeSync works, but I've had some trouble getting it to work properly (never had much luck with FreeSync anything though).<br/><br/>I will update if I encounter any problems, but I'm very impressed so far.<br/><br/>Updates after a few days of use:<br/>- The monitor is VESA mountable with an included bracket (75x75 pattern) designed to go on the back of the monitor (in place of the stand). The monitor is about 12.15lbs, fairly light for a monitor of this size, so it should fit most VESA mounts. If you have a VESA mount larger than 100x100, you might want to consider using longer screws and standoffs, since there is a small overhang on the back of the monitor that might block larger VESA mounts from laying flush when screwing into the included bracket.<br/>- Some of my previous monitors had about 1ms response time, and this monitor has 5ms response time. I don't think it is hugely noticeable, but in fast paced competitive games, you might see mild ghosting if you're used to faster response times. Like most curved monitors, it's a VA panel, so the slower response times are somewhat expected.</span>

<span>Eleven days of owning and no issues, but after reading the reviews and seeing all of this crap said about DisplayPort ports dying, non-mountable, not powering on, Sceptre isn't a brand name.<br/>I'm left to ask a serious question. Are any of you taking into mind what comes with the monitor, taking advantage of it, and using the right equipment.<br/><br/>I'm gonna cover a lot of this in this review.<br/><br/>'Sceptre is not a brand name'<br/>___________________________<br/>What? Sceptre is a relatively big brand and a decent one at that. Though they've always been on the budget friendlier side of the equation, and there's tons of research you can do on it to reinforce my claims.<br/><br/>'DisplayPort dying within a month'<br/>________________________________<br/>If this ever happens, there are several things that need to be considered.<br/>1. Was this during a graphics driver update? If so, unplug the DisplayPort cable, connect an HDMI, DDU your drivers, and install again with the cable in fresh.<br/><br/>2. What kind of DisplayPort cable are you using? I don't care if the monitor came with one. I don't care if you have a DisplayPort cable laying around.<br/>Purchase a VESA Certified cable and ONLY use VESA Certified cables like this one - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CD1FB3A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1<br/>Cables can kill a DisplayPort rendering it entirely useless. Stop being cheap and making up excuses for your monitors port dying out.<br/><br/>'How do I mount the monitor?'<br/>____________________________<br/>There's a VESA Certified mounting plate that comes with this monitor. You need to already have a mount setup and ready to use, and be ready to make sure the mount supports the monitors weight.<br/>After that, attach the mounting plate to the monitor, and then screw it in with the screw provided for the stand. After that, you want to mount this to your VESA mount, yes it will flex the plate, but at least it's keeping the monitor stable. Continue to mount until tightened.<br/>All mounts should be compatible.<br/><br/>Please stop coming to Amazon ready to complain about something you may have caused on your own.<br/>Sceptre doesn't deserve to be strung out all over the place because of human error.<br/>If you encounter any sort of issue on opening, you need to be in their Amazon messages issuing a return or RMA, not writing asinine reviews and giving the company a bad rep.<br/><br/>Onto my opinions!<br/>This is a budget monitor, it has BUDGET MONITOR ISSUES.<br/>The monitor looks great, sure. Though I will say, this monitor doesn't exactly achieve the whole ultrawide appeal to the fullest extreme. Yes, it's great. Though I feel wider would've been a little more genuine to the ultrawide claim.<br/>So far, I love it. Though I have noticed, if you don't mess with the settings properly, there is ghosting, dull looking image, and so on.<br/><br/>NVIDIA users should completely avoid this monitor.<br/>There's been countless reports of this monitor flat out not achieving 144Hz+ 100FPS+ goals on this panel. A lot of it seems to lean to this monitor being tied to FreeSync and not cross compatible.<br/>I use an RX 5600 XT and have hardly any issue.<br/>All of these things need to be taken completely into account before you buy this.<br/><br/>I can recommend this monitor to responsible people who are actually going to verify issues, and obtain the proper equipment before purchasing, as you should.<br/>I like it, I will likely be upgrading though. This is likely going to be a media monitor for me in the near future, just because I think I'd like stacked ultrawide panels and a different panel.<br/><br/>Gaming works fine on here, though there's a reported issue of ghosting at 200Hz. I can't test this myself, though I'm sure it's something that can be fixed.<br/><br/>Hopefully everything I covered was at least of some use to people, thank you for reading.</span>

<span>First off, one can't deny the benefit and beauty of so much screen real estate. The flexibility to view 2 documents/screens side-by-side, entire webpages with minimal scrolling, or multiple inputs using PIP/PBP, makes this a versatile monitor for work or play. My primary usage is for business applications in a work-from-home setting. I connect two laptops using the dual HDMI inputs in PC mode and extend the displays. It also includes a DisplayPort and headphone input for added versatility. This gives me the equivalent of three screens to view my work. Where this monitor really shines is crisp text even with 12 pt. fonts, minimal glare, accurate color reproduction, and the eye saver mode for extended viewing comfort (reduces blue light output). Although I can't comment directly with this monitor, it does feature FreeSync (FS) too, but my graphics card does not support it. I have seen FS in action elsewhere, and it is an added bonus if you are a gamer with a compatible card. You can also use the monitor for TV viewing due to the dual HDMI inputs, and the picture quality is very good. You will need to change the setting to AV mode, and you can also adjust the aspect ratios and other settings to suit your preferences.<br/><br/>There are a few aspects of the monitor that are not ideal for a user such as myself (work-from-home), although I suspect they would not impact most people. In the interest of transparency, I will include them in my review. As mentioned earlier, I use both inputs simultaneously throughout the day for viewing work content. When I have a need to switch to a full screen view of either of the inputs, I have to select the small jog button on the back of the monitor to change inputs. This requires it to cycle through the inputs each time until it reaches the one I want. There are no software shortcuts or hot-keys to simplify this process, and it is not uncommon for me to do this a dozen or more times a day. Not only is it a bit slow (5-7 seconds), I worry about the durability of the jog button with so much constant use. Also, there are no height or pan/swivel adjustments, only tilt. For me, I like to stand up periodically during the work day at my desk, so it is not at an optimal viewing angle during this scenario. The monitor is  very light, so it is easy to physically pivot the monitor, but then the stand moves things on your desk. Again, these are not deal-breakers, but small annoyances. Overall, I would fully recommend it to those looking for a widescreen monitor.  I did receive an incentive to review this product, but I hope you can see that I reviewed this as objectively as possible.</span>

<span>I use this monitor for CAD and office work at home and like it for several reasons. Its height and tilt can be adjusted. There were no dead pixels, and there is good connectivity. It even has built in speakers.  When connected via HDMI on a PC with an Nvidia graphics card, it may be necessary to go into the Control Center and set the output dynamic range to Full. On my Lenovo laptop, that wasn't necessary. The correct settings were automatically applied.<br/>The image quality is pretty much the same as that of a Lenovo monitor I have in the office. It is of the same size with an IPS panel, and cost more than double of the LG. Can't really see a difference. Good value for the money, if you can live with the tri-color design (black, white, silver).</span>

<span>The screen is clear and bright and the colors are surprisingly vivid for a VA panel.  Well that is if you manage to get it setup correctly and if it works properly in your setup.  Some of the choices made and the layout of the software (menu) make no sense to me.  For example, If you disable HDR on HDMI, then you also disable 4k60 and you also disable freesync on EVERY INPUT.  That's correct,  You can't disable HDR on HDMI1 and then play a game with freesync on the Displayport Input.  If you enable freesync on DP, it will force-enable HDR on the HDMI ports at the same time.  What does one have to do with the other ?  No clue.  This is further exacerbated by the fact that this monitor is far too dim to actually display HDR content.  Correctly configured HDR looks exactly the same as SDR when HDR is disabled.  It "supports" HDR in NAME ONLY.  That means it can technically decode an HDR stream, but it cannot DISPLAY HDR.  Since the monitor doesn't have the brightness needed, it shrinks the Dynamic range of the incoming HDR signal down until it can display it, that means it converts HDR into SDR.  And if you are unfortunate enough to try and watch SDR content while HDR is enabled because the dynamic range is shrunk down by more than half, it looks dark, grey and the colors are horribly washed out.  Since you cannot disable HDR without also disabling 4k60 (HDMI) AND disabling freesync on EVERY INPUT you are going to be stuck with it if you connect any source that supports HDR.  The best way you can use this monitor is to connect it to windows 10 and then disable HDR in windows advanced display settings.  Since you don't get any benefit from HDR you aren't losing anything by disabling it in windows.  If you planned on connecting a streaming dongle (or box) to one of the secondary inputs so you can watch TV while the computer is off this isn't the monitor for you.  If you get stuck doing that anyway, try and disable HDR on the dongle, or if you can't, turn the brightness and contrast up full and it'll be watchable, but still a bit dull looking.  *** Bottom Line : It's a pretty good SDR 4k monitor but they have ruined it by hacking FAKE HDR "support" onto a screen that can't actually display it. ***  Avoid this monitor unless you get a fantastic deal on it and you understand what your getting into.  It would be a much better monitor if they had just left their FAKE HDR out of it completely.</span>

<span>I purchased these monitors on prime day and took a chance on them so granted I kinda knew what I was getting myself into. Prior to purchasing these I had two flat screen 20" Acer monitors that I had been using for my home office setup, they still work great but it was time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>Overall the monitors are quite nice and they already fit my vesa mounts perfectly without any issue, so set up was very easy but then I noticed...the power bricks were differently sized...I checked the monitors themselves and they are indeed the same model and came in the same packaging BUT WHY ARE THE POWER BRICKS DIFFERENT!? Not only that but the length of the cables are different as well...the right Larger brick being longer (but feeling very cheaply made) and the left being short but seemingly good quality. Can I get the same sized brick thoooo?<br/><br/>The power bricks aside...gaming quality, picture quality, and screen quality are all satisfactory for my needs and doesn't break the bank. Again setup was easy ( I already had the Vesa mounts and arms, these do not come with them just in case you were wondering) and I'm happy with my new monitors.<br/><br/>One last thing and I'm not sure who this goes to. I did make sure to snap and picture and video just in case the monitors were busted during transport. The box in the picture shows that the monitors were basically put in a larger box but no additional padding was included. When I got the box...the monitors were just shuffling around in there and I did not see any labels saying that these could be fragile.</span>

<span>I gave this three stars because I think it's probably a decent monitor, especially for the money, but I haven't used them, and was tempted to give one star due to my issues.  I ordered two of these on a Prime Early Access Deal for just under eighty dollars each. I ordered two because I have a motley collection of mismatched monitors and I wanted two that match for my setup.  However, I should have paid attention to the review by Matthew M., because the monitors I received have the SAME model number, but they are DIFFERENT. One says "extra thin bezel" and has a diagonal viewable area of 21.5 inches, and the other says nothing about the bezel, has a quite noticeably thicker bezel, and has a diagonal viewable area of 21.45 inches.  They are SIMILAR but placed next to each other would look significantly DIFFERENT, which totally defeats the purpose I had in mind when ordering two "identical" monitors of the same model.  Amazon says they have had other customer complaints about this, but Sceptre does not distinguish between the monitors and gives them the same model number.  They (Amazon) recommended I order a third monitor, and if it matches one of the others, then I can send back the odd one.  So, if you want two of these monitors, and you want them to match, then to be safe, you need to order three.  Unless Sceptre decides to put out a third style with the same model number, in which case you might have to order four...<br/><br/>Update: I gave up and sent these back, it was too frustrating to try to get two that were the same.</span>

<span>This computer monitor is good for students and small home business owners because it is simple to use. It has speaker at the back which makes the sound project backwards and inaudible but still manageable. The best part is that the price is right for someone on a budget. I bought it when my 5 year old HP monitor suddenly died after a power outage and I desperately needed a monitor to complete important task. I ordered it from amazon and had it delivered the same day which was very helpful and commendable service. The same day delivery with amazon prime, such a good deal!</span>

<span>I have purchased 3 of these from Amazon in the past couple of years. When on sale the price dips below $90 which I think is a great value but I have only seen it happen twice in 2 years time. It's a good monitor with nice picture quality and good features.<br/><br/>That beings said though be careful if ordering more than one for a matching setup because as you can see from my pictures out of the 3 I have purchased one of them is smaller in size, shape, and has a slightly thinner frame around it than the other two even though I purchased all 3 from Amazon themselves and from the same listing that I have had saved in my shopping list for past couple of years.<br/><br/>The have the exact same model number except the slightly smaller one has a 1 at the end of the model number. I don't know if this is normal or a mistake but either way they all work great they just look different which is why I had to buy 3 total in order to get two that matched perfectly side by side for my dual monitor setup. I gave the 3rd odd ball one to my son because he needed an upgrade as well so it at all worked out in the end. Weirdly enough though the 3rd one I ordered matched the original one I ordered 2 years ago instead of the 2nd one that I had purchased a week ago so that means Amazon must of a mixture of both in their current inventory.</span>

<span>I usually use a 15 inch 4k portable monitor as my second screen in my setup, but have always considered getting a slightly bigger screen. I prefer a smaller sized monitor because as my secondary monitor I only use it to play videos or movies in the background, or connect to my other consoles like a Switch or Playstation. For this reason, it was essential for my secondary monitor to have built in speakers.<br/>This 22 inch monitor is a great size for my setup. It is very lightweight and quite thin for the most part. Its thin bezels make it a great addition to have in portrait next to my main monitor. The 1080p is sufficient for most of my needs, but coming from a 4k all the colors looked washed out and pale without HDR. Unfortunately this is one of the main reasons for returning this monitor.<br/>Another unfortunate quality of this monitor is the built in speakers, which was my deciding factor for returning it. The speaker quality is very poor, practically unusable. I understand that you're not supposed to expect stellar quality for built in speakers, but the sound is very thin and distorted with very low volume level maxed out. My portable monitor's speakers were more akin to a phone's speaker so you can hear things clear enough and the frequencies are more balanced. I was very disappointed with the Sceptre's speakers.<br/>Sadly for me, this monitor didn't meet my needs. But for what it is I think it's a decent monitor. It's excellent for smaller spaces or as a portrait monitor. Pretend these don't have speakers at all. I did a quick monitor test for it and I didn't experience any horrible light bleeding and as a used - like new item, no dead pixels present. It feels like a decent monitor for the $80 I spent on it. Will be returning.</span>

<span>I just moved from a retina iMac to a Mac Studio and was looking for a monitor that was as good as the retina in the iMac. First off, nothing is as good as the retina iMac screen except the new $1,500 Apple monitor. But, this LG gets you 99% of the way there. It takes a little fiddling to get the resolution right but after working with it a couple of weeks, I can't tell the difference between this monitor and the iMac when writing code - working with text. No idea about games or professional graphics. As far as casual watching YouTube and web browsing it's every bit as good as the retina iMacs.<br/><br/>I liked it so much, I got a 2nd one to connect to the Mac Studio replacing an older 27" Apple Thunderbolt display. The monitor works great out of the box with the included USB-C cable. I now have 2 connected via the USB-C cables and they are great. Probably the only downside is the built in speaker. It's no where near what the iMac's speakers sound like. To solve that one, I found a Nylavee sound bar and it fits snugly under the monitor. One other issue I have not solved yet and it could be self inflicted is the computer sometimes will not go to sleep from the sleep menu the first try. Another issue is open apps don't always stay on the 2nd monitor when the computer wakes up. This is a known problem when using non Apple displays so it might have to be something to live with until Apple has time to stop making new emojis and fix a few bugs in their software.<br/><br/>Now I'm back to what I had with the iMac, except now I have 10 cores and blazing speed.</span>

<span>I like this monitor. I love the height adjustment! It will be so much nicer than bending my neck to look down at my all-in-one. Hard to find a height adjustable monitor at this price.<br/>I did have a bit of trouble getting the operating manual. Spent way too much time looking for a manual for this model on the HP website. FINALLY noticed Get Product Support on the order details page. I soon talked with a very nice human being who sent me a cut and paste address for the manual.<br/>Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to use it much, other than to check screen quality. I ordered an HP desktop from another vendor at the same time. In my quest to get some questions answered about the computer, I found that HP had no record of the computer's serial number. After some googling, I found that is a thing with HP. They don't have a very reliable system for keeping track of their serial numbers. AND, if you have no serial number, there is no way to communicate with HP. Plus, you have no warrantee. Many people find out they have no valid serial number too late. Even the tech guy at the store where I bought the computer had had the same problem. He spent months (in vain) trying to get satisfaction from HP. I am still looking for a NON HP desktop.</span>

I recommend getting the instructions from HP online as the one-sheet instructions with pictures only is severely lacking.  The only issue I had was with the audio.  It comes with a audio cable with phone plugs on each end.  If you use this in conjunction with HDMI, you get no sound.  I found nothing that specifically said that in the instructions, but while trying to figure out why the built-in speakers weren't working, I unplugged the audio cable and immediately the sound worked.  It seems the HDMI cables carry the sound and the audio cable is not only not required, but blocks the audio signal.<br/><br/>HP should update their instructions to make that clear.</span>

<span>Using this monitor with my Macbook Pro. At first I tried to connect it via my own Hdmi cable and all I got was flickering, white dots and the screen going on and off sporadically. Then I connected it with the USB-C cable it came with and it worked perfectly fine. It will not work by connecting the cables to my dock station. I tried a different Hdmi cable and that also gave me the same issue. So after talking to Amazon customer service (which was no help) and then getting transferred to a LG tech rep, I played around with the resolution of the LG monitor and it seems to be working fine once changed to 2560 x 1080. When I used the Hdmi cable that it came with, it automatically set it to this resolution setting. I then switched it to what's recommended which is 3440 x 1440 and so far it seems to be working fine.<br/><br/>So, my verdict, just make sure to use the cables it comes with and don't bother plugging them into a docking station.</span>

<span>Best computer monitor I have ever own. I have haul this monitor around to many places in a travel trailer and yet it continues to function like new. The monitor sit on a hard table top in my trailer secure with a single bungee cord. I have transported it on long trap facedown in the trunk of my SUV with no padding. Yet it continues to function with no defect. The picture quality is the best. So, what do use this monitor for/with? Mostly use with my iPad 11 Pro (2020) for general computing. Since the iPad is my primary computer, I just get a big square (viewable area) in the middle of the screen with two black bars on the right and left side of the screen.  The viewable area is approximately about 23 inches diagonally. Some contents like movies and photos will fill the screen for view pleasure.  The blue color USB port in the back of the screen allows me to connect blue USB devices like flash drives and high performance cameras with no problem. Over all this was a good buy. I’m happy.</span>

Screen functionality is perfect and I couldn't be any happier with my purchase!  There are others that are cheaper but I landed on the LG since I couldn't really see any bad reviews that would persuade me to go a different direction.  I also liked the aesthetics of the stand and the overall look more than the others.  My use is for productivity not gaming, so I really didn't care either way for the LED backlights.
