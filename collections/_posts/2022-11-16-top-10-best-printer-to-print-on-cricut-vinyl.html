                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>Pros: Easy set-up, connects to computers via WiFi, small and compact<br/><br/>Cons: Just try and print something, anything, and this printer will sit on it until it's darn good and ready to actually print. Case in point: while searching through my orders to write this review, the return label I tried to print 10 mins ago finally decided to print, long after I'd closed the window and given up on seeing said return label.<br/><br/>I think this printer is possessed by Satan.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I’ve had this printer for almost two months now and have had zero issues. If you follow the set-up guide you shouldn’t have any problems. The set up was quick and smooth. I used one of the promo codes I got from other reviewers and got an extra month of free insta ink. The codes do work!<br/>I got this printer for school related stuff and I’m so glad I did! BUY IT! You won’t regret it.<br/>My only gripe is the paper stock tray is outside of the machine and slanted off the back, so you can’t load a bunch of paper at once. Other than that I love this printer!</span>

<span>Light weight and compact enough to not get in the way. Prints fast for me. Easy to assemble but to setup you will need to install the App on your phone or PC for it to work. If you have trouble printing right with Windows 10 it is due to MS update and there is a patch for it, the link in the app so you can install the driver. Wireless and you can print from anywhere to the printer. Also an option for HP+ and Instaink so they send you ink when you are low before you run out, you pick your plan on how many pages per month you use or change it whenever. Never run out of ink. The basic low end is only 99 cents a month!  You can choose to opt out of it. Cannot comment on durability and life because I just go it the other day. But with HP+ there is a 2 year warranty included.</span>

<span>Purchased the cricut to start making my own stickers, it's definitely easy to use. Working on understand the interface and messing with the settings, not hard but definitely need a sit down, an a few mins to feel more confident to use. During set up, use "cricut family" as the device and not "cricut explore 3" my only issue I had during set up. Overall 8/10.</span>

<span>The Cricut Explorer Air 2 is an excellent piece of hardware for the money. The extra speed of the Air 2 vs the original Explorer doesn't seem to come with a compromise to the quality of the cut.<br/>The machine's biggest flaw I've run into is the software. When you are still new to the Cricut or new to crafting in general the Cricut seems like a dream come true. Once you've gotten very skilled with using the machine the software is a hurdle. Design Space is a joke. Because they didn't want to invest in software instead of the web control site they built instead, even with 16GB of DDR4 memory the design space software hits the browser's RAM limit and crashes all the time, losing all your work. It does not have an auto-save feature to help with this either.<br/><br/>Uploading:<br/>Design space makes importing images a chore, being over simplified there are not enough tools and options to completely process a single image into different pieces for layers. Also if you don't do it all during upload, getting it done within design space will add on 3x the effort to just get a clean image you can work with. If you have a graphic that will need to be disassembled into pieces for assembly in design space, you have to upload the image multiple times and manually pull out all the details from each piece, saving them as separate uploads and then inserting them into a single project.<br/><br/>Design Space:<br/>-Once you've gotten past the upload issues, you're in a design space window ready to create. Design space loves to eat RAM. So much so that if your design is complex, the browser will crash or lock up. If these two things don't happen, great. Lucky you.<br/>-Depending on the browser you're using the software will scale images differently on the output getting cut on the mat. So even though you've made super precise designs that all have to fit together just so...your cut is going to be in a different place on the mat that you chose, or the design is not to scale making it useless. Since there is no compensation for this in Design Space, you end up doing a lot of costly trial and error to adjust for the difference in scale. Chrome works best, IE is the worst, Safari isn't much better.<br/>-YOU CANNOT EXPORT ANYTHING. NOTHING. Everything you design belongs to Cricut and is locked into Design Space. If you want to design something in Design Space, then export that for sending to say, a t-shirt shop because you initially were going to make everyone's shirts yourself, but found that it would be too large a job or inefficient on costs...too bad. You're going to do it on the Cricut, or you're not going to do it with Cricut at all.<br/>-There are too few tools for creating free form shapes. I have been trying and trying to use what's there to make a simple shape for a vinyl side stripe for my car.. forget it. The shapes are too generic, and unlocking the L and W dimensions only let's you drag a shape out in ways that won't allow you to change an angle of a curve to make a custom shape..you can work around it with a lot, a LOT of patience and time but will have to settle for simple shapes if you don't have a pre-made vector graphic to upload.<br/><br/>Cutting Mats:<br/>The cutting mats are really cool the way the grid more or less matches with the grid on the screen in Design Space. That said, they lose their sticky very fast for the price tag. If you're using these mats, you'd better keep that clear plastic shipping cover they all come with and stick it back on after every use. I have one mat that I kept the clear sheet on it and one that I did not...the difference is night and day. I've watched videos on how to restore the tackiness of the surface of the mat but it hasn't returned to its original tack, causing anything with a curl to peel up constantly. (like vynil from a roll..a staple of this machine's worth). You're going to need two mats minimum, one standard stick, and one light stick. (Green mat, and light blue mat). Card stock will come apart trying to use a standard stick mat, but peels off excellent on the light stick mat. Vynil on the other hand usually has a curl and needs the standard stick.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>This machine is still great, but the longer I use it the more I wish I had bought something that allows you to create things that don't have a Cricut logo on them. This machine is entirely focused on getting you into the Cricut ecosystem, having you subscribe to "Cricut Access", and pushing you into buying Cricut accessories.  I have not bought any cartridges, they seem like a throwback to the older machines, pre-Explorer. The cartridges seem like a waste of money, you get some of what you'll actually like and use...and the rest, like an album CD from a singles artist, is junk you'll likely not ever use. Everything that's in the cartridges are available al-la-carte in Design Space allowing you to buy them based on your project need individually..although the prices are stupid expensive for what they are generally. $5.00 for a single font choice. $10 for a project component. If you're not a designer, if you're not THAT serious about crafting and eating from Cricut's hand for content is fine for you, the Cricut is going to be amazing. If you are more skilled than beginner or have become skilled while using the Cricut and are getting more and more advanced, the Cricut begins to lose it's luster.<br/><br/>I've spent hours and hours daily on this device with the Design Space software. I've gone through learning from dozens of hours worth of online tutorials and youtube how-to's.. I've bought hundreds in materials and have dozens of active projects, I am an avid user. Take that for what it's worth, I've beat this thing up and here's what I have found. Hopefully this helps someone else before they buy.</span>

<span>This heat press is terrific for novices and “dummies” like me! I bought this to apply logos on to thin, satin, “budget-friendly” table runners for a school district fundraiser. I was worried an iron would be too hot for the delicate fabric.  The temperature control combined with the timer was invaluable for this project. 210 degrees for 15 seconds. I am very happy with this purchase.</span>

<span>Purchase Oct. 2021-I have been using this Cricut Easypress 2 for the past 10.5 months and happy with it. I use the same materials-parchment paper brand, Subli paper, Epson printer, same brand of polyester shirt. Did several projects with it and it turns out great.  About a month ago, It started burning my projects (w/ Temp set at 385F for 30 Sec. (recommended by Subli paper was 400F at 25-40 sec.) The heat press showed 385 at 30sec. but barely 10 sec into the process, it would burn the shirt and I noticed that the plate is so hot that it overheats beyond the heat settings.  I did a few more projects thinking it was just an isolated one, but a couple more shirts would burn.  This product is only good for less than a year. Not a good investment.  I'll try to contact the supplier and have this returned, if not, I would just advise-"buyers beware".<br/><br/>Update - i contacted customer service and the representative was very helpfull. They are sending a replacement to make good of their product warranty. I'm updating my rating to 4 star, as i might just have gotten a bad unit but otherwise the product is excellent.</span>

<span>After a little help from my friends, we discovered the Housing for the blade was not functioning correctly.  I went and bought a new housing and now my Cricut works as if there were never a problem.  Only 4 stars because Cricut did not reach out, they should include more stuff for the Maker 3 for those who have never owned a Cricut, and why are they forcing me to use bloothtooth.<br/><br/>I was so excited to receive my Cricut Maker 3, only to be sorely disappointed.  First, it was missing the USB cable to connect to computer - and they push to use blue tooth.  Second, the maker 3 does not come with all the stuff the Maker comes with, I guess they assume you own 3 or 4 of these machines and don't consider you are new to this so don't send additional stuff. I also received an older version of the Cricut Maker 3 as I received the silver cutting blade housing, rather than the improved gold colored one. Third, my machine will NOT cut through vinyl, even after changing the settings (as recommended by Cricut - and users on Youtube). Even after setting it to cut twice, it will not cut through the vinyl.  I had no idea my cricut would need a new blade immediately upon purchase as I assumed (my bad) that it would work properly at least the first few times using it.  So now I cannot use my cricut until I by new blades to see if that is the problem, and if it isn't then my cricut was an expensive item that is now useless.<br/>I will note that Cricut customer service was helpful with the missing items, but they still haven't arrived.  I have selected the correct material and mats for what I am trying to cut - I have friends that own cricuts and have been trying to help.  So disappointed.</span>

<span>I can't believe I just discovered this machine!  I am so addicted.  I'm having so much fun and in time will figure out how to market items I am making.  Until then, having the time of my life with this thing.  Crazy side note, my 24 yr old son LOVES it too.  He's been making his own designs with stickers, iron on vinyl, etc.  We just invested in a sublimation printer and a heat press so we can expand on the number of things we can make with this incredible machine.  There is a learning curve, so be patient with yourself.</span>

<span>I was so excited the day that this machine has arrived. I have had it almost a month now and I used it everyday. The only problem that I have on this machine is that when you do a cut project lets just say it takes 2 ore mats to cut for 1 project, after cutting on the 1st mat and when it ask for you to place the 2nd mat in it will do its thing and when you hit the play button it will not work it will error out. Then you have to cancel the whole project out and just make it cut that one mat out. If anyone knows how to solve this that would be really awesome. Other than that I love this machine..</span>

<span>...at least in terms of future proofing your investment. It can do it all so you will never have to worry about not being able to do something as your needs and interests evolve. I did not think I would want to cut wood and leather but glad I can since the purchase got me thinking about different things. I am amazed how integrated it is with my computer, seems like whatever I do wrong, like jamming the material, the software knows how to recover perfectly. I have not needed to reboot at all.<br/>The only things I did not like about this product was that Cricut has economized on the starting samples, so you will probably need to buy a mat, various tools and supplies. Look at the item list, for it does differ from a lot of the older Youtube unboxing videos, you may be surprised. A bundled kit might be a good idea.<br/>The other unfortunate thing is that Cricut, Amazon and others have frequent sales and promotions, less than 3 weeks have past and already there is a special price that is $50 less than what I paid. This is true of materials also. So, while you are trying to determine purchase, one might benefit by taking one's time, and get acquainted in not only the unit, but of the Cricut universe for the most satisfaction. Happy crafting.</span>

<span>I just had to say that I almost did not purchase this printer based on the many reviews stating how difficult the set-up was. My beloved Cannon printer had expired and family members recommended HP with their ink subscription. I wanted the HP Envy 6000e printer but it seemed like the set-up was going to be a nightmare based on comments from other purchasers. However, believing the best, I used HP Smart App on my desktop computer, followed its very clear directions, and was printing in no time at all! I was so surprised at the simplicity of set-up when using the HP Smart app. I do not know what problems other customers ran into- but really, I'm 75 years young and it could not have been easier. I tested printing duplexed articles, images, and photos. All crisp and beautiful! Now I have a ZIPPY and lovely HP Envy 6000e printer! Please don't hesitate to buy this printer because HP offers a lot of support should it be needed. I am quite pleased.</span>

<span>I am not a happy adapter of new technology.  When my printer finally gave out, I searched for an unused model of the same kind, no longer manufactured, and used it.  It had actually been free as an Apple Store promotion when I bought my computer.<br/><br/>But the color function never worked, so I was limited to black-and-white.  It was somewhat compatible with my newer MacBook, but I found it easier to use the older one.  Finally, I realized I needed to move forward and purchased a new printer-- which was immediately returned because it was so complicated to install and never actually worked.  So, back to the old one for a long period, until I decided to be brave and attempt a new model again.<br/><br/>Researching online the best models for my computer, I found this one was rated highly.  My previous printer was an HP and, although the quality was never quite as good as my previous model (and I can't even remember the brand), it was good.  Most important to me, it can be used with a USB connection, as I have had terrible luck with wireless anything.<br/><br/>When it arrived it sat in the box for at least two weeks, as I avoided the presumed hassle plus endless waiting for tech support.<br/><br/>I was thrilled to find out that it was actually quite easy to set up and install.  The ink cartridges separate the three colors, which of course means you aren't paying the exorbitant cost to replace a triple cartridge when only one color is depleted.  But they install as my old HP cartridges had, so not a challenge.<br/><br/>The happiest aspect is that connecting the WiFi is as simple as entering the password for the modem.  I was absolutely thrilled to find it instantly functional.<br/><br/>In fact, I did not rate the tech support for this review as I had no reason to contact them<br/><br/>I have thus far only printed, and haven't attempted to use the assorted other functions, like faxing or scanning (I have a separate scanner which I have used for years and doubt that the smaller version included with the printer would meet my needs, though it could be fine for various documents).  The printing quality for scanned photos is so-so and a bit streaky, but I only have attempted this with garden variety copy paper as a trial for modifications before taking it to be professionally printed.</span>

<span>Installing this printer was a little glitchy. I first removed the packaging material and plugged into power. I installed and ran the full software, not the HP Smart thing. When I ran the installer I choose to setup via wireless, It did not find the printer. I figured, whatever, and connected my USB cable. After installing the printer software via USB, I was able to double check the manual from HPs website to locate the option to change wireless settings. Under Tools &gt; Device Setup &amp; Software &gt; Reconfigure Wireless Settings. I was easily able to switch from a USB connction to wireless. It did prompt to remove the USB cable after though. The biggest annoyance was me not paying attention to the pictures. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it only had the top paper feed tray instead of an actual hidden paper tray drawer. I had to tell myself it's a cheap printer. The main reason I purchased this printer was for the multi page scanning ability. My old HP Photosmart 6510 was only a single page scanner and took forever to scan a multi-page document, then the file size was enormous. For as much as I'll use this, I couldn't justify spending $250-500 on a nice full featured printer. It's a printer, it prints, it does what it's supposed to do.</span>

<span> I'm very honest in reviews and wish to be helpful. I've had many printers since the 1990's, from dot matrix to laser to inkjet and 3D.<br/>I chose this as Mom wanted to print about 50 pages a month and didn't want to pay over $150. Because I love the HP ink program and the six months free it seemed like a simple task.<br/><br/>I found this printer on sale and read the reviews and advised she should get one step up, however she purchased this one. It took about an hour to open up and download the software from HP and then another fifteen to sign up for HP INK and complete the warranty info.<br/><br/>We've had the printer 3 months and when it's connecting to the internet network at home it's and to print documents in decent quality but extremely slow. I scans documents at a decent pace, however if you're wanting to make a copy of a simple document it takes longer than any printer I've owned. I contacted HP thinking I need different software or a hardware update but I had everything set correctly.<br/><br/>About 50 percent of the time we've got issues not being able to print from her new Chromebook as it can't locate the printer. The steps to reset the printer are not at all for the novice. It doesn't make sense to purchase this printer unless you're directly connected to it by USB connection to your device or computer<br/><br/>Skip this model. I hope this was useful.<br/>Peter and mom</span>

<span>This was a 5 minute set up- simple and easy.  I don't do a lot of printing at home, so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a printer.  This was a reasonable price.  It is not super fast, but I don't need it to be.  My only complaint is there is a blue light that stays on- it this the length of the paper tray.  The only way to shut it off is to shut the whole printer off.  According to HP you should not keep it off for some reason.</span>

<span>Heads up, they give you a pinch of black ink, so I didn’t know mine was out (the readout looked like it was half full) so after trying to figure out why it wasn’t printing….I finally put in a new ink cartridge and it works well.</span>

<span>I was trying to setup the printer using my phone (Samsung S9, so Android 12 software) and it just was not working. There are no instructions explaining how to connect the printer to the WiFi network in the first place. So I installed the HP Smart app and had it scan for the printer as follows:<br/><br/>(Make sure printer is on)<br/>Add first printer<br/>Get started<br/>Wifi<br/>Get ready to connect to printer: follow the first 2 steps. For the 3rd step, the only thing you need to pay attention to is that your phone's Bluetooth is ON. When you press CONTINUE then OK, it will prompt you to allow location permission (Precise), so accept (I chose: while using the app).<br/><br/>Now it'll try searching for the printer, since the printer isn't connected to your wifi of course it won't find it.<br/><br/>Click My Printers Not Listed - it'll search again<br/><br/>Click Find Printer -now it'll attempt to make a direct connection to the printer (not using your router). If the printer is on, and the wifi icon is flashing, the app should locate it and connect to the printer. If the WiFi button light is not on and flashing try pushing and holding the button for a few seconds.<br/><br/>Follow the prompts to connect the printer to wifi. Select the correct wifi to connect to your wifi router, enter the password. And now you should finally be connected to the printer through wifi.<br/><br/>Just following the prompts to finish the printer setup.</span>

<span>I just finished setting up the printer so far, so good. It took less than 5 minutes to connect to wireless.  The print quality is good and the compact size of the printer is exactly what I was looking for. I don’t do a ton of printing so it’s perfect for what I need. So far I’ve printed from my iPhone and iPad with absolutely no problems. I haven’t tried printing from my MacBook yet because I’m too lazy to go it right now but if there are any problems I’ll update. If you are looking for an inexpensive, compact printer for basic printing go ahead and get this one.</span>

<span>This printer comes with VERY FEW printed instruction sheets, which one would assume means it is simple to setup. Unbox, plug in, insert ink cartridges, connect via USB, WiFi direct or add to your WiFi network and voila!<br/><br/>Except when I plugged it in and opened the front panel to install the ink cartridges, I could hear/see the cartridge carrier shake and vibrate but it would not move to the open area to allow installation. I looked inside for one of those large red/orange tabs that sometimes secures movable components, but none were visible. I checked the instructions AGAIN - nothing. I viewed the setup/get started videos on the HP website, no mention of anything to remove.<br/><br/>Error code 3E on the panel which means 'carriage malfunction' (no surprise). Instructions on how to clear the error were about removing paper jams. Have yet to print anything, so no paper has been through it. After 30 minutes of back and forth I am ready to box it up and return it and as I turn it over, I hear a 'rattle'....hmmm.  I shake a bit, more rattle. I look inside and shake and waaay in the back, I see a small white plastic piece. I cannot reach it with my hand, so I continue to turn and shake until this piece falls out (see picture).<br/><br/>Plug it back in and the carriage centers as it should and I can proceed with installation.<br/><br/>While the installable HP printer app is well designed and easy to use, and there are numerous pages of instructions you can print by pressing buttons on the printer, HP should include just a little more information - especially about the carriage lock AND use one that is a more visible color.<br/><br/>Another potential problem is if you sign up for 'Instant Ink' - the ink delivery service.<br/>This service requires connectivity from the printer to HP using a webservice. Unfortunately, this feature was disabled by default (at least on this printer). When I tried to register I kept getting a rather innocuous error. After a bit of frustration and way too much time, I found reference to how to enable it, but using a browser to connect to the printer directly. Cool - except I was prompted for a password, which wasn't provided anywhere. None of the 'usual defaults' worked, nothing listed on the HP site/web search worked but I found mention of how to reset it to not need a password, which I did. This also reset the WiFi settings on the printer - phhht.  Fortunately, the HP software made setting that up, AGAIN straight forward, but I mean - COME ON!<br/><br/>All total, I spent approx 2hrs of frustration getting this tiny box setup when it should have been &lt;30 minutes.<br/><br/>As a result of these experiences, I rated this printer 1 for tech support due to setup issues and 3 overall.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with WiFi Direct, be aware that when you are connected to the printer you are NOT connected to your internet connection. I've had more than a few friends get frustrated by that.  I recommend you avoid it unless you have used it before. It's benefits in your average home environment is, IMO- limited.</span>
