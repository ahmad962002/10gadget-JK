<span>I bought this laptop to dip my toes in the water for PC gaming and also to use as a personal PC for emails, browsing the web, etc. I used a separate monitor as I wasn't using this as a mobile gaming set-up. The version I got with the i7 and 3060 laptop GPU was great for warzone. I was able to run well above standard graphics on Warzone at about 100FPS. I never had any issues with overheating, although I did buy a cheap "fan deck" to put the laptop on. The fan isn't quiet, but that is to be expected with any gaming laptop, especially when under stress. I have since bought a full gaming desktop as I realized I did want to fully make the jump from console to PC but I gave this laptop to my wife who plays the Sims and Age of Empires and she has seen HUGE performance boosts compared to her older Asus Nitro 5. Her games run much smoother on this laptop. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get into pc gaming or someone that is looking for a multi-use portable PC. Be sure to check the specs and reviews for the specific model you're buying as Amazon shows reviews for similar pcs with different internal specs.</span>

<span>Well, it really is premature to write a review about a laptop on the day it was received but I was loving how it felt in my hands that I just had to say a few things about it.<br/><br/>It is by far the best, fastest laptop or pc I have ever owned. I was so impressed with how fast programs seemed to download and install. It was pretty amazing to me. Even in comparison to a relatively new and powerful laptop owned by my wife, this was far quicker and snappier.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in finding out that it uses a proprietary charger. I was really hoping it would be a usb c charger. Can't win them all.<br/><br/>I had to settle for a non touch laptop. In order to get the other components, the graphics card and the processor etc, I wasn't able to find a combo with a touchscreen so I had to settle for this. But this is not a negative on this laptop.<br/><br/>Even coming out of the box you could tell it was premium. The packaging was really good and protective. It even came inside a soft cloth bag. First time I've had a laptop come that way.<br/><br/>The screen is sharp and very clear. Obviously, I still need to test it and put it through it's paces to see how beautiful things will look but the few video clips i put up sounded and looked great.<br/><br/>Update: I reduced the rating by 1 star all related to 1 thing. Battery life. I lowered the refresh rate on the screen to 60hz with intent to increase it if and when I game. With settings like this, the laptop seems like it would run for around 5 hours but that's an estimate. And that is not bad. Throw in something that uses the gpu and you get very little. In fact, I was running a golf simulator program called e6 and casting the screen to a 2nd laptop screen. In that mode, this laptop died in about an hour. I shouldn't be surprised though as nobody would game on battery power... Not for a serious gaming session. I still thought I'd get more than 1 hour.<br/><br/>Other than that, the laptop performance is spot on and pretty amazing. Crisp and snappy... Fast. Coming from a 6 yr old unit... This thing feels amazing in comparison. Startup is done in a matter of seconds and away you go...</span>

<span>I do a lot of video editing and it's relatively okay for that. But when it comes to just everyday work it's not easy to use. The cursor jumps around so you'll be typing in one place, but your cursor jumps somewhere else.  So then you've got to figure out how much chaos you created in your document and try to fix it. It's very annoying.</span>

<span>So this was listed as very good condition. Under Amazons description for that all essentials to operat and in good working order.<br/>It came to us on time but its was well used to the point that the keys where wore off the screen was broken or creased you can see it in the pics the charger was a European plug and the unit would not power up(could not plug into power) but batteries where completely dead.<br/>Sent the unit back and 8 days after they received it i am still waiting on my refund of over a thousand dollars very disappointed in Amazon right now</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span>this is my first time having a asus laptop and it is just excellent! The multicolor backlit keyboards are beautiful and the computer is looks and feel very sturdy. The features  are very convenient; i can see my phone notifications, transfer calls from my phone to my laptop, and drag tabs to my phone with myasus and xglide. it has three modes: silent, performance, and turbo which I find very useful for different task. However, I gave it a 4 star because the battery life isn't as long as they describe and also one of the keyboard's keys fell out and I had to reattach but it was minor problem so not that serious. I’m also writing this to disclose about my 90 day extended warranty.</span>

<span>As my first gaming laptop I couldn’t be happier. I bought this on sale for just under $600. 8gb ram, I added a 4gb stick I had in a damaged laptop and now have 12gb ram (which has worked just fine and I have noticed the increase in speed). 500gb SSD that I just upgraded with another 512gb SSD for $43. I have played halo infinite and it looks great. Looks as good as it did when using the Xbox series S. This laptop upgrades easily. I put the ram in and then the SSD in under 5 minutes. Seems solid, not flimsy. Haven’t noticed screen brightness issues. Have used for job interviews using Microsoft teams and the camera and speakers and mic work great. Overall very happy. You don’t need to spend thousands to get a good gaming rig and work/education rig.</span>

<span>I'm not a fan of Windows at all, however I decided to leave it as dual boot with Linux. As is usually the case with laptops, battery life is much better in Windows than it is in Linux. That is an inherent issue with Linux and not a detriment to the laptop itself.<br/><br/>Running Arch Linux, all of the hardware was found automatically. The only issue is not being able to cycle through the different modes of keyboard lighting. It's fine because I usually leave that turned off anyway. I could probably find a way to get it to work, but I don't really care to.<br/><br/>The fans are quiet, the keyboard feels positive and comfortable, the display is very good. I have no complaints.</span>

<span>I got this product on sale for $599, and it is more than worth the price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Battery life is fairly decent. The only time the battery would burn itself was when I was using additional monitors and graphic intense activities at the same time. Even when the battery may be low, the charge speed is very powerful, and you should have full charge in an hour even if your using the laptop.<br/>-Processor is a beast. i5 10300H has the firepower to run some games that normally require high specs. Dark Souls III runs very smoothly on normal settings, haven't been able to test Elden Ring yet. (This may require more ram.) I'm also able to hook up a monitor, among other peripherals, as well as have other things open, like Discord, without a problem.<br/>-Screen. With 144hz (or 144 visible frames per sec.), you don't need additional monitors to see just how good your games are running.<br/>-RGB Keyboard. Can change how the lights appears, as well as their intensity, or turn them off if you don't need them.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-RAM. With only 8gbs of RAM, you may yourself upgrading to something more using the extra empty RAM slot. Luckily, this laptop is designed to be easily upgraded with a poppable bottom. All you need are screwdrivers that fit and a RAM cartridge of your choice.<br/>-Storage. Again, with only 512gb of space, you may find yourself upgrading using the empty extra M.2 SSD spot. One thing to keep in mind is that this laptop will only support up to Gen 3, so make sure to save some money and not but a Gen 4 SSD, as you will not get the full power out of it.<br/>-Graphics Card. The GTX 1650 isn't exactly the best graphics card out there, but it gets by for meeting recommended settings on older games, while meeting minimum requirements for newer more graphic intense games.</span>

<span>My son sent me the page for this, knowing what my desired specs and budget were.  Then I read the reviews and was almost scared away.  He talked me into at least trying it and I am so so glad I did!!<br/><br/>I love everything about it.  I am not a gamer, the games I play generally do not require high specs.  However, I do photo and video editing, and a lot of multi-tasking.  This laptop works well for everything I do.<br/><br/>I have not experienced any problems with the display, you do have to make sure the cord clicks into the back, and the keyboard has a nice feel to it (I type a lot).  My only cons are the battery life (3-4 hours), and I do wish I could adjust the light on keyboard.  I don't mind the red, but do find it annoying that it doesn't light up until the first keystroke.  I often use the computer in a dim or dark room, so finding that first key is annoying,  There should be a light up key.Like hitting space to light up and it doeant make a space if used before typing anything else.  That is a minor thing tho.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I am very pleased with this laptop and hope it lasts me as many years as my previous one did.</span>

<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>I'll admit that I thought this PC was too good to be true: amazing price as well as extremely good specs. The other reviews would have you believe this was doubly the case: poor packaging would lead to a PC that was dead on arrival. I have to say my experience was anything but that.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I did see the UPS driver straight-up drop the box, and the box with the laptop is packaged inside a box that's much bigger such that rocking around definitely happened. However, all that said, the laptop arrived in working condition. I checked the specs upon setting up, and everything is as advertised.<br/><br/>I don't game as much as I used to, but it's good to know I have a machine that's ready to go full blast when needed. In the short time that I did do some gaming, I have to say that everything ran smoothly, and heat is a total non-issue. Admittedly, the fan can be kind of loud if you're in a very quiet space, but nothing too crazy.<br/><br/>I don't have the display lit up, but it is very pleasing to the eye if you're into that kind of thing. It used to be that you needed a laughably large chassis to support such a powerful CPU/GPU, but we've come a long way tech-wise. As such, this 15'' laptop is much more compact than my previous 17'' one.<br/><br/>Would definitely purchase again if I had any need to.</span>

<span>This laptop gets hot quick when gaming, even after I bought a cooling pad, even had to get a new keyboard because playing on a hot keyboard got old quick, wish it had more fans and wish the fans were more powerful, other than that tho this laptop is pretty good, would recommend upgrading ram for it, slapped in some 32 gbs for this thing and works great now, good purchase over all</span>

<span>Maybe it's because I'm upgrading from an ancient desktop but this computer is blazing fast, runs everything at high settings and high framerates. Battery life is low if I'm running games with high graphics. Storage is only 512 GB which, after I had installed seven games and my Spotify collection, was 97% full already. No camera or BD/DVD/CD-Rom drive. Touch pad is ok but it's better to just get a mouse. Computer runs hot so make sure you have something between your legs and the laptop to counter the heat. My biggest complaint is that UPS was supposed to ask for a signature on delivery but they just left it on my doorstep. Thankfully I was home at the time and watching for it.</span>

<span>This is my first gaming pc so I am new to all of this. but from my first introduction to this... wow! It has blown me away and impressed me. I can't go deep into the specs but I can give you a bit from my experience so far.<br/><br/>I mainly use this for gaming nothing else. Nothing productive so I will only share my thoughts from the gaming perspective. I mainly play Warzone, Battlefront II, Fornite and Fall guys on this thing. And with every single game it blows through it easily<br/><br/> Everything is smooth with the 144hz display. The display is nice 1080 I believe. I wish it could go brighter but its still very good. Sharp and so. The speakers are ok. they're good but not loud, my iPads speakers are way better than this thing and for around the same price but considering this is for gaming and you'll likely have a head set plugged in which I do so I don't care much about the weak speakers. the power is great, like I Said I just play a few games but they run amazing. Battery life is ok, not the best. Definitely DO NOT play Warzone on the battery, it'll just eat right through plus drop frames like crazy. ALWAYS be plugged in to get the best performance. IF you're playing games like Fall Guys or Cloud gaming I think you'll be alright.<br/><br/>I have loved every moment of this. Lots of features I could go on about. IF you are like me and just want to game on it with about the same games as I am, this is perfect for you. Its a beautiful nice display that you can also hook up to a Monitor or TV and game from that. Works great. I recommend this for a first timer like me BUT please do your research before and CHOOSE what's best for you. and before I leave you, don't get too excited and mess something up when you get a gaming pc. I am coming from Xbox so a whole NEW world of gaming to explore.</span>

<span>All and all, it's a decent lap top, but I don't like being deceived (lied to). The 85w max on the gpu which is listed at 130w is a pretty big lie and makes the 3070 a 3060 more or less. I'm returning. Get accurate descriptions!</span>

<span>The laptop works great, feels and looks amazing, for everything from gaming to doing cad or other programs. However the worst part is even with all the battery saving and performance lowered to minimal it never gets more than 2hrs of battery life when being used lightly. This wouldn't be optimal unless you had an outlet within 5ft of you every other hour to charge it back up or just keep it going for longer. Kinda sad for portable uses but then again the power consumption seems to back the parts it packin. Definitely showing that the 12th gen intel and 3070 are power hungry.</span>

<span>Bought this to replace the Desktop i built in 2015,  so far im impressed,  i recommend ordering Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22 with it, and a ssd as space is limited,  i had a 256 gig sitting around that i popped inside it.  With the upgraded ram i have to say it runs most things i throw at it,  games that area few years old run at a great frame rate, and more recent things like farcry 6 im getting about 40 - 55 frames,  so a little subpar but definitely playable.  I bought a laptop for the portability not the graphics capability so im absolutely ok with it.  the one gripe i have is popping open the clamshell case to perform the ram upgrade and install the SSD was more difficult than i think it should be,  it made me miss the days they left a little trapdoor port for easy access and upgrades.  i got through it and got everything together but it was a frustrating experience.  other than that great purchase for the budget gamer</span>

<span>I bought this because it was on sale, I play some lightweight games (Emulators, WoW) and I use AutoCAD for engineering classes. I needed something that had some "umpf". This computer is perfect for both CAD software and Video Games. The computer itself is very solid, clean and looks really cool. The screen is beautiful. I really like that the keyboard is back-lit red; I do a lot of homework late at night (I'm an expert procrastinator) and it's nice to be able to actually see the keys. It doesn't seem to have any overheating issues, I've been playing WoW off and on and the fans barely even make a sound.

<span>As someone who wanted a laptop that wasn't too high-end (so I wouldn't mourn over its loss) and something that wasn't too weak, I am thoroughly satisfied with this purchase.<br/><br/>Graduating from an ROG "ultra gamer laptop", the outer casing is such a breath of fresh air. The thing is fully enclosed with a sleek black. The only thing that offsets the darkness is the piercing red of the shield and the keyboard. This is definitely where the "less-is-better" approach shines through - I'm not ashamed to bust this laptop out in a public area. Really grateful for the design choice here.<br/><br/>In terms of performance, I have no qualms with it. As someone who plays Rocket League, Heroes of the Storm, and Fortnite, I can run these games on medium at 100-120fps. While it does get hot, it does arguably better than my older laptop, sitting under 80C during load. If you can get to knowing how to use the gamer profiles on Dragon Center, it'll help you a TON. While the presets have their own fan curves, you can also set your own. While I'm not gaming on battery, I am still doing some creative work like Photoshop/Krita. Even then I could use it for a while before I have to plug it in - though I usually have it plugged in so I don't have much experience on this end.<br/><br/>I can't say too much for the keyboard. This classic laptop chiclet design is a far cry from my main mechanical keyboard, but it's nothing foreign from laptops of old which I'm fine with. Bonus points to having the enter key and backslash kind of combine to look like a reverse L enter key! How charming.<br/><br/>A word of advice? Get a USB hub. This is constantly the issue I have with laptops - they'd probably have to increase the form factor to fit in more. All in all, this is a solid machine. I'll update this in case anything breaks.</span>

<span>Spilt a drink across it immediately so now the keyboard is sticky but that's only complaint about it lol. Got this as a gift for my daughter who's beginning to get into more resource intensive games. She was pretty floored how well it handled all the games she plays (Mostly through Roblox) on max settings. It really does look good and loads them much faster now as well. If it breaks due to my catastrophic cluts moment, I'll probably buy her the same model again ($600). Might upgrade to one of the higher end graphic card models</span>

<span>First off, I want to acknowledge what a great value overall this laptop is. It is specced well for the price point, and the white with teal only lights is drool worthy imo. Their needs to be more laptops with color options besides every shade of black, and 20k shades of grey. It literally turns heads in the library when I take it out lol. The plastic made case doesn't feel cheap or low quality at all. When I got it I upgraded to 24gb ram from 8gb. I didn't know the 8 was soldered onto the mobo, and that's my fault for not doing enough research. Also when I got it I added a 2nd 1tb wd black ssd, along with the nonamer brand one it came with. There's no Xtra thermal pad for the 2nd m.2 slot  that comes with the laptop, and there definitely should be. We'll see if heat is an issue down the road for it.Adding this 2nd ssd , unbeknownst to me they are put into some sort of raid mode,by the bios,not 0,not 1, and it can't be changed. The bios is absolutely atrocious. Almost nothing can be tinkered with.  even in advanced options(f7) anything interesting is greyed out i.e. graphics options,storage options, secure boot stuff. it's despicable that you can't change any of this stuff, and really bent me jaded me on this laptop abit. If your braindead and just want to game, this is optimal. If you want to squeak every bit of performance, and optimize YOUR laptop like I have my whole life, this isn't that laptop.ASUS cuts off every avenue for enhancement, and they use the Intel dynamic tuning, and Intel management engine to put a kibosh on any attempt to subvert this garbage. The screens good not great, sound is good not great, also im pretty sure they turn off some of the VM features of the i7 chip this laptop came with the vt-x. So power users need not apply here. 'Nuff said.</span>

<span>My laptop works pretty good. I had a couple of technical issues (eg NVidia video card disappearing) and tech support was absolutely unhelpful (after spending a very long time with them).<br/>Check the specs on the machine you are buying because there are similar models with different features. I did not get some of the features I expected to get (and what I saw in promotional videos and even unboxing videos). Be careful.</span>

<span>This is my first gaming laptop! I’ve been looking for awhile for a good gaming laptop. I’ve looked through Razer, Asus, Gigabyte mostly the big brands then I saw this Lenovo Legion and I thought to myself why I’m I looking at those high end gaming laptops when it’s my first gaming laptop and Knowing that I would probably just toss it around and it’ll just get wreck in my backpack and stuff. So why not save some money. For a thousand bucks this exceeded my expectations, it runs triple A games flawlessly with no problems at all. It’s super fast out of the box. Only bloatware it came with was McCafé so I didn’t do much cleaning, it was ready game. I never paid attention to Lenovo before, didn’t know they make good gaming laptops but actually this laptop looks good, it doesn’t scream I’m a gamer, I can take it out in class and at the library without gaining much attention, Very stealth looking. It’s all plastic but the build feels solid. The fans are loud as always with any gaming laptops. The keyboard is soft, feels good to type on. The best thing is that the laptop is upgradable, the 2x RAM, 2x SSD, Wi-Fi and battery are easily accessible without voiding warranty, yes Lenovo allows those upgrades so don’t worry. The hybrid mode aka mux switch is good to have too. The screen looks good without even calibrating it. There are lots of air vents specially a huge vent under the laptop so very good cooling. If you’re on a budget student gamer well this is a good choice for you. For a thousand bucks you get an AMD Ryzen, RTX series, SSD, dual channel RAM, IPS fast monitor, Mux switch, windows 11, 3 months xbl ultimate sheesh can’t beat that.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Llevo mes y medio probado la máquina y no ha tenido ningún tipo de contratiempo en su funcionamiento. Recibí exactamente lo que el proveedor describe.<br/>Honestamente tenía un poco de recelo en pedir éste artículo por que en las reseñas de envíos a Latinoamérica mencionaban sucesos lamentables. Lo que decidí hacer por la oportunidad que tenía fue pedir el artículo a casa de un familiar que vive en Estados Unidos y posteriormente éste familiar me lo envió a la Ciudad de México, no sé si ésto haya ayudado en realidad a recibir el objeto adecuado.<br/>Finalmente, aún así me salió barata comparando con su precio en México.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I have built my own computers since 1999.  I know what I want in them and how much it's gonna cost me.  I never buy the latest stuff, I keep it about a year old and has served me well.  But this time after a friend's advice I dove into the gamin laptop and am very pleased.  No it's not the legion 7 but it's new and has what I need.  Quick fire up, minimal bloat software, slapped in another 1 TB drive, created my local account, updated everything, loaded MW and I was off to the races.  Great machine.  I will be getting the 80 watt battery to give it the power boost it needs to really open it up.  Very happy.  We'll worth it and highly recommend.<br/><br/>8/23<br/>Quick update.  This laptop is great.  I have the HDR setting turned on with no issues.  4k will only run at 60 fps but the picture is outstanding and doesn't really task the processor or vid card.  I recommend the RAM upgrade.  It comes with 16 gig of ddr4 and is actually the sweet spot for most everything but boosting to 32 gig of ddr4 really gives it a lot more breathing room to perform.<br/>I would get a stand or something for airflow.  I love AMD but they are a hot runner compared to Intel.  But this thing does have an awesome cooling system as long as you've got the bottom vents unobstructed.  Heat is the enemy.<br/>Windows 11 is actually a very good OS.  I found a cheap metal stand that works perfect.  I work in Engineering IT and have delt with every os since win 95 so seen the good and the bad.<br/>Just my 2 cents and hope it helps some folks</span>
