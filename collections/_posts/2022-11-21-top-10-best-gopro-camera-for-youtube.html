<span>First one was a charging dud, this one started up right away!  One reason we buy through Amazon is the great customer support regarding returns.  Our first GoPro ordered a couple of weeks ago refused to charge no matter where plugged in and we couldn't get the Hero main screen to show even with just small battery amount it came with.<br/><br/>We returned and requested a replacement GoPro which arrived today.  We turned on before charging the battery fully to check due to the previous issue and this one started up and showed the main screen immediately.  Kudos to Amazon for prompt replacement!<br/><br/>Now to the camera.  We are senior sometimes "geeks" and enjoy tech things.  This is our first GoPro so we were excited to receive and start testing.  I will say that unpacking and removing the camera from the box top mount was more challenging than expected LOL.  We love the touch screens but had nothing in the included "how to" booklet related to sound.  During test video recording we weren't able to hear anything, saw nothing in preferences to help adjust volume and ended up using good old online "search" to find out that we needed to swipe up during playback mode to check the volume.  Once we increased this we heard the sound recorded.<br/><br/>This is just a preliminary report as we plan to record more and save to my Mac to use IMovie and then create a DVD.  We will use the camera for our cruise vacations, especially beach and snorkel time.  We always create 1-2 hour movies to bore our friends and family.<br/><br/>The reason for the 4 star is that the battery seems to drain quickly and also wish the camera was just a little bigger since we won't be mounting to a helmet or chest, just a small float type stick.</span>

<span>I upgraded from a GoPro 4 Black. Not much difference in video quality that i could notice. Bit rate seems to be slightly higher with the 5 than my 4 Black, it it's recording more details in 1080p. I don't really have a use for 4K as the max frame rate is only 30fps. I need at least 60fps and 1080p is more than enough for what I use the GoPro for.<br/><br/>The main selling feature for me is the image stabilization and GPS for telemetry overlay in the video. I did a quick test in my car and the overlay feature is nice as it will show my speed, G force, and all the other good stuff. I plan to use this for my motorcycle rides through the canyon. I can see the electronic image stabilization working on the video play back. Seems like I'm using a 3 axis gimbal which is cool. I think it actually electronically stabilizes all 3 axis (pitch, roll, and pan). It seems to work pretty good on my car test shot, but not sure how well the image stabilization works when holding the GoPro hand held or using it on a motorcycle which has more vibrations.<br/><br/>The cons about the newer GoPro 5 Black:<br/>1. The built in mic sucks. Audio sounds really muffled and not clear like my GoPro 4 black. Probably due to the water proof design. It sounds very similar to using a GoPro in a full waterproof case.<br/>2. You can no longer plug in an external mic directly and need to use an expensive adaptor. This sucks as you can only use the adaptor that GoPro sells and this is not cheap and adds more stuff just to use an external mic.<br/>3. The screen is required to access the main settings. You can still change the camera settings without the screen, but not able to change the other settings such as WiFi, GPS, and other things like the previous GoPro models. I have to remove my motorcycle gloves to use the touch screen. Also I heard the touch screen doesnt' work under which I haven't tested yet.<br/>4. The GoPro 5 Black is advertised as waterproof, but I'm not going to take that chance without using a real waterproof case. Ive read some reports from other people that their camera lens fogged up when using the GoPro in water or water got inside and fired their GoPro. GoPro doesn't cover water damages. Too much money to test out so purchasing the insurance may be a good option if you going to use the GoPro around water.<br/><br/>Overal I give this GoPro a 5 Star rating because it does exactly what I expected. There are other sellers selling refurbished ones for cheaper but I choose to buy new as I wanted to have the best and not a second hand unit. Also can't bet Amazon's same day shipping for dirt cheap and saved me the time of having to go to the retail store out of my busy schedule to buy one.</span>

<span>Great camera. GoPro's products are legendary in the action cam world. But what makes this new Hero5 stand out is the telemetry data. As far as I know only the Hero 5 and Hero 5 Black offer this option. The camera is super easy to use, charges quickly using the included USB-C cable, uses a standard Micro-SD card (I recommend a Lexar high-performance one at least 32GB), comes with a mount and works with ALL of the GoPro mount products both from GP and third party.<br/><br/>My only complaint is battery life, between the GPS for telemetry, wifi to aim and check the views, the battery itself don't last as long as I'd like. I can get one good bike ride in before its near dead. I found that not using the wifi connection helps, get the camera aimed (easier when on your helmet if you do via wifi) then turn it off.<br/><br/>Getting telemetry onto your videos is a little daunting, as it requires you to go out of your way to do a bunch of extra steps before popping the video into GoPro Studio, but its worth it to see the speed, direction, path etc overlayed on your video. My recommendation to get from Quik to Studio is to do the following... copy over your video segments, don't let the software do it for you. Aim the Quik and Studio software to the same location. Manually import the segments into Quik, double click one and turn on all the telemetry items you want to use, then it uses that setting for everything else. Trim that clip (CMD-T on Mac), it will overlay the telemetry data and offer a Save button, add on -telem or something at the end and save it, repeating this for each clip. THEN import the new -telem clips into Studio and lay them into order, add music etc. Just my preference. Quik offers only 2 means to export otherwise, FaceBook and YouTube.<br/><br/>I am loving the Superview super wide angle, it's my most favorite, and yes it does distort the view a bit but it makes more of the scene fit on screen and gives a sense of speed to bike rides etc.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it offers all the wonderful stuff you expect from a GoPro, rear touch screen, voice control (awesome for turning on and off recordings and shutting off the camera when done while its helmet mounted), works with all the mounts, takes top notch video including 4K for those who want to get the ultra high quality video. I find personally that the 1080p is more then enough for my needs and can do 60fps as well.<br/><br/>It's not super heavy, so when mounted you don't notice it, and it doesn't want to move when you hit bumps if you use a good tight mounting kit. Overall, well worth the money, and for GoPro fans, its a no brainer.<br/><br/>I use this along with several Sessions to record car, bike and motorcycle rides. And I wear it with the chesty on walks/hikes. Another great GoPro product with tons of features, making it a no brainer if you are upgrading or getting a new GoPro for the first time and want all the bells and whistles.</span>

<span>It must be noted that for the first few days of owning this camera, I considered it a terrible investment due to the issue of the GoPro experiencing problems with the SD card. I was seriously regretting my purchase until I got it figured out, and for that, this product unfortunately loses one star for me because it was a major pain until I got it working correctly. It is something that a user should not have to deal with right out of the box. I will post at the end of this review what I did to correct the issue, and if you're experiencing SD card errors I would expect it will clear your problem up as well.<br/><br/>With THAT out of the way, you can rest assured that this camera is by far one of the best ones your money can buy available on the market today. The image quality while recording at 4K is stunningly beautiful, not to take away from the great quality at 1080P or 720P, as those deserve their due credit too. The sound recording quality is noticeably better when compared to the previous model Hero4 due to the improved microphones in this model. I haven't messed with all the features in this camera yet but so far I think it's an awesome looking, great performing, fantastic little piece of equipment to have in your camera arsenal.<br/><br/>As for the SD card error message displayed after about :10 seconds of recording: I purchased a SanDisk Extreme 32GB UHS-I micro SD card as recommended by GoPro themselves to be a trusted card in their device. No matter what I did... no matter how I formatted it... THIS CARD DID NOT WORK IN MY CAMERA. PERIOD. I instead went out and purchased a PNY 32GB UHS-I micro SD card and I have not had a problem since. Hopefully the same thing works for you if you're experiencing troubles with this great camera as well!<br/><br/>Here's a link to the micro SD card that actually worked for me: (https://www.amazon.com/PNY-Elite-X-32GB-microSDHC-Adapter-UHS-I/dp/B01G26R13Y/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484790784&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=pny+micro+sd+card)</span>

<span>As to the camera itself, I honestly cannot complain much. The battery life is short lived, however, that’s more due to the quality of video I’m filming.  Aside from that, there are add-ons that I can purchase that will help prolong battery life...in a way.<br/><br/>My biggest problem??  GoPro, in their less than infinite wisdom, have put out a quality product, yet....here it comes....REQUIRE the user to use a (for Windows-based computers) Windows 10 (ONLY) app to do any kind of video editing.<br/><br/>SERIOUSLY!?!?

<span>The video on this is great.  The picture is always clear and it stabilizes very well.  I many use this on my motorcycle and even when I use a bar mount, there is still no discernible shake, and for reference, there are many instances when the vibration from the motor make my mirrors blurry.  The battery, though, is big disappointment.  You MIGHT get an hour of video before it dies.  You also can't plug it in and record at the same time so there goes the hardwire power thought.  Also, when you plug it into your computer to download videos, it's also running on battery, not charging.  If you need more than an hour at a time for your videos, better get the black as it has replaceable batteries.</span>

<span>This is my third GoPro Silver, I love this camera for what I do in terms of film making. I wish it had image stabilization, but I know that would be additional cost production wise. I love how with the update it will go into portrait mode so I can do my Instagram stories on something other that my phone. I would try the GoPro 8 or 9 but I keep hearing more bad things than good things.</span>

<span>This camera is such a shame. The video and photo quality is outstanding and when the camera works it's really perfect and I love it. However this is a very frustrating device that has many issues which I'll list below. It's really frustrating that my cheap little Hero Sessions never has a problem yet this newer more expensive model is riddled with issues. Here they are; 1) It regularly freezes and I need to do a hard reset and this happens often 2) If I click the filming button while the GoPro is off and it comes on it is often upside down. I then need to stop, wait for it to auto rotate, and then start again....sometimes "missing the shot". This too happens often 3) Almost every time I turn it on it asks me to set the date and time and I’ve tried doing via the app and manually to no avail...I wish it wouldn’t  ask me any more 4)The battery drains much faster than I would have expected.<br/>I have the latest firmware ( v2.0 at the time of this writing) and I try to make sure it's updated. If GoPro can fix these bugs this is a wonderful camera for the money. When I called GoPro they told me it was the microSD card, which I figured they would. I use Sandisk Ultra 200GB, one of the best brands, yet they say it’s not recommended. How good can this camera be if it doesn’t work with one of the most common and decent memory cards?</span>

<span>This camera is pretty cool but I was disappointed after I spent $800 dollars buying it along with accessories that came from GoPro which would have included a free S.D. card or other useful item and then bundles from another company and paid someone $100 dollars to set up and train me a new one was released!  Not to mention that the shopping experience was painful online and I could have paid the same amount with GoPro and re wives additional freebies or learned that within the month a new version 8 was being unveiled! So if you plan on buying g one of these cameras may I recommend:<br/>1.  Invest in the introduction books or be prepared to watch a lot of YouTube videos as your child sits waiting patiently fly.<br/>2.  Be certain that the GoPro site doesn’t have a better deal on the camera itself - I learned this one the hard way!<br/>3.  BUYER BEWARE - I HAVE YET TO VIEW MY PHOTOS OR VIDEOS SINCE I CANT FUNC THEM IN THE CANERA AND BELIEVE YOU MYST USE A SECONDARY DEVICE TO DI SO AND KNOW YOU MUST<br/>4.  BUY OR OWN AN I5, 6, 7 etc I tel celery. Processor to effectively use the apps and be able to store 1, preferably 2TB of memories to use the apps to edit or create the cool stories. This is an entire lesson AND ADDITIONAL MONTHLY FEE UF YOU CARE!<br/>5.  Camera is not intuitive. I hired someone to set it up. Then I got lessons. Then when I went to use it, I couldn’t even zoom the thing to see more than people the size as peanuts who were only 20 feet away. When I could zoom - it didn’t name that much of a difference.<br/>6.  YouTube videos always show this menu-everything on this machine should be voice activated or touch d ten - it is not!  So just get ready to select a few different external buttons before you can use the touch screen feature and not all icons in touch screen respond. To touch - only certain ones located at the bottom.<br/>7.  If you have your GoPro set to video and just turn it on it will start to re it’s by simply selecting the power button so once you can access everything you have videographer or photographed get reEadt to delete and be stuck with likely half used SD cards sothose can’t be used chronologically as back ups to your cloud app.<br/>8.  Extras - this box came with just a tiny camera that fit in my hand. No SD card or converter. Just the camera and case. If you want the benefit of everything or just 10% of what this device can do you will need to prepare to spend an additional 2-300 if you are cheap. I spent $50@ so far and that was in memberships and to get help just opening the very difficult camera compenents which I understand must remain firmly intact due to the waterproof feature but there has to be an easier way<br/>9. Speaking of easier way - GoPro should produce free tutorials from opening the box to explaining what a S.D. Card is and what a converter card is and where you can access the battery to charge it - this tutorial should note that the case must be removed. It should literally coating an online lesson plan included with purchase. It is almost a must as I love this camera and so does my kid but we Gabe both endured painful experiences trying to open the charging area to location the battery.<br/>10.  It would be awesome if you partner reed with a retIler that could take our S.D. cards and just show us what is there and they download videos to cd’s or memory sticks and do the same with the photos we can review prior to picking.<br/>These are just a few suggestions for GoPro and some advice for new users. I must admit that my non GoPro accessories that were made to work with GoPro have been my Best Buy. I will photograph what size bag I must carry to get my “smaller-than-palm” camera and its accessories needed around with me! You would be s hocked to know that I have hundreds of dollars in SD cards and $50@ worth of plastic equipment on top of what I paid for a canera in a cool box that is now outdated as if 4 months ago!  On a positive note - at least I heard the only real difference between the two is the choice of a “real” black - mine is a “washed out black, maybe grey color and the new GoPro has 2 other colors of camera. None of which are noticeably bright - which would be Irrelevant in the long term because the camera is always in a case!<br/>I am attaching my GoPro only bag now and as soon as I get my photos on my ios7 Intel I will do a dude by side comparison with an iPhone 6s underwater picture taken with a bag over it that they sell at the Grand Wales in Hawaii to compare to the quality of the GoPro’s abilities u see wate - unless I get locked out from reviewing!</span>

<span>I purchased the Hero6 after having constant frustrations with my several year old Drift.  I needed an upgrade and GoPro is obviously the industry leader.<br/><br/>I want to preface everything here by saying that GoPro customer service is TOP NOTCH.  Please read on...<br/><br/>I had secured the curved helmet mount as per the directions as I was going on a family ski trip in February.  I was super stoked to use my Hero as I'd read so many good things about it. Well, as 'fate' would have it, something did not work out right with the adhesive.  I put my helmet down for a second at the top of a slope, put it back on, and raced down the hill.  I have all the goodies with the Hero, including the wrist control (which I find is very functional).  At the bottom of the slope, I put my hand on my head, and guess what?  NO GOPRO.  I thought I had lost it somewhere on the slope.<br/><br/>Well, as it turns out, it never went down the slope with me...it apparently fell off the helmet and was sitting in the snow.  Someone turned it in at the top of the slope but I had no idea...I went down the same slope a few times, looking for it...before I started asking around for it.  My wife was angry with me as we spent the whole day looking for the Hero...of course, for the cost, I wasn't going to just walk away.  Plus, it was my first day on the slopes and I really wanted it for videos, pics, and everything else...  To make a really long story short, the camera was brought to the base of the mountain (Keystone Resort in Colorado) and I was able to retrieve it at the end of the day.<br/><br/>This is where GoPro stands out.  I was calling them during the day when I got a break and I'm sure they could tell I was both upset and frustrated...after all, I had just spent all this money and I never even got to use it.  It'd be easy to say 'this guy is an idiot' at this point, but please remember that I 'cured' the adhesive as per the directions...simply put, something was wrong.<br/><br/>Customer service filed a ticket for me and asked me to continue looking for it...which I did.  They were polite, concerned, and helpful.  We were all happy when I found it and after a few discussions and emails, Go Pro promptly sent me another curved helmet sticky.  In addition, they sent me a hand held 'selfie'...they probably felt bad for me and wanted me to never lose the darn thing again.  (of course, I got these when I got home).  Lucky for me, I had also purchased a chest mount and I used that the rest of the trip.<br/><br/>That's my story...so, for the rest of the trip I got great videos and pictures.  I love my GoPro and I love the company.  They care about their customers and stand by them.  Very few companies these days do this...it is very much appreciated.  Oh, the voice activation is amazing, BTW...I ended up using this over the wrist control by the last day.<br/><br/>Another note:  Do NOT buy aftermarket batteries.  I did that to save a few bucks and guess what?  They worked great when in a room but in the cold, they died almost instantly.  When I got home, I returned them and got the GoPro batteries and charger kit...well worth the money.  Don't take chances...for a few bucks more, nothing beats quality.<br/><br/>I hope this review has helped a few people make an informed decision.  GoPro is a great company with high quality products.</span>

<span>I bought this specifically for a trip to the Caribbean and to be mainly used to snorkeling. It takes a nice picture under water, and takes nice video…when it wants to record properly.<br/><br/>It's really depressing that the GoPro brand cannot make a good battery, and also put a big price tag on their products.<br/><br/>I had a big vacation last month that i knew i was going to use the heck out of my GoPro Hero 6 on. I actually bought a spare battery that was on sale on Amazon for $16, then bought the GoPro brand Battery Charger and spare battery ($50), giving me 3 total. I've got to say, what a pathetic battery these are.<br/><br/>It takes NO TIME at all to drain these. Just using your GoPro to flip through settings, look at pics, or have On while using the app to download pics or use a a remote, will drain it at an amazingly fast rate. Of course, if you don't already know this, recording on your GoPro in better qualities at better frame rates will also help drain the batteries fast. Why does this happen? I have no freaking idea and it pisses me off. I've read nightmarish reviews about the GoPro's and their batteries but wanted to find out for myself. According to some reviewers, they recommend that you remove the battery from the GoPro after use because it will overheat the camera and also harm the Micro SD card that is in the same slot as the battery! That's insane and uncalled for. We spend a TON of money on GoPro's cameras and accessories, only to buy something for the name. The quality is really quite pathetic. The word pathetic can also stretch out to their poor customer service and App. Might sound like i'm getting off topic, but mediocre technology is the reason why the battery life is poor, and why i had to buy 2 spares. I can tell you that i used every one of these batteries on my vacation, as well.<br/><br/>GoPro's website has plenty of hints, tips, tricks, troubleshooting, and recording times versus battery life. In my experience, the actual battery life versus how long GoPro claims the batteries will last, is far less. It's my belief that they, themselves, don't really know what's going on. They also tell you what SD cards work with their cameras, but wouldn't you think that it should be ANY Micro SD card? Me too. They say that you should wipe your SD card after each use. What's the point of buying a 128GB card if my video comes in crappy when recording a few clips of 1080/60fps? There's no need for it. If you advertise your camera to record at 4K/60fps then it should do just that. They don't tell you up front that the battery will drain faster, video shuttering will happen, that you get a grainy video, or that it takes up a ton of space on your Mirco SD card. SInce i purchased this last September, I've had shuttering problems, poor battery life, video automatically recording in slo-motion, grainy video, poor sound quality, and trouble with uploading pictures off of the App. Plain and simple is what it should be. There's way too much involved here and it just doesn't work as it should. Maybe i'm not as tech-savvy as i thought i was, but i'm not dumb with it either. I just feel like owning this should be as simple as point and shoot, but GoPro complicates it to the point where i don't even want to use it anymore. Over $500 on camera and accessories just so this thing can be more of a burden than a camera.<br/><br/>If you can stay away from this camera, i'd recommend doing so. If it helps any, i'm someone who is used to having an iPhone, which i find simple to use.</span>

<span>I got fed up with my Sony Action Camera. Sold it and bought this GoPro unit. GoPro seems to have the same confusing product information as Apple products do. Luckily, I found some excellent product reviews and capabilities which led me to buy THIS model GoPro. I bought it to record my fishing efforts. I have a brackish water canal in my backyard and I fish nearly every day, and many nights. Although this camera SAYS it has low light setting, I’ve not seen any picture improvement in low light with it on or off. Other than that one concern, the camera works easily and flawlessly. I have it set on it’s lowest video/audio quality and to my eyes on my big screen Samsung TV, the picture is excellent as well as the audio is very clear and quite sensitive. I had and audiobook playing through my iPhone and a volume loud enough for me to hear, but not blast the neighborhood. Even though the camera sits on a swivel stand I created from several different accessories I bought here for less than $20 with a hard shell foam lined case. So I can control the camera with ANY device that can pair using Bluetooth. Add this excellent function for my situation so I don’t have to leave the camera running through all the hours I’m not landing a fish. However, when I get a strike, I can quickly hit start after the fish is hooked but before the really excellent fighting begins when I try to reel what I’ve caught in. THEN, using my customized camera holder which I don’t have to wear. I can swivel the camera as I fight the fish along the path it takes while I do my beat to net it. Whether connected to my fishing chair, or to any other solidly secured post, stand, or even to my fishing rod tripod rack system which keeps my rods parallel to the water and very easy to grab and hopefully set the hook.<br/><br/>Conclusion...as my month of ownership has taught me, the model GoPro black camera I bought with an accessory pack. I am now able to have more than just still photos after I land each fish before I put it back into the canal. So much more fun to not only remember how each fish was caught, but now I have a record of exactly how each fish fought, where the strike in the canal occurred, and the really lengthy fight with some of the bigger aquatic critters from big bluegills, to mullet up to 6lbs, typical snapping turtles as well as Alligator Snapping turtles (which look more interesting with their very long tail, ridged shell, and massive head and sharp clawed feet), to Armored Sailfin Catfish (aka...Plated Sucker Fish), to huge Tilapia, Blue Catfish, Walking Catfish, and even dozens of blue claw crabs. There are even Largemouth Bass here, but ONLY congregate at the end of my canal near and half submerged tree. Perhaps, someday I’ll walk down there with my gear and see if I can catch one. All other creatures I’ve mentioned either hang out near my chum bucket I keep filled in the water near my fishing spot which the Tilapia and Armored Cats seem to find irresistible. Although I don’t catch any Mullet near my chum bucket, I’m hoping just having the chum in the water causes Mullet to go into a feeding frenzy which allows me to catch many more fish than the few other fishermen on this same canal.<br/><br/>I’ve been trying to get a community fishing contest possibly with prize money based on the yet to be determined entrance fee for each adult fisherman and something as a reward for any young adults or young children if they join the tournament. So far like most things here...no one has shown any interest. But IF I manage to create a contest, having my digital Sony video camera I can mount on a tripod or walk around...whichever will be best. Then combine that footage with anything captured by my GoPro, I should be able to create an excellent video each participant could share.<br/><br/>Only thing I don’t like about this camera is how fast it kills the rechargeable batteries which is why I bought five extra ones so I’d hopefully have enough working camera time to record the entire event. If anyone reading this knows for a fact video recording with the cameras minimal settings is typical of the less than advertised battery video recording time, I’d appreciate being told just as much if my battery usage is typical. Thanks.</span>

<span>TL;DR: If you don't have a GoPro already and are looking for the single best one, snatch a GoPro Hero 5 Session while they are still available. They have been discontinued, but are still around. If you already have a GoPro and are looking for a second camera, this GoPro Hero (2018) is a new take on a durable classic. However, it's bigger than it needs to be and has lower resolution than it should have (given the price and other competitive cameras on the market).<br/><br/>And now for the longer review...<br/><br/>I've been using GoPro cameras since the original camera first came out. I've used them for skiing, snowboarding, shooting, dirt bike riding, car racing, twice on roller coasters, once in a glider ride, and as a simple baby cam on a Hawaiian vacation. They are good cameras overall. I haven't had any let me down or truly fail.<br/><br/>The last GoPro I bought was a Hero 5 Session. I "downgraded" if you will from a Hero 5 Black which I thought was too large, and too complicated for use in the field. Ever since, the Hero 5 Session has been my go-to GoPro. I love the small form factor, the ease of mounting it (because it's a cube and it's cage is also a cube), the one-button record feature, the rugged housing, the built-in waterproofing, and the ability to preview and view video on a smartphone (it eliminates the need for a screen or touchscreen actually on the camera). Probably my only two complaints with the Hero 5 Session have been: (1) Sometimes the GoPro app is glitchy and unreliable, so you can't use the preview feature, and (2) The battery life of the Session can be short and there's no ability to swap batteries.<br/><br/>In getting read to film some action scenes with my new car, I decided to get this GoPro Hero (2018) because I could use a little more battery life. I tested it outdoors and in, and the video footage looks great. Audio from any action cam is usually pretty lousy, but I have a GoPro mic adapter on the way and I'm looking forward to trying it out. Overall, I'm happy with the GoPro Hero (2018). It's a fine action camera, and of course works with all the numerous accessories and mounts they've released over the years.<br/><br/>I love everything about this camera except for three features...<br/><br/>First, having a touch screen on an action camera doesn't make any sense. Putting one back on is a step backwards, and not forwards. If you are truly going to film any ACTION, these cameras are typically mounted in mounts (on your head, on the hood of a car, at the top of a mast, etc), and therefore you or the camera are not in any position to be viewing things-- especially on a tiny screen. However, everyone and his brother has a cellphone, so why not simply have the camera interact with and be viewed on a larger cellphone screen? Like it does on the Session 5?<br/><br/>Second, the cube shape of the Hero 5 Session was and still is far superior to this rectangle. GoPro cameras should be getting smaller and lighter. Not larger and more bulky. This GoPro is larger than the one I had nearly ten years ago.<br/><br/>Third and finally, there is no reason this camera shouldn't be able to record 4k. If they could get a 4k sensor in the Session 5, they could do it here. They chose not to, and that chaps my hide.<br/><br/>In closing, this camera doesn't feel like a bunch of engineers got together in the R&amp;D department to discuss how they could build upon and improve an existing product or model of camera. This camera definitely feels like someone in the marketing or accounting department was told that they needed to create a product would would cut off the sales of an existing product and divert them to another. It's like the Session 5 was a perfect little 4k camera that only needed a swapable battery, and it would be THE best action camera on the market. But GoPro instead pulled it from the market to push an inferior camera for the same price.<br/><br/>That has really soured me on GoPro. It's also probably why their stock is in the toilet. They've stopped innovating, and now they are cannibalizing themselves and eating their own. Literally.</span>

<span>2 years back I bought a GoPro Session. I didn't like it for a bunch of reasons (no touch screen, no mobile app to sync photos/videos, terrible editing software, issues transferring photos/videos off the camera, no removable battery, hard to add music, confusing super tiny interface for changing settings etc.) And it was $399! So definitely wasn't happy with the experience and didn't buy another GoPro. So then I see GoPro release this new $199 camera, GoPro 2018 and decide to give it a chance. And wow was I pleasantly surprised!! All the things that sucked in that original GoPro Session have been fixed and they even added voice commands that work really smoothly. It's literally like the exact opposite experience! So anyways, I'm not sure if the best option is to buy this one instead of their top of the line GoPro Hero 6 for $200 more but I do know that I am super happy with my purchase and loving the experience. Oh and I signed up for their GoPro Plus $4.99 a month service thing, that has been very useful. Oh and that auto video creating option as the files automatically transfer to the cloud when I plug it in is so cool. I just bought the 32 gb memory stick and that basic selfie/tripod stick thing to start. Ok you get the picture, I would DEFINITELY recommend buying a GoPro!<br/><br/>Update: 4/28/18 - ok thought I would update my review since I've now had it for more than 3 weeks.<br/><br/>So far everything is working out great! no changes to my review and I will update my review after say another month of using it.<br/><br/>Update: 5/19/18 - have had it for about 2 months now and going good. I like to use the 1440 setting instead of the 1080 for video recording, both come out really nice but the 1440 is just so good. It takes up more space on the memory card but well worth it. The only I might do differently is buy a 64 gb card instead of the 32 gb. I might also buy an extra battery. The thing I like so much about this thing is how insanely portable and rugged it yet the video and picture quality is so awesome. In terms of accessories, I'm still good with the basic tripod, it fits nicely in my pocket and is a great holder for it. So yeah still working great. Video and picture quality is great, the interface is super easy to use (on the phone and the app) and it's never not worked and I've been using it almost every other day. Oh and yeah I've used it a lot more in water since my last update. lol it's definitely waterproof without any case. Also it is indeed very sturdy. I've dropped it, my kids have run over it, and it has been tossed all over. It kind of makes it more fun in a weird way. You can just hand it off to your kid and it won't break (and believe me kids break everything) or you can go running around with and not have to be extra careful. Ok I will try and update it in another month or two after so more use but i can thoughtfully say now that the GoPro Hero is well worth it and I have not used their other models like the GoPro Hero 5 or 6, so i can't speak to them. Sorry one last thing and this is meant for parents. Give the GoPro to your kids for the afternoon and say just go off and fill up the memory card with lots of different videos and photos. You will get some of the most precious and genuine moments you can possibly imagine. I don't know if it the portable size or how the tripod makes it look like a mini movie camera, but our daughter came back with heartwarming footage that we will show her years from now when she has her own kids. Ok lol sorry I know most of you don't care about all that, but hopefully I covered the quality part of it.<br/><br/>Update: 6/8/18 - ok i don't know if i should keep providing updates or this is useful, but i have some more feedback. As you can read from above, I like to start slow with buying accessories for any device to make sure I am first happy with the device itself. So now that I am happy with the GoPro Hero, I have ventured out and found another useful accessory, besides the basic gopro tripod, that is inexpensive ($19.99). The accessory is basically just a sleeve with a lanyard in three different colors (i got the blue one because well i like the color blue and it looks fun especially in water). On Amazon it's called "Accessory Cover Gopro Sleeve plus Lanyard". Honestly though, i pretty much buy everything off of Amazon, but in this case (not sure Amazon likes me saying this part) but I bought this accessory and the tripod off the GoPro site because they give you 20% off if you have the GoPro Plus $4.99 membership. Anyways, it's a just a few bucks, so probably can do it off Amazon to make it easier, especially for returns. Ok enough about that sorry. So the "GoPro Sleeve Plus Lanyard" is such a basic accessory but man it's super duper useful. Combined with the tripod, it's the only accessories I think I need and they both are cheap (I know people buy the one that hooks to the chest and all but I don't use that). Anyways, it's perfect for when you're in the water because the lanyard can be secure around your neck or wrist. And since fun moments to capture kind of pop unexpectedly, I use it to keep it around my neck so I can quickly turn it on and capture what's happening (especially easy because if you hit tap the record button on stop it just starts recording without having to push anything else). And I know this part is subject, but there's something just fun about having it in the sleeve (especially in blue, but i'm partial to blue), you just look at it and you kind of want to grab it and start shooting something. I just recorded my daughter riding her bike for the first time (without training wheels) and it came out great. Again easy because of the sleeve+lanyard. Also, for traveling, you can pack the GoPro Hero + sleeve &amp; lanyard + tripod literally in your coat pocket. Ok so sorry that was a lot of typing about a $20 accessory that is basically just a sleeve and lanyard, but I just found it super useful and thought I recommend that people first start with the tripod and sleeve+lanyard before spending too much on accessories. Oh and also, if you're wondering if you should buy the high end version instead, i'm not sure what the answer to that is. I am super happy with the quality of the video and pics on the Hero, especially because of the price being $199, but I have seen friends videos and pics off the Hero 6 and I won't lie it's pretty incredible and yeah it's better than the Hero quality, but it's also $399. If this is your first GoPro Hero (like me, well I had the Session like I mentioned earlier, but that one is sort of a different model and as I mentioned I didn't like that one), I would recommend starting with this one. The good thing is they are all the same size, so all the accessories will transfer over if I decide to upgrade in say 2 years. Ok so to finish off, I am still super happy with the GoPro Hero and I've been using it literally daily/every other day since I bought it.<br/><br/>Update 7/5/18 - ok I've now had the GoPro Hero for 3 months. I'm still going strong with just the two basic accessories (the basic $29.99 tripod and the basic $19.99 sleeve + lanyard). We have started to bike around the local forest reserves so I've been thinking about getting a bike mount, but haven't pulled the trigger on that one. Ok so in terms of updates, I would definitely recommend getting an extra battery especially for trips. For day to day use I don't find the need for the extra battery. But vacation trips, it was definitly a mistake to not get an extra battery as we couldn't get back to the hotel or a charge point. Anyways the batteries are relatively cheap and super tiny so doesn't add to travel bulk. The picture and video quality continues to be just really awesome. The versatility of this thing in terms of going from a water enviorment to a more rugged one where it has to be able to take a fall and not break and do so in a manner of that is truly portable and easy and quick to operate is what makes this thing so insanely useful.<br/><br/>On the negative side, I have noticed that once in a while I have to swipe one extra time on the touch screen to have it react. Minor and infrequent event, but worth looking into by GoPro. I'm not sure of th cause, maybe it happens if the screen is grimy or something, not sure.<br/><br/>Anyways, overall, still loving it and with summer here it's use has gone up to every day usage. Oh and last thing, my daughter dropped it down a flight of stairs last week and literally nothing happened to it. They should make my car out of this stuff.<br/><br/>Update 7/14/18 - oh forgot to mention, MAKE SURE you buy the memory card recommend by GoPro (SanDisk Extreme® 64GB microSDXC or the SanDisk Extreme® 32GB microSDHC. Here's the link to it on Amazon - </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/SanDisk-Extreme-64GB-microSDXC-UHS-3-Card-SDSQXAF-064G-GN6MA-Newest-Version/dp/B06XWMMPGV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SanDisk Extreme 64GB microSDXC UHS-3 Card - SDSQXAF-064G-GN6MA [Newest Version</a>
<span>]). The reason I say to make sure to buy the right memory card is because I have two friends whose GoPro was freezing and it turns out it was because they didn't use the GoPro recommended memory card. Apparently it's a high speed card that the camera needs.)<br/><br/>Update 7/22/18 - have a noticed a few times that the audio stops playing when replaying the video on the camera itself. i went to settings and hit the reset settings option and then it worked fine. it automatically restarted the camera and in like 20 seconds it all was fine. i have just recently started changing it from 1440 to 1080 so that i can change the field of view to narrow and medium as that can get better footage when you are up close to things.  On 1440, the only option is wide. It's just that the video quality looks so good on 1440 that I usually end up leaving it on that setting. oh my son was running with the gopro on the little tripod accessory and ran into the wall and lol he was fine most importantly and the gopro was fine as well. if you get the chance, go down a water slide with it, you get some awesome footage. again would like to reiterate that to start one of the coolest things about the gopro is it's portability for when you go on trips, so i would highly recommend not going overboard on buying accessories to not only reduce cost but also to ensure you can easily pack everything without too much bulk. so pretty much the gopro hero + 64 gb memory card (specific one required, </span>

<span>] + 2 batteries + mini tripod thing + sleeve&amp;lanyard thing.<br/><br/>Update 7/25/18 - Ok I swear I am not trying to test if this thing will break lol. But I was chasing my 2 1/2 year old son down the street and I had the gopro hero in the mini tripod in my sweatpants pocket (it holds better in the back pocket of jeans btw) and it fell out and wam it slammed on the concrete. I was like oh @#$. I looked down and the edges around the square lens cover thing was dinged up pretty good but interestingly enough the lens cover didn't get scratched at all. So then I turned it on to check if something inside broke. But everything was fine. So yeah it's pretty tough. anyways so just a recommendation, if you are wearing more loose fitting clothes like sweats, the gopro hero might fall out of your pocket but if you have jeans on it's totally fine. My wife asked me why don't I just use the blue sleeve + lanyard thing because that can connect around my wrist. i just like alternating between the mini tripod handle thing and the sleeve + lanyard mostly because I find that the camera moves around less when i use the mini trip handle grip thing for obvious reasons. so now that I know this thing can take a serious hit with no damage, might hook it to the front of my daughter's bike wit this </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/GoPro-Handlebar-Seatpost-Pole-Mount-GoPro-Official-Mount/dp/B01GCKO96C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GoPro Handlebar/Seatpost/Pole Mount (GoPro Official Mount)</a>
<span> but then i saw it was $56 for the mount and that seems kind of pricey although the reviews are good on it and it definitely fits the need. But as I have mentioned in my many comments above, i don't recommend buying tons of accessories right off the bat. Think about it for a while and see if you really think you need instead of just going out and spending too much on accessories. If you find yourself consistently riding your bike (two times doesn't count!) and holding the gopro with one hand as you ride, then yeah start looking into the mount for that purpose. After owning two basic accessories so far (the basic tripod and the basic sleeve + lanyard, i can tell you that while the gopro accessories are not cheap, they do feel really solid and good quality like the camera itself).<br/><br/>Update 8/20/18 - Still going great! The app is really well designed. The automatic videos that the App creates after it auto-synchs with the GoPro are just great. You can even use your own music if you want. It automatically matches up the beats of the song with the video, so cool. I cannot stress how much of a different experience this GoPro was from the GoPro Session I bought over 2 years ago.  Just flat out night and day. Luckily I haven't dropped the GoPro again since my last update but as I referenced before, it wouldn't matter even if I did as the thing is practically indestructible. It has frozen once since my last update but I just took out the battery and put it back in and all was fine. Btw, 2 points to the designer of the battery who put that little handle on it. It lets you slightly pull it out and push it back in. That way you don't have to completely remove the battery when it freezes. Again though, it's only frozen a few times since I bought it so not an issue.<br/><br/>Update 9/3/18 - yesterday I forgot to bring my GoPro hero as we celebrated the last weekend of summer in the city and I got ugh got my iPhone wet and something happened to the mic. Luckily I dried out the phone and eventually hard reset the phone and everything is back to normal. But would have been much better if I remembered the GoPro because I would have got way better shots because I wouldn’t have to be so careful. With the GoPro, one of the continuing pluses is how tough and durable it is. You could hang out and have a good time and not have to worry about breaking anything. And it’s durable enough where you can just hand it off to your kid and say go run with it and not have to worry.</span>

<span>Hey everyone, I wanted to give a little feedback from this transaction... The GoPro is a great camera.. The session is a good camera, there were a couple reasons for the 3 stars..<br/>The first reason is I dont mind the e-commerce packaging, all the frilly stuff doesnt matter to me.. But literally it had nothing in the box but the cam and a mount. No instructions or at least a scan for the app or something to be able to get started out of the box.. But nothing, so it took a while to eventually figure out all the features..  But once I did it seemed to record pretty good..<br/> The other reason is that in the description it says that this camera is capable of 1080 at 60fps... Well no matter what I did I could not find that setting, there where only two options available, 30fps or 48fps... There was no 60..... Now just so you know why that makes a difference for me is that I am using this camera on my racing drone.. So when I am recording flying through trees at 60mph, there is some skipping issues due to the amount of information trying to be captured..  So that is why I have been looking for a small, light camera that has that capability.. I found the Mobius mini, I have a review for that in my que too...<br/> So as this may be a great action camera for someone who is skiing or motorcycle riding or bike riding stuff like that, I say go for it.. But if you are a drone pilot and you want to do proximity flying this may not be the best way to go...<br/>I will say this, I only got it about 4 hours ago, after setting it up and testing it out in the office I just found I was not satisfied... On the Plus side.... Kinda..... I am going to go ahead and purchase the session 5.... that is why I only refunded a gift card.. That one seems to have all the features I need for smooth videos..  So I do thank this company for sending the camera out in a speedy fashion and it was a great gopro, just not what I read in the description..<br/><br/>So I would recommend this camera for some but not for all....</span>

<span>I use this camera for fishing, boating, and most often paintball.  I've written the review below specifically regarding using this camera for recording tournament paintball:<br/><br/>The GoPro Hero4 Session is the best action camera I've come across yet for paintball.  I personally use the camera with a Grizzly Mounts Pole Mount ($20 on Amazon).  The mount is similar to other pole mounts, but that it is made of a really tough rubber.  This means it won't scratch your barrel and also doesn't crack when you tighten it down or take a dive.  Definitely a recommended accessory for the Hero4 Session that is useful for paintball as well as limitless other activities.  I've broken down the camera review into the features of the camera that make it an excellent option for paintball players.<br/><br/>One-Touch Operation<br/><br/> The Hero4 Session is unique in the GoPro line in that it features one-touch operation.  This means that the camera is powered off at all times unless the user is adjusting settings or recording.  Simply press the record button, and after a couple second delay, the camera is powered up and begins to record.  When finished, press the button again and the camera finishes recording and powers down.  This has a couple of advantages on the paintball field.<br/> First, it allows a single battery to last an entire day for tournament paintball.  The Hero4 Session's battery is rated for about 2 hours of recording, and does not drain when the camera is not recording since the unit powers itself off.  By pressing the record button before the start of each point, and pressing it again after the flag is hung, a player's entire tournament worth of play can be captured on a single charge.<br/> The other advantage to the one-touch operation of the Hero4 Session is the simplicity of use.  With previous GoPro models, the user would have to press and hold the power button, wait for the camera to power on, then cycle through the operation modes until “Video Recording” is selecting, and then finally press the record button.  All of this is taken care of in one press of a button with the Hero4 Session, which is saves a ton of time while practicing, but is priceless during an XBall match where every second in the pits or walking out to the start box is precious.  One touch of the button and within seconds you'll be recording.<br/><br/>Size and Design<br/><br/> The GoPro Hero4 Session is the smallest GoPro as of the time of its release.  The shaved down dimensions are very noticeable when mounted on your barrel, especially if you choose to mount it upright, on top of the barrel.  Previous GoPro cameras were significantly wider, which meant more of your vision was blocked when looking down the barrel while playing.  The Hero4 Session is also narrow enough that it does not hit the ground when sliding and crawling with your marker sideways against the turf/grass.  Maybe the most important aspect of its smaller size is the smaller target that the Session provides for your opponents.<br/> The Hero4 Session also features a centered lens in its design.  In other GoPro models and many other action cameras, the lens is placed off-center on the camera.  The Session's centered lens affords the camera an unobstructed view when snap shooting on both sides of a bunker, as well as viewing straight down the barrel instead of on a slight angle.  The Session captures paint streams better than ever before because of this one easily overlooked feature.<br/><br/>Automatic Image Rotation<br/><br/> The GoPro Hero4 Session features Automatic Image Rotation.  This means that when the camera begins a recording while it is upside-down, it will automatically correct the video to right-side-up.  This saves quite a bit of time that would otherwise be spent manually rotating the videos in computer software or changing the camera's orientation settings on other action cameras.  This is an important feature for when the camera is mounted hanging below the barrel, allowing the player better vision down their barrel from above.<br/><br/>Exposed Microphone<br/><br/> One of the most important features of the GoPro Hero4 session are its exposed microphone and case-less waterproof features.  Since the camera is waterproof and shockproof without a fully enclosed plastic shell, the microphone remains exposed to open air.  This results in superior sound clarity that was never able to be captured with previous generation GoPro cameras.  Instead of just the muffled sounds of the marker firing, the Session records the voice of the player behind the camera as well as his/her teammates on the field.  This feature alone puts the Hero4 Session above other action cameras.<br/><br/>Price Point<br/><br/> The GoPro Hero4 Session comes in at a price point of $199.  Compared to the other cameras in the Hero4 line, it is the most affordable below the Silver at $399 and the Black and $499.  At the lowest price point, this camera still packs in features that the others do not that are essential to recording first-person paintball.</span>

<span>GoPro HERO Session in E-Commerce Packaging<br/><br/>The gopro hero session does exactly what it needs to do.<br/><br/>Purchased this for just $116.xx a couple months ago, sold directly by amazon. It seems out of stock at the moment and is being gouged by 3rd party sellers. If amazon gets these back in stock, I expect to get another. After using this, it seems like the newer Gopro Hero 5 session would be overkill.<br/><br/>I have been using this as a bodycam during photoshoots at political protests, which can get quite dangerous.<br/><br/>The gopro hero session can record continuously for about 4 to 5 hours at 1080p60.<br/><br/>The video quality is astonishingly good.<br/><br/>The mp4 file format is good as well, since quick edit tools are readily available. Making quick clips for twitter upload is super easy from the .mp4 file format. For example, try the open source, OpenShot Video editor for making quick clips and adding watermarks (use the title feature), easily.<br/><br/>I was able to buy an mount/attachment kit separately for about $14.00, which included a mount that enabled me to wrap a velcro strap around the left shoulder strap of my backpack, so that the gopro hero session sits are shoulder height at my left shoulder.<br/><br/>Helmet mounts from 3rd parties are available for about $20.00, in addition to a helmet with an attachment for those mounts. The gopro iPhone app seems a must for checking on/off status if the hero session is mounted on a helmet where the status light cannot be easily checked.<br/><br/>Initial setup with the gopro iPhone app was difficult. However, once it was configured, it works pretty well. It is hard to image checking configuration without the iPhone app. The WiFi between the iPhone app and the gopro camera works without an external server, which means it can be used in the field, even when a separate internet connection is not available. Expect to need a usb power bank unit for the iPhone for all day connection between the gopro and the gopro iPhone app.<br/><br/>criticisms:<br/><br/>The gopro hero session should be able to switch from super wide view to regular view at 1080p60, but it cannot (does not). The gopro hero session only supports ultra-wide angle at 1080p60. There isn't any reasonable technological basis for this feature limitation. At ultra-wide angle view, distortion (called barrel distortion) is readily apparent at the edges of the frame.<br/><br/>The gopro website is horrific. The people who run gopro don't seem to understand that they have already sold you their product when you get into what are supposed to be their website's support pages. All the content on the gopro website support pages acts like they are still trying to sell you their product. Their ceaseless marketing hype tone is very annoying. The gopro youtube videos are just as bad, if not worse. The gopro website pages don't actually provide much usable support information. Thankfully, via google searches, there are plenty of other websites and youtube videos that explain how to use their product.</span>

<span>This gopro has (so far) the best image quality and sound of the previous generation of gopros. I've owned each Hero, Hero2, and Hero3+ but then stopped. But this one was interesting. While this one is smaller in width, it is wider than the old ones so basically it is a cube instead of lego-shaped. I did a test in my car mounting the Hero3+ and the Session at different angles and filmed for 20 minutes. Then I edited it together; cutting between the two cameras. I used the Session's audio exclusively because it was that much better than the 3+ sound. The image quality of the Sesssion was also better than the 3+ but not to much. More like a refinement than an improvement.<br/>As for the user-interface, I find all GoPro's to be user UN-friendly. I assume most people set them up to power up in the mode they prefer and use it in that mode most of the time. As changing it is difficult. This model is even more difficult, however at least you can read the lighted display vs the old LCD panel on the older models. But... there is only 1 line of text. With the 2 buttons on the Session, you basically have to memorize Morris Code to figure out how to change settings or set on/off the wifi. Their smartphone app is pretty good so I'd use it instead. Note however that turning the wifi on/off requires learning how to do it--which in and of itself is a design failure--but that's always been the problem with GoPro cameras--the user interface is horrible at best.<br/>Why 5 stars, because it is the best GoPro yet, and compared to the older models I believe it is simpler to operate--albeit still difficult (requires getting used to it). The image and audio quality is very good.<br/>I was looking forward to the Nikon Mission 360 in hopes of it being a GoPro killer, but looks like that one will be a contemporary Nikon problem with production/delivery, so I got this one instead. Probably would but a 2nd one for both backup and 2nd angle perspectives.</span>

<span> I purchased a Hero 8 and they sent me this Hero 9.  My first test out on a bike ride this morning, and I can really tell the difference between this one and my cheap little Sportscam.  In the GoPro video, you can see the horizon and trees and road and surroundings all stay stable and don’t move. Only my bike is moving. In the cheap camera video, everything is jiggling with my movement. This was well worth the money I believe.  The only thing that never improves from product to product is battery life. There’s really no answer for that other than to buy multiple batteries and keep them handy. This battery lasted me about 59 minutes before it died.</span>

<span>I bought this Hero 8 Black to make instructional videos for work. It WiFi linked up with my Samsung phone just fine so I could see what the camera was seeing, to set up my shots. Made a couple short test videos. When it came time to download the test videos, nothing! Used the USB cable provided, Windows 10 computer. Computer does not see the files. Downloaded GoPro Quick thinking that would work. Nope their program does not see the video files either! Went to the GoPro web site and help section. Everyone is saying the same thing. So.... I started hunting around in the setting on the camera and in order to use the USB cable you HAVE to change the Preferences, to USB Connection MTP! Once I did that I was able to see my video files after some hunting in the folders and copy them to my Computer for editing. Hope this helps someone else. I was pretty frustrated!</span>

<span>I love my GoPro.  I started a Nature video channel, and wanted something that I could use under water. This camera is perfect. I have a special lanyard that I use with it, because it didn’t work the way I wanted it to being mounted to my snorkel. Once you turn it on, you can leave it on while you’re swimming around and searching for turtles or other underwater creatures. I just grab it, press the start button, and it starts filming. Once I’m done I pressed stop. Having the ability to do this, while you’re searching for different things that you wanna take footage up, really saves on battery power. I couldn’t be any more happier with this camera. You can go back through your videos with the camera, just to see how things turned out. If you feel like you needed to get more footage, make sure it’s charged, and you can head back in the water and do it again.  this probably bought a lot of joy in my life,  and is completely waterproof and doesn’t need any type of packaging to keep it waterproof underwater. I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This is great for any type of movies that you want to make, or just for capturing your travels.</span>

<span>Bought this camera as a replacement for the 7 that I lost kayaking. With the bigger battery, I thought that this would surely be an upgrade. I was told that it could be used as a webcam as well! When i got home, I quickly realized that the camera had several problems.<br/>1) webcam feature connects through ethernet port, not usb, is not reliable, and most can't even get it to work at all. I was able to join an incredibly dumb fb group to get access to the beta versions, of which none work. this feature is a complete bust until they allow the usb connection to transmit the feed and stop, for whatever reason, trying to route it through the network ports.<br/><br/>2) the camera only works with the most expensive sd cards. i understand that bitrate and stuff is important, but my dji drone is 4k 60 and it has no issue making video files on the same card, and the files aren't broken up into small pieces that i then have to 'stich' back together using expensive editing software. they will BS you and tell you that it takes the super ultra microSD cards, but i STILL had failures where it didn't record but 4 seconds and then shut it off, and i missed my moment of recording. total and complete trash.<br/><br/>3) you would think that if you had an overheating problem, that recording in the snow wouldn't be a problem as it would keep itself warm, but the cold would keep it in the optimal range to record. NO. Took this to the mountain to go snowboarding (east coast, so it wasn't even that cold) and it would only record for literally 10 seconds before it shut off. i thought this thing was for adventures and it can't even handle 60 seconds of my adventures.<br/><br/>4) the live preview to your phone feature is GONE. they have removed it, so they can brag about the battery life improvement, which is all BS and false advertising. I used to use this on my motorcycle to have a very nice rear view facing camera, so i could see danger approaching me in the rear. this feature is one of the main reasons i bought a gopro, and now that it's gone, i feel completely ripped off.<br/><br/>5) if you manage to get the camera to record anything longer than like, 8 minutes, it will break the files up into pieces. they TELL you that it's because if you lose a file, you won't lose your entire recording, but this is extremely annoying as I said above, you have to put all the pieces back together perfectly and even still, will probably notice the moment it switches to the next piece. It doesn't matter what's going on, you could be in the middle of a sentence or watching your child be born, and then boom, you gotta open another file to see the rest.<br/><br/>I cannot stress how absolutely dissatisfied I am with this piece of tech. I stress to EVERYONE, find something else to buy and do not give them anymore money until they restructure and fix their devices properly. stop worrying about worthless subscriptions, and worry about satisfying the initial promises of the camera before you try to store everyone's private moments on your servers. This is a legitimate review with years of use and a highly technical background. I hope I save some people from making one of the most expensive mistakes of my young adulthood. Thank you.</span>

<span>I love the quality and clarity of the video this camera produces! Mounted it to my Harley for a trip through Tennessee and I was very impressed with the video quality. I will definitely need to play with the settings, though, because for some reason, the camera would not record 1 long video. Instead, the videos saved in short increments. Also, the battery life is not nearly as good as I was expecting. I have 3 batteries and I figured they would definitely last much longer than they did. Overall, however, I am very happy with the camera!</span>

<span>Bought this camera to make some in-studio and on-location videos of up-close and personal subject matters. To my surprise, I was disappointed with the performance (of the camera that is). This was not the camera for the job. Although the picture quality is excellent, everything else left much to be desired. The battery life is very short and if you do not have extras, your shoot will be severely put on hold. Image stabilization is there, but not as impressive as advertisements and commercials would have you believe. Let's not forget about all of the accessories that you have to purchase separate. The good thing about that is that they can be purchased from third parties. If you are looking for a compact action camera for landscape shooting and outdoor wide shot adventures, this may be the camera for you. But I still recommend shopping around. For the price that you are going to pay, you may be able to find something cheaper on the same expectation level.<br/><br/>Now, for the type of shooting that I wanted this "ACTION" camera for, it was a FAIL. Using the Quik App to connect your phone to the camera is intermittent, the camera itself does not posses the best user-friendly software out there. While filming and connected to your phone there is no preview of what you are shooting available, so getting the angles and closeups that you want are a guessing game. To see what you are filming, you have to stop filming, check footage, reset the connection between your camera and phone, get into position, check the preview before filming, hit record and hope you are still in position... Rinse and repeat...</span>

<span>The battery in the Hero 10 overheated for us many time in the first few days.  I returned it in exchange for the Hero 11, and those problems didn't exist.  I ended up returning it because I found using a GoPro too much trouble, but it was a really nice device.  I use high end DSLR cameras, and I get that feel from this device.</span>

<span>By now there are a number of review sites on social media showing off all the fancy new features the GoPro HERO11 has.  I think overall these assessments are accurate.  The GoPro 11 certainly has a number of great shooting modes. The 8:7 aspect ratio is very nice. The horizon lock feature works as advertised. Very happy with the functionality and overall customization options available.<br/><br/>The GoPro Quik works, but there are ads to upgrade to cloud storage/backup. After setting up your GoPro, the app will detect and recognize your unit every time you start the app afterwards, but it takes about 10-15 seconds to actually connect and see what the GoPro sees in the app.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the GoPro 11 overheats quickly.  At room temperature (~77DegF), the GoPro 11 shuts down in a little over 20 min when shooting in 4K 60 fps. It doesn't seem to matter if you step down to 1080 HD. Removing the battery/door and then powering the unit solely by USB power, improved the record time to about 25.5 minutes. Recognizing that tradeoffs have to be made in order for the GoPro to be waterproof and environmentally sealed, it still would have been nice if the GoPro Devs could make the camera last to the 30-minute mark with a battery installed.</span>

<span>The batteries took way longer than 2hr to charge as per other answer. With WIFI enabled it lasted about 45 min, so can't stream a full sports game of any kind into am app (like GameChanger) without buying new batteries or charging it while recording. The clip attachments has single direction rotation so you can't just clip it on a chainlink fence and adjust angle.<br/>SD card wasn't included in this bundle and can't use camera without it, wish I knew so I could buy ahead and record what I bought the camera for!!!</span>

<span>My first go pro. Easy to use with the online guides and apps<br/><br/>My one gripe is the battery. As soon as you take it off the charger it drops to 98% before you even use it, then it dies fast</span>

<span>I am close to returning this because it cannot connect to a mac vis usb. The engineers who designed this took away the option to toggle out of MTP mode (instead claiming that it switches to MTP automatically). I've searched GoPro, Google, Reddit and Youtube - no effective solutions anywhere offered even by the GoPro staff!! Now I have to fight to get this super tight side door open and take out the micro sd and use the adapter to plug into my computer every time when I shouldn't have to! Too many steps for the amount of money I paid. It is sold with the "ability to usb connect", but this is a lie. GoPro, you released your 10th and latest model with this malfunction knowingly... I'm pissed!</span>
