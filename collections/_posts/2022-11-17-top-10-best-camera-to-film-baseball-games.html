<span>Future generations will never know how horrible cords and bulky cameras were. The Mevo Start is the future of compact wireless cameras, today. I can now sync multi-angles easily and discreetly place the devices in the set for high resolution capture. The cropping and exposure capabilities in the software are simple and super impressive. I love these cameras. I could not be happier with my purchase. Many thanks to those at Mevo and Logitiech.</span>

<span>Aside from the flaw (which I will get to), the camera is pretty awesome.  I think the most impressive part of it for me is the battery life. I wish there were a 4K option, but it's a small sacrifice given the price point.  Now, the flaw...<br/><br/>You cannot change the aspect ratio of the camera.  It is always 16:9 which means that streaming on popular platforms like TikTok and Instagram shouldn't be a thing since these apps work best using 9:16 ratio. Now, if you're ok with simply recording versus livestreaming, you can lay the camera over to achieve 9:16.  Then, during the editing process, rotate the image.  Aside from that issue, the Mevo Start is a flawless budget camera.</span>

<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>This is my second GoPro - my first having been something I owned several years ago. This is a SIGNIFICANT upgrade from that in almost every way, except one. But before I go into that, let me explain what I LOVE about the HERO 11...<br/><br/>1. The video quality is AMAZING. So good! GoPro has been doing action cameras for a long time and frankly speaking, they STILL do it better than anyone else does...period. The HERO 11 has crystal clear image quality and colors are vibrant, sharp and life-like. It's downright impressive.<br/><br/>2. The stabilization is superb. This is another area where the HERO has received a significant upgrade. This little camera CAN AND WILL take anything you throw at it, and it will give you a beautiful, stable image from it.<br/><br/>3. It's lightweight. Coming in at just under 5.5 ounces, it's not going to get in the way of anything you want to do.<br/><br/>4. Despite being a lightweight, the quality and craftsmanship is something you can feel. This is a high end camera - and it shows, and you can feel it, too.<br/><br/>5. It has multiple shooting modes so you have great options on getting perfect shots.<br/><br/>6. The audio quality is also significantly better on the HERO 11 than on previous models.<br/><br/>And now, the one and only problem with this that I have found. It gets HOT - to the point it overheats. THAT'S a problem, especially if you are using it for a while. And then of course, when this happens, it shuts off, as most high tech devices do these days. Not sure why this wouldn't have been caught on beta testing (which I assume GoPro would do) but this is a significant issue. I only took one star off because the camera is so, SO good otherwise...but hopefully this issue is addressed because I hate for it to take away from what is otherwise a SUPERB action camera.</span>

<span>This is my first time I have ever owned a GoPro. I have rented them and owned a couple knockoffs. The knockoffs have nowhere near what this GoPro has. The GoPro 11 I received was not part of a bundle and only includes the camera, case, adhesive mount and mounting buckle.<br/><br/>Out of the box, it is pretty basic. The camera itself weighs 5.4 ounces. It feels heavier, but it feels premium. Opening up the battery hatch is a little bit of a pain. You will grab it at the notch and pull it out and it is pretty tight, so if you have nails you care about, please take caution. You will find the battery, SD card slot and USB-C connection in there.<br/><br/>Now, to where this GoPro shines. Where it shines brightest in is the video quality. There is not another action camera that I have found that produce the high quality images that this camera can. Color and image quality are paramount. The image stabilization is phenomenal. A bumpy road feels like the flatlands when filming live. My hands are not the steadiest and I have never seen a camera truly compensate for that like this one. The built-in audio is good and better than older versions and way better than any knockoff.<br/><br/>I wish there was a bit easier way to upload videos without having the GoPro subscription service, but it is not terrible to do this manually.<br/><br/>Also, you have seen others talk about it overheating at 4K/60fps and they are spot on with that assessment. This does overheat and is something GoPro should have worked on more before the release. This had to be a known issue. It gets very hot and while mine has not shut off, I can see how easily the unit would shut off when feeling like it is on fire.<br/><br/>One complaint I have from GoPro is can you include a SD Card with your purchase. This is not an inexpensive item and a SD card is a very low cost item that could be easily included because you cannot use the camera at all without an SD Card.<br/><br/>Do you need this latest and greatest GoPro if you have an older model? More than likely you do not. There are not a gargantuan amount of improvements to make you hit the order button immediately. Plus, your batteries and other accessories would work with the 11.</span>

Compact, lightweight and easy to use, the Panasonic Full HD Camcorder HC-V180K brings a fun, worry-free experience to high-resolution video capture. Featuring a 5-axis image stabilizer for maximum handheld stability, this 1080p camera’s super-long 50X optical zoom and up to 90X intelligent zoom quickly bring distant objects in focus. A convenient 28mm wide-angle lens allows you to fit more people and scenery into settings like weddings, reunions and vacations. An advanced BSI sensor assures low-light video image quality while Panasonic’s Level Shot function automatically detects and compensates for distracting camera tilting. For added fun, the camera includes creative filter effects like 8mm Movie, Silent Movie, Miniature Effect and Time Lapse Recording, all easily accessible on the 2.7-inch LCD touch screen. A 2-channel zoom microphone works in tandem with the zoom to ensure crisp, clear audio up close or at any distance.

<span>The video quality on this camera is great in the day and it's decent in low light. The camera (picture) quality is not good but its it's not the worst by far. Still have to remember it's a camcorder so it's not expected to be the best in picture mode. It's pretty small, at least for my hands, which is good for carrying in pockets but it sometimes would feel strange trying to hold with the strap around my hand. Took me a few hours to realize how to switch from seeing pictures and videos, which I'm sure they explained in the manual that I did not read. The zoom is awesome though and for the most part it's very steady, of course, until you reach past 60x and enter digital zoom. The touch screen could be a lot better and is kind of tricky if you have medium to large hands but it is still manageable. Overall I will give this 4 stars because I got it for my wedding and I know the church has low light and the videos were very nice but not professional so dont think it's going to be crystal clear. But I enjoyed it and watch it often. There is no mount in case anyone is wondering. There is no flash either. I'm only mentioning that for the ones wondering about it. I like this Panasonic camcorder though and is deciding if I want a camera from them, Nikon, or Sony around $500 so if anyone reading this have a suggestion, including Panasonic, which would tell me why I should choose them, let me know what you think. HAVE A NICE DAY</span>

<span>I use this camera to record two to three high school football games a week and do highlights for the team. I love the zoom and the picture quality is fantastic (day or night). The still photos are great when you are in photo mode, but I was disappointed nothing or low quality, small size, out of focus and fuzzy if you take any photos on video mode. I was hoping to be able to get action shots while filming. But I think the photos will be great when I zoom in on far off mountains etc when I get back up to the hills.<br/>I love the fact that you can film in 1080p 60fps MP4 format. This way I don't have to convert MTS files before posting online. But these files are 28Mbps, so they are rather large compared to my old camera. You can record in 720p or 360p I prefer better quality. You can also record in near 4K with MTS files.<br/>10 or 15 years ago you could get a camcorder with a viewfinder and maybe a my hookup and flash in this price range. But not anymore.</span>

<span>This is my first Camcorder, and I absolutely love it. I love to take pictures of birds, but they are too easily spooked before you get the picture taken. So, I purchased this camcorder with a 50X optical zoom lens. Wonderful! I can be 200 yards away, and still get a decent picture, and they don't fly away. I have set the maximal zoom to 90X, and I still get very good pictures! I have taken a lot of footage of Mule Deer, and I can get as close as I want - in most cases.<br/><br/>I took a picture across the mighty Columbia River and on top of a mountain on the other side in the State of Washington, at least a mile or two away, and I showed the object to my wife. It took her a few minutes to find it, but she was amazed that I could take a picture that far away. In other words, she could clearly make out the object that I took a picture of, and find its location. Most camcorders come with a 20X Optical Zoom, but this has a 50X Optical Zoom! It rocks! This is an awesome wildlife camcorder!<br/><br/>I'm still learning to pan smoothly by hand, but I now have a video head that pans perfectly. It almost cost as much as the camera, but it was worth it. Hoping to get into some action video at a zoo, races, or windsurfing. Having fun, and you will too!</span>

<span>This camera looks way better than it should. I love everything about it except the fact that it cannot do a clean out and record at the same time. I use the clean out to go to an ATEM switcher, and would like to iso record from the camera as well. If you push record when using clean out, the picture goes black. Unfortunately, it’s an either or situation. My work around is to record at the switcher and just not iso that camera. The Canon R800 does everything I need but is also double the price point.</span>

<span>I paid about $240 on a promotion. GP has had the Hero 10 for a deep discount, on their site. I might have done that. But the price I paid is pretty great for what this camera does, and I don't worry about it much. The good thing is that the stabilization on the Hero 8 is close to fantastic. I ride an ebike up a very rough road and the picture is almost too smooth. It's just remarkable what the electronic stabilization can do. And these are pretty tough cameras. The picture is very nice, if a bit punched up. I guess there is a bland setting. The camera is a lot of fun. It's fun to go outside in the snow and rain. It's fun to point it at odd angle and mount it in weird places. Hey, you want a fantastic camera that does it all, get a Sony A7iii. But that's not reality. The stills from this camera are pretty good, but always wide views. The battery life honestly sucks.</span>

<span>We just recently got a Hero8 Black GoPro to take videos of hikes and mountain climbing adventures.  The good: setting it up and taking videos is simple and straightforward, and the video quality is clean and sharp (recommendation: go for at least a 128 GB sim card to ensure adequate storage capacity at high resolution).  The bad: transferring videos off of the unit is a pain.  After spending over three hours installing and reinstalling the GoPro app on our phones and computer, we were unable to get anything to recognize that the GoPro was even there (it was plugged in at 100% charge, and our wi-fi had no problems at the time).  There is no option to directly connect the GoPro to a computer to transfer files, and the only customer support available is apparently based in India or Pakistan (judging from the accents of the support people we contacted), so clear explanations of the problem were difficult and took a lot of work on both ends.  Ultimately, the only way we were able to transfer videos from the GoPro was to manually pull the sim card out and plug it into a reader in our computer.  Customer support told us that this is not a bad thing, as it would ultimately take 5 times longer to transfer files via wi-fi.  I don't think this is an acceptable solution, because (1) handling the sim card multiple times increases the likelihood that it will be damaged or broken and (2) damage to the GoPro is possible if the sim card is inserted in the wrong orientation (there is no indication on the unit of the correct orientation to use, and even when you have it correct, you have to "shove" the card pretty hard to get it seated properly.)<br/><br/>Customer support gets 5 stars for willingness to be helpful, but 1 star on convenience and ease of use.  As mentioned before, the only way to get customer support is to submit a report on the website, which apparently goes to a call center in India or Pakistan.  You then wait for a call back, which could come minutes or hours later.  Of the three call-ins we made, two had such scratchy, bad connections that I am doubtful we could have understood what the support tech was saying even if they spoke crystal-clear English (seriously, we could only hear every second or third word, the rest was static).  Ultimately, the tech who helped us was helpful and knowledgeable, especially given that he could not see what we were dealing with.  All told, the customer support setup needs work to make it more accessible.</span>

<span>We’ve had some fun playing with it and gotten some great photos. I have to get used to using it for water and always wipe the lens. Not very intuitive to use, so you have to be committed to learning the system to get the full value. I’ve bought many accessories to make it all work, maybe more than I needed but some at least seem needed. Recommended Accessories: SD card, screen protector, tripod mount<br/>I think with the string it comes with I might not really need the camera float.</span>

<span>I purchased this because, sadly, we've had an uptick of "activity" in our local park where I routinely walk my dogs. FYI - I purchased the non-zoomable camera because I did not envision needing that function. I have only used this a few times, but the video quality is pretty darn good. I see some reviews that say "everything looks far away," but I disagree. Good color and good field of view. I did test this inside my home when I was setting it up, and quickly found that the video goes gray and grainy as light decreases, so good for daylight but not so good for low light. Audio isn't stunning, but it's a lot better than some reviewers led me to believe. It's more than adequate for what I believe this camera is intended, which is just to capture any "encounter." I will say that the mic doesn't capture much sound from afar (meaning beyond maybe 10 feet), but that's understandable since it's capturing your voice from 5 inches away. You can't have things both ways! My only real criticism of this camera is the phone app, which is pretty basic. You can view your video on the phone app, and also of importance, you can format the micro SD card too (this camera won't loop record, so being able to zero-out the micro SD card via the phone app is a plus). FYI - max micro SD card is 32GB. I'm sure the phone app will improve in time if this company keeps going with this technology. Also, although I haven't used them in practical operation yet, I really like the fact this thing has lights on it, and they are bright! Yeah, they're small and won't illuminate much, but if all you have to do is look for something on the floor or very near you, it's awesome. And lastly, I like that I can see small red light that lets me know the camera is on or recording (it won't be noticed by others, but I can just barely see it in my field of view). I wear a body camera and often have to look and verify it is recording, which isn't always convenient. I do see some reviews that note camera failure after only a few months, so I'll update this review if my camera fails.</span>

<span>It’s a great beginning product. As a YouTuber that builds race cars it’s good for hands free work. But the audio is absolutely terrible. Easy to blow out the mic when talking too loud. Sounds like you’re talking out of a Tim can. Also the battery doesn’t last very long. Will out last the memory card. And the max memory card size is not huge. That being said. If those things aren’t important to you then it might be great. I picked it up when it was $75 and that’s how much it’s worth.  Would pay way more for better audio and quality.

<span>Never owned a camera before but I heard a lot good things about this one. The 60x zoom on it is great for taking pictures of birds though the focus on smaller bugs isn’t that great it kind of focuses them out. It also takes  good quality videos, would be great for vlogging. For the price it’s unbeatable I highly recommend !</span>

<span>Bought this for our granddaughter as her first non-iphone camera.  She is thrilled with it so far.  It has a fully automatic program mode that allowed her to begin shooting good looking photos immediately.  She loves horses and has been using the camera to take photos and videos.  Yet the camera has many advanced features like a serious telephoto zoom, full manual, aperture preferred, shutter preferred modes, and much more.  Nice touch screen to allow easy access to menu options.  At this price, it seems like a very good deal.</span>

<span>just wanted to communicate a quick message. not that i want to focus on negatives but these things jumped immediately as not so great at me when using the camera for the first time.<br/>for all of this i subtracted 1 star.<br/>From all i was reading i do expect that all other function perform as described.<br/><br/>1. It said charging can be done through USB cable, so i was hoping that for long-term exposure (like astro photography etc)  one can add an external battery to keep it going bit NO:<br/>"Even if charging is in progress, it stops when the<br/>camera is turned on."<br/>that is what the manual says and i checked it is true<br/>2. the EVF is activated by eye contact. basically the moment the EFV is darkened. the weird thing is when reviewing images on the LCD and then you look through the EFV to see more details etc the camera switched to the regular recording mode. to see the image in the EVF you have to put your eye on it and THEN switch to viewing mode.<br/>on all other Pen cameras i use the EVF-1/2 and it is switched by a button on the EVF which i like better.<br/>3. the battery door has no automatic lock when it is closed, you have to manually move a little slide. also different from previous Pen's. i though it was broken.<br/>4. autofocus seems ok but have not directly compared to my EP5 and EPL9. once thing that bothered me on that older cameras was that they did not focus well on the moon at all which disappointed me a lot (that was with the 14-150mm zuiko).<br/>5. EVF: clearly the external EVF-1/2 have the advantage that they are articulate. meaning you can orient them 90 degrees up which is very convenient for many situations. now that would be great to do here too. or they could have added the port to use the EVF in addition when needed.<br/><br/>update1:<br/>(2) i found out that the automatic switching of the EVF can be turned off with a button next to it - very good!<br/><br/>Update 2, Jan 2 2021<br/>Did my first shooting outdoors. AF works very good compared to my epl9 and ep5. It even focussed very easily to the moon.<br/>The 2 dials on the top are very convenient to quickly change key parameters.<br/>I explored the HDR function a little but have not seen too dramatic impact. On my phone I use Snapseed for HDR and feel it has more impact on the image. But so far so good.<br/>I also played with the Art14,splash color, function and it is working well.<br/>More later<br/><br/>2021 january update 2:<br/>tried the nightscape mode for the stars. everyone who has interest in that one probably knows the Pleiadies (see picture). this was taken handheld with Zuiko lens 40-150mm, not bad overall. the camera takes 8 frames with 1/10 sec each and combines then. outcome is not bad at all. to get the focus to work i had to point first to another brighter star and kept eh release button pressed half down when pointing then to the barely visible Pleiadies (this was in the city so no really dark sky).  this scene mode does not allow for manual focus which would be nice.</span>

<span>I'll try to keep it short and sweet. Nikon user for over 10yrs. Photo passes for concerts, comedy, and live shows. This camera is the best street photography camera I've ever owned. I shoot jpeg on the street. But what about raw!. It's an old school feel with modern tech. Raw is great. But that's not the point. It's a walk around action camera with great color saturation and white balance.<br/>Pro: light weight, shoot all day, feels great, battery life awesome on jpeg, sharp pics, for the art camera, great in low light<br/>Con: it's not a video camera: go Lumix G9, a lot options for a beginner; but a YouTube vid can fix that.<br/>I really like this camera and it's become my favorite camera.

<span>Honestly, for the price I was expecting something more DSLR-y. But what I got was a point-and-shoot that was buffed up to make it look like more than it is. Honestly when I picked it up out of the box I thought someone had scammed me. It feels like a kid's toy, a big hollow plastic camera. If not for the screen on the back, I think anyone could mistake it for that. It feels cheap and hollow inside.  But okay never mind the feel, it's all about the pictures right. And the pictures are on the same level of a point and shoot too. I was prepared to give it a chance, despite my initial disappointment, until I saw the grainy low light pictures and the extremely poor dynamic range on the video. I was very impressed with the autofocus though for pictures, it was very speedy. Less impressed with the videos where it couldn't keep focus when I zoomed in.<br/><br/>There are so many easy to access settings that provide those point and shoot features you'd expect, but it also allows you the more precise controls you'd expect from a better camera. The screen on the back is nice too. it's easy to hold when taking selfies, as long as you want to hold it with your left hand. For $200 less it would be a wonderful choice for a high quality point and shoot. And you might find it on sale for that price, And if you do I can recommend it. Maybe this camera is trying to fill that middle range between the two types of cameras.</span>

<span>I am not a professional. I wanted a camera that was better than the garbage that comes on a cell phone, but didn't want something as bulking as most DSLR camera. I wanted to be able to take it with me most places I went. This is what I arrived at. Very good camera, take incredible quality pictures! They don't look super great on the screen, but once I brought them over to my laptop they looked INCREDIBLE!<br/><br/>Only 2 things I was a little disappointed with. I really wish you could snap pictures faster. it's still MUCH faster than an average cell phone, so I was still okay. Just not as fast as DSLR's.<br/><br/>I was also a little disappointed by the app designed to import pictures to your phone wirelessly. I didn't really know it was going to require wifi, so it's difficult to do while you're out an about for the purpose of social media. Just have to stop at a coffee shop or something. This wasn't the whole reason I bought the camera, so not a huge issue.<br/><br/>All and all, I would still really recommend this camera for someone who wants good quality photos without lugging around a huge bag with camera parts. I didn't expect to spend this much, but a quality camera, even one designed to be smaller, lighter and more maneuverable, is going to cost you.</span>

<span>This is now the third insta360 I've had. I had the original, then the onex, now this. I will mostly be compring it to the onex, since it is made to be the replacement for that.<br/>I REALLY like the usable screen on this camera. I can actually get the functions I need and see useful previews.<br/>The form factor is a little bigger than the previous, but close enough to call it negligible. It's a heavy little unit, but sturdy.<br/>Battery life is really good. I did 4 20 racing sessions and it outlasted them all.<br/>I do use it windsurfing and it hasn't leaked yet.<br/>The bad stuff: They say quicker wireless transfer, but that's not true in any way. It's still basically unusable for editing my longer videos unless I download them first. I might look to purchase the cable instead, and I'm not sure why they can't just include that. Maybe if you are on;y taking 2 minte videos it works, but mine are usually 15-30 minutes long, and it really bogs down.<br/>No option to automatically cut videos in to shorter sections the software can actually handle.<br/>the edge stitching leaves a lot to desire.<br/>Finally, the flat output video is still pretty low quality, especially if you try to zoom in to frame a certain thing. I was hoping for a 4k flat output from a 360 capture. Nope.<br/>Still good, would still recommend.</span>

<span>I've ONLY played with it, didn't use it for any real work, but man is the APP just the worst. I'm on android, and my phone luckily supports the app and whatnot, BUT it requires access to "PHONE" aka your calls which gives them access to your logs, phone number, etc. Can't use the app if you don't activate it. Also since Android updated I think 10 and later versions, app permission names are all different from the permission names in the Insta360 app, so it's a real guess and check to see how many permissions you can leave off since, inside the app settings in "system" it truly asks for EVERYTHING; contacts, mic, camera, and the usual you expect like Storage. Also, YOU HAVE TO HAVE location on to use this app. Which has me looking for "spoofing" apps to spoof permissions turned on for security reasons. SORRY, just not in the most trusting mood with China these days, can't explain why, cough cough.<br/><br/>As for image after the DEMANDS it asks you for, it's not bad, though the image quality on screen is weirdly better looking than it is on my monitor. And no, it's not my PHOTO REFERENCE GRADE monitor that covers 98% of the Adobe RGB spectrum and is 500 Nits bright making it HDR500 compliant. Paid 900 for this monitor. It's not the issue. It's a neat device. Just hate the permissions it asks of you. It can perform at GoPro Max levels, and I was testing its capability in lower than desirable light. WHICH I did go into settings and adjusted the EV, ISO, Shutter and whatnot so it looked GREAT on the display, but for whatever reason, when I transferred it to the PC, looked  WAY DARKER AND WORSE. HMM. Also, Insta360 likes hiding features behind "PRO" mode, like 4K60 and the 5K settings. So, if you're wondering where those resolutions are hiding, it's there.<br/><br/>!!!HUGE TIP/WARNING!!!<br/>I bought this camera from AMAZON. I bought their other lineups from their site. DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR SITE, BUY FROM AMAZON. It takes forever to get to your house from China, and 90% of their items don't offer expedited shipping. Even if offered, it's disgustingly expensive like $50 to $100 per item expensive. Items come whenever and rarely together. So you might get one accessory one day and then the next month get another and after that 2 weeks for another part and so on. COMPLETE mystery as to the logic why that is.<br/><br/>Also, the Insta360 site tends to have worse pricing, not terribly worse, but when you factor in shipping, then it's way worse. BUT if you go free shipping. I find their site has a $50 to $100 premium to their items sometimes there's a deal, but also most of their items are RARELY kept in stock WHICH IS FRUSTRATING.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>Don't buy, yes it's one of the best ones out there and can easily go toe to toe with GoPro Max, without any struggle in a better form factor which means the stitching is better, as well. BUT the whole NEEDING AN APP ON YOUR PHONE to even USE this is disgusting and annoying. THEN there's a weird anti-HDMI out this company seems to have. NONE of their cameras support it, which at the price range of these cameras is inexcusable. YOU can kind of make the argument this camera can't find room for it, fair enough. BUT their OneR cameras that are modular DEFINITELY have room for it.</span>

<span>Watch out! This camera will NOT survive being submerged, even within 10m. Product says it’s water resistance up to 10 meters. I attempted to film some underwater shots, and eventually the camera stopped working. Found out that the battery compartment does not make a complete seal, so water leaked in. Thankfully the SD card was not damaged and I was able to keep the videos.<br/><br/>Besides this one major issue, everything else about the camera is very good. Wish it would record for longer than 30mins. Not able to do a set-and-forget Timelapse without the camera having to stop and start another video after 30mins. There’s about a 15 second delay between it stopping, loading and recording the next video.</span>

<span>This is unbelievable. At first, I was a little annoyed that you have to pay so much for a camera that lets you set manual iris/focus/sound etc. But I finally but the bullet and paid 4x as much as a regular fully auto HD cam. I'm so glad I did. I just tested all of the fancy bells and whistles that I was skeptical about. Holy crap, they all work! I got this camera for recording my own concerts. The audio is on par with some of the field recorders out there. The 4k resolution means that I can leave this at a wide angle from across the venue and later in editing, zoom into my bandmates it as if it were a second and third camera. On top off all that, I don;t have to run out into the audience to press record right before the show and then run out after the show. I can control it from my phone (this is what I was sure wouldn't work properly but it did)! The wifi range isn't long enough for a large venue or festival, but you can tap into a wifi router which I already have on stage for our sound gear.<br/><br/>I only got this camera because of it's manual control. Don't try shooting concerts with an automatic camera. The cameras don't understand stage lighting and it will look horrible unless it's a well lit outdoor show (of if the stage lights never change). Plus, they alway automatically focus on the stupid little toys and signs and beach balls that pop up from the audience. Manual settings solve all of that. You can get that with several different Cannon and sony cams for around the same price. But this camera absolutely CRUSHES it with the extra stuff. I am amazed.<br/><br/>Tip: don't bother buying the expensive larger battery. Get a usb backup charger. The kind that you can use to power a phone or tablet. I have a heavy duty one that will outlast any camera battery. If you're using a tripod, you just rig up a place to put it and you're gold.</span>

<span>I'm pretty happy with this camcorder. We bought two of them and they, like most consumer cameras, are a little clunky out of the box. Features like auto light on/off, auto horizon level, and demo mode, can make it finicky to get your shot the way you want it, but a quick few minutes in the menu, got this camera in good working order. It has a great zoom lens with optics that allow the image to be sharp even at the tele end of the lens. I have noticed that the edges of the picture aren't super sharp when the camera is zoomed all the way out wide. For our application this isn't an issue as we'll be using this as a close up camera 99% of the time. This camera cannot record in 4K and output video via HDMI at the same time (HDMI will go out when you start recording), it can output and record to 1080P at the same time, however. The 4K is a little soft, as you would expect with a consumer camcorder, however the footage looks fantastic when scaled down to 1080p. The built in microphone is hands down the best quality I've ever heard from a built in camcorder mic. It sounds as if I'm using an external recorder. I'm also glad it has a built in video light and nightvision, however as I mentioned earlier, the built in light turns on and off constantly in auto mode, so I recommend disabling auto and switching it on/off manually when needed.</span>

<span>Works great until I try to upload the footage to the GoPro Quick app. I have been trying for 5 day.  One hour of footage everyday and when I click scan for footage it says no new footage found. My firmware is up to date and I have removed and added the camera multiple times.<br/><br/>Also the battery last for 35 to 60 mins.<br/><br/>Also was a headache downloading because it would take so long to download.  My battery would run out before I could download My footage to the app.  NOW I CAN'T EVEN DOWNLOAD ANY THING.</span>
