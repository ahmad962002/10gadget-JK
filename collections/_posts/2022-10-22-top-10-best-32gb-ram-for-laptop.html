<span>I used Crucial's RAM-finder app from their website to be sure that I was buying the correct product for our new Asus laptop. Laptop was already pretty good performer with the original 4gb of RAM. But it did slow down during multiple program use etc.<br/>There are several good Asus-RAM-upgrade video's out there that are very helpful. Small tips--like the fact that, with 10 hold down screws on the computer's shell, there are 3 or 4 different sizes and you should not mix them up. I ended up using several Dixie cups to hold the screws during disassembly. The size difference is almost impossible to discern with the naked eye.<br/>Following the video's instructions, it was very easy to pop off the back of the laptop, remove the old RAM module and pop in the new one. Then reinstall the back of the laptop and start up the computer.<br/>Worked perfectly. And faster than before.<br/><br/>From shut-down to disassembly to assembly to restart, this entire process took about 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Some of the videos recommend disconnecting the battery before removing the old RAM. Probably a wise idea. I've upgraded two Asus laptops and did not disconnect the battery either time and had no problem. But probably a wise idea to do so.<br/><br/>Also--critical--don't use a screwdriver to remove the back of the laptop. One slip and you've ruined the computer's guts. Do use the little plastic pry-bars that are available for this purpose. Much more control and less likely to cause damage even if you slip.</span>

<span>I have a budget lenovo laptop that I bought when I started college and I was constantly plagued by freezing and a lack of resources whenever having more than one program open. I decided to invest in this ram card and having 16gb as opposed to 4gb makes a world of difference. I can finally have Chrome, Spotify, and word open without lag or freezing.</span>

<span>I bought this for my ASUS Vivobook S 14 Flip TN3402QA-AS54T. It came stock with 8GB of DDR4 3200 so to give it more capacity plus allow it to run in dual channel mode I purchased this 8GB of Crucial 3200. It made the laptop noticeably speedier. It runs at the full rated speed and seems like a perfect match. The laptop was too new to check compatibility on Crucial's site as it was not in their database yet at the time of purchase.<br/><br/>The price was great and Crucial is a trusted performance brand, so this was a great buy for me.</span>

<span>I had purchased a very capable  Acer Aspire 5 laptop with 4GB of memory. I decided to double the ram by adding this Crucial 4GB memory stick. It cost me about $20 USD at the time I purchased it. I am so glad I did. The laptop runs so much smoother now. It always started up fast, but now it is a much faster startup. I can keep more programs open without any of them slowing down. I can also keep more tabs open on my browser. With this upgrade, there  was an added bonus of more shared video memory, (5GB total, 2GB dedicated, 3GB shared),  that helps my programs like Youtube, Zoom, and watching movies,  run much smoother.  I can only comment on gaming from the basic games I play. They run smooth without any choppiness. I can not find any negatives about this upgrade as it has been a very positive experience. I highly recommend this Crucial memory.</span>

<span>This was for me, cheaper to buy two of these than buying a 64MB kit from other manufacturers.<br/><br/>It's a bit of work to disassemble the Mini, but Ifixit provides a handy guide and it's very straightforward. After you take the logic board out, just pop out the Apple memory cards and pop these in, making sure they're securely seated into place.<br/><br/>During reassembly, I think I didn't securely inset the fan connector--I didn't realize this and when I turned on the Mini to check (it recognized all of the memory) and install updates, I noticed how hot it got. I checked to see if there was any air blowing out of the vent and...nothing.<br/><br/>Turned off the machine, took off the bottom place, and it over and plugged it back in. Fan not running...<br/><br/>So, disassemble down to the fan portion and re-seated the fan connector. Plug it back in, and yes! The fan is running. Put everything back together and it's been running (fan and all) very well and quiet.<br/><br/>Very happy with the purchase!</span>

<span>As the title says, works just fine with Mac Mini late 2018, but a few words for the wise...<br/><br/>TL:DR<br/>- Its time consuming to get to the RAM in this computer<br/>- Make sure everything is working before putting this back together<br/>- Check that your fan is spinning (0rpm is no good, this computer always has an idle speed)<br/>  - Macs Fan Control is a free app that will help you check your fan is working properly<br/><br/>After all is said and done this RAM is working great in both slots for a total of 64GB, but I did have quite a bit of troubleshooting before everything was working well. On my first attempt of installing I took the whole machine apart, replaced with new ram in both slots, put everything back together and...no boot. This computer can take nearly 10min to put back together with all its tiny screws and connectors (im looking at you impossibly small and poorly placed wifi antenna!). I would highly recommend leaving the computer half built and testing a boot before reassembly. I left off the ram metal shielding, fan, and wifi, and was able to boot without problem. Basically, install the ram and only replug the large logic board power cable and the tiny 2pin cable nearby and try to boot. After all is said and done I needed to try x6 boots before I was able to successfully rebuild. KEEP IN MIND, this little computer runs HOT FAST, so when boot checking, simply get into the OS, make sure you see the ram in your System Report, and power back down.<br/><br/>- 1st attempt: Removed OEM RAM and replaced with x2 samsung = no boot<br/>(had already put the whole computer back together = MISTAKE)<br/>- 2nd: Took computer apart again, put OEM RAM back in = successful boot<br/>- 3rd: Left computer mostly disassembled and installed x1 32GB stick = successful boot<br/>- 4th: Installed 2nd 32GB stick = successful boot<br/>- 5th: Re-installed all pieces except bottom metal shielding (aka wifi) = successful, but no fan<br/>- 6th: Pulled the fan back out, and its tiny connector had pulled up slightly during instal and only had 2 of the 4 pins connected. Pressed down on the connector and = fully successful boot<br/>- Then reinstalled all components.<br/><br/>I hope this helps save any future DIY'ers a little bit of time. All in all, took me about 45min to get everything settled in with all the troubleshooting. If I were rebuilding this entire machine every-time it would have easily taken 2+hours and would have been possibly frustrating enough to give up and go with a trusted third party option.</span>

<span>Dell says that the XPS 15 9570 can only run 32gb, but the motherboard is rated to 64gb. These worked great. Now I've got 64gb and it's lightning-fast, even with a huge excel spreadsheet! FYI: After you change out the ram, your PC will want to go through the diagnostic/scan process, it takes a little time, and you have to babysit it to answer some questions that pop up. Takes about 1 hour or so, take your time to let it go through the process. Oh, and when you open up the bottom, be prepared to clean out your PC. I found a big chunk of lint in one fan. Have a very small paintbrush, an old toothbrush, and a small vacuum handy. The paintbrush will clean the fan blades, and the toothbrush cleans crap that is built up on the components. My PC is literally better than new...</span>

<span>I used this product in a Synology DS920+.  It was an easy installation. This particular memory was listed as one of the ones that is known to work with the system.  One of the key considerations in purchasing this module for this scenario is that it is a dual rank chip.  So far so good with it.  After installation of the memory and plugging back in the power cords and network cables, the system powered up and booted up without issue.<br/><br/>The system recognizes the memory and shows 20GB of RAM available. Now I just need to start making use of the memory.</span>

<span>Nowadays 8gb ram just doesn't cut it if you look to have stable and smooth performance on games like warzone, apex, or even halo. That's where this RAM stick comes in handy. 16gb of RAM does perfect on games like apex and warzone. I've seen about a 20 fps boost on RAM consuming games like warzone. Plus, this RAM stick was super easy to install in my Nitro 5 laptop. So I think that if you are still hooked on 8gb RAM, you should upgrade to 16gb RAM for a couple bucks with this RAM stick.</span>

<span>The A-Tech RAM is a fair priced match set of SODIMM (8gig each) that serves its purpose of memory utility. Many systems that can take SODIMM 'sticks' may be able to handle faster specs and it would be wise to seek those make/models out. However, in my case, I am using it in a NAS system and it does exactly what it needs to do which makes it excellent utility RAM. If I had other items that asked for similar spec SODIMM, I would again look at the A-Tech offering and some of their others.</span>
