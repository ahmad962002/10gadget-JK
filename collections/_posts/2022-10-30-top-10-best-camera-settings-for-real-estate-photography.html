<span>I have had a Canon rebel for years and was happy to get this for my 16 year old daughter who has a photographer’s eye. My old lenses still work with the new T7 which greatly expands her options. The camera is easy to use but also will be helpful to explore more detailed photography skills.</span>

<span>Nice build quality, the pictures come out really good with just the kit lense, definitely recommend for any beginner who has never tried photography! Videos suck, but with some editing and good lighting, you can get a video that is good enough for small businesses. I bought a used T7 and the one thing I would change is the eye lense is very blurry, I have to take most of my pictures on the digital display because with the eye lense, you can’t tell if the person or item is in focus. 4/5 camera, if you have the money definitely buy a new camera or go for the cannon M50 or the M50 mark II.</span>

Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<span>Version 3 of this Wyze indoor/outdoor cam is a bargain.  The high resolution and low-light color sensitivity of the new Sony Starlight imaging chip, which it uses, is amazing.  It is significantly more sensitive than my own vision at dusk and dawn.  The camera nevertheless also has infrared imaging capability, which I do not need for my applications.  These features coupled with a multitude of other features, too many to list, and overall care to design details make this a superb choice at its current price.  There are, however, things to consider that might depend on intended application.  1. The short focal-length lens provides a 130-degree field of view.  This is great for surveillance applications, but it introduces significant barrel distortion.  Although the camera has digital zoom capability, this is at the expense of otherwise great resolution.  A version with a longer focal length lens (narrower field of view) would suit my needs better.  2. The camera is suitable for some outdoor applications but can also shoot through windows (IR imaging off).  The camera has a white body that makes the black window mount, sold separately as an accessory, a must.  It would be nice if Wyze introduces a black version to limit window reflections, as it did for the earlier Version 2 of the camera.  3. You must buy a subscription to the Wyze Cam Plus cloud service, currently as low as $15 per year per camera, to make full use of the many surveillance detection and recording features.  The annual cost is likely to go up and be significant with multiple camera installations.  4. Wyze is developing a web-based browser application, which is currently in beta.  For now it has limited functionality compared to the Android and Apple smartphone applications.  Sadly, you must subscribe to Cam Plus to access even the beta version.  Wyze should definitely make browser access free.  Time will tell how much of a long-term bargain this camera will be.</span>

<span>I like these little cameras!  Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below).  Real time live video is important to me for various reasons.  For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.<br/><br/>These cameras are small and light.  The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting.  Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.<br/><br/>The app is so-so..  it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked.  For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings.  To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline..  it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead.  I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain.  You have to guess where to look for things.<br/><br/>For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events.  Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.<br/><br/>Speaking of recording events only to your SD card:  SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings.  If you choose "events only" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops.  This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information.  I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook.  The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.<br/><br/>The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events.  It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone.  When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good.  It is slightly better indoors.  I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera.  (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that.  The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).<br/><br/>For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio.  Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced.  As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.<br/><br/>Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons.  This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.<br/>I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all.  You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings.  I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet.  No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.<br/><br/>1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017.  They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years.  They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal).  The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed.  (My network is not the issue.)  It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise.  I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards.  No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.<br/><br/>3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc.  Priced around what wyze cameras cost.  As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house.  Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them.  That feature does work and is actually really nice.  Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.<br/><br/>4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit.  These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point.  The cameras seem really solid and well made.  I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked.  Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay.  For the price, they would have had to be perfect.<br/><br/>5. Eufy Solo  IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more.  I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster.  I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras.  Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion.  Audio quality was really good with these.  But the delay was a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>The End.  I applaud you if you got this far!</span>

<span>Much improved over 1st version.  Night picture is much clearer.  I use them outside under eaves, porches &amp; patios.  Last one has been there 4 plus years &amp; was still working. Temps ranging from 110 degrees to zero.  After seeing the new vision I’ve replaced all 15 cameras at both homes.  2nd home is a cabin in the mountains so I get many videos of lions, deer, raccoons, skunks &amp; birds.  Some have even captured mice.  My biggest complaint is the constant upscale pressure of their longer cloud videos.  Whenever I replace an old camera I 15 days of their free longer videos &amp; I hate them.  Do not need to see the trees blowing for 5 minutes.  Then when free trial expires you have to figure out how to get free cam lite videos which are 12 second snapshots.  Longer videos are recorded on a 32 gig micro sd card which you access in the phone app.  So if you need the longer video it’s there you just need to look at sd card from your phone &amp; it’s there.  Works great for what I need.  Many false events outside but I realize they are an inside camera.  I’ve tried their wireless outside version &amp; they’re horrible.  They eat batteries miss the wildlife &amp; other events.  They do not have any range of wifi so they are junk.  They lack the ability of seeing the sd card from phone app. so you need to retrieve card to download events.  Never have even done that cause it’s a hassle to pretrieve card.  Just been viewing the 12 second videos.  If I had to pay to use them for videos I would change them all out for different brand.  The price point for cameras &amp; 12 second videos can’t be beat.</span>

<span>We purchased this camera for work purposes and have to say, it does do the job. I was able to zoom a pretty good distance (more than what is actually needed). The flash is not the best BUT after walking the property and taking random photos - the camera did pick-up lowlight areas and did brighten the scene, so the photo did come out clear and brighter. I wouldn't recommend this camera for a person who is experienced and is used to a more sophisticated DSLR camera as it would be a disappointment to you. This is great for someone wanting to learn how to take photos and doesn't want to carry multiple lenses around at the same time. Although these cameras were purchased for work, I did catch some pretty nice shots. The main caveat I will say is the LINK123, APP. Unfortunately, the app does not always function when you want it to. Also, it would be nice to be able to open the app without syncing your camera to view older saved photos in your camera gallery.<br/><br/>Overall, if you would like an introductory camera with pretty neat options - I would recommend this camera.</span>

<span>I have been shooting exclusively with this lens for around two months now, doing fine art landscapes, nature, and some artistic architectural images as well. This lens is fantastic.<br/><br/>It is built like a tank. When you pick it up for the first time, it simply oozes quality, with extremely precise construction and movements, a buttery smooth and crisp focus ring, and a very nice heft. This lens absolutely does not feel or work like a budget lens. It feels and shoots like premium professional glass, playing in the same league as Carl Zeiss and Canon L. Do you get what you pay for? No, I would say in this case you actually get quite a bit more.<br/><br/>The image quality I've been getting from this lens is absolutely superb. Mine is razor sharp across the frame in most shots, especially stopped down. You get creamy bokeh and some vignetting at 2.8. This is normal and desirable, and it looks great in real life. I seriously do not understand people who whine about these perfectly normal features that are essentially inherent to any ultrawide lens when shot wide open. They add a nice emphasis to the subject in most real-world images.<br/><br/>As for the perfectly normal mustache distortion, it is only notable in images where you have a straight line crossing through the middle of your frame, such as a sea horizon at sunset.  In most normal photos you will not see any distortion. You really need straight lines for it to be noticeable. Either way, this is easily corrected with one click in Aperture, Lightroom or Adobe Camera RAW with any one of the many free and excellent lens profiles available as a simple download online. Also note that moustache distortion is inherent to virtually all ultra-wide angle lenses, including Canon L glass.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this lens. It is currently my favorite lens I have shot with in over 7 years of serious and professional photography, and I would highly recommend it to those who know how to shoot with ultra-ultra-wides (see Ken Rockwell's article on the subject, but disregard his inaccurate review of this lens which was based on a bad copy of the ProOptic version he got from Adorama). Basically embrace the stylistic nature of the lens, and do not merely use it to cram more stuff into your frame. It really is a majestic lens to have in your arsenal.<br/><br/>The only reasons to consider the Canon L lens are USM autofocus and the electronic control of aperture (which enables program mode). You can shoot in Aperture Priority and Manuak modes just fine with this lens. If you just want AF confirm you can get a chip for that for about $10 or less on eBay. For doing landscape work, this lens will do the trick. If you are shooting people, you may want to consider an autofocus lens.<br/><br/>Lastly, I will leave you with a quick tip: when shooting with this lens, it is best to shoot on a tripod if possible, and to check your focus zoomed in 10x on the magnifier in live view (tripod or not). Otherwise you may be blaming the lens for soft shots that were due to an easily avoidable user focusing error. If you focus properly, this lens will nail the shot every time. It's an incredible buy.</span>

<span>I love this lens!  I bought the lens to supplement my UWA lens corral, having an 11-16mm for my Canon 7D and a 17-40L for my Canon 5D MkIII.  My 17-40L works well for the Real Estate work I do but just not quite wide enough!  16mm is the sweet spot for me with Real Estate Photography.  The 11-16mm f/2.8  Tokina won't work properly on my 5D MkIII, so I picked up one of these, liking the reviews and the price!<br/><br/>The lens worked better than I expected!  The colors was fantastic, the sharpness was amazing!  Adjusting to shooting with a 100% manual lens was easy, they all used to be that way!  I just focused using live view and it worked fine.<br/><br/>Outdoor landscapes have a very special feel to them with this lens, especially when combined with a good ND Filter.  The real estate shoot that I used it for indeed, also had an exceptional feel.  The compliments I received on this Real Estate Shoot were some of the best I've ever received.  That being said, I had issues with it.  The Vertical distortion was just too much for me to resolve.<br/><br/>Instead of the normal horizontal "mustache" distortion I was expecting, the images had a heavy vertical distortion on either side of the frame.  I applied corrections in LR5 and with DXO but could not completely eliminate it.  Too me it stood out like a sore thumb but after working them as much as I could, I had no choice but to submit them, as I couldn't get back to the site for another shoot, it was a once in, last chance in, type of arrangement.  The images were fantastic in many respects but the curved side walls were unacceptable to me.  Nevertheless, I submitted them.<br/><br/>The compliments from the client were glowing!!  In fact it led to a couple more shoots for them on some other properties.  By then, I had already sent the lens back, deciding the amount of work needed to correct the images was way too much time to make it worthwhile for Real Estate imagery.  And despite the glowing reviews, some of the best ever, I stand by my premise, it was way to much work in post, for the type of shoots I was using it for.  Way to much...<br/><br/>Needless to say, I ordered another one because despite not really being able to use it for Real Estate Images, the rest of options for me to use it are fantastic, I missed it and just wanted this lens to live in my bag for the landscape and other work I enjoy doing.  As I mentioned before, coupled with a very good ND filter, this lens is fantastic for landscapes and gives the images a very special feel with an exceptional color rendition!  It also resolves sharpness in at an exceptional level!  I'm looking into adding an after market chip to add to it for AF and/or Aperture...<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you've not shot Ultra Wide before on a full frame, it may take a little getting used too, with this lens you have to do a little work, photographer work, like "back in the day"  but the results are worth it!  Just don't buy it for Real Estate interiors!  You'll love it!</span>

<span>This camera is my first camera ever (other then my phone). To say I’m absolutely in love with this camera is a under statement. Ever photo I’ve taken so far has came out crystal clear! The little things around my house including my kitten that with a phone doesn’t pop much absolutely come to life! I bawled when my camera came in. I have been scraping up every penny to be able to save up for this camera and I’m so happy I did. One thing I do wish it came with was a lense protecter. I have seen mentions of uv lense protecters that are supposed to be absolutely wonderful. If you do get this camera save a little extra to get one. Once I can save up I’m getting me one. It is a super easy camera to learn especially for beginners. It is not heavy at all, which comes in handy for if you are doing long photo shoots. Another thing I wish it came with was a camera cleaner. Or things that told you what was safe to clean the camera with. Obviously not water but are glasses cleaners safe? Or is there a specific camera cleaner? Not sure but other then that I’m beyond happy!</span>

<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>It's an old product but very reasonable price... make sure you buy the old type of memory cards... however, this worked great during our recent Canadian trip.  A bit slow in capturing focus, and of course, there is no wifi for xfr... but SD card readers are cheap, and Apple even has an adapter that works great w/ iPhones &amp; iPads.  I did buy an extra battery, but all worked fine.<br/><br/>PS  For those who couldn't get this working...  START OVER AGAIN... pull the battery, count to 5, reinsert battery, and then connect the charger to the camera...  I had to do this reset only once.<br/><br/>Note:  I'm coming off of a Nikon/Tamron system that I gave to my grandson who's getting into Photography... so as at least something better than the iPhone zooms, this is the one.</span>

"   1. High-quality, 360 degree still images are captured with a large sensor and a unique lens  -Equipped with a 1.0-inch back-illuminated CMOS image sensor, which is the largest 360 degree consumer camera. This camera uses two sensors, each with 20MP (approx.) to capture high-definition 360 degree 23MP (approx.) still images. In addition, it supports high-sensitivity shooting up to ISO 6400, which is an advantage for shooting at night or in a dimly lit room. Ricoh's original three-fold structure technology is used for the lens unit to achieve a body that’s only 24 mm thin, whilst increasing the size of the image sensor.  -Equipped with a multi-stage aperture mechanism, the F value can be selected from either F2.1, F3.5 or F5.6. In brightly lit areas, narrowing down the aperture will improve the resolution of the surrounding area. Furthermore, the newly designed lens unit effectively suppresses ghosting, flares, and purple fringing that can affect the image.  2. High-performance image processing with the latest algorithm and various shooting modes  -The latest image processing algorithm provides low-noise, high-resolution images throughout the sensitivity range. In addition, DR (Dynamic Range) correction is automatically adjusted during shooting to effectively suppress overexposure, even outdoors where there can be a huge variance between brightly lit areas and shadow. In addition, this model is equipped with various shooting modes such as ""HDR composition"" and ""interval composition"" allowing for star trails to be captured, as well as ""multi-bracket shooting"" that shoots continuously with up to 19 settings.   3. High-quality (4K equivalent) 360 degree movies using the latest image stabilization technology  -When shooting movies, the 3-axis rotation correction provides high image stabilization performance. It is possible to shoot high-definition, smooth 360 degree movies at 30 fps (frames/second) at 3840 x 1920 pixels, which is equivalent to 4K. In addition, Av (Aperture Priority), Tv (Shutter Priority), ISO (ISO Sensitivity Priority Auto Exposure), and M (Manual) can be selected as the exposure settings, enabling movie shooting with more detailed settings.  -The camera body has a built-in 4ch microphone that supports 360 degree spatial audio recording, and by recording audio in all directions including not only the horizontal direction but also the vertical direction, the sound and image as it is in the shooting environment. It is possible to reproduce. You can enjoy creating VR video content with a sense of realism and watching videos on a large monitor more realistically.  4. Easy-to-understand UI (user interface)  -Equipped with a 0.93-inch organic EL (OLED) panel that displays shooting information at the bottom of the camera. This allows you to directly check shooting information such as battery level, shooting mode, remaining number of shots, F value and ISO sensitivity value at a glance.  -The Fn (function) button at the bottom of the side of the camera switches the display between ""normal shooting"" and ""self-timer"", 3 types of plug-ins, and switches to off/mute mode.  -You can save the shooting modes from your smartphone as ""My Settings"" in the camera body (one for images and one for video).  5. Supports RAW file format to improve editing control  -In addition to JPEG format, it is possible to save in RAW (Adobe DNG format) JPEG format. As a plug-in for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic, we provide the stitching app “RICOH THETA Stitcher” free of charge. After developing a file recorded in RAW, you can generate a spherical image with no visible seams with a plug-in. You can freely change the details of zenith correction, orientation correction, and distance specification during stitching. You can enjoy full-scale editing of color and image quality like an DSLR camera.   6. Various sharing methods  -The 360 degree spherical image taken can be posted directly to Facebook or LINE, or uploaded to the dedicated website - theta360.com and shared on social media sites such as Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr. can do. You can also post spherical images on YouTube's 360 degree channel and Google Maps .  -Equipped with a 360 degree video ""remote playback function"" as a plug-in. By using a general-purpose receiving device such as a compatible wireless display adapter to transfer and mirror the 360 degree still image and video data recorded in the camera, you can create a powerful 360 degree image on a large display or projector. You can project it and operate it on the camera body to enjoy it.  7. Robust and luxurious design  -The body material is a lightweight and highly robust magnesium alloy. While ensuring rigidity that can withstand harsh use, the surface is textured to give it a luxurious texture suitable for the top end models.  -A metal tripod screw hole is used for use in harsher environments. In addition, the connector for external connection uses the next-generation standard USB 3.0 (Type-C), achieving a more efficient transfer speed. Since the shape is vertically symmetrical, it can be inserted in either direction.  8. Excellent extensibility with updates and plug-ins  -Adopts ""Qualcomm Snapdragon TM"" and Android-based operating system for the main unit.

<span>If you are working in real estate photography this is a must have tool for offering clients 3-d tours. I use it with Matterport and Zillow. The picture quality is great. My only frustration is the battery, but I always carry external battery’s and so battery life isn’t really as big an issue for me.</span>

<span>Truth here: people frustrated with this camera have not put in the time to research how to use it.<br/><br/>Pro? The camera is great. If you learn to use it and understand it, it’s a money maker. Don’t lean on this model for video. You can get better from the theta line of 360° cameras.<br/><br/>Con? Made in China. Pro2 in the USA. Half star loss for that.<br/><br/>For a thousand dollar camera, I expect some stickers and a better case. As well as a dedicated lens cover. The packaging is super cheap. Half star loss for that.<br/><br/>INSANELY limited battery + the remote app is 2/5 at best. Half star loss there.<br/><br/>Lastly, half star loss for bad customer service support. Several day to get a response on any ticket is kinda poor. No option to subscribe to premium customer service or coverage.</span>

<span>I love that the beginner photographer can easily use this camera in the general settings, but there is also room to grow your skills with manual settings.<br/>The auto focus works phenomenally, and the picture quality is crisp and a leap ahead of the Panasonic camera I was using.</span>

<span>Great camera for photo journalism or amateur photographers who love taking photos. I highly recommend using manual focus tho, it really does get you the picture you want. Also recommend looking over the manual and watching a couple of youtube videos to learn the camera more. Best way to learn is to go and try it. Also, essential that the bundle comes with two lenses, adds to versatility, you won't regret it.</span>
