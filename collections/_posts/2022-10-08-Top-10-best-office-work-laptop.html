                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm writing this for a typical user, using plain language, so they know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation, which is a monster configured for performance, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop, knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy, but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced, and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.<br/><br/>My preferred browser is Opera, so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault, that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world, so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.<br/><br/>My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge, the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages, and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it, until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate, and that's a serious problem.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it came optimized the way I made, it, I'd give it a 4, maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3, if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year, and based on what I saw, there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email, that has better data management than a Chromebook, then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop with the sole purpose of installing Linux. I didn't want to mess with my better computers Secure Boot to try to dual boot it. I  had read on one website that this particular model, and this processor worked well with Linux.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that Manjaro XFCE Linux installed and booted flawlessly. The only thing I had to do was change the display resolution - very easy to do with the graphical tools included. The only problem was a setting the proper time. I had to do that through the terminal, but was extremely simple and has maintained the proper time ever since.<br/><br/>The display quality doesn't match my more expensive laptop, but is more than  acceptable for normal use, including watching videos. The computer is fairly responsive for normal use, including watching videos.  All in all,  I am happy with this computer for running a Linux distribution.</span>

<span>There was absolutely nothing wrong with this laptop! I honestly thought it was brand new. That's why I didn't understand why the free year of 365 was used. Come to find out I bought a new/used computer. I needed Microsoft 365 for school. I returned it because of that reason! My mistake! Whoever does purchase this computer will be very happy! It runs fast and is easy to navigate. There are not any defects or markings that I noticed and I'm OCD. I apologize for my mistake and will read what I'm buying thoroughly next time! Thank you for sending such a nice laptop to me! I returned it in a brand new black leather laptop clutch for the hassle. Thanks again!</span>

<span>purchased this product for fiancee to use for work from home, they require windows 10 and can't use win11,  this says preinstalled with win 10 home, the reason we bought it, it came with win 11 installed, spent over 2 hours with HP tech to get win 10 reinstalled so we could use this laptop.  Also as a side note, it dosn't have a lAN line connection, only wireless, had to get an adapter for USB port. (she can't work using wireless), other than that seems like a good computer for the price.</span>

<span>I have a iMac desktop which I absolutely love but I can’t take it with me when I leave the house, so I bought this little guy so I could grab and go. I was anticipating a little more from it to be honest. There are a few big problems I have with it. First, it runs Windows 11 S. I don’t know what the S stands for but I’m guessing it means slow because it is painfully slow. Downloading the software updates took over a hour and a half. Secondly, the 64GB hard drive space is half way full just from the operating system and software applications it comes with.  I used 2GB loading photos alone. I decided not to put my music on it just to save disk space. Lastly, as I said  before, it runs Windows 11 S. I attempted to download some files from the internet but the Windows wouldn’t allow me to do it. It forces you to use Microsoft Store which is terrible if your looking for a good selection of apps. If you’re okay with those problems I experienced then go ahead and buy yourself one. I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere. Unfortunately I’m going to have to send it back because it’s not what I wanted or what they said was.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>Great laptop for the price, I don't think you can find a laptop this great at this price point. Appearance looks great, great build quality, keyboard does not at all feel cheap at all and the keyboard backlight is a great touch. Very lightweight. Touch pad is large and responsive. I have not tried the fingerprint scanner yet. Decently fast boot up times given it has an SSD. Battery life is actually pretty great, too. I am happy with the ports, it even has a USB C port. Screen gets very bright.<br/><br/>It also took about 5 minutes to put in an 8GB ram stick in the easily accessible and open ram slot.<br/><br/>Some cons of course since this is a budget laptop (these cons can be considered "normal" at this price point):<br/> - Full HD display with 1080P screen, however the color quality, especially blacks and other colors is not great. It feels like white is overwhelming compared to other colors. But otherwise at this price point it is OK in my opinion, just that there is a very noticeable difference compared to my 700 dollar laptop.<br/>- CPU kind of sucks. I added 8 GB of ram which did make the computer faster, but downloading things or loading times can be slow with the CPU being the issue. However it is tolerable and I am overall happy with the speed for this price point and do not feel I have to crutch on my other high end laptops.<br/>- The acer 5 series is usually marketed as "slim", but this laptop is definitely not slim. It isn't bulky though, I think it is very average or more in thickness compared to actual slim laptops on the market.<br/><br/>If you have 330 dollars only to spend and are on a tight budget, don't hesitate to get this laptop. If you do purchase this laptop, I would DEFINITELY recommend adding additional ram (I got 8GB ram for 25 bucks at microcenter) since it is super easy to upgrade the ram in this computer, and it made a noticeable difference in browsing, loading, scroll speeds. If you have an additional 100 dollars more to spend, I would go ahead and purchase a more expensive laptop for a better screen, and the next price-tier laptops usually have additional ram.</span>

<span>Okay, so full disclosure.  I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.<br/><br/>First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:<br/><br/>[EditionID]<br/>Home<br/>[Channel]<br/>Retail<br/><br/>Once you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.<br/><br/>Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.<br/><br/>Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called "Vari-Bright."  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off "Vari-Bright" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.<br/><br/>The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.<br/><br/>The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.<br/><br/>I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a "nice" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.<br/><br/>The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno.<br/><br/>I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.</span>

<span>Purchased this laptop because I didn't want to use my gaming rig for work and other basic tasks.<br/><br/>Build quality is far better than I  expected at this price point. Sure, it would be great to have a solid aluminum case instead of just the top, but that is to be expected for the price.<br/>Took it apart as soon as it was delivered so I could add a 8gb ram stick and a second ssd.<br/>Installation was super easy.<br/>Kudos to acer for adding the ability to install a 2.5" hard drive with provided hardware.<br/>Not many other rigs at this price point that have a second drive option.<br/>You can also upgrade the nvme drive if you want to.<br/><br/>Backlit keyboard is also a huge plus and it is the perfect brightness in my opinion.<br/>Keyboard is comfortable to type on and the addition of a 10 key is another bonus at this price point.<br/><br/>Screen is nice and bright with no glare. Honestly a much better picture quality than I expected for a sub $500 laptop.<br/><br/>It has all the ports you need to get the job done.<br/>2x usb 3<br/>1x usb 2<br/>1x usbc "Out only unfortunately" You have to charge the laptop with included charger.<br/>Lan/Ethernet<br/>Headphone jack<br/><br/>Performance is where this laptop really shines.<br/>I am dual booting the stock windows 11 and linux mint.<br/>Both run flawlessly and super fast.<br/>Hasn't slowed down at all with multiple apps and browser tabs running at once.<br/>Everything runs just as fast as my desktop gaming rig.<br/>Would't run any high end games on it of coarse since it is not built for that and has no deddicated video card.<br/>Pretty sure you could run minecraft or wow/diablo on lower settings.<br/><br/>Battery life is also amazing.<br/>I am getting about 8 hours of usage before I plug the battery in at 30%.<br/>That is with full screen brightness, wifi and bluetooth enabled.<br/>It took 10 hours to completely drain the battery after the first charge.<br/><br/>I would recommend this laptop to anyone that wants a solid rig at a great price for everything other than gaming.<br/>It is also very light for a full featured laptop, so it would be a great choice for school or business for someone that needs/wants to carry around a full sized laptop.<br/>I don't think you could find a better laptop for a student at this price.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>If you're working within the limitations of this platform, then there's really nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>It's an excellent throw-in-a-bag-and-go laptop.  No bells and whistles (except the numpad/mousepad), excellent battery life, and a surprisingly robust plastic chassis.  One charge usually gets about 10 hours of useful life, and that's without extreme battery saving settings in use.<br/><br/>The num-/mouse-pad is great.  The caveat to that is that it's mostly useless unless you have an external mouse, or are only using it in spreadsheets.  Having to toggle between functionality makes it mostly useless, otherwise.  But (!!) it does give you a one-hand numpad, which is unheard of in other laptops this size, so that's pretty incredible in its own right.<br/><br/>It should go without saying:  unless you're talking about solitaire or minesweeper, you shouldn't be trying to game on this thing.  That's not what it's for, that's not what it's good at.  But for basic productivity, it's hard to argue with this thing for usability and utility, especially at this price.</span>
