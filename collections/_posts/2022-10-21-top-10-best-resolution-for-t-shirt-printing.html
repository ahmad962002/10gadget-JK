<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Purchase Oct. 2021-I have been using this Cricut Easypress 2 for the past 10.5 months and happy with it. I use the same materials-parchment paper brand, Subli paper, Epson printer, same brand of polyester shirt. Did several projects with it and it turns out great.  About a month ago, It started burning my projects (w/ Temp set at 385F for 30 Sec. (recommended by Subli paper was 400F at 25-40 sec.) The heat press showed 385 at 30sec. but barely 10 sec into the process, it would burn the shirt and I noticed that the plate is so hot that it overheats beyond the heat settings.  I did a few more projects thinking it was just an isolated one, but a couple more shirts would burn.  This product is only good for less than a year. Not a good investment.  I'll try to contact the supplier and have this returned, if not, I would just advise-"buyers beware".<br/><br/>Update - i contacted customer service and the representative was very helpfull. They are sending a replacement to make good of their product warranty. I'm updating my rating to 4 star, as i might just have gotten a bad unit but otherwise the product is excellent.</span>

<span>The Easy Press itself is great, easy to use, no issues. My issue is that the box states it comes with a welcome book and materials for a practice project, mine did not. I believe this to be a seller issue, not the product.</span>

<span>It’s a good printer. The instructions were not easy to understand but the customer service and tech support was very good in helping me get everything set up so I can use it. You do have to disconnect your antivirus or the printing program won’t work, so if you use your computer for work that requires a firewall and antivirus you might want to get it set up on a different computer. This works great on thin fabric, but thick fabric that’s more than maybe a quarter inch thick gets tricky. So if you’re wanting to print on sweatshirts or something thick and big like that, you might struggle to get it to work right. But when you use on thin kids shirts and stuff it works wonderful.</span>

<span>These work really well, fourth time we are using this! A few tips for you, especially since the instructions leave a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>1) WASH THE SHIRT FIRST<br/><br/>I forgot about the washing of the shirts ahead of time.  The first time we used these the shirts are still hanging in there after about two years and multiple washes.  The next two times we forgot to wash the shirts, the iron ons looked great but are peeling a bit already.<br/><br/>2) DO NOT PRINT IN REVERSE, THIS IS NOT AN IRON ON TRANSFER!  THINK OF IT MORE LIKE AN IRON ON PATCH!<br/><br/>Meaning: What you print out is what you will see EXACTLY on your shirt.  The ink does not transfer to your shirt.  if you're not sure what that means, do you know those little kid toy tattoos that you peel, apply to skin, and then put a wet sponge on the back of the tattoo to get the ink to "transfer" to the skin (and it does it in reverse of what you see).  That is a transfer.  This is more like an iron on patch, but instead of a patch, it is what you print out on the printer sheet.<br/><br/>3) PEEL THE BACKING FIRST!<br/><br/>Because the "iron on patch" will be stuck to the surface it is on.  If you do not peel the backing, then your print will be forever sealed to the backing.  You want it sealed onto the shirt.  Fortunately, the back of the sheet has numerous pieces on it, not just one big piece, so I was able to cut the shape of the heart on my transfer and still was able to peel it quite easily.<br/><br/>4) Use the white sheet included in between the iron and the printable.<br/><br/>I think otherwise you may discolor your shirt with all the heat from the iron<br/><br/>5) 3 minutes, not a lot of pressure, repeatedly going over the entire printable esp the edges<br/><br/>I did not use anything close to a lot of pressure, I think that also may discolor your fabric.  Just fairly light even pressure over the course of 3 minutes, not staying in any one place too long, over and over and over<br/><br/>6) Let the surface cool down a bit after each iron<br/><br/>Mostly because otherwise the next shirt will get hot when you put it down and it's waiting and you don't want to accidentally have your iron on printable get heat sealed any little bit before you apply the iron.  Just to be on the safe side<br/><br/>Great product!!!</span>

<span>This is the 2nd Cannon I bought (for a different location).  I am sick of making Hewlett-Packard rich because of the high cost of ink.  H-P is so intent on wanting you to waste ink by pestering you to print an alignment page every time you change cartridges.</span>

<span>I am so glad I decided on this Canon TR8620a printer, which I bought as a replacement to the HP printer I had at home to use for my remote job.  I have always preferred Canon printers over the HP brand, mainly because of the simplicity of use and freedom to buy ink wherever I want.<br/>Set-up took literally minutes, and it was off and running. The display window actually shows the functions available and interacts with the printer. No need to go online to a program to choose the function you want, like the other brand. The scanner is accurate and quick; the printer is easy to connect to WiFi (or you can connect directly to your computer if preferred or needed) and it prints beautifully. It took just seconds to pair it with my iPhone as well. The copy function does just as one would expect. The only feature I have not tried (and probably won't need) is the fax. But I have no doubt it would work as expected as well. I have not needed to call tech support, but over the years I have called them a couple of times for questions about former Canon printers, and always got the help I needed.<br/>The price was good; delivery was fast; and I am so happy to be using a Canon once again!</span>

<span>I'm not generally happy with Canon printers after my 10 year old printer suddenly showed a code that cannot be fixed.  However, after researching the other brands I came back to Canon.  (Disclosure- I have over 100 videos on Youtube, all shot with Canon cameras)  This printer has all the features as my old one.  The most fearsome is the wifi, so I made sure the printer had a cable port.  I followed the wifi set up<br/> instructions and had no issues whatsoever.  A surprise after reading the reviews.  Printing from the cell phone is really nice. The issue, a small one, is that if the printer is not awake and the door opened it won't print. (duh?)  Color photos, so far, are not as good - sharp - correct color etc , as my old machine - may be corrected, I hope, with settings.  BW no issue.  The printer is fast, prints both sides, and once I figured out the print tray - it no longer shoots the paper to the floor.  It comes with ink.  Some reviews indicate the enclosed ink tanks are not full, but that has not been our experience.  Overall its a good replacement - smaller, lighter, smarter, easy to use. And you can use off brand inks. And you have separate tanks for each color - a big money saver!  No stars for tech support because I didn't need to call them. Only three for sleep mode because its annoying.</span>

<span>During the initial set-up, the printer wouldn't acknowledge the stack of blank paper that was in its "cassette." Kind-of a bummer, but everything else seems to work and there's another paper feeder that I can use to get paper into it. Also, the website that is in the start-up manual wouldn't load, so I had to get the drivers directly from Canon's website.</span>

<span>I spent 3 hours on the phone with Epson customer &amp; tech support. I bought this printer mainly for the auto two-sided printing...I really wanted auto two-sided printing (plus the larger sizes). Monday, I spent 4 hours trying to get it to print on both sides on its own to no avail.<br/><br/>So I called tech support. For an hour the support guy tried to help, and failed. He said it was hardware malfunction. To get a replacement though I would have to let them put a ~$250 hold on my card. I said that was unacceptable [I get that their POV about sending a $400 printer to someone who already has a $400 printer, but I'm not giving you *more* money when what you gave me doesn't work and not everyone has $250 they can just "hold"... thats like a tank of gas for some of y'all right now] So I asked to speak to a manager.<br/><br/>The manager said the printer only auto prints for letter and legal. The website and all advertising online just says auto two-sided printing. The only caveat is anything bigger than 8.5x14 has to go in the back tray and that tray requires manual flipping. I was trying to print 7x10, which fits in the front tray. I explain that the company needs to be clear about what the printer does and doesn't do, that their website is MISLEADING--it's borderline fraud. Dude tells me it's in the manual ('cause I totally had a manual before I bought the printer???) and says I should have known; it's not their fault....<br/><br/>After I went off, he transferred me to customer service so I could make a formal complaint and they admitted the wording should be more clear.  They started a case/process for my complaint.<br/><br/>But I'm an engineer and I was not satisfied with the notion that it didn't work. Mechanically it didn't make sense. So I played around with it some more last night and as long as you choose a preset size that is close to your actual paper size (I chose JIS B5 since its closest to 7x10) the printer *DOES* auto 2-sided print for non-letter sized documents. The techs and managers just don't know how to use the products...which is understandable because it took someone with a PhD in Embedded Systems 2 days to figure it out...</span>

<span>Excuse the long review.  When my old Epson died in the middle of a print job, I was so excited to be able to purchase this model printer.  It was the last one available.  The dealer got it to me quickly; no problems with shipping.  However, the printer itself proved to be a big problem.  According to the reviews, people love or hate this printer.  I myself was totally exasperated before asking for a refund.  Why?  First, the power button is hard to see.  When going through the installation process, my first hiccup was that I  could not see the power button.  I kept hitting the home button instead.  Realizing that the home button did not have the proper icon, I got out a flashlight and hunted around until I found the power button.  {Yes, I wear glasses but they correct to 20/20].  A small irritation, really, and easily corrected once I found the right button. The rest of the loading process went smoothly.  Ink cartridges were easy to install.  Synching with computer was a breeze.  Test pages on plain paper and fine-tuning print nozzles took time but were easy.  The test page on plain paper looked sharp.  However, printing on photo quality paper was a disaster.  First, pages hung up in the printer. I kept getting an error message saying to reload paper when the paper was properly in the tray.  Had to keep opening and closing the tray. Double checked to see that the type of paper was properly entered.  Check.  Paper installed correctly.  Check.  Print quality on computer and printer synced.  Checked.  Right side paper up.  The problem?  When printing on photo paper--high gloss, matt presentation quality, and semi-gloss, I kept getting smeared looks--the results reminded me of watercolors.  Tried printing on top of the line Ilford paper--worse.  After more than four hours of checking, retesting, recleaning, redoing, gave up.  [Incidentally, I have used Epson printers for years.  Never had this sort of problem.]  Finally gave up and called Amazon.<br/><br/>Amazon to the rescue!  They did have to connect me with Epson to see if Epson could help me solve the problem.  That call was a disaster. Summary:  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  You must be loading paper wrong.  No, I have tripled checked....After over an hour of repeating the basic steps over and over,  my hero Amazon person stepped in, ending the call, and allowed me to return the machine.  Repacked and had machine picked up.  Hurrah.<br/><br/>Looking back, since I had problems with the paper not loading as it should, perhaps it is some sort of roller problem.  Don't know.<br/><br/>Several folks have spoken highly of this printer.  I did much research before ordering it and it was generally highly praised.  The test shots on plain paper which I printed as part of the loading process have fine detail and great color gamuts.  I think I just got a lemon.  However, with Amazon, the pain of the lemon is now gone.<br/><br/>So...I have to give this individual printer a one because while it prints great on plain paper, it is useless for printing quality pictures on photo grade paper.  I give tech support [EPSON] a two because the person I spoke of did not seem to know much except how to start the printer going.  I give AMAZON support a 5!!!They were my hero in this situation and did not jack up the price because of scarcity.  I also give the seller a 5 for they got the printer to me quickly in great shape.  I give the printer a one for "touch screen" because it didn't have one.  It had buttons to push instead.  Not a big problem but would take longer to set settings than a touch screen would.<br/><br/>If these printers were widely available, I probably would reorder and try another, but as of 9/1/20, decent printers and photo printers are not available as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.</span>

<span>I had an old Epson 2880 that I have had for years. It was starting to have issues so I bought this printer. I am so glad I did. Great printer. The only negative is that the normal tray that you pull out for the printed copies is automated. I can see in the long run of it being a problem.</span>
