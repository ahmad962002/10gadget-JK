<span>The monitor is big and bright and true to color. As shown in the picture attached, on a pure background -- black, white, or any single color -- the monitor (on the left) looks "uneven". I dimmed the brightness of the pic a bit to exaggerate the effect. It's not that much in real life, but easily noticeable, especially from an angle. Since we don't work on pure backgrounds, the problem is less of a concern.</span>

<span>Added a pivoting stand and positioned vertically to display mostly text. I've not used a monitor in portrait mode before but this worked great with Windows 11 making it super easy to setup.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Great video.  EZ package removal.  EZ set up; aside from the whole no audio thing.<br/><br/>I'm legally blind, so use the monitor in dark mode.  The 4k, and as good a black as I've seen, combine for an image that makes work still possible.  It's awesome, and only two negatives to cite.<br/><br/>The convenience of a single joystick controller is dulled because the interface screen it drives is a little picture in picture down in the corner.  I didn't measure, but maybe 2.5" x 2.5".  Not Samsungs fault I'm legally blind, but I think this would be an annoyance for most.<br/><br/>And the lack of speakers.  Just why?  Again, easy to overcome, but this is for home office use.  I don't need an external speaker cluttering my desk, but I do use monitor speakers for Teams / Video Call interface.  I'll be honest, I didn't check if it had speakers, or even review their quality.  Some things you just expect, so a let down, and the reason it's a 4 star monitor.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Overall this is a good monitor for home use.<br/><br/>There are better ones out there, but the price point makes this one worth considering.  I bought it because I wanted to display text files in larger sizes -- so far, it's doing an excellent job.  Text is crisp, and the larger size allows me to both read more easily and multitask.  Arguably a similar arrangement could be done through two smaller monitors, as is the case in my business office, but I don't like the screen being divided.<br/><br/>My old monitor was 27 inches.  It, too, worked well for many years, but as my eyes have changed, I was feeling more strain to read text.  Because I write and edit a lot, among other things, I often have more than one full-sized page open at a time.  The problem was larger monitors without higher resolution were not necessarily an improvement.  Yes, they enlarged the images, but then the text wasn't as readable.  This higher resolution, 4K monitor bridges that gap.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>1) Crisp images and text -- I can run a 4K movie in a window and still have plenty of real estate for other applications.<br/>2) A decent refresh rate -- videogamers no doubt will have quibbles, but for ordinary business use and all but the most sophisticated graphics, it's fine.<br/>3) No dead pixels or screen bleed -- I've been using the monitor a while now, but, of course, these flaws often don't show up right away.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>1) Color reproduction seems a bit off compared to my old, non-Samsung monitor.  The colors lean toward the blue portion of the spectrum.  I may play around with the settings more to see if I can warm things up.<br/>2) The display stand is not adjustable and does not swivel.  This is a bigger issue than it sounds because it's actually in an computer cabinet with fixed shelving.  Yes, I can raise the office chair, but this is the first monitor I've ever owned that can't simply be raised or lowered at the stand.<br/>3) Physical buttons are awkward.  There's a circular control in the back that's tough to reach (especially since the monitor also does not swivel).  The HDMI and power plugs are on the opposite side . . . which is awkward since the feed for cables in my display cabinet as well as the wall socket are opposite of that.  Because the power cable is short, I actually have to use an extension cord to plug it in.<br/><br/>So, if you can live with these limitations -- some of which are specific to my furniture and den set up -- this is a good value for the price.<br/><br/>Time will tell how long it lasts.  For the past 10 years or so, I've sworn by Samsung televisions, but a more recent one developed significant display problems because of a long, purple "cloud" across the top of the screen.  I'm guessing because the television is so razor thin, the screen buckled from it's own weight, warping that portion.<br/><br/>It's too early to tell if this monitor, which is similar in proportion, will do the same.  In more recent years, Samsung seems to be using cheaper parts and components, so I may need to update this review in a few months.</span>

<span>I've been using an old 16" LG flat panel from 2008 that I bought when Circuit City went out of business, and to be fair, it's been good to me for that entire time.  But I had no idea just how much I was missing.  This monitor is fantastic compared to that!</span>

<span>Really nice monitors, especially for the price. I am now a work from home employee and wanted to have some decent monitors to work with. I purchased two and then mounted them on an elevated stand. I really like them. As with most monitors, I had to turn the backlight down (it's super bright to start), and the little shuttle based menu thing in the back takes a bit of getting used to, but outside of that, they are nice monitors. They mounted to a mounting arm without having to use any spacers, etc...the plate fit right on the back just like a non-curved monitor.<br/><br/>One thing to note - for these monitors, they put the power suppy external to the monitor....the power supply is in the plug, so there is a sizable plug (like an oversized wall wart plug) that is used for each monitor, so take that into account when allocating power outlet space. They can eat up some outlet space on a standard type power strip (unless you get one that flips the plugs 90 degrees). However, it helps with weight and makes the monitors that much lighter because the power conversion equipment is external to the monitor. But, I believe it's proprietary, so if the external power supply goes south, then finding a replacement may be a challenge. Have VGA &amp; HDMI inputs (I am using HDMI).<br/><br/>Haven't used for gaming, but they seem fast scan rate. I cannot seem to get them to go to 75 Hertz (may be due to my Mac). They calibrated without issue with a Spyer.</span>

<span>This monitor is amazing. Prior reviews say that a curved one should be no less than 27inches for gamers may be true but this 24 inch (23.5) is a must have for any personal computing. I bought this to replace my HP 2311X I got in 2011 which was working just fine and I gave to my daughter. One thing I noticed is that it "appears" to be not as wide screen but it is. The curve puts everything in focus so you are not having to look around to see everything. It is very bright and yes it does adjust 2 degrees down and 20 degrees up. I sit about 36 to 43 inches from the screen. For regular computing I have the top of the screen at eye level. For movies and games I set the eye level about 2/3 to 3/4 of the screen. I use the HDMI connection but this also has an RGB interface plug which I am not sure why anyone would use anymore. My video card is an EVGA GTX 650 TI SSC 2GB which required the mini HDMI to HDMI cable. The curve is just right, 1800R for a monitor which means you would have to sit about 70 inches to flatten out your view. Clarity is great and the toggle control is very easy to use. Installation was a snap as it only involve switching power cables and HDMI. I am presently replaying Rise Of The Tomb Raider in a whole new view. Also looking back on what I paid for my HP 2311X, this monitor was the same price as what I paid back in 2011 for the HP. Try it and you will like it.</span>

<span>I've mainly used this as a second monitor and not my primary monitor but whenever its turned on it will make some sort or high pitch squealing sound every once in a while. Its not as noticable when a video or something is playing on the other screen.<br/>Not sure why but it's been like that since I got it and it's past the return window and I threw the box out already so it's to late for me.<br/><br/>For some reason the text is a little hard to read (looks thinner?)

<span>I am using a MacBook Pro 15 inch 2012 (non-retina) with this monitor and it has been great. I've been using my laptop for 8 years and decided that I need more real estate. At first I was planning to get the new MacBook Pro 16 in. 2019 and a USB-C input type of 4k monitor setup but that was about over 3k dollars. I'm not so familiar with computer hardware but wanted more real estate for coding and productivity. After extensive research, I realized that I can connect a mini-DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter to my MBP in the thunderbolt 1 port and a separate HDMI cable to this monitor. Once I have gotten this monitor, I realized that 1080p resolution is more than I need and a very cheap solution. Even if I upgrade my MBP to the 16 in. 2019, I would still continue to use this monitor. The curved screen is a bit of getting used to but I don't mind it at all. If you use spreadsheets heavily then you might consider getting a flat screen instead because the lines won't be as linear as you may like. However, watching movies is great and I'm not a gamer but I'm sure it's great for gaming too. My only regret is that I wish I bought this monitor sooner!!!</span>

<span>I purchase this for my home office and I must say I wish I had done this a long time ago. It allows me to have a split screen along with my laptop so I literally feel like I have three screens. The picture quality is great and for install all you do is plug in HDMI cord to your laptop. Can't comment on use with gaming because I don't game but I'm sure there's other reviews on here that can let you know about the gaming aspect. Overall I trust Samsung products and I'm a long time fan/customer of theirs and they never disappoint.</span>

<span>First off this monitor has stunning detail and clarity in all regards. Text is bright, defined and easy to read. The Video on this monitor looks as good or better than it does on my 42" Samsung LED HD TV. The games I play also look better on this monitor than the other monitors I own (which include these 22 and 23 inch monitors. ViewSonic VA2246M, a HP 2159M and an Acer G236HL.<br/>The refresh rate at 60Hz could be better, and compared to an old school CRT it seems to slow frame rate a little more than I care for, but the frame rate was measured from a basic low end PC, with an Intel 2000 onboard graphics adapter, and can be resolved by a simple graphics card upgrade (with a GeForce 630 the frame rate is very acceptable for my purposes). The addition of an HDMI input is a nice addition and is a useful addition compared to other monitors in this price range. (HDMI/DVI/VGA and audio inputs are easily accessible).<br/><br/>After setting this monitor up, and comparing it to the other monitors I'm using. The color and detail, and contrast is what has really impressed me. At a price near the $160.00 mark, this monitor would seem to priced in the lower echelon of desktop monitors (let alone multimedia units). But it's performance seems to reach well above other monitors in this price range. I did play with the color balance a little and it helped to create a more realistic palate when browsing photo's and video. But right out of the box the colors were brighter, with more detail than on the other monitors I've mentioned above. None of those monitors had the crispness in the whites, the deep blacks, or depth of color this monitor has, and none are even close after making a few minor adjustments in the monitors menu pannel. As with most monitors the panel of adjustments are easy to reach and use, and the Intel display adjustments allow for fast easy onscreen preview when adjusting this monitor (which did not require a great deal of tuning to satisfy my needs.<br/><br/>In addition to the great color, detail and contrast, other options this monitor offers could make it attractive for many buyers.<br/>1. The game mode option adjust contrast, and might or might not be something I use in the future, but it's there and might come in useful.<br/>2. The mounting options give the monitor some flexibility and at this size I could see mounting it on a wall for various uses.<br/>3. Built in 2 watt SRS Audio might be attractive in many environments.<br/>4  The weight, it is very lite for a 24" monitor which makes handling quick and easy.<br/>5. Streaming Video from YouTube - Amazon Prime and Netflix on this monitor is as good as it gets. As I said the monitor looks as good or better than my Samsung HD TV. (unlike the other monitors I own this monitor re-creates a true HD experience.<br/>I'm sure there are other things to consider, and these few might or might not be on everyone's list, but at least a couple were on mine.<br/><br/>Over all Not owning a monitor over $200.00 I cannot really compare this unit to one of the higher rated displays. But rating it at a monitor closer to $150.00 mark than the $200.00 price range I can say my initial reaction is that if your thinking about it's a very good bet.<br/><br/>The assembly should take maybe two minutes if your slow (meaning fast and easy). The resulting construction feels solid and it sits square without wobble on my desk.<br/><br/>I did not try the speakers, since I have a set that I enjoy and at 2 watts the speakers were not a part of my purchasing decision.<br/><br/>I was hoping for at least good color and detail and I believe that this monitor does an excellent job and surpasses my hopes in those regards.<br/><br/>Even attached as a basic workstation monitor, this monitor expands the basic productivity that my other monitors provide in that regard. The actual display at 23.6" is large enough to create a smooth easy transition between multiple tasks... However this monitor goes far beyond a basic workstation unit and does a very good to excellent job in multimedia and gaming situations as well (matched with a PC designed for gaming I think it would be a very good choice as an entry level gaming monitor as well).<br/><br/>Finally I'm Extremely happy with this purchase, and would recommend it as a great choice for an everyday 24" display.</span>

<span>I was disappointed that the monitor did not come with HDMI cables.  When using these monitors with a laptop, most docking stations offer HDMI connection, some offer PC VGA connection, but none offer DVI connection.  I know that DVI and HDMI are essentially the same except DVI does not include sound.  Manufacturer should include HDMI cables for a more universal connection method.<br/>Picture quality is good, but the settings screens are cumbersome to use, and you have to be careful which buttons you push, or the monitor will disconnect from the docking station and have to reconnect itself.</span>

<span> This was worth every penny. I researched so many monitors. I wanted a 27in and a 144ghz. I looked at the PC part brands like MSI and gigabyte who often had dead pixel problems. I looked at ASUS and Acer and cheaper brands like AOC or Viotek. I also did research on LG screens and figured if phone companies and tv companies also use LG screens for their products than an LG monitor has to be a solid choice.<br/><br/>I also needed something with multiple ports as I work from home and game and have to have multiple computers plugged into one monitor. I also REALLY liked the stand that this comes with. The bottom of the feet are grippy so it won’t slide around easily or scratch up your desk. The height adjustment on this thing beats out every other competition. Not only is it so easy to move it up and down it can also be turned vertically! My boyfriend bought the same monitor after me and the weird clip on handle in the back doesn’t fit properly but it’s not even needed to be used. You just very slightly squeeze is and it’ll lower. Otherwise going up you just lift the screen like magic. So easy a baby could do it and it’s also a fun brag factor when your friends come over!<br/><br/>We have a 3070 GPU so we wanted a monitor that would go hand in hand with it. So far it’s been wonderful. You can really change the settings on it just through the monitor but you can even further tweak everything through the NVIDIA g-sync which is FANTASTIC!<br/><br/>!!!!!BE AWARE!!!!! I do however want to !!WARN!! Everyone about one thing: we downloaded the LG driver for the monitor (which basically does the same thing the actual monitor button does but we were curious....) but we turned on HDR through that and it basically crashed our computers. Everytime I opened a game in full screen it would completely freeze my PC and I would have to restart it. I uninstalled the program and it still was crashing. (My bf uninstalled his and it worked fine after) I was freaking out. I went into the monitor button settings and just reset settings to factory and it fixed everything. So I’m not exactly sure what the issue is with that drive but I would NOT download it! I since have turned HDR on again through the monitor button settings and it’s fine so it was something with that driver.<br/><br/>A 1440p and 144ghz monitor looks amazing we had fun watching YouTube videos to see the detail and colors of it. However the Home Screen was so tiny everything from the menu bar to the programs on the desktop were super tiny. Down to the font size on browsers so I adjusted my settings to make everything 110% zoom which makes my monitor look “normal” again. Otherwise those are the only settings I’ve really had to change on this monitor. I know other non ISP monitors you have to change color shading and everything to make it look good which is why I went with an IPS monitor. Also leave it on fast mode dont move it to faster ever unless you like shadowing.<br/><br/>So far I have zero complaints. No dead pixels. Amazing build quality. Monitor feels solid and light. Easy to adjust height and vertical. Base is ingenuity. The size is perfect. It’s not curved. The settings in the monitor buttons are perfect and plenty. G-sync is fantastic. HDR looks amazing freesync works great.<br/><br/>I also want to mention in game mode there’s a reader option which makes working from home even better. Not sure what the effect does specifically but it makes words softer on the eyes if your reading or working from home which I LOVE!<br/><br/>Although the stand it comes with is amazing: what gamer doesn’t get a VIVO mount? This stand slides off really easy in order to mount it I was surprised again LG out did themselves on this monitor! Buy it!</span>

<span>Excellent monitor!  Just upgraded from an LG 1080p 60hz IPS panel to this one and the difference is clear.  Images/text on screen is much sharper and I can tell movement with the mouse cursor on the desktop is much smoother.  I set the display scale to 125%, which now matches with my older 1080p monitor at 100%, otherwise text and desktop apps are just too small for my taste.  You can really get an idea of smoothness during gaming.  I play games where high FPS is preferred.  Currently playing Halo Infinite on older hardware (GTX 1660 ti) but enough that I get about 70-72fps on medium graphics settings.  Even with that, and response time set to 'fast' I can already tell the difference in smoothness of gameplay compared to my old monitor.  And I should mention the obvious jump in visual clarity is instantly noticeable!  Just be sure your graphics card AND CPU can handle 1440p and produce high framerates especially for graphically intensive games. I noticed that in-between games my web browsing has slowed substantially due to CPU bottleneck while using this monitor (again just a limitation caused by older hardware).  The joystick style menu control and layout is simple and easy to operate.  This monitor even comes with an HDMI cable AND a DisplayPort 1.4 cable! Got mine for $280 and at this price point you really can't go wrong with this monitor.</span>

<span>I have been using this product for well over a year so the review is much needed. I can start by saying this monitor is def made for gaming with a vibrant and colorful picture right out of the box. The ghosting on this monitor is very minimal but response time should stay on fast and not the fastest option. 144hz 2k monitor at this price for gaming is truly a steal, enjoy it while you can.</span>

<span>Love this monitor. I recently had to replace it due to a faulty surge protector after my house was hit by lightning. I immediately wanted the same one and after over a year from my first purchase, the quality is the same! Definitely keep it on a quality surge protector as the electronics are obviously very fragile. Gaming is a dream on it, the only thing that pulls me away is my 4k tv. It compares nicely tho</span>

The image is blurred- read the instructions on the link "Adjusting the Screen Resolution “on the CD, and then select the correct resolution, refresh rate and make adjustments based on these instructions. If a VGA extension cable is used, remove the extension cable for the test. Is the image now in focus? If not, optimize the image by working through the instructions in the "Adjusting the refresh rate" section on the link "Adjusting the Screen Resolution". It is normal for blurring to occur due to conduction losses in extension cables. You can minimize these losses by using an extension cable with better conduction quality or with a built-in booster.

<span>*1 Month Update*<br/>So after adjusting settings in windows I have to admit this monitor is absolutely beautiful! The auto dimming is "Dynamic Contrast" and I was able to turn it off in Windows Registry Editor. After that and pairing this with a 2080 TI..... WOW!<br/>The monitor has been great and given me no problems whatsoever. Beautiful picture, IPS and compatible with Nvidia GSync (Even though its not certified) I can report it DOES work and works great. Right now as of June 2020 you wo t find a better monitor than this for the price. I highly recommend this monitor.<br/><br/>I love 4K monitors and that's all I've owned for the past few years. I actually switched from my AW3418DW (Tried 1440P ultrawide for a year) to this for the 4K and "HDR". I was super excited about getting this monitor. I set it up and was immediately super impressed with the picture quality. Set Windows 10 to HDR and set the monitor to HDR and fired up a video. Colors really POP, but I noticed the screen kept getting dimmer and brighter on its own. No settings in windows were on for adaptive lighting. So I went into the monitor settings and when HDR is on none of the settings can be adjusted, no brightness, no contrast or the adaptive lighting. Only sharpness can be adjusted. If HDR is turned off (Whats the point of getting a HDR monitor if its off) the colors are very off and looks horrible with the "Simulated HDR" that comes on. After hours of looking and reading the entire BENQ manual its doing this because of the Ambient Light Sensor built into the bottom of the monitor. There is no way to turn it off when in HDR Mode. This does this when gaming as well. So i fired up a few games (YES This monitor is GSYNC COMPATIBLE) AC Odyssey won't recognize this as a "True HDR* monitor but Forza 4 will. It looks absolutely beautiful when you 1st switch one of the 3 HDR modes on but after a few seconds that Ambient light sensor kicks in and messes with the brightness and makes the picture dark. It goes back and forth and its highly noticeable. I will call BENQ and see if there is a fix but I've spent hours messing with settings to no fix. Overall the picture is amazing, colors are bright, viewing angles are great and the build is superb. The color of the monitor is actually very pleasing too. The speakers actually sound quite nice as well. Overall its very nice, a bit expensive and I wish they made a cheaper version without speakers. I will wait to see what BENQ says but if it continues to get brighter and dimmer when watching YouTube or playing a game I will unfortunately have to return and find myself another 32" 4K IPS display.<br/>-PROS<br/>-Beautiful IPS Display.<br/>-Has FreeSync and works with Nvidia GSync.<br/>-Out of the box the colors are amazing.<br/>-Has built-in speakers that actually sound quite good.<br/>-Has support for 100x100 VESA Mount.<br/>-Framless design and monitor outer color (Reddish Copper) is very appealing.<br/>-Deep Black's<br/>-HDR 400 with 3 HDR Modes.<br/><br/>-CONS<br/>-Only 60hz (Dont bother me) and if your not playing competitive FPS shooters its not noticeable.<br/>-Stand has no adjustments (But I have mine on a monitor arm)<br/>- BENQs HDR modes aren't that great. (Display HDR is the best)<br/>-Not curved<br/><br/>Thats pretty much it. I looked for about a week before deciding on a monitor. Ive had ma y 32" 4K monitors and this one is by gar my favorite. If you are even thinking about this monitor I highly suggest you get it. When i had questions about the dimming, I called BENQ and a live person answered the phone and helped me fix it. When asking about the warranty I was informed I could send it in to BENQ and they would send me a new replacement.</span>

<span>This is a solid performer at a reasonably price.  We use these for CADD design and, for the price, you would be hard pressed to find a better monitor.  Very crisp picture with lots of setting options.  It took a bit of time to get the picture quality to where we needed it for our CADD applications but once we did, the picture was great.</span>

<span>UPDATE October 8, 2021:  Another replacement is on its way.  I updated to four stars based solely on the fantastic BenQ customer service.  One star deducted base on quality control...appears to be a few more lemons out there than normal.  Love the monitor, but hate the hassles and time of exchanging when it goes bad.  This will be my third.  The first one, the speakers developed a crackling noise in the right channel along with distortion.  Second one, the monitor worked great for a few months until I turned it on and all I could get was a blinking power LED.  Will see how the third one works out.<br/><br/>UPDATE September 18, 2021:  The replacement arrived July 9th, but today it failed.  The monitors power LED flashes on and off with no picture, logo, etc.  Am I just having bad luck or what?  Let's see what customer service does this time.  Meanwhile, down to two stars while this is sorted out.<br/><br/>UPDATE June 27,21:  BenQ Customer Service has shipped another replacement after acknowledging the one sent earlier was lost in transit.  Customer Service has been very reasonable in working through this, so I have added another star.  Hopefully, this one will reach me soon!<br/><br/>Update June 20, 2021:  Still waiting on a replacement from BenQ.  It was mailed on May 11 and is stuck someplace in the USPS system.  I can't really blame this one on BenQ, they did their part by shipping a replacement.  I will update again when status changes, but for now keeping it at three stars.<br/><br/>Update May 3, 2021:  Updated from 1 to 3 stars.  Customer Support sent me a return label to return the monitor.  Let's see what they do when they get it back.  Will they repair it?  Will they send a "renewed or refurbished" monitor?  Will they send a new monitor?  Will they instead refund my money?  The ball is back in their court.  Let's see how they play it.<br/><br/>Update April 28, 2021:  Received an email from customer support over a week ago that they were checking with their logistics department but have heard nothing since then.  I just sent them another email requesting status.  Why doesn't Amazon offer a zero star choice?<br/><br/>Update April 16, 2021:  Just knocked another star of my rating after a couple of emails with customer support.  At first, it seemed they were going to issue a pre-paid label to return the monitor.  Today, I received an update advising me they cannot support my US Military APO address for shipping.  Both FEDEX and UPS along with US Postal service all offer shipping options for APO addresses at domestic rates.  It's not that BenQ "cannot" but instead they "choose not" to support the troops with APO addresses.  I might add that Amazon shipped this monitor to me using US mail and it arrived at my APO location in 7 days.  Adding BenQ to the "do not buy" list that refuse to support US APO address.  I gave BenQ the info on how to ship and receive from APO addresses, let's see how they respond.<br/><br/>Video on this monitor is fantastic. Selection on inputs are great.  Power delivery is awesome.  The week link is the audio.  At first the speakers worked fined, then after about 3 months, the right speaker started a crackling noise and distortion.  Today, the volume level in the right speaker has now dropped substantially compared to the left speaker.  Makes me wonder how soon the other electronics will start to fail.  My recommendation is to look elsewhere.  I may update this after I contact customer support, but they don't seem to answer emails.</span>

<span>Rarely was I as conflicted over hardware as I was with the CRG9. Ultimately, I bought it because the current M1 Macs (you might be reading this years in the future, so this may not still apply) can only use one external monitor. For most people that's not an issue, but I use three 4K color-calibrated Dell 27s in my office, so going down to just one was very constraining. There are a handful of 49 inch panels out there, but there are really only three top-of-the-line ones you might want to consider supposing you've got the budget. One is an IPS panel made by LG, also offered by Dell, and then Samsung makes two, the one in this CRG9 and the one in the Odyssey G9. I think some other companies are rebranding the CRG9's panel too.<br/><br/>In retrospect, for the work I do, I should have gone with the Dell/LG IPS panel, but at the time I felt the CRG9 had the best balance of assets between the three, based on rtings.com's analysis, and it was more affordable as well. According to that thorough website, the colors were more accurate, the contrast and brightness were much better, and of course it has a 120Hz, something I don't need but is nice to have.<br/><br/>I'm going to give a quick rundown of the pros and cons with this monitor, talk about who should and shouldn't buy it, and then discuss how to get it to work right (tl;dr, it does work right, and it's not that hard to get it to work) with the M1.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>Size: 49 inches is actually only about 2/3rds the screen size of my previous triple 27 setup (basically two 27s combined), but for multitasking, it's even better than you'd expect. I discovered that, because of the bezels on my triple monitor setup, I ended up giving way more space than necessary to entire programs, because in some cases cutting them in half (two per monitor) wasn't enough. That is to say, space was used inefficiently. using magnets in macOS lets me break things down into thirds very easily on the 49, and a third is about what you need to have three truly full-sized windows side by side, which is about right for me. If the lack of monitor real-estate is your #1 issue with the M1, the CRG9, and any of these 49s, will absolutely solve that problem.<br/>Frequency: 120Hz, surprisingly, makes a difference around the desktop. I was just as surprised as anyone, but I could really tell the difference just moving windows around and things like that. It's hardly a deal breaker to go back to 60Hz, but just for office workers that are wondering, yes, it is appreciable outside of games.<br/>Brightness: The intensity of this monitor was almost off the chart. It was casting my shadow on the wall at night. I work in a very dark office, so this isn't super important to me, but if you do work in a bright office, that'll be an asset.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>Colors never looked quite right on the CRG9. I compared it side by side to my color-calibrated Dell, and the colors almost always looked washed out and bland (and yes, this is with HDR off). It didn’t look terrible, but it was a noticeable decline in color intensity.<br/>The resolution, although 5k laterally, just isn’t enough for a Mac user. We’re so used to 200+ PPI that, without trying to look for it, everything looks rough and unpolished at 109 PPI like in this monitor. My Dell 4Ks (27 inches) look great to me even though they’re not over 200 PPI, so you don’t have to go all the way to an LG 5K or an XDR, but the drop in pixel density was a lot more jarring than I hoped. Keep in mind that if you’re not used to high resolution displays, and if you’re just working on things like spreadsheets, this probably won’t be a big deal to you.<br/>The viewing angles were OK. They’re in the “bad” section because they’re a noticeable step down from an IPS panel, but they’re not horrible or anything. You can see some washing out on the fringes of the onitor.<br/>Curved: For a lot of people, being curved is the ultimate in monitor design, but in graphics, it creates a distortion. All straight lines look curved, and ultimately the people you’re working with, and the final product, will be seeing it flat, so it’s an unnecessary element to compensate for.<br/>Space: The monitor takes up a ton of space, as you’d expect, but really it’s the stand that gets me. It may just be unavoidable for a giant monitor like this, but it absolutely consumer the center of your desk. It got hard to even move the mouse around without hitting a leg. Make sure you’ve got a deep desk or a monitor arm for it.<br/>Connectivity: No one-cable solution here.<br/><br/>The ugly:<br/>The real killer on this for me, in addition to the resolution, is the backlight. The backlight is extraordinarily uneven. I’ve attached photos of mine so you can see what I mean (keep in mind that they look worse on the photo than they do in real life). I had a particularly terrible spot in the bottom right of the panel, which almost looked like a flashlight shining into the display. It even gave the area a slight blue tone. Keep in mind that, for gamers, this is potentially acceptable, and every CRG9 has a really sloppy backlight from what I can tell, although mine, I suspect, was below average. But it isn’t suitable for product design or things like that.<br/><br/>And I think that’s fundamentally the issue here: it’s a gaming panel that I tried to make work for productivity. For some people, it will do that job just fine, but for many it won’t. The resolution is simply not high enough for a monitor of that size to have a precise and sharp image yet, at least not to my eyes. I think for the well-heeled home user that just wants an epic monitor, or for the gamer, these flaws are probably acceptable. For gamers, perhaps this is even desirable.<br/><br/>How to get it to work on an M1 Mac (early 2021 edition). I used this monitor on both my MBP 16 with Radeon graphics and my M1 MBP 13. This all pretty much the same between the two, except that you can get the right resolution at 60Hz (but not 120) on the older Radeon-powered MBP just by holding down the option button when selecting a resolution. With the M1, you need to use Switchresx, separate software that lets you have much finer control of display settings. You’ll need that on non-M1 Macs too if you want 120Hz.<br/><br/>The next tip is to use only Displayport cables, and go directly from USB-C into the monitor. Also, consider turning the monitor’s settings from Displayport 1.4 down to 1.2 in its on-screen controls.<br/><br/>Ultimately, setting it up on my Mac(s) wasn’t really that painful of an experience, contrary to what I often hear about these. I wouldn’t let this particular element scare you off.</span>

<span>Took me a week or so to get used to the ratio (this replaced a 49" Seiki 4k TV that had a more standard aspect ratio). I find for some reason that keyboard placement relative to the middle of the screen has become more important to avoid awkward arm stretching. Having a browser, Slack, mail, notes, and other apps all side-by-side, without overlap (and without the awkward up-and-down visual scanning that the traditional 16:9 ratio required on a 49" screen) is ... life-changing might be too strong a word, but it will definitely change how you work and game.<br/><br/>Regarding games: if you're on a Mac, manage your expectations; gzDoom + Project Brutality runs great, and Borderlands 2 does, but the last Deus Ex vehicle has weird offset problems with button/crosshair offsets that render the game virtually unplayable. Finding games (FPS, anyway) that run well at 32:9 on the native resolution, that *also* run on Apple Silicon, is a bit of a challenge. I haven't tried on Windows yet; if you're connecting to a MacBook Pro, be sure you get a good quality USB-C to DisplayPort cable - the native HDMI port on the Mac won't drive the monitor at full resolution. I'm using this one and it works great: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08B3XNZGS/<br/><br/>One downside is that I get the occasional flicker in the screen after wake from sleep, but it seems to subside after a while. I got the entry-level QLED model, not the 240Hz or the mini LED variants - decided that even the base model was such a huge upgrade that it wasn't worth twice the price to get the mini LED variant. If you're doing game streaming or anything competitive, you may want to spring for the high-end version.</span>

<span>Updated Review - received this item almost 2 months later than promised.<br/>Updated Review - Product DisplayPort failed working and Samsung support is unwilling to resolve the issue as they have the item miscategorized in their system and they told me to contact Amazon for replacement. Amazon refusing to replace.<br/><br/>DESIGN - 3/5<br/><br/>The monitor is super curved and I like that. It's not like those gimmicky "curved" ones where it's not really curved. It's definitely more curved than it looks in the photos. That's part of the reason it looks so thick in the stock photos, however, this monitor is still extremely bulky. The bezel is pretty large, and the stand is large for no reason. I have a heavier TV that has a smaller stand than this - there's absolutely no reason they needed to make the stand take up this much space. It's almost impossible to really put the monitor "back" that much and make sure you have a pretty large desk. Right now I have this on a dining table (pretty large) and it takes up a large portion of it, not just the length but depth. The back of the stand is pretty cool with the lightning, the stand is pretty solid, and the anti-glare works as well as other monitors. But I honestly feel like this should have been able to make this a little less bulky.<br/><br/>PICTURE QUALITY - 3/5<br/><br/>This is where I started getting disappointed. The picture quality doesn't really look like "QLED." I have an LG OLED TV and I've also seen the Samsung QLED TVs on display. It's not really as bright as they say, or at least it doesn't feel like 600 nits. Maybe I misread that figure somewhere - Samsung has finally updated their site to show 350 nits. It's important to note that their QLED TVs have over 1000 nits of brightness so I'm not sure why they're calling this QLED. They're obviously not as good as OLED, but this one is a lot closer to a TN monitor than their "QLED" Televisions. Everything looks washed out. I mean it's not bad when you compare it to other "regular" monitors, but it's pretty bad compared to anything in this price range: OLED, QLED TVs, and OLED TVs. The viewing angle is also pretty bad. If you get too close to the monitor (which you'll have to since the stand is so big) the viewing angle may bother you to a degree, especially with the anti-glare. I had a curved IPS LG monitor before this that I returned because of backlight bleeding. There doesn't seem to be much on this monitor, but the picture quality on the LG, I would say, was better. In addition, you can really notice the lower pixels per inch when you're forced to get closer to this monitor, due to the stand as mentioned previously. There's a wall mount bracket that comes with this so you could give that a try.<br/><br/>PICTURE AFTER TUNING - 4.5/5<br/><br/>Once you can mess with the settings, there's more you can achieve out of this monitor. You can put it on a high brightness mode where it definitely looks like the 350 nits now advertised on their site. However, once you tune it, it's not really a "gaming" monitor anymore. So again, it's nice to use the multiple-mode buttons to switch between them based on what you're viewing. However, it's still misleading when Samsung shows the HDR and high brightness on a game. Realistically you wouldn't lower the settings on a game to get a better picture quality. Still not as good as my OLED TV, but maybe a little bit brighter on average, since OLED TVs automatically lower brightness based on what you're watching.<br/><br/>QUALITY CONTROL - 2/5<br/><br/>Noticed a dead pixel on the screen. Really a shame when what you're really paying for is the panel. There was also a screw missing when this was shipped because of the way they ship this, which I will cover later. There was also scuffing all over the back of the screen because of the way it was shipped. Some back-light bleeding on the corner, not too bad. None of this is acceptable when they're charging $1500 for the panel.<br/><br/>DISPLAY CONFIGURATIONS - 4/5<br/><br/>This monitor does pretty good with 144Hz and the response time seems fine. With a GTX 1080 on this resolution I can get 144fps or higher on CSGO. Other games, not so much. There's different response time modes, and for "fastest" which I assume is 1ms, the brightness goes down, which kind of sucks. There's an "eye saver" mode which is cool to have on displays, as I have on my other newer displays, but this one is extreme. It'll definitely save your eyes but it washes out everything to an extreme degree and the brightness is turned down a lot as well. I definitely cannot use that mode, so I'll have to stick to f.lux to solve the problem. There's also a mode to turn the LED backlight on and off, but it doesn't do anything - it might be important to note this was "off" by default. So for gaming you obviously want the fastest response and best "gaming" settings but when you're not gaming you probably want the higher brightness. The thing I really like about this monitor is that they have 3 dedicated physical buttons to different "modes" so you can switch between different settings quickly. I wish all displays would do this.<br/><br/>FORM FACTOR - 4/5<br/><br/>This is the perfect resolution for multi-tasking. It's easy to arrange everything, and it's in the same line of sight. I've used 4K televisions before (and still do) to have multiple windows open. I would say it's not as nice having windows floating up higher on a 4K resolution, so this is basically 4K cut in half where you need it. You can comfortably fit 3 windows on the screen. Ever had two monitors and you had awkwardly small resolutions for 2 windows on both screens? Well this is the perfect resolution for 3, instead of 4 windows with scrollbars at the bottom. However, since this is a GAMING monitor, it's important to note that a lot of games don't really support this resolution so it's useless. For example, CSGO will just stretch the edges so you don't really get any extra real estate and it just looks bad in the corners when you look at it. Overwatch doesn't support it at all. Then when you game borderless, you can't really use the corners. If you game in windowed mode, since it's 1080 pixels high, but you lose space at the task bar and the top of the window, so you can't really play at 1080p. What would have been really cool is if they made this a little "taller" and bumped up the resolution while maintaining the same pixels per inch. So something like 1200 pixels high and have it be like 50" or so diagonally instead.<br/><br/>SHIPPING, SPECS &amp; PRICING - 1/5<br/><br/>I purchased this immediately after it was released for a pre-order on Amazon. It looks like Amazon sold more than it actually had ordered with Samsung, and Samsung delayed the launch. Then it went from July to August delivery. I should have ordered directly from Samsung.<br/><br/>With that set aside, this is an extremely high pricing got what you're getting. This is basically a 55" curved QLED cut in half. Samsung is definitely price gouging on this one, even though the response time is better than a TV. Now I'm not complaining specifically about the price, but lack of features for the price. Samsung has opted for the cheaper FreeSync over G-Sync and anyone who can afford this probably has an Nvidia GTX 1080 or higher. Otherwise you won't even be able to utilize the 144Hz on most games that come out today. So why go with AMD when their new graphics cards aren't even out? There's also a lack of a lot of specifications on Amazon and Samsung's website. When I received the item, it was single shipped and there were some scuffs already on the back of the monitor. They also leave the screws dangling inside the monitor stand, so I was missing a screw when I received the monitor. Finally, it's extremely hard to get this out of the packaging if you're just one person although it's manageable, but I do like how they organized the box from top to bottom.<br/><br/>DEFECTS - 0/5<br/><br/>This monitor came with a bright dead pixel. Samsung's policy is only to replace these if you contact them within 7 days, but this isn't sufficient time to notice it and it's also not sufficient time to contact their support for RMA since the product isn't even listed properly on their RMA portal since it's a new product. This effectively means they won't be able to assist you. In addition to this problem, DisplayPort stopped working after about a week. So it's not possible to use 144Hz with my monitor anymore.<br/><br/>SUPPORT - 0/5<br/><br/>I have been trying to contact Samsung for weeks. Using the live chat, email, and calling them. Originally this monitor did not even exist on their site. The Consumer support says it's a Business product, which doesn't make sure, but they ensured me any monitor above 34" is business. The Business support says it's a consumer product. If you call them you'll get transferred in an endless loop because Samsung didn't put this in their system properly, and this is months after the product is out. You cannot request a service/RMA because you cannot select the model # that doesn't exist, and the serial number lookup does not work either.<br/><br/>TOTAL - 2/5<br/><br/>Overall this is an okay monitor if you factor in everything, and pretend like you didn't pay $1500 for it. I have a lot of money to blow, desk space, as well as a separate OLED TV to watch movies on and do everything else, so its fine for me and I'll most likely keep it since it's the only monitor right now with this type of ultra wide screen.</span>

<span>I want to start by saying this monitor is amazing, hands down worth the money. It can almost replace your TV!(we will get to why it can not though in the cons section) Just make sure you have the desk space for it as it sits about 45 inches long and a good 9 inches away from the wall.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-Large, Very large, honestly it is game changing, I upgraded from a 35inch ultrawide and didnt think it would be a huge difference... I was wrong, and now I cant go back.<br/>-2 27 inch monitors with out the bar makes it great for multitasking, and better because you can have 3 full size windows screen up since there is no bar.<br/>-5120x1440p is honestly a must at this size, any smaller resolution and it wouldnt look so great.  Another good thing about this resolution is that it looks amazing but its still not as many pixels to push as 4k making gaming on epic at max resolution possible<br/>-120hz You can probably OC it to a little bit more if you drop the color to 8bit or lower, and maybe even to 1080p(probably get 144hz) but honestly 120hz is a sweet spot for most gamers.<br/>-HDR10 yes 1000 nits of HDR beauty, only problem, is there aren't a lot of games that support it and not a lot of shows that do either. Still at the time of this review is the only 49inch with HDR10<br/>-Customize-able menus, you can change colors, black light,refresh rate,etc all at a push of a button.<br/>-Crosshair , yes a crosshair built into the monitor makes it so much easier to aim for games without it, and even helps for games with bad crosshairs.<br/>-Stand allows an above average range of motion(no swivel, but pivet and vertical movement)<br/>-Gsync/Fresync compatible (I tested it, it does work with this monitor)<br/>Picture in picture, allows you to see both HDMI/DVI ports at one time by splitting the screen or putting one in an overlay.<br/>-Qled while not as good as OLED, QLED does improve the blacks, RGB and still gives your a pretty snappy response rate.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-No Speakers (not that it matters too much at this price point, as if you can afford $1000 worth of monitor you can afford some solid speakers/headphones)<br/>-HDR on windows 10 kind of sucks at the moment, leaves a hazy look when you aren't on HDR content. And if you are in a game on fullscreen and try to adjust the volume, windows will tab out the game to show you the volume then tab back in causing you to miss a good 10 seconds.<br/>-If you use to a dual monitor setup for work, and you screen share a lot, this may not be the monitor for you. As there isn't a way to share just one side of the screen, you'll have to share the full screen<br/>-It is really large, had to buy a bigger desk to actually fit it comfortablely.(not really a con but still)<br/>-No movies or tv shows will take up the whole screen due to the aspect ratio of 32:9 Which is why it can't really replace a tv as you'll be watching most content on a 27inch portion of the screen and a few on 21:9. Now on chrome you can install an extension called ultradewide which will stretch out the content on most streaming sites but thats as good as you'll get.<br/>-A lot of games (like overwatch) wont support 32:9 aspect ratio, however most games that support 21:9 do support 32:9 and you'll just have to change Field of View. Rare exception is Overwatch which supports only up to 21:9<br/>-The stand breaks relatively easily, well at least the little connectors at the bottom.. not a big problem but still., as the monitor is pretty heavy. could be due to improper installation.<br/>-The box it comes in is revealing, I would make sure it gets delivered at a time that you're home as you can't hide it, it's too large, makes it an easy target for thieves since they know exactly what's in the box.<br/>-No way(as far as I know) to split the screen and have 2 full screens applications open, now this can be a limitation of windows or software, but I wish there was a way to do that because this monitor is the perfect size for it.<br/><br/>UPDATED REVIEW<br/>It’s been a few months now and the monitor is still holding up pretty well.<br/>Pros<br/>-windows has fixed the hdr issues where if you adjust volume while in full screen it would flash a black screen,<br/>-I believe if you plug in 2 HDMI/DVI into the monitor from the same computer you can treat it as dual screen<br/>Cons<br/>-gets  hot, you’ll notice if if you’re in a small room especially with your computer on.<br/>-This version is not worth it seeming the price is almost the same as the Odyssey but the odyssey specs are better.<br/>-if you a big into movies and  videos this monitor is not for you, honestly I would say go get a 21:9 ultra wide or one of LGs new TVs with 4K 120hz, you can get a 48in for about the same price(it is tower however there are more months available)<br/>- it does support vesa and does include a vesa mounting bracket however there are few vesa mounts that are able to support this behemoth. I’m using one that is underrated for this monitor size so far so good...<br/>- Qled is good when the whole screen is taking up by content, on 32:9 aspect ratio but anything below that will have the black bars on the side(literally all streaming content and quite a few AAA games)  since Qled is still LED it has a back light that noticeable fades away from the center. So you have the big bright grey area when it should be all black. The price of 32:9<br/><br/>Overall still good however save your money for the odyssey/ a gaming tv unless you can find a used one. Samsung doesn’t offer much support or parts replacement for these anymore so good luck if anything ever happens to it or gets lost.</span>

<span>This display holds its own next to my 16" MacBook Pro 2021 with "Liquid Retina" display, which is high praise! Great color, good brightness, good pixel density, and great sharpness make this an awesome match for the MacBook screen.<br/><br/>And, everything connects through a single USB-C cable! I just plug in my MacBook (or XPS 13, depending on what I'm working on) and I get 4k60 graphics, keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals, and power to charge the laptop.<br/><br/>With the quality, features, and price, I'd definitely buy this display again!<br/><br/>(yes, I'll admit the MacBook still has it beat for pixel density, brightness, and contrast, but unlike many other monitors, this Dell still looks solid even in a side-by-side comparison.)</span>

<span>Overall, the monitor meets my expectations. Some items to note though if using on an M1 Mac with Monterey 12.1. For some frustrating reason, Apple has decided to enable VRR for external displays that support the feature by default. This means every time you wake your laptop/monitor from sleep, the monitor will default to VRR 40-60hz which is NOT desirable. Some have reported flickering, I have not experienced this, but regardless, you want full 60hz at all times. There is currently no way to permanently disable this protocol at the time of writing this review. You will have to manually adjust the refresh rate to a flat 60hz every time. There is no way to disable VRR on the monitor directly in the OSD menu. Very frustrating, and am hoping either Dell adds this option or Apple fixes this.<br/><br/>Second, you MUST switch USB-Prioritization to "High Resolution" in order to get full 4K 60hz RGB 30-bit. By default, it's set to "High Data Rate" which caps the output to 4K 60hz ycbcr (24-bit I believe?) which is inferior. Took me a bit to discover this as it's not explicitly stated anywhere. This does cap the monitors USB port to 2.0 speeds I believe, so there is a tradeoff involved.<br/><br/>UPDATE: As of Monterey 12.2, the vrr issue has been resolved and the monitor defaults to 60hz. As a side note, install the app lunar on your Mac to gain access to keyboard controls for brightness and monitor speaker audio - works flawlessly. Very happy with monitor now.</span>

<span>My initial impressions with this monitor are extremely favorable. I needed a second monitor for use with my Mac Studio and overall multimedia setup, which includes a 5.1 AV receiver with multiple HDMI sources including Apple TV, cable TV box, blue ray, etc.<br/><br/>I connect my Mac via USB-C to this monitor’s USB-C connection and connect my 5.1 AV receiver to the monitor’s HDMI 1 port that supports HDCP 2.3 (and earlier) which is needed to support 4K copyrighted content.<br/><br/>This monitor also has an audio output jack that can be used to connect to the AV receiver’s audio input which is needed since computer monitors don’t typically support HDMI ARC. I am thus able to use the HDMI and audio capabilities of this monitor and my 5.1 AV receiver as a small format home theater setup - right on my desk. I’m okay with everything being 60 Hz since that’s all the Mac supports.<br/><br/>When I need 2 screens for computer use, but still want to listen to 5.1 audio, watch TV, stream content, I put the HDMI input from the AV receiver into the Picture in Picture (PIP) window while the rest of the screen is dedicated to USB-C display from my Mac.<br/><br/>I could have also sent the Mac video through the AV receiver via HDMI to the Dell monitor, but I didn’t want to have to turn on the receiver just to use the Dell as a second monitor. My main monitor’s audio is sufficient for office tasks.<br/><br/>I’m very pleased to have found this monitor because it checked all the right boxes for my computing and multimedia setup.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that.
