<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Upon unboxing, I was immediately impressed with the quality of the enclosures - smooth rounded edges, and parts fit well together, no rattling of components. The power cord is noticeably short, and I wish it were about 18 inches longer. The slave to master speaker wire is a small gauge wire and limited in length. For my application (speakers spaced about 6 feet apart), it was long enough, but others might need to find a replacement wire.<br/><br/>I first set them on a table top and connected to my wired sound source for testing. I must say, this initial test was not a pleasant listening experience... boomy bass, indistinct cymbals, and a midrange that was fatiguing to listen too. I would caution others to NOT be too concerned with the sound with speakers in this arrangement (see photo with cat). These speakers are not designed for bookshelf or table placement. You will be SURPRISED how much BETTER they sound when properly mounted from a wall or ceiling using the brackets that came with them! They are not nearly so boomy and the midrange not nearly so fatiguing when mounted.<br/><br/>The volume control knob is inconvenient to access. Personally, I would prefer mounting on the side or front, rather than the rear location behind the removable access cover. It also has a limited amount of adjustment (the arc range of the knob is considerably less than 360 degrees) and is a small knob. There are no tone adjustments. As I already stated, they sound MUCH better when properly mounted, but I am still not quite satisfied with the equalization. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I have ordered a line-level 9-band equalizer so that I can adjust the tone to my liking, but I have not received and installed it yet.<br/><br/>Regarding the power output specification - I can only image that the 400 W RMS rating is the power capability of the speakers themselves. It is not anywhere near the power capability of the built-in amplifier for audio content. I placed an AC wattmeter inline with the power cord for the speakers, then delivered a loud, demanding music (the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck") feed via the wired inputs to the speakers from my cellphone. A better test would be a pink noise generator with a measurable RMS level for the input. If another reviewer has access to such equipment, I would welcome seeing such a review. In my setup, the RMS power consumed by the Pyle PDWR64BTW system was 34 Watts. Recognizing the laws of thermodynamics, the amplifier will naturally dissipate some amount of power as heat, as will the speakers. So the available audio power can only be somewhat less than the 34 watts consumed in my test. I would caution readers that they should not expect anywhere near 400 watts of audio from this system, based on my test results. For my installation inside a porch, these 34 watts are quite sufficient. For an outdoor installation, I might be underwhelmed.<br/><br/>PROS: solid craftsmanship, nice fit and finish, easy to install, nice sound<br/>CONS: limited volume control, no tone control, low power output for the "400 watt" rating</span>

<span>Ordered these July 25th and received on Aug 1st, original delivery date was Aug 12th.<br/><br/>Installation:<br/> I've waited to write a review to have some time for evaluation. Speakers physically are sturdy and were easy to install on my pergola, the brackets are adequate and do the job. The RCA connection on the powered speaker is a bit flimsy when pushing the connector in but works fine and have had no issues. The passive speaker connections are very sturdy and work very well. I did solder an additional piece of wire for the passive speaker since the original one is too short. I had read where some people had issues with the rubber covers not sealing well and even popping off after wires were connected so I took some black duct tape and sealed the edges so they wouldn't come off. I've had several hard downpours and have had no issues with water getting in the speakers. I plan to cover them in the future when I find something that works well for my setup.<br/><br/>Sound and Bluetooth:<br/>Bluetooth connection has worked great and have had no issues with it disconnecting, I have even been able to walk in my house with my phone in my pocket and not lose connection. The only complaint would be the LOUD sound it makes when the Bluetooth connects, although I believe that is because I have the volume on the powered speaker maxed due to the inconvenience of having manually turn it on and increase the volume knob every time I want to connect them. I just plug-in and un-plug and extension cord for that. The sound quality is decent and is worth the price for the speakers. The 600W is plenty of power if you really want to irritate your neighbors and doesn't distort unless you are turning it up all the way. As others have mentioned, the base is lacking but not as bad as some have stated in some of their reviews, in my option. I plan on getting an outdoor subwoofer and splicing it into the speaker wire for the passive speaker to provide deeper base.<br/>My only two real complaints is the way they have done the covers on the rear of the speakers (should have a tight snap-on cover that seals the edges) and the short thin gauge wire for the passive speaker. I will update this if there are any changes to the sound,, operation or weatherproofing with the speakers.</span>

<span>Speaker was much larger than I expected, check the size if you’re sensitive to that. They sound awesome and have deep bass.  The speaker with the AC cord has an amplifier built in. It runs a single speaker wire over to the satellite speaker. Note that the AC cord and the satellite speaker wire was way too short. I had to cut off the satellite speaker wire and splice in a longer wire to get to the other side of the hot tub. Bluetooth is always on, you just reconnect your phone or watch when you come close (nothing to fiddle with). These speakers rock, perfect other than cord lengths.</span>

<span>I wanted speakers in my big garage/workshop to play music on from my phone.  These fit the bill nicely.  As others have mentioned, reinstalling the metal grille once you  install the speaker is a fool's errand.  I tried multiple ways and ended up with two dented speaker grilles.  They don't look terrible, but truly annoying that it was so difficult.<br/>Sound is great.  The are plenty loud enough for me and have enough bass for my taste.  If I crank the phone volume all the way up, it is loud.<br/>Some things that would have made it better for me... Automatically connect when I come in range of the speaker.  As it stands now, I have to manually connect to the speaker every time I go into the garage and want to use it.  Also, potentially add an additional input into the speaker controller, like a 3.5mm jack or something like that.  I'd like to be able to connect my garage TV directly to the speakers as well.  I can do this through a ROKU app, but it relies on wireless signal, and that is not very reliable in my garage.  I've thought of using a bluetooth transmitter from the TV to the speakers, but not sure how I would pair the two (you do this via the phone)?<br/>All in, a very nice speaker with great sound for the price.  You can spend a lot more money on a different solution, but I am very pleased with these and the fit my purpose perfectly.</span>

Initially, my plan was to install a Bluetooth soundbar or sorts in my garage but these just looked  cleaner and subtle. I was quite skeptical on the brand name - I just never really associated Pyle with high quality products. With that said, I figured for the price, I'd roll the dice and give these a shot.<br/><br/>Build quality actually isn't bad on the speakers themselves - the rubber surround is supple and responsive. The plastic housing is sturdy and well made. I did notice that the supplied speaker wire was not the same length - one of them was shorter than the other, way way shorter. Quality control may have missed this? Also the instructions themselves had tons of typos but I got the gist of how to install. Also, I did feel that the power brick/bluetooth receiver was extremely light. Everything that you need is included in the box. I did use a power drill though which got the job done quicker. I also applied silicone to the inner side of the speaker before sliding them in place.<br/><br/>So you're probably wondering how do they sound - well, they sound... GREAT. I initially pulled everything out of the box and set it up on the garage floor just to test it out before cutting holes in the drywall. And they sounded ok - but, there's a HUGE difference in sound quality once you actually put them in place within the drywall. You get some good bass, coupled with decent treble. It's truly a great speaker setup. And having it installed in the garage gave it that surround sound feel.<br/><br/>For the money, this is a heck of a deal. I would definitely look into other products offered from Pyle simply based on this one purchase alone.<br/><br/>Lastly - here is what I don't like about this product. There is no ON/OFF switch. The unit is continuously on unless you physically unplug it from the outlet. Though this is kind of annoying, I plan on purchasing a smart plug that has wifi which will allow me to turn OFF/ON the unit (the outlet is on the ceiling which is why this is kind of an inconvenience for me).<br/><br/>With that being said - give these speakers a try. Not a bad choice.</span>

<span>Easy to install and sound great. Considering I have these mounted out doors, the sound is still loud. The Bluetooth module is always on, but I have it connected to a smart outlet so I can power on/off. No issues with the Bluetooth connection dropping.</span>

<span>This is a great set of speakers that sound good. The one issue is that iPads, iPhone, and Android tablets and phones do not allow zoom because they want it to have a microphone. So we have to use a separate bluetooth receiver for our purposes. Other than that, these install easily and are a fantastic value and price.</span>

<span>I bought these speakers to go in the ceiling on my back porch, I wanted simple Bluetooth speakers that I could control from my phone and didn’t require a receiver and these fit the bill!  The sound quality is not great in comparison to a JBL or Bose speaker but it’s not awful at all however, I expected that for the price and I couldn’t find any “high end” speakers that didn’t require a receiver of some sort.  Let’s get back to the sound quality of these speakers though, it’s pretty decent, there is no cracking or anything like that even when the volume is turned all the way up and they get pretty loud, I can hear them clearly in the back of my property which is about 150 yards from my house.  I’ve had the speakers installed in the ceiling on my back porch since May 2019, we live in central Florida so humidity is a big deal and so far I’ve had no problems with them, they’ve been great, meeting and exceeding my expectations with almost daily use.  As far as installation goes, I’m clueless as my husband installed them, he didn’t complain about them but he’s quite handy so I’m not sure how helpful that is.  Overall, I highly recommend these speakers for the purpose!</span>

<span>I bought these for my backyard pergola to stream music via Bluetooth from my iPhone. I just installed them and tried them out, so I can’t yet attest to their durability, but here are some initial thoughts on functionality...<br/><br/>1. Easy to setup &amp; link speakers. It does have an odd speaker wire connection on the powered speaker, but if you have a straight tip jewelers screwdriver, it’s not hard to wire the two speakers together. The passive speaker has the more traditional style +/- terminals. Once wired together, it’s linked.<br/><br/>2. Easy to install brackets. The brackets are pretty well thought out. “Key slot” cutouts both for horizontal and vertical speaker install allow you to hang these with screws. It IS easier to install brackets removed from speakers, but the knobs to attach speakers to brackets are easy to use.<br/><br/>3. Sound quality is good to very good. Not great, mind you. These are not Bose, but they are not priced like Bose either. For budget friendly outdoor speakers, these sound nice. Not sure why another reviewer said otherwise, unless his speaker wires crossed polarity (instructions warned that doing so would impact sound quality). Just ensure your speaker wire has either the ribbed or line on one wire so you can ensure you have positive to positive and negative to negative.<br/><br/>4. Bluetooth capability really good. I moved around with my phone in hand streaming music, and at 30-35 feet, didn’t lose signal. Also, Bluetooth setup was easy. Once powered on, the Pyle speakers appeared in my Bluetooth connections on my iPhone. Clicked connect and was good to go! There was even an audible chirp over speaker to acknowledge device connection.<br/><br/>5. The negative... not everything you need is provided! As mentioned, the speaker wire connection to the powered speaker has this little (removable) plug that has tiny slot head screws, which require a jewelers screwdriver to open a slot to insert wire, then close slot to clamp wire close. It was odd, and the only reason I see for not having traditional terminal posts like the other speaker is that it does allow you to easily unplug the wires from a speaker mounted to a wall. Also, there is zero speaker wire provided. Not even a short one. Not sure why they couldn’t at least include a short, low budget wire to get you started. I keep a spool on hand being an audio guy, but most probably don’t, so be aware you’ll likely have to make a run to someplace like Walmart for speaker wire (and that jewelers screwdriver, perhaps).<br/><br/>6. Oh, the instructions, while not overly complicated, is a bit misleading. The way the setup is worded, it reads as if the speaker wire is already on one of the speakers. As I mentioned, it’s not even included at all.<br/><br/>7. Material quality. As I mentioned, the speakers, themselves, aren’t Bose equivalent, but for what you pay, pretty good! I didn’t take cover off to inspect materials. Being outdoor, hopefully they’ve chosen a nice moisture resistant cone. I’ll adjust this review if longevity is insufficient. The speaker encasement seems to be a poly/plastic that wouldn’t rust. Seems sturdy enough for what you pay. The knobs to attach speaker to bracket are also plastic, but with a brass insert and metal screw within the plastic knobs. The bracket is a coated metal. Sturdy enough, and as I mentioned, designed to secure speakers in either horizontal or vertical position.<br/><br/>8. One more negative... while the sound can be adjusted in regards to bass, treble, and volume, it is via knobs on the back of the powered speaker. I probably would have rated this 5 stars if there were an app that could make these sound adjustments so you don’t have to awkwardly reach in the small space between the back of the speaker and the wall it’s mounted on to blindly fiddle and adjust (although admittedly, the brackets allow you to tilt/rotate speaker to reveal backside).<br/><br/>That’s pretty much my run down. Hope this review helps. I’ve tried to put specifics on what I see as the positives and negatives of these, but in summary from my initial thoughts, I’m pleased with the purchase.</span>

<span>I'll cut to the chase, the speakers sound descent for what you pay, don't expect to host an outdoor EDM party with them, but at descent volume they are fine for leisurely listening.  Any louder and you'll probably anger your neighbors anyway, and who wants to do that in this crazy world.<br/><br/>Some things you need to know:<br/>- They pair fine Google Home, they should pair fine with Amazon Echo or other smart devices, although I did not try anything but Google Home<br/>- They pair without entering a pin, they paired to my iPhone 7 fine<br/>- Once they pair, they stop advertising themselves, so they can only be paired to a single device, and whoever connects first gets the bluetooth audio<br/>- The bluetooth does not override the other inputs, as per the manual I scanned in since you can't locate on Pyle's site there is no priority on the speakers.  This can be a good thing because it would allow you to hook up a mic to one of the inputs if you needed to announce while music was playing (or maybe Karaoke).  I will admit I didn't try the inputs, I only cared about bluetooth.<br/>- They have two power ones, always on and power save.  In power save the speakers will turn the amp off until sound is detected, and they will wake up.  In power save, the bluetooth stays active, and the speakers will go to sleep with bluetooth still paired, and will wake up when sound starts playing again.  They take about 2-3 seconds to power up, so if you are doing broadcast audio be aware your first couple seconds you will miss while they power up (otherwise use always on).<br/>- They work fine on a switched power circuit.  I have them paired with a Google home mini in my barn on a switched circuit.  So when I leave the barn, I turn off the circuit.  When I enter, I turn on the circuit, the speakers power up, the google mini powers up, and they pair.  Exactly what I wanted in an outdoor speaker.<br/>- They were very easy to mount, with lots of mounting options on the brackets.  They can be mounted horizontal or vertical.  They have notches that keep the speaker in the same place once you tighten the knobs that secure the speakers to the brackets.<br/>- The bluetooth blue light on the back is rather bright.  If light is a concern for you, put a piece of black electrical tape over it.<br/>- I used 18ga wire I sourced locally to go 32' between the speakers.  The tiny connector where the speaker wires go into the active speaker would probably take 16ga wire easily, but anything larger and you will probably need to shave the wire down.  The passive speaker I believe can take a banana plug, but i will take a larger wire easily as the connectors tighten down like most regular speakers do.<br/>- The speakers don't seem waterproof.  I do worry about the knobs over time on the passive speaker getting dust in the controls.  The speakers would have been better if they had a dust covering over the backs, especially on the active speaker, to keep dust and moisture off the controls.  I don't think I would recommend these to be mounted somewhere water could spray on them, like under a deck near the edge.<br/>- The active speaker is the left speaker, and the passive speaker is the right speaker.  Ugh I always wish you could swap this, but when dealing with bluetooth connected devices, you normally cannot.  I would have preferred the active speaker to be where I usually keep my ladder in case I wanted to adjust the sound later.  Oh well.<br/><br/>PS:  I wish all this info would have been on Pyle's site.  Pyle you need to tell your marketing folks to provide more information, I would have bought these two months ago had I known all this.  This was the second set of Pyle speakers I purchased, the first set I had to return because they would not connect to Google Home or Alexa due to requiring a pin when connecting the bluetooth.  The first set of speakers I bought from another store, and had to return them because they would not stay powered on and they would not automatically power on when they were plugged in (i.e. when the circuit was switched on).  All of this should be in the product description.<br/><br/>Overall very happy with the purchase, as long as they last years to come.  These replaced a pair of speakers I had for almost 10+ years that had no bluetooth and a separate amp and were not wall mounted, which was a mess of wires.</span>

<span>So  after the fact an AV guy told me bluetooth receivers can be a little wonky.  I would not put this somewhere were you cannot easily reset the receiver.  I've had to do this 3 times in 4 months.  Luckily its right under a drop ceiling tile where all  I need to do is get a chair to perform the infamous yet effective unplug/plug back in maneuver.  Which works every time.  Otherwise,  I can't complain for the price.  The sound is just fine for an office setting.  They can be installed and will hold up through a drop ceiling tile.

<span>Being able to run speakers like this into a bathroom and a closet without having to run cables to an amp makes this worth the cost.  I installed this on the first floor of a 2 story with no crawl space, but running the speaker cables to each speaker after the holes where cut was a breeze.  Trickiest part was getting power to them, I had to fish the speaker cable through a jbox to make sure the Bluetooth adapter was still accessible and had them coming out of the new outlet I installed to have the power and box be as hidden as possible.  Being small and not having a dedicated amp these things sound great, it shakes the floor in the second story.<br/>  Bluetooth is the real winner here, just sync to the Pyle adapter and your cruising.  I did have to buy 2 since the first one I received the adapter didn't work.</span>

<span>I've read the reviews before buying this setup. No on off switch, no volume control, not much base, all that. Well I decided on these for several reasons. Most of all better than what I had already. My phone is my stereo, and video player and can control the volume with that, the amplifier is plugged into a power strip and have an on off switch on it, I'm 61 and don't need massive bass and volume, yet the system is adequate for the volume I'm getting. Anybody with knowing how to read can install these. I'm pleased with my purchase, and have only one very minor complaint. The screwdriver that came with it to put the speaker wire in the amplifier is about as useless as can be. Not really worth mentioning at all since I'm a cabinetmaker and have a vast amount of tools.
