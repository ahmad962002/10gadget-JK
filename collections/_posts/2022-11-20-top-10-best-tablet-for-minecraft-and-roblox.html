<span>I had been looking for an inexpensive Android-based tablet for a while now, mainly to use specific Android-only apps for external devices. Mind you, I have already tried a few cheap Android tablets already, some from no-name brands and some from well-known brands... all of which I immediately returned after such a horrible experience. Basically anything available under $100 is such a compromise - these tablets are usually made from all plastic, with a super slow chip, a mediocre touch screen, economy-build quality, and a slow and unresponsive operating system. In other words, the literal definition of CHEAP.<br/><br/>However, the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is none of those; for a little over $100 you get a much better experience overall! The build quality is nice, the aluminum body doesn't look or feel tacky, the touch screen is pretty responsive, and you get a smooth Android experience. Even if this is Samsung's lowest-priced tablet, it is a capable performer and a pretty good value. While it doesn't have 4k HDR and isn't powerful enough to play many AAA games, that isn't what I bought it for and that isn't what it was meant to do. I needed a simple, capable Android tablet and I found what I was looking for here; This is the difference between being "cheap" and being "low-cost"!<br/><br/>When there are deals (which is often) you can pick up the Tab A7 Lite for about $100-110. I can confidently say that the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is the best bang-for-the-buck low-cost (not "cheap") Android tablet available!</span>

<span>First thing first...spent many hours trouble-shooting the initial wifi connect setup...it wouldn't accept my wifi's password (as printed on the wifi's case)...My other Apple devise's ios' aren't up to Apple's standard to do an auto-setup of my new Gen-9 iPad...so only a manual setup was in order. After Googling, Youtube vids and pnone calls to techies...I was still unable to connect. Then l searched my macbook for the wifi password and found it in my laptop's "Keychain", listed as "Airport Network Password"...completely different password from the one printed on the wifi's case....8 hours had passed to solve the setup problem...Persistance paid off....</span>

<span>Decided to buy this when the last Prime day deals was going on last month. I don’t regret it at all. I had a fire tablet before but I just couldn’t get used to it for some reason. I guess since I’ve always had Apple products, I’m more used to using them. Screen is great touchscreen. Even with the protector on it. Feels like it’s not even on there. Not much else to say about this. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to buy a tablet</span>

<span>I just received it yesterday, and since I am an android person,  I took it to my Geek Squad to  show<br/> me how to use it, and he had no problem whatsoever.  I was told it was just like my Apple iphone, (my<br/>only Apple device, which I must have for my Apple watch)  and so far it seems to be so. I brought it home and connected to my wifi with no problem whatsoever.  I have received my emails, seen my wonderful photos from my iphone etc.  Everything on my iphone was immediately copied to my new tablet almost miraculously.  The box it came in was pristine, and beautiful.  So far I have no complaints, and have not had it long enough to know about the battery life.  I think it is beautiful and am looking forward to watching Netflix on it etc.  As I was told, it is just like a BIG IPHONE, except that I did not get cellular service.  I will update if I have any problems.</span>

<span>I do not mean "Wild" kindly, but I'll get to that shortly. Sorry for the long read, but I have a lot of thoughts about this particular product to inform you, the end-user of your purchasing decision before you commit a purchase, and as a responsible citizen of the Internet, I've heavily tested the tablet hands-on to see what I can make it do, how I can make it work and where Amazon's hires could improve the overall experience for a multi-adult household.<br/><br/>The tablet itself is functional. What else is there to say about it? Inside a home or building, so long the sun isn't shining directly on it the display is bright, with a clear, crisp display and along with a decent battery much bigger than your current handheld mobile device, you also get anywhere between a mediocre and acceptable tablet use experience, depending on how much money you hand to Amazon. I painfully regret not going with the Fire HD 10, but I am a bit of a cheapskate and after having seen what comes with the Fire HD Kids' Pro 8 through an encounter with a daughter of my mother's friend, I figured the Fire HD 8 Plus would be the same exact experience — and I can happily say, it is.<br/><br/>The inclusion of a three-pole phone socket for headphones and TF / micro SD slot for extra storage practically makes it the ideal tablet computer… until you try to use it as a multi-user tablet computer. But we'll get to those gripes later. First impressions of the hardware makes it seem like the absolute perfect device for personal and work use, domestic and abroad. A simple tablet with great features. Except for a GSM / SIM slot but if you already have a mobile handheld, the Fire can use wireless tethering whenever the tablet needs access to the Internet where WiFi isn't available, and it can do calls via WiFi so that's something if your friends aren't using any of the supported social network platforms available through Amazon's app market.<br/><br/>Fire OS on the other hand, that's uhm — fun. Yes, fun. If you receive nothing else from this, should you be the sole adult of the tablet, then you have nothing to worry about. Everything just works — for you. For anyone else? Yeah, nah. Show mode is honestly a great inclusion, as well Alexa Hands-Free — it's like if you have a general-purpose tablet, Amazon Show desktop unit and phone (which can only do calls via WiFi) for what was at the time of Prime Day anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars depending on device capabilities. What a bargain!<br/><br/>…For the primary user. Second adult? Nah, can't do Show Mode, Alexa Hands-Free or WiFi calling. But children can do calls with approved contacts and permission from their parents! That hardly makes any sense — if you're not a child you don't get to make calls beyond the primary profile? Why? Speaking of kids, if you think that kids' launcher or adult settings will let you move off all of the kids' apps to an SD card, ha ha nope. So your child will very likely make using the tablet almost impossible after they stuff the internal storage with nothing but pointless games.<br/><br/>For a couple, it makes even less sense to buy this for the intent of using voice recognition features. Sure, auto guy and shop girl can keep their profiles separate, but only one of them get the privilege of using all of the tablet's features. A second adult profile is like a grown-up kid, and feels almost demeaning, which likely means whoever wears the pants between two people will be the one with the primary account which does everything. And what if they want to share applications? There's no easy way to do this beyond reinstalling them on the other profile. I've looked, and there seems to be no way of easily sharing apps between adult profiles which especially makes installation of such things as Google Play a major drag without third-party guidance and tools.<br/><br/>It's an Amazon device, so of course it will advertise Amazon everything — even Washington Post. If you don't use that service, too bad can't disable. If you don't care about Amazon's other services, too bad shove it in a folder on the Fire Launcher. Without tinkering beyond what Amazon allows you to do, it kind of makes using the tablet a terrible experience being inundated with all of these Amazon-owned things at once, and for some people the constant upselling is enough to warrant a return.<br/><br/>If you can get over all of that — and again, if you are the sole adult of the tablet, none of the above save for the upsells are really an issue — then you have yourself a capable and handy little Android-based tablet which will do almost everything you want. A solid product with a mediocre and terribly flawed OS, but one if you've committed your entire life to Amazon may be welcome. As I exhibit no such brand loyalty I'm exceedingly annoyed, but all of the thorns and papercuts are nothing a little bit of tinkering cannot cleave and become rid of.<br/><br/>EDIT 07/06/21.1: Minor correction, seems like while four-pole may fit, I can't use external mic with the tablet or Fire OS doesn't disclose how to do this.<br/>EDIT 07/06/21.2: Grammar and error corrections</span>

<span>I've only had this one for a week or so, I can't comment on battery life, it's been fine for me but I haven't really run it down yet. I really like that it does wireless charging without the proprietary dock.  This one replaced one of the ones that did that, and it limited you to either always taking it out of the case (to use one with a screen cover), or never covering the screen.  I have a magnetic screen on the new one and it charges with the screen covered on my phone charger.  Have had several versions, including the HDX which had better screen resolution, but I honestly can't see much difference with a screen this small.  It was easy to get set up and on line.  If you have a trade in and do it when there's a deal going, it's worth it to upgrade.</span>

<span>Good: Inexpensive, high battery life, adequate performance, USB-C charging<br/><br/>Bad:  Hard to hold, thick and heavy for screen size, unacceptable button placement, wireless charging turns device into echo show with ads - a feature I would pay to remove!<br/><br/>I have owned three Fire HD 8 tablets and each generation has gotten more annoying to use because of compromises in the design intended to make them less expensive to produce.  I am extremely happy that Amazon has decided to market this upgraded version with 3 GB of RAM because that is now the minimum needed to run Android or Fire OS smoothly. The 1.5 that came with my second Fire HD8 never worked - it just isn't enough anymore, whereas the 2 GB that came with my first HD8  waa plenty for that era.  I think Amazon was foolish to make that change on the base HD8 because of the added frustration to the end user, but at least there is a choice to upgrade to this "plus" version with its frustration-free 3GB setup.  Is the experience as smooth or responsive as even the least expensive iPad?  Certainly not.  But those start at $400 and this was closer to $120.  What I really want is a $185 option that combines this specification or better with the physical design and form factor of earlier Fire HD8 generations, because when it comes to physical design this generation of Fire tablets is extremely annoying!  I am sure the changes are all designed to minimize cost but please find a better to do that than to put the power and volume buttons so close together with such a similar size and feel.  It is far too easy to press the power button to begin with because it protrudes to far from the case and doesn't have a very strong spring, but when you put it right next to an identical feeling volume button that is just unacceptable!  There is good reason why almost every phone and tablet in the world has these buttons in different locations ( often opposite sides or ends of the phone.)<br/><br/>I happen to believe that it probably would work to have both buttons on the same end as the charger and headphone jack but not if you put them this close together, and give them exactly the same tactile feel and the same overly light spring rate. Please at least recess the power button, use a different surface texture and a stiffer spring. Or better yet move it to the opposite corner where the headphone Jack is now.<br/><br/>And for users with the current, unfortunate design you could eliminate the worst effects with a software update. Just modify the software to require a longer press of the power key before it shuts down the display.  If a one-second press were required then it would eliminate 90% of the instances when I have accidentally shut down the screen trying n to change the volume.  With no security options other than a pass code, tis means I almost every time I try to adjust the volume while listening to a podcast or watching a video I have that experience interupted and I end up having to enter my pass code and physically restart what I was listening to just because I tried to adjust the volume.  This design choice just doesn't work.  Fix it, Amazon!<br/><br/>Another cost saving design choice is that Amazon has allowed the HD8 tablets to get thicker each generation, which I agree is probably reasonable.  But between the thicker body and the much smaller bezel compared to previous generations, I am finding this version much more difficult to hold.  I actually think the sensitivity of the screen might also be a factor because if I put fingers on the front edge if the glass at all this registers as a touch. So to prevent that my fingers must stay on the plastic, and there just isn't enough plastic on the front bit the tablet to get a good grip.  That gives the impression of the tablet being heavier and more awkward than it probably is.  And again this could be an issue that might be addressed with software if the screen sensitivity could be decreased a bit to reject unintended "touches" at the edges ( in this case beyond the edges). of the screen.<br/><br/>My final gripe is going to be about the behavior of the device when put on a wireless charger.  Oddly, when I want to use a wireless charger my intention is to actually charge the device.  It is not to turn my tablet, for which I paid extra to have ads removed from the lock screen into an always on Echo Show with advertising!<br/><br/>I'm sure there are some people who might actually use an Echo Show and for them this must feel like an amazing value.  Like getting a second device for free.  But I just want it gone.  I would never willingly use, much less purchase, an Echo Show, particularly one with a working camera, because I can't accept the privacy and security risk. And I certainly don't want another device showering.me with advertising.<br/><br/>That said, I don't object at all into Amazon including the Echo Show functionality with the tablet, or even having it run by default when you connect it to a wireless charger, but there needs to be clear documentation about how to control this feature and how to turn it off both permanently and temporarily.  Without that I am actually losing two features I specifically paid for on this tablet, wireless charging and freedom from advertising.  Please do a much better job explaining this feature and how to control it as you update the device software</span>

<span>I am a fan of Amazon's tablet offerings and have been for years. I do also have iPads, which I use for music related apps. but for everyday uses the Fire HD tablets are a very smart option.<br/>What I like:<br/>1. Price - you get a lot of computer for relatively little money<br/>2. Screen &amp; Speakers - Amazon has improved the resolution and brightness of their tablet screens over the last few years that rival Apple, Samsung, etc. Movie audio is crisp and loud enough, even streaming music isn't bad on the built-in stereo speakers<br/>3. Battery - on the 8" and 10" Fire HD tablets you will get impressive battery life, especially if you take the effort to power off if you won't be using it for a few days. The 7" tablet does not have quite the same battery life however, from my experience<br/>4. Everyday uses - Amazon's browser, email, office, games, entertainment, audio books, music, etc integrated apps are well thought out and work intuitively and efficiently on these tablets.<br/>5. Entertainment and shopping - if you're a Prime member the Fire HD tablet is really a no-brainer, especially if you watch Prime or other prescription streaming video or do any amount of shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods<br/>6. Alexa and Smart devices - the Fire HD tablets easily work together with your home Smart devices, such as Ring doorbells and security detectors and are quite versatile too. You can sync them with your Echo devices, TVs, security video cameras, etc. You can even use them to communicate with other Fire tablets in your home - almost like a video intercom system<br/>7. Updates - Amazon is always improving the functionality of their devices so new features often appear with OS updates. Basically you're getting more than you paid for over time.<br/><br/>What I don't like so much:<br/>1. Fire OS - Amazon has done a great job with their operating system but still has some work to do as far as multi-tasking, efficiency and compatibility with certain file protocols. Also the internal filing system and access to the SD card for storage is a little clunky. Transferring files from one device to another can be confusing<br/>2. Camera integration - the Fire HD tablets have decent cameras (well, the front one is decent) but they don't seem to play that well with the included photo app - and the filing system apart from Amazon Cloud is again, somewhat non-intuitive. This is something that obviously can be remedied with software updates, hopefully soon.<br/>3. 3rd party applications - Amazon is pretty strict about which apps can be used with the Fire OS (you cannot download from GooglePlay) so there are likely a few apps you like that will be unavailable - unless you hack the tablet to run as a straight-up Android device, which defeats the purpose of having an Amazon device in the first place. So..<br/><br/>That pretty much covers it from my perspective. The Fire HD 8" &amp; 10" are a real bargain in the Android-ish tablet market, IMHO. I really love mine and use them daily and believe you will love yours too!</span>

I hesitated on buying it because of all the reviews I was reading, but honestly it is a great product.<br/>If I had one bad  thing to say about it, would be that once we leave the house it doesn't let my son see any videos.

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>When you buy this, just know that you won’t have a lot of internal storage to work with. I bought an sd card to handle my storage effectively. When you get close to having the internal storage met, expect performance issues. The computer will work slower and just seem to struggle with keeping up.<br/><br/>This is NOT a gaming laptop. Please consider buying a different laptop if you wanted to game. It really doesn’t have the frame rate to handle games that are large. I used this laptop to play Roblox with students of mine and 9/10 this laptop could not keep up.<br/><br/>As for a work laptop it’s lightweight and easy to use. I use this laptop for zoom meetings(with an external camera, not the internal one), homework, writing and casual browsing. It does this job well. I generally won’t watch anything on it because the audio quality isn’t great, but if I had to use this laptop I would play the audio with headphones or a speaker.<br/><br/>Overall for school, work, or causal browsing Id definitely recommend this laptop.<br/><br/>PS this is not a backlit keyboard.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>My daughter’s old tablet stopped working so I was forced to get her a new one and I’m really happy I chose this one.  She’s dropped it plenty of times and the screen is still in tact almost a year later.  The built in kick stand helps for when she’s just watching videos and playing with actual toys at the same time.  My favorite part is the battery.  Her last battery took something like 19 hours tk charge fully but this one charges swiftly just like a cell phone.  I bought it on sale but I’d have spent the regular price</span>

<span>I had bought this for my 11 yr old god daughter and she LOVES learning on it and watching videos. The color is excellent on it and the touch screen is spot on. I started out with the 7" when she was 4 yrs old then the 8" when she turned 8 yrs. But then the screen cracked when she dropped it from her tree house accidentally ( one month after it ran out of warranty). She always took good care of her tablets. So for her 11 Birthday I got her the 10". She has autism and I would recommend anyone with children that has a learning disability to get one. The learning technic on there apps helped her read, write, focus and explore. I am VERY Thankful I got these these. Totally Worth the Investment for your Child and their Education. And easy on your wallet.</span>

<span>TL;DR --- The tablets are good. Amazon's interface for setup and for parental controls has not improved since our last experience. I'm a week in to having these in my home and SO irked that the experience hasn't gotten better in the 4 years since our last Kids+ tablet purchase.<br/><br/>This is our second experience purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids+ Tablets. We had a previous generation for ~4 years and they were fine for our kiddos at the time. As the kids are now 5 and 7 years old (and the other tablets were sllllowwwwwww), it was time to upgrade! They did some chores to 'earn' them. It was all very cute. I compared and strongly considered going with iPads for ease of use, but the cost savings with Amazon Fire Tablets was substantia due to the trade-in value of the old tablets, the promo they were running for trade-in's and some Amazon credit we had saved up.<br/><br/>The screens are a far improvement. The larger size is wonderful, and the kids are enjoying their cool new cases which they got to pick out AND have the stand/handle feature. (My oldest went with the black case and immediately decorated it to make it her own with her sticker collection. Our youngest went with the doodle case and its cute.)<br/><br/>I like that you can choose the 'younger' Kids+ interface OR the 'older' Kids+ interface.  (That is not mentioned in features on the shopping site here. But, I found it buried in the parental controls as an option yesterday and I'm so glad! My 5 year old is already benefitting from that, as she has not yet started reading, so it's easier for her.)<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The screens are good. They actually charge and hold a longer charge than the previous ones. Cool cases. Fun games. In the end, my kids don't care what I do with setup, as long as they get to play a few games they like and get their screentime. They do not know the difference between this and any other brand of tablet. Because, they are 5 and 7. And while they literally have opinions about everything. They do not understand that Amazon is a commercially driven giant who just wants their parents money and mine our family's data as best they can. (I get that I still bought the darn tablets. Life is about balance.)<br/><br/>ISSUES WITH AMAZON'S SETUP AND PARENT CONTROLS/DASHBOARD:<br/>- Ok... the booklet that comes in the box is a useless waste of glossy paper. It basically says 'hello. turn on tablet. follow setup instructions on screen.' SAVE THE PAPER, AMAZON. It's 2022. At least make it more recyclable so I don't feel bad immediately throwing it in the trash. It makes the 'Climate Pledge Friendly' icon look even more like pedantic greenwashing. Your consumers are smart, Amazon. Get it together.<br/>- Setup instructions are SO basic once you open it up on screen.<br/>- There is seemingly a 'parental controls' option you can access from the Amazon Fire Tablet that is NOT the same as the Parent Dashboard for Kids+. This is confusing and frustrating. My husband and I are both very 'with it' Millenial types who understand technology. And we were both just getting mad at these cheap tablets. We were very close to sending them back and biting the bullet on the price tag of two iPads... just for our own mental health.<br/>- Parental controls are most easily accessed online from a computer. I couldn't access all the options from the tablet or even my phone.<br/>- Once you get into the parental controls, there were no explanations of what the info really means. And there were lots of options buried that were just frustrating to find. The 'call' feature all of a sudden DISAPPEARED from my 5 year old's tablet. I searched in all the places, tried 'sharing' the Alexa app from the parent profile to the kid+ profile... nada. I had to get onto Amazon chat to manage getting that found and even that person didn't quite know where to find it at first. They sent me 4 different things to try and I was thissssss close to doing a factory reset mere days after getting the tablet. I found the unchecked box eventually, but good grief. (This is merely ONE of MANY examples of my annoyances with this system interface.)<br/>- Speaking of the "CALL" feature... some notes: the video/call quality is roughly ~80% there. It'll do. But, the call features are NOT available if my kids are playing certain games. So, I cannot drop in, announce, or call them from another room to blissfully say, 'hey sweetie... 5 more minutes until dinner.' It constantly tells me they are unavailable. And then when they call anyone else, it drops calls pretty easily. Real life with these tablets is apparently not like the commercials. (Our family has really amazing fiber internet, so it is absolutely the tablet's fault here.)<br/>- I had --- of course! --- checked out the FAQ/Help sections on the website first. None of them were helpful. All were basic, generic, etc.<br/><br/>Here's what I think Amazon should do:<br/>- Add some printing to the box insert that says 'hello. turn on tablet. follow setup instructions on screen.' and cut the useless waste of glossy paper.<br/>- Significantly improve the usability of the setup screen and instructions! Parents are busy and do not inherently speak your in-house 'Amazon' language; some of which has changed since the last time we had to truly setup one of these things. Create a setup that literally walks parents through a 'yes/no' of features that they want to set up for their child right then and there with the option to find it EASILY later. Again... It's 2022! Use pictures. Give me info on what you're even talking about; maybe even some 'best practices' of what you intended it to be used like, what other parents might use it like, etc.  Just ask me one screen at a time what I want my kids screen-time to be like, if I want them to be able to Call people and who, then tell me HOW to setup that call system (not everyone has or wants an Alexa device in their home - so you have to actually tell us how to set it up if someone doesn't have a device)... like, just do the whole 'explain it to me like I'm five' but respect me like I'm paying for your CEO's space bill thing. Ok? Thanks.<br/>- Work on that "call" app in the Kids+ side of things. It's a really cool option for us to give our kids, but it is lacking in interface design and ease. (Why can't I update the robot icon to a picture of the person they are trying to call? Wouldn't that be gosh darn cute and easier for a kid who wants to call that person I've approved for them?!) And it should have the capacity to override - at least as a banner notification - when my kids are in whatever app they're in. Like any other 'phone' call type of thing would be.<br/><br/>I'm a busy parent and just want this thing to work long enough so that my kids can stare at it, maybe learn some things, let them call my sister while she's attempting to work from home, and then get dinner started without them asking me for snacks every few minutes. The hardware is there. The software is not.<br/><br/>Vent over. I hope this helps at least one person make the best decision for their family. And I hope Amazon hears my pleas before I have to buy another tablet for the kiddos.<br/><br/>Be well, all.</span>

<span>Okay, let me start by saying that I am currently on my second fire tablet.  The first was a gift from my last job and was an Amazon Fire 7 2017 edition.  It was, as one would expect from a cheap tablet, very slow and low quality.  However, it was still a great tablet for the price.  I believe that they were running somewhere around $50-$75 at the time I received it and regardless of the quality, it worked far better than any smartphone I had seen around the same price.  I was able to expand memory and I used it for personal and professional services for almost 4 years.  So it definitely served its purpose.  Last year my wife was tired of me always complaining about how slow it had gotten and how limited it was on being able to keep up with newer apps.  So she bought me an Amazon Fire HD 8 2021 for Christmas in the hopes that it would fix the issues I was having with my 2017 model.  That brings me to the real point of this review.  Having used this tablet for almost a year now I can say again that this is an excellent tablet for the price.  I only have a few complaints that I was hoping Amazon had fixed since the 2017 model.<br/><br/>1) The screen is just not bright enough.  It's fine when you are inside in a low light area but when you walk outside, especially on a sunny day, you can't see anything on the screen.  That's with the brightness level at max and adaptive brightness turned off. (Wanted to clarify for those of you who might think I don't know what I'm doing)<br/>2) The screen lags when switching between apps and when loading apps.  This was a major problem with the 2017 Fire 7 but I had hoped that, with all of Amazon's internal hardware and software upgrades that it would be faster but it's about the same still.  It's just definitely not made for multi-tasking or gaming really.  You can multi-task but it's difficult due to the lag.  However, it's a great option for those of you who just want to binge watch your favorite movies and shows on streaming apps and/or use it for ebooks, music, or shopping.<br/>3)  The battery life is about the same as my 2017 which was also very disappointing.  On a full charge I can usually get about 4-5 hours of solid use before it's almost dead (that was brand new), about 8-10 hours of intermittent use, and if left on but inactive (on standby) you can get up to 3 days on a full charge before it dies.  However I will also say that those numbers have not decreased much, if any, over the past 8 months of use.  So at least the battery life seems to be fairly consistent.<br/>4) While the tablet is very "user friendly", it's not very good for those of you who like to poke around the more technical side of things.  You basically have to download a bunch of secondary apps to read or change deeper settings than what you see on the basic menu.<br/><br/>*IMPORTANT NOTICE*<br/>You should never change or alter the programming of any device.  Doing this can damage your device, void manufacturer warranties, and may even be illegal in some cases.  So make sure you know what the manufacturer as well as your local and federal law allows before you do anything that can alter or potentially harm your device.  All repairs, alterations, and any other changes should always be handled by the manufacturer or other industry professionals who are trained to work on your specific device.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, remember that this is a cheap tablet so don't expect your Fire to keep up with the latest iPad because it can't.  That being said, it really is a good tablet overall.<br/> Especially when you consider that the closest thing to it from another company would cost you at least twice as much.  So for the very last time I'll say, it's an excellent tablet for the price!  Thank you</span>

<span>This is actually the second Fire HD 8 I have purchased from Amazon. The first one that I bought a few years ago was for me. It was an 8th generation. This most recent one was a gift for my girlfriend and she has the 10th generation 2020 release. My experience with the original one has been positive. I don't use it as much as I used to but when I do, it still performs well. Battery life is still very good even after 3 years. I was able to add Google Play to it which really made a huge difference in the functionality of it for me. My girlfriend seems to like her brand new Fire HD. Haven't heard any complaints from her yet and she uses it very frequently. Amazon makes a great tablet at a very reasonable price. When it's time to upgrade, I will almost certainly buy another Fire HD.</span>

<span>I was looking for a wall-mounted pad to centralize and control my Alexa-based smart home.  For the price, you can't beat it, but it's a hack (at best) with mixed results. The HD8 is a perfect size for this kind of application.<br/><br/>There are several aftermarket wall mounts, I'm very happy with the one I got, but I did need to saw it to get access to the volume controls. You will need to access them frequently so look for a mount with exposed volume buttons. My mount has wired USB power but there are several options from POE to mains on most available 3rd party mounts.<br/><br/>Smart Home Dashboard:<br/><br/>The "show mode" has a dedicated button on the lower task bar which is handy, but it only surfaces ~50% of your smart devices and lacks support for groups, routines and other functionality.  You'll still need to launch the native Alexa App to have the needed functionality.  The native Alexa App is UGLY on this device as compared to the stock android version.  It can only show in white (light theme), and it's missing a GUI — it looks like a 1990's HTML web page that doesn't have CSS support.<br/><br/>The main challenges I'll share are two-fold; making the user experience streamlined, and integrating with media playback.<br/><br/>User Experience<br/><br/>Shovelware!  The price is low because this is jam-pact with marketing shovelware, everything is crammed with upsells, recommendations, and tons of clutter.  Getting the GUI to be simple and intuitive requires a lot of setup config to systematically remove all the clutter, but it is possible with dedication.  The stock desktop backgrounds are all bright and busy, I had to link to my Amazon photos and upload a solid grey image to replace the crazy graphics because there are no solid color stock backgrounds available in the settings.<br/><br/>There's an upsell when you buy the pad to "remove lock-screen ads" you absolutely should buy that option unless you want a crazy distracting flashing panel on your wall.<br/><br/>I suggest enabling the recent apps "continue" option on the homescreen setting that creates a large UI component with the last 6 apps used. Much easier to see than a cluster of small icons spread over the desktop.  This is a great feature and should be developed more. In my application as a smart home dashboard, 6 featured apps are more than enough.<br/><br/>Media Playback<br/><br/>The speakers on the pad are tiny and cheap, you'll need to bluetooth or hard-wire from the headphone jack to get any acceptable sound. It supports the Alexa multi-room speaker groups feature, but you'll need to add the phrase "play XXX on the XXX group" everytime you ask for audio playback, and limit yourself to only a few Amazon sanctioned music services, I think that's a really terrible user experience.<br/><br/>You can bluetooth to another Echo speaker, but if that speaker is set up as a stereo pair, you'll only get it to play on one, not both. Basicly the media playback functionality is sub par and needs a lot of work.<br/><br/>For my application, I elected NOT to use the pad for the Alexa/music speaker group support and instead bluetooth it to my network Yamaha receiver.  This decision was partly because I use the PLEX app to serve my home media needs, and the PLEX skill only works locally on any given Alexa device and is blocked from using speaker groups. I'd need to enjoy my music on the tablet's 1/4" speakers, or bluetooth to an external device.<br/><br/>To complicate matters further this solution required me to use the Yamaha AV Controller android app to remotely choose inputs and receiver volume or—I'd need to run back to the media hub to change the receiver settings defeating the purpose of a remote pad.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Yamaha AV Controller android app is not available in the Fire Appstore as is typical with all other audio-gear manufacturer apps. The Fire App Store is for your children. It's only has super-basic apps but with thousands of games for kids—little for the grown-ups—and none for my purpose.<br/><br/>I won't advocate that you violate the Amazon terms of service, but I was able to get the Yamaha AV Controller android app installed after some research and effort. I don't suggest you try this unless you're comfortable with android system alterations, but it is possible to put Google Play Services on the pad with the full play store app catalog. We'll see how long it works until future Fire updates break it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>—Price<br/>—3rd party mounting options<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>—Shovelware!!<br/>—Lack of full device support in "show mode"<br/>—Ugly native Alexa app<br/>—Sub-par media connectivity<br/>—Limited to Amazon-sanctioned music services<br/>—App store lacking apps for grown-ups<br/>—Limited config/UI options<br/><br/>Someday Amazon will evolve their Echo hardware with added 5.1 abilities and I'll likely toss my receiver in favor of a native 5.1 Echo solution. Running two independent sound systems, with two independent speaker sets isn't a great experience, but clearly Amazon is working towards a better home media environment.  They will need to have support non-amazon music/media services, especially local playback services like PLEX as any "owned" media is currently blocked in their ecosystem, like many others, I'm not happy paying monthly service fees to rent the media I already own and Amazon has stopped allowing user uploads to their music services—only Amazon-purchased music is available. Nope, not a usable solution!<br/><br/>Even with all the limitations, I believe it's a tortured but acceptable solution for a centralized dashboard if you're willing to do what it takes to get it to look and function properly.<br/><br/>Good luck!</span>

<span>I have had an Amazon Fire 7 for years, and have enjoyed its use.  It was an alternate reader when my Kindle was broken or being charged.  And viewing pictures on it was rather nice too.<br/><br/>Then I got this deal from the online version of the home shopping channel that starts with Q.  It was a fantastic deal, and it even came with a coupon for a free case.  My 7 still works, but it was getting old, and its battery life was a little less than optimal.<br/><br/>This Fire 8 is a very nice upgrade.  Although only 1 inch bigger, it makes the view just right.  The screen resolution is sharper, the memory is larger, the processor speed is faster, the Ram is higher, and the battery is better and lasts longer.  Although I was happy with my old one, this new one makes me much happier.</span>

<span>Purchased on April 22, 2022 and it completely stopped working on October 13, 2022. A blank white screen &amp; nothing would work!! Then you are stuck having to contact HP Customer Service for them to determine if you receive a refund. It’s not worth the hassle!! Very disappointed in this product.</span>

<span>I’m a final year medical student and I was really struggling to use my 7 year old laptop. I was hoping it would be good enough to just study for my last board exam before graduating but it couldn’t even open web pages reliably! And literally took 5 mins to just turn on.<br/><br/>I found this laptop on amazon and watched a ton of review videos. It was super cheap so I was wary, I was concerned it would be unreliable. But ultimately I went for it, and boy was that a great call.<br/><br/>It comes with a free year of office so in my head I knock $80 off the price because I was paying for office anyways. So that knocks the price down to $190 for this laptop. At $190 this is an incredible value proposition!<br/><br/>It has a monster battery life and it’s great for.<br/><br/>- Webpages<br/>- Osmosis<br/>- Boards and Beyond<br/>- OnlineMeded<br/>- Uworld<br/>- NBME practice exams<br/>- Anki, without the media files though<br/>- MyEras and everything else regarding license applications and residency. You can open a ton of tabs at once with no issues at all.<br/>- I definitely suggest buying a small SD card and using that to store everything off the actual emc thing.<br/><br/>Some minor issues<br/><br/>It’s $190 so it’s not gonna be a MacBook Pro or anything. But the issues are minor if you’re just looking for something to study with and take care of basic computer work.<br/><br/>- trackpad gets a bit stuck occasionally but nothing that causes a major issue.<br/>- keyboard isn’t backlit but that’s not something you can expect at this price point.<br/>- it’s most useful in S mode I think, I haven’t tried to take it out of S mode because I’m not sure how well it would handle it. And it works well now so I don’t feel the need to try.<br/><br/>When I was looking for reviews I was worried about the compatibility with the programs I would need to use. If you’re in med school and you just need something cheap and reliable to study. I give this a 100% endorsement for the price point. I’m very pleased with this purchase, so much that I’m writing my first review!<br/><br/>I think this would work well for most other uses as well but as I’ve never used it in any other capacity I can’t really speak to that.<br/><br/>I’m definitely a big fan of Asus now!</span>

<span>This is the perfect super-portable Linux machine. I can run Dwarf Fortress and Stardew Valley without an issue (at the same time, even). I had some trouble with Wi-Fi drivers installing properly using Manjaro/Arch and gave up before going too far down the rabbit hole. Mint works perfectly using the Xfce edition, and I’ve got i3 windows manager installed next to that and it’s flawless. Drivers seem to work out of the box (with the correct distro at least). Battery life is so good - I’ve never gotten past 50% before my nightly charge.<br/><br/>As a point of pride I didn’t even let it boot to Windows before ripping it out and putting Linux on, so I can’t speak to that, but you definitely get a great bang for your buck running dainty Linux vs resource gobbling Windows. Hard drive is big enough that I didn’t feel the need to get a microsd, though there is a port for one. I still have 33 GiB free after the OS and all of my tools.<br/><br/>No fans to make noise, no moving parts really which is nice if you like it quiet and clean. Despite this the bottom gets only pleasantly warm but nowhere near hot or uncomfortable with a heavy load. It’s very light at about two pounds, and the size is big enough to not feel cramped while still fitting in practically any bag.<br/><br/>There’s plenty of ports despite the small size, and the the inclusion of HDMI is surprising but welcome. The keyboard feels good. The touchpad is fine (though with i3 or similar windows manager I don’t need to use it much). I even got the webcam  and mic to work with out of the box drivers.<br/><br/>The screen is very glossy, but the range of brightness is good and so far I haven’t been too bothered by reflections. Everything is plastic to keep it lightweight. It feels well built, not flimsy. I wouldn’t trust it to hold up to rough handling, but I’m not worried about it jostling about in my book bag.<br/><br/>Overall I couldn’t be happier with the little guy. It’s exactly what I was looking for, and seems like it’ll serve me for years to come.</span>
