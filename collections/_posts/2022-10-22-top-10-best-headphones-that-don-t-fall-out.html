<span>I love everything about these buds but I can’t get them to fit or stay in my ears. They fit for few minutes then when I’m moving around they fall out. And they don’t seal completely for the best sound because the sizes of ear pieces don’t fit my ears.</span>

<span>I bought these because i work dishtank at a restaurant, and tonight before i closed something bad happened. I had my right earbud in my left ear and left in my right, didn't notice like an idiot. There is a metal grate in front of the walk in dish area, where everyone is push all the stuff down into on the kitchen floor when we clean before leaving after close. I was sweeping over this nasty pitch black water with a metal grate over it. And i bumped my left ear by shrugging and shoulder barely touched my ear, earbud falls right out while standing over that grate. saw it fall through the grate into the nasty pitch black water my heart sank lol. I also heard it disconnect from my other earbud. Picked the grate up and swooped into the water with caution, pulled it out my first try thank god. Was very stressed out only had them for 4 days. That earbud wouldn't allow me to connect to it anymore so i thought it was all over. I put it in rice for 2 and half hours try to connect still not wanting to connect. then i tried something else, which was take the earbud that wasn't working anymore and put it into the charging pod, i did that and it lit up indicating it is taking a charge i was surprised. I then decided to take it back out, and it started to look for a bluetooth connection and connected right to my phone. Tested out the sound and it sounds all the same and just the same as the one that was never touched by water. So this product is amazing and glad i got it. the bass is good fits in my ear comfortably. i would def prefer these over apple earbuds i just like the sound quality more and how they sit in the ear just my opinion so yea if u ever water damage these just be quick in getting them out put in rice and let it sit, and put into charging pod to see if it will take charge, and it will work. Mine fell in the most disgusting water possible and was very lucky it still works gl and hope u enjoy the product as much as i do</span>

<span>I bought a new phone and it has no headphone jack. To me, this no-headphone-jack trend is a PITA because I listen to audiobooks A LOT and usually fall asleep listening. Bluetooth headphones are just not as convenient or comfortable as wired headphones. I bought myself these for Christmas because the price and reviews were good.  If possible, I'd actually give these 4.5 stars (Amazon, update your ratings ability) because they're not perfect, but they're pretty good.<br/><br/>First the good:<br/>-Sound quality is excellent. You wouldn't think that it would matter much with audiobooks, and it doesn't in certain ways, but if the quality is bad and slurry, I have to have the volume louder to catch all the words if a narrator gets louder and quieter as they read. I can turn the volume to the lowest level and have no problem hearing the book while laying in bed.<br/>-When sitting up or laying on my back, they are pretty comfortable in my ears (but see the negatives below).<br/>-The battery life is excellent - better than any other bluetooth headphones I have, most of which are connected to each other with a small battery pack in the middle. Many times I go to bed with them on playing a book or white noise and wake up and they're still on. When at low volume, they easily last 8-9 hours. The case recharges them at least 3 times before the case itself needs to be recharged and the headphones pop right in easily due to magnets. On one side I have the larger silicone earpiece and it does not affect them fitting in the case.<br/>-Unlike some other reviewers, I had no problem at all connecting these to my phone. They connected to my old phone immediately and when I got my new phone, connected to it easily as well (although I did have to disconnect them from my old phone, which is something I've experienced with most bluetooth devices). I like that the phone gives me information about the battery level of the earbuds, too.<br/>-I've taken several phone calls with these and the person on the other side says the voice quality is very good.<br/><br/>Now the bad:<br/>-My biggest complaint pertains to the fit. These are not comfortable in my ears when I lay on my side. It must vary from person to person because others say they're fine, but for me, a ridge of plastic presses on the cartilage above my ear canal. I know it's because they are big enough to have a large battery life so it's a trade off, but maybe the battery portion could have sloped a little more or had some padding or something.<br/>-More troubling and also related to fit is that the battery portion is relatively heavy. In my right ear it doesn't cause a problem, but it does not seat as securely in my left ear and falls out fairly frequently. I tried to solve this by using the bigger ear piece and it didn't help much. I would not exercise with these in for sure. On the plus side, I once lost the left one out of my ear into the sink while washing my hands and there was no ill effect to the earbud :) They could have solved this problem by including removable loops or a silicone guard that goes farther up into the ear for more security if you have a weird ear (apparently like me) or plan to jog/exercise).<br/>-I cannot get the touch controls to work properly when these are in my ear. For instance, you push the button twice to pause. You have to push it fairly hard and quick and I can't do it, although I can if I take it out of my ear and hold it in my hand while pushing. Maybe the button will loosen up over time or I'll just get better at it. I'd definitely rather have controls than no controls, although maybe pause (as a frequently used function) could have been a single push.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall the good outweighs the bad, especially for the price compared to similar true wireless earbuds, so I didn't want these to lose a full star, but the negatives are enough to keep me from saying these are the best out there - they may be the best option at this price point, however.</span>

<span>I have been using these daily since I bought the in 2019.  I was a bit hesitant at first, but now I would purchase again and again.  I take my dog for a walk twice a day everyday and absolutely love these. I have always had a problem with having earbuds as they make my ears itchy and noise cancelling blocks out things like approaching cars and other things I need to hear to maintain awareness of my surroundings. I have used these for running and they are fantastic, they stay in place and never move and again let me be aware of cars.  I like to think of it as if there is a sound that takes over my hearing while I'm listening to music, then it's something I should be aware of.  Part of my walks has me cross over a highway on a bridge and during that time it can be a little tough to hear, but I either just pause or accept it, because that's how they are.<br/><br/>These also work wonderful for podcasts, audiobooks and anything else spoken. It's as if it is my own head voice narrating.<br/><br/>  There is a slight grip/pressure to them at first, but over time I've either gotten used to it or they relax a bit.  You won't be getting deep bass on them, but I've actually come to enjoy music a little more without the bass. If you need a little more depth you can put in ear plugs and that not only acts as noise cancellation from the outside, but deepens the range of sound.<br/><br/>On airplanes I've used them with earplugs and had no issues hearing what was said and found them to be very comfortable over the duration of long flights.<br/><br/>The battery life three years later is still something to brag about, I'm really impressed on how long they stay charged. As with any battery it does not like the extreme cold. I take my dog on a walk in the single digits and after taking them off the charger I got about 15min into the walk and was getting the low battery warning.  I kept it going, since they auto shut off when they need to and they lasted the entire 45 min walk, but did warn me every few minutes that the battery was low. Slightly annoying, but it's also really cold out.<br/><br/>Overall extremely happy with the product and will purchase again when these inevitably die.</span>

<span>First things first, I hardly EVER write reviews. Way too busy, and I don't typically care enough. Here's a short and sweet summary: if you can fit the extra $160 into this month's budget (maybe no fast food, pizza, or coffee...whatever), don't hesitate - you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Next, here's some helpful info from the included manual:<br/><br/>Wireless range: 10 meters (honestly, I get better range than that...I've used them from downstairs in the opposite corner of my house from my phone)<br/>Continuous play battery life: 8 hours (they must mean streaming to two devices simultaneously and nonstop, or maybe talking on the phone for 8 hours, because I wear and use it all day from 6am until around 9pm and have only charged it at night - it has never died).<br/><br/>...now on to why I love these things. I am a previous owner of the Trekz Titanium. I tried the Trekz Air but didn't buy them. I was waiting for a unit that handled dual Bluetooth devices and was waterproof - Aeropex was what I was waiting for.<br/><br/>Cons: You already know this, bone conduction headphones can't replicate the amazing bass of an expensive pair of earbuds or cans. THAT SAID, when you're under water (these are waterproof) or wearing earplugs these things easily sound at least as good as a "decent" pair of headphones (like $20-40 range...more than adequate unless you are an audiophile). WITHOUT earplugs in, with open ears that are alert to your surroundings, I'd say these are the same quality "ish" of stock Apple iPhone earbuds. Maybe a bit less.<br/><br/>PROs:<br/>1. These have the best battery life of any wireless headphones I've used.<br/>2. I now have a headset that simultaneously connects to my work laptop for Skype meetings and my iPhone for personal stuff. Amazing. No more multiple headsets. Mic is great. Clarity is better than my Plantronics.<br/>3. Sound quality is great. Better than Trekz Titanium, can't speak for Air. The feeling that there is music playing that everyone else hears BUT THEY DONT is pretty amazing. I get to work or exercise to the music that keeps me going, but I don't have to worry about not being alert. No, these don't have great bass (without earplugs in). But as someone who enjoys dubstep, I can at least say I enjoy my music, still. The benefits far outweigh this minor drawback, trust me.<br/>4. Vibration (the tickle common to bone conduction) is dramatically improved, as is sound leakage. People don't hear these things unless they are cranked.<br/>5. Touching on something mentioned in my one and only "Con" - if you want noise cancelling headphones, it would be tough to find a better pair. Since you can wear the highest grade earplugs with these things - THEREBY *ENHANCING* THE SOUND - they effectively replace any other noise cancelling headphones. AMAZING.<br/>6. I love, love, love the charging port. The magnetic charger just snaps into place and works - I now wish every device had a charger like this. BONUS: they give you two in the box, so you have one for home and one for work.<br/>7. Since this is a relatively "new" technology, it's a great conversation starter, and everybody loves it. When you tell them to plug their ears (and suddenly they hear it BETTER) the facial response is like magic.<br/><br/>...so there you have it. I will likely not review another product for like ten or more years. But you, dear reader, I hope this pushes over the edge, if you're on the fence. These things are great. I have worn them all day, every day, since purchase (manufacturer warranty of two years btw) and they are comfortable and so convenient.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!</span>

<span>I’ve had these for teo days and have worn them almost nonstop. I love being able to hear what’s going on around me while also listening to music to audiobooks. I’ve taken them on a couple of bike rides and have enjoyed that they work with my helmet.<br/><br/>I have noticed that after hours of wearing them my ears and cheek bone area where they touch get sore. Just like any headphones or earphones I’ve ever used. I was hoping because these don’t go in the ear that they would be fine. But since there is some pressure created to keep them on your head after a while they are noticeable. They also press the ear part of my glasses into my hear and the tops of the backs of my ears. I should try the aftershocks with contacts only and see if that makes a difference.<br/><br/>The battery life has been great. The lowest they have gotten to after wearing them all day was 60%  (according to the battery gage on my iPhone for the headphones). I did not play things all day but had them on all day. With my AirPods I would have had to recharge them in the case at least two times if I had done the same thing.<br/><br/>I’ve used these to call several different people on the phone. Everyone has seemed to be able to hear me clearly. But I’ve noticed I have to turn the volume all the way up to hear them. And sometimes plug one ear if there is too much noice around me.<br/><br/>Using these with earplugs is the best. I am excited to use these when flying with the earplugs because I know I will actually be able to hear without having the valine going high.<br/><br/>The sound quality is not the best. It sometimes sounds like it’s underwater. But I’ve noticed if I plug my ears or use earplugs it gets better. These are not noice canceling at all unless you use earplugs. The bass feels pretty good. I don’t know if it’s because I can feel it on my cheek bone.<br/><br/>I bought the mini version because I have a small head. I wish they had an even smaller version though. I’m glad I did not go with the regular because I thing they would just fall off.</span>

<span>THE GOOD:<br/>+ Discreet, insofar that no one will be able to truthfully make those "turn the volume down, I can hear your music all the way over here" comments. Get rekt, Mom.<br/>+ Safe. Even when listening to music at full tilt, you can still hear when you're about to be run over by a forklift or assaulted by a vicious kitten, or when your significant other is talking to you.<br/>+ Socially acceptable (or at least moreso than devices that cover/fill your earholes). In my experience thus far, people seem far less put off by this device when exchanging pleasantries or engaging in customer service duties (please refer to your employee handbook regarding this device's compatibility with your supervisor's personality) compared to traditional headphones, earbuds, or AirPods. In some cases, it can even serve as a nice icebreaker.<br/>+ Intimate. It puts music in your bones, man. Can't get much closer than that. Audio is crystal clear and overall of high quality (or at least as high quality as the file itself). It is a delicious experience, for lack of better terms.<br/>+ Stellar battery life. On the first day of use (I did charge them overnight), I wore these non-stop from 0800 to around 1800. There was approximately an hour and half of call time, and the rest of the time was just music. Volume was at roughly 67% throughout the day, and by the time I took them off, the Bluetooth menu on my phone was reporting that my Aeropex were still above 50% battery life remaining. Granted, overall battery life will degrade over time - as it does with all rechargable devices - but this is a phenomenal starting point. Doubly so when considering how lightweight and small this device is.<br/>+ Solid mic quality. Of all the headphones and headsets and earbuds I have owned over the years - and I have owned many - the Aeropex has one of the best built-in mics I have had the pleasure of using in a long while. People can actually understand what it is that I am saying during phone calls and on voicechat platforms like Discord. Maybe my excitement over this is tempered by the fact that I had absolutely no expectations for it, given that the last half a dozen devices I've owned had mics suited only for collecting dust, but still.<br/>+ Thoughtful. Well, AfterShokz, I mean. They provide not one, but TWO of their fancy magnetic charge cables. No brick, but to be fair it's a safe bet that the average person has at least one standard USB receptacle somewhere in their life.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>- Yes, bone-conduction as a means of audio delivery does lose out a bit on the lower frequencies. Bass drops will not be as phat, the double-kickdrum sprees may sound less intense, and certain bassy, sexy voices may not sound quite as buttery. This is the caveat in the "overall of high quality" remark in THE GOOD section, but for me it is a tolerable caveat.<br/>- There is a voice that announces things, like general battery level, connection status, and the "POWER ON" and "POWER OFF" announcements. It is not the worst robovoice I've ever heard, but I would have much preferred a variety of beeps or other, non-vocal status indicators. For volume change or pausing audio, it does play back a simple beep, which I deeply appreciate. Some folks report that this beep is inordinately loud, but that has not been my experience.<br/>- It comes with a silicon pouch... tote... thing... which smells about as good as the milk you found on the floor this morning, which your cat regurgitated either last night or the night before. Cold, sour, slightly rancid; 10/10 do not recommend. Mine also came with a so-called Sport Belt. While it doesn't smell absolutely vile, I have approximately zero uses for it. Not necessarily a bad thing, I suppose, but it is a "waist" of materials. (I'll see myself out.) In all seriousness, go get a hardcase, or use a small cardboard box, or really anything other than the silicon odor abomination it comes with. I recommend a case from Hermitshell, which are tailoired specifically to AfterShokz products.<br/><br/>THE UGLY<br/>× Fit may vary. I was comfortable all day (roughly 10 hours straight, for those of you not paying attention), but my coworker had to attach tiny cushions to the bits just behind the ears on his set because they were, as he put it, "a little clampy."<br/>× Sometimes they would catch on my hood when I'd be looking around, and so were shifted a bit out of place, which was mildly irritating. I've trained myself to adjust the way I look around as a result.<br/>× Amazon keeps bringing up noise cancellation, for whatever reason. Bone-conduction headphones, such as AfterShokz's Aeropex device, are open-ear devices. That is to say, they do not offer noise cancellation. In fact, the lack of noise cancellation is actually a selling point. They do ship with a pair of foam earplugs, which are quite effective in blocking out sound, but I am not about to rate the Aeropex on the noise cancellation properties of foam earplugs. Good grief, Amazon.<br/>× COVID-related mask experience may vary. With the ear straps of the mask in place first, my Aeropex sit nicely over my ears with no issue and no audio interference. With my Aeropex on first and the mask's ear straps on second, I am still comfortable and neither item is at risk of slipping or falling or otherwise vacating their place atop my ears. I exclusively use a cloth mask with a 3D-printed frame (which is basically a cup for your face), so I cannot speak to the experience one might have with, say, an M95 mask, or a rebreather, or an exclusion zone gas mask.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 4.7/5.0<br/>This thing is magic, as far as I'm concerned. Delicious, intimate, beautiful magic. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.</span>

I can also put them in my pocket.<br/>* The charging case is convenient. I like only having to charge the case every three or four days, and always having it on me in case my earbuds get low.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>* They don’t fit in my ears. They constantly fall out, so I’m always readjusting. If I walk at a fast pace, it seems to speed up the process.<br/>* They’re not noise cancelling.<br/>* The sound quality is a bit weak.

<span>They sound great, are easy to charge and store, the batteries last a very long time, and the noise canceling feature works very well. They are really easy to connect to any device too. But they have a tendency to fall out of my ear, and that costs them a star. Maybe it is just my particular ears, but almost every time I use them, one manages to fall out and hit the ground at some point. Because of that, I have to be careful where I use them. Motorcycle rides and river activities are out of the question. Once one fell out while I was on the riding mower, and it took me about ten very stressful minutes to find it. I have since learned that it helps to wrap a bandanna around my head and ears when mowing. Unfortunately this isn't a perfect solution either, as the other day one still managed to fall out and hit the ground when mowing. Fortunately I found it right away that time.<br/><br/>Thank goodness they certainly do seem to be very durable. My kid's Airpod Pros got washed and dried, and they still worked! I heard them clanking around in the drier for 30 minutes, but thought it was just a nickel or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, for around the house or office they are great. But don't think you can trust them to go anywhere.</span>

<span>I have never purchased anything from Apple.  Being on the phone for hours each day having a nice pair of earphone is very important to me.  Friends recommended me getting AirPods and I think it is  probably the best on the market when it comes to comfort level, noise reduction and battery power.  I wouldn't use it to for music listening since the sound quality can't compare with Bose.  It's a must have device if you're on the phone for hours each day.</span>

<span>I bought a pair of these 6 months ago and I'm so blown away at how amazing these are I'm coming back to post a review. But you have to use the product for what it's designed for. These are open-ear headphones. So right off the bat, forget the idea of noise cancellation. These are designed for the opposite use - to allow you to listen to your stuff while also listening to the environment. They hide in your hair if it's decently long, and they disappear under a loose beanie. This means you can use them to listen to whatever you want and tune the world out, and if someone says your name you can easily pop back into reality. Essential for the workplace!<br/><br/>Sound quality is pretty good - given it's vibrating the sound through your skull. If it's touching your head you'll hear the music. Which means it's not going to be the go-to for audiophiles. But if all you want is decent sound while being able to answer your colleague's question that they've asked 3 times already and keep your cool cause you've got your music playing, this is the set for you!<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent. I use it for a whole 8 hour shift, switching from music to WebEx, and back again. I pair it to my phone when I leave for lunch, and then pair it back to my computer to resume work. I plug it into the weird proprietary charging jack and leave it on my desk. And as the Immortal Todd Howard once said - "It just works".<br/><br/>I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because the audio isn't the best. Stuff like FLAC will sound terrible, relatively speaking. But, hey, save that stuff for when you're not at work and can appreciate it; this is a business expense!</span>

<span>These headsets are a game changer for me. Using them is such a pleasurable experience!<br/>It's important to understand the advantages and disadvantages:<br/><br/>1) These go outside your ears. Sounds is transmitted through the bones and some through the ears. This allows you to hear your music without canceling the ambient noise. As long as the environment noise is low, the experience is fantastic. If you are riding a bike by the freeway though, the noise will easily overpower the music and ruin your experience.<br/><br/>2) Because the ears are not covered, using them for calls gives you an amazing experience, where it feels almost as if you were talking to the other person in front of you. I cannot stress enough how much better these are for calls than regular in-ear headsets. I use them daily for all my conference calls and would not change them for anything else. The built-in microphone also uses bone conduction and works very well and reliably. I gave it 5 stars for noise cancelation meaning cancelation of everything but your voice. Of course outside noise cancelation for what you hear is non-existent.<br/><br/>3) Fit is excellent. These will NOT fall from your ears, even if you are working out. I have some issues with them itching the back of my ears sometimes, but in general they are far more comfortable than anything else I've tried.<br/><br/>4) The controls work very well. The only gripe I have is that press and hold of the left button is supposed to let me use Siri but I have not been able to make that work.<br/><br/>5) Battery life is very good and they charge fast.<br/><br/>6) They have multi point pairing. This is an awesome feature that allows me to use them at the same time with my iPhone and my computer. It is not perfect, but works as expected most of the time. Sometimes I just have to turn them off an on to have them re-connect, but that is easy to do.<br/><br/>Overall, just a great product. As long as your audio expectations are met, you will be very happy with them. I just wish they were a bit cheaper...</span>

<span>Read all of the reviews and really wanted to give these a try.  The ear buds I have will start to hurt my ears after wearing for a period of time.  For these, overall, the concept is good.  But the cost versus the sound quality was something I couldn't justify, so I returned these.<br/><br/>A few key notes:<br/>1. I would recommend you read the review by HJeffK on January 13,  2022.  His review is 100% spot on.<br/>2. The 'bass' with these - at a normal volume, the headsets vibrated.  Slightly annoying, especially since the 'bass' didn't improve the sound quality.<br/>3. As someone noted, the sound quality was like having music playing in the background.<br/>4. With my earbuds, I can turn noise cancelling on or off.  The idea of having these so that I can hear what else is going on around me when running or biking is negated.<br/><br/>Again, the bottom line for me was the sound quality versus the cost.  I feel like I could get something much cheaper at cost, that is also bone conductive, for the same sound.</span>

<span>I've previously owned a cheaper pair from BBY that was pretty good, but I struggled to hear them when outdoor sounds god loud. Even when simply riding my bicycle.<br/><br/>As for these headphones, although they still can't out-compete the sound of a passing subway train (from the platform), they work well around traffic and during a windy bike ride. Furthermore they have some sort of microphone array which makes it easier for people to hear me during a phone call, although a poncho in the rain is still going to be noisy.<br/><br/>In any case, I'm very happy htat I can wear headphones while riding my bicycle without having to choose which ear to keep open. Since both ears are open, I can enjoy full stereo sound.<br/><br/>Some might choose to give it 4 stars for sound quality, but when I bought these I knew that these weren't designed to be better than my studio monitor headphones. These headphones are the right tool for the job, and that is to have stereo sound while being able to hear my surroundings.<br/><br/>**Side note:** My older pair from the other company came with earplugs which make them easier to hear in noisy environments. I never wore the earplugs since I usually left them at home on the occasions when they would've been useful. During a bike ride, I'm certainly not inclined to wear earplugs. I believe older models of "After Shokz" did come with earplugs, but at this point they are pretty much unnecessary.<br/><br/>That being said, if you are in a noisy environment in which you struggle to hear anything on these headphones, earplugs will definitely help (assuming you don't need to hear your surroundings).</span>

<span>I've been eyeing these buds since they were released but was hesitant to purchase them due to the mixed reviews for the ANC, even with the initial launch discount. That said, my new neighbors are frat boys who party at any hour and are destroying my night-shift body's minimal sleep schedule. And, while I do have noise canceling technology (Bose Headphones), they aren't devices that one can wear comfortably in bed. As such, I decided to bite the bullet when these buds went on sale on Prime Day for $158.<br/><br/>Having worn these now for a few hours, I'll share my current thoughts:<br/> - ANC is far from sub-par. You might notice a decrease in quality if you're used to the high-end stuff, but if you're like me and your only experience with NC are headphones that create pressure on your ears, this is certainly a worthy purchase. The Sony app is still learning to adjust (it has only been a few hours after all) so I'll sometimes hear my fan on full blast if I move locations, but the earbuds adjust and make the fan noise completely vanish within about 15 seconds.<br/> - I consider myself to have ears on the smaller scale (I'm 5'1") and am usually skeptical of earbuds that have a round body. That said, these have not yet caused any ear pain and the Medium ear tips (these are the tips that are on the earbuds when you open the box) had a fairly comfortable fit. After a few hours, I decided to try the Small ear tips and realized that they were the better fit for the fact that the earbud bodies sat more snugly in my ears and didn't protrude as much. Unfortunately, I found that the Small tips were a tad too small for my ears as the NC could no longer completely block out the sound of my fan. After about 5-10 minutes of bouncing between the Medium and Small tips, I decided to stick with the Medium tips since NC was of better quality. And it's not like I'm worried about the buds falling out of my ears.<br/> - Charging is fairly simple, both for the buds and the case. I did notice that some folks here were upset about the lack of wireless charging but, as a cat parent, I find the ability to charge my case via a secure cable extremely reassuring.</span>

<span>Let me start of by saying that these earbuds have good sound quality , are super light and have decent battery life I can wear these the entire day and not even feel they are there<br/><br/>But it does have some issues one of the earbuds sometimes doesn't connect and someone's disconnects while music is playing I'm sure this is some glitch but for such high priced earbuds should not be an issue , overall still good headphones perfect for working out</span>

<span>I stumbled on these earbuds by mistake. I've had good experiences with Sony headphones, so I thought I'd give these a try.<br/><br/>Boy, was I surprised. The sound is perfect &amp; the noise canceling feature works well. This buds are small, so they don't look obtrusive and they are easy to insert in my ears.<br/><br/>The addition of their app takes the cake. I can modify my sound to my liking. In addition, you can subscribe to a streaming service that enhances the sound. The details are in the app.<br/><br/>These are great headphones at a reasonable price.</span>

<span>(This is a lengthy review, so in case you are short on time I have included a quick Pros/Cons summary at the top.  This gives an idea of my overall opinions, but for more details continue to read on below.)<br/>(Note- I will mostly be comparing these to other earbuds that I have used and/or reviewed recently: AirPods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II )<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>--Comfort/Fit:  So far, these are very comfortable to wear.  They are slightly smaller than some of the other earbuds I've tested, and are up there with Airpods Pro in terms of comfort.  They also feel very secure in the ear, unlike some other brands.  No complaints here with comfort/design.<br/><br/>--Mic Quality:  The mic quality of these is excellent.  I tested out with calling friends, and these were either 1st or 2nd best sounding earbuds according to the people I called.  My friend says that these mics are the best out the earbuds we tested in this range.<br/><br/>--Multiple Ecosystem Support:  These work well with all ecosystems, whether you are using Apple or Android; and with assistants including Alexa and Google.<br/><br/>--Good ANC :  The noise canceling on these is also fantastic.  This technology has come a long way, and sometimes it can be hard to compare ANC, since each company produces earbuds that prioritize blocking out slightly different frequencies.  To me these seem like they are close to the best , but maybe the XM4s and Airpods Pro are SLIGHTLY better, especially the XM4s at low frequency ranges.  The Adaptive Sound Control is a neat feature that can change ambient sound settings based on your location, though I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>--Overall Sound Comparison:  With the default EQ settings, the overall sound quality actually seems slightly worse than the WF1000XM4s to me.  I also prefer the sound of the Klipsch T5 IIs with most music, and even the Galaxy Pros with some songs; as these LinkBuds S can sometimes sound slightly muffled or dampened in comparison.  Still good quality sound overall, just not as good as some of the other options in this range, and not my favorite with any type of music I tested.<br/><br/>--No Wireless Charging:  This seems like a big disappointment for this price range.  I would expect that ALL earbuds that are over $200 should have wireless charging at this point.<br/><br/>MORE DETAILS:<br/>Here are my thoughts on each category, again mostly comparing to:  Airpods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II.  (I also enlisted the help of a friend of mine that is an Audio Engineer, to give his opinions and to use some of his equipment.)<br/><br/>Sound -  These sounded great to me when I first put them in and listened to a variety of music.  I was not disappointed in overall sound quality at all, and if you aren't comparing these to anything else, you will also probably think that they sound great.  It was only after rigorously measuring their output with my friend's mics, and also repeatedly comparing them to all of the other earbuds,  that I was able to notice the slightly muffled sound compared to the other earbuds.  The Airpods Pro, Klipsch T5 II, XM4, and Galaxy Pro all seem slightly more “clear”, with a broader range.  The midrange on the Airpods Pro might be the biggest difference here, and when I switched back and forth between them I felt like I was missing some of those midrange frequencies with the LinkBuds S.  Overall sound range/EQ preferences are of course very subjective and personal, but my friend and I both agree that these are definitively not our favorite in this category.<br/><br/>Design/Fit – I like the way that these fit in my ear, and they are right up there at the top with Airpods and Klipsch in terms of being lightweight and comfortable.  For me, the Galaxy Pros were a little to clunky and felt like they might fall out sometimes, but the LinkBuds S fit great while also feeling secure.  The texture of the buds themselves is almost a little scratchy, which took me a little while to get used to, but I think I prefer this texture for touch sensitivity.  For me though, I have always preferred the press-able buttons on the Klipsch T5 IIs over all of these touch sensors, partly because I often wear a headband over the earbuds and a sweaty headband can mess with the touch sensors sometimes.<br/><br/>Calls – This is probably the best overall feature of these earbuds.  The microphone quality seemed to be the best out of all the earbuds when testing out on my friend's equipment, and in real-world testing I experienced similar results.  These were either the best sounding, or a close second best when compared to other earbuds when making calls.  These sounded the best in almost every environment, maybe tied for best with Klipsch in noisy/windy environments.<br/><br/>Water Resistance - These have the same IPX4 rating as most of the other earbuds, but note that the Galaxy Buds Pro have a superior IPX7 rating, if that matters to you.  So far these have been working great for exercise, but again personally I prefer more headband-friendly designs sometimes.<br/><br/>Charging/etc:  These charge at about the same speed as the other earbuds, and have a similar battery life.  The BIG difference is that these don't support wireless charging, which seems odd at this price range.  These come with a short 9 inch usb-A to usb-C cable in the box, no plug/brick.  This is my least favorite in terms of charging options compared to the other earbuds in this price range.<br/><br/>OVERALL:  These are solid earbuds that feel great, produce good sound, have good ANC, and have excellent microphones for great call quality.  They do just about everything well, but at this current price I can't say that they are my favorite, or even the best value.  Overall my favorites are probably still the Klipsch T5 IIs, which are currently less expensive than these LinkBuds S earbuds at the time I'm writing this.  My second favorite would either be the Galaxy Pros or the Airpod Pros, both of which are slightly less expensive and produce slightly better sound in my opinion.  The only thing these LinkBuds S are the best at seems to be the mic/call quality, but even then the difference there isn't big enough for me to recommend choosing them overall.  Personally I'm sticking with my Klipsch T5 IIs for regular use, but if you are a diehard Apple user, I would have recommend the Airpods Pro over these LinkBuds S at the current prices.  If these drop in price in the future and are competitively priced with some of the other options, then they might be a good choice; especially if switching back and forth between ecosystems is important to you and you don't mind the lack of wireless charging.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love these earbuds! They are my go to for when I want to listen to music, podcasts, or generally anything I don't want to bother anyone else with but still be able to listen for doorbells, or have a conversation with someone.<br/><br/>Sound Quality: Remember when we used to have those wired earbuds from Sony or JVC or Panasonic that came with those foam covers that we always used to lose? That's what these sound like, but slightly better - very slightly. Mids and highs are good, don't expect much, if any, bass. There is some low frequency response but it's very airy. These are no audiophile earbuds folks! Only audio codecs available are SBC or AAC. These are akin to Apple's Airpods - they are completely open, no sound sealage, no noise cancellation, but sound quality is definitely not bad if you know what to expect. But if you do get a chance to listen with these it's a different experience. Like music or voices are only playing for you, but you're not completely sealed off from the world. Your own personal soundtrack can play in the background as you go about your day. As mentioned before, the LinkBuds only offer SBC or AAC audio codecs, which is fine. Why waste AptX or LDAC capabilities on open earbuds? You lose more detail with the earbuds designed to be completely open. With the Headphones app you can turn on the function to upscale compressed audio via AI with the DSEE option. I honestly didn't notice any huge difference with it being on or off.<br/><br/>Build Quality: ABS material, though they feel very sturdy. The recycled plastic look has its own charm. Definitely a different look and feel, but you can tell Sony really tried to go environmentally conscious with everything, from the materials to the packaging. Besides the silicon inside the buds, it feels like it could be recycled again (if that makes sense). They don't feel cheap by any means. The buds are lightweight, probably some of the lightest I've used. Overall good build.<br/><br/>Battery Life: Battery life is good. I would say average. About 4-5 hours of continuous music listening, with an additional 2-3 full charges from the case. Just recently got the Xperia 1 III which they added battery share (reverse Qi charging), which is interesting to me since the case for these earbuds didn't include Qi charging capabilities. Sony s WF flagship does, but these do not. Hopefully if they make a LinkBuds ver. 2 they add it.<br/><br/>Fit and Comfort: Just like any new earbuds, getting the fit right requires some trial and error (and sometimes a little bit of discomfort). The LinkBuds come with 4 (I think, can't remember) different sized wings that help keep the earbuds in place. My ears are somewhat smaller, so I typically use either small or medium eartips and wings. For these I had to switch the preinstalled mediums for one size smaller. At first the wings are a bit too stiff and uncomfortable. But after breaking them in they're perfect! The LinkBuds stay in place, even with more than normal head shaking. Although the shape of these earbuds are unorthodox, once you understand how they need to be placed in your ear they fit well. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live I find these MUCH more comfortable but a little more pressure than Airpods.<br/><br/>Features (Headphones App): The Wide Area Tap apparantly isn't a new function, but it is a niche one. The way it works is instead of tapping directly on the buds themselves, you double or triple tap an area around an earbud for it to trigger an action. In the Headphones app you can assign area taps for each side, but only limited to a specific function. For example, for the left area you can assign the Volume function, so 2x tap will be set to Raise Volume and a 3x tap will Lower Volume. And for the right area you can set something like Playback Function, where 2x tap will Skip Song Forward, 3x tap will Previous Song. You cannot, however, set left area to function as 2x tap volume up 3x tap previous song. It's only left/right area tap set functions (Volume, Playback, Assistant, etc). There is Adaptive Volume Control which raises the volume automatically when you're in a louder area such as outside where there's traffic, and lowers volume when you're in a quieter are such as a library. Then there are your typical earbud functions, such as Auto Power Off when nothing plays through the earbuds after a certain amount of time passes, or Auto Pause when earbuds are removed from your ears. In the app you can mess around with the equalizer, set up 360 audio, set voice to speech, and set voice notifications.<br/><br/>Connection: Now this is my biggest gripe with the LinkBuds. I have the Headphones app set to prioritize a good connection at the sacrifice of sound quality, but noticed if there are any large masses that get in between my phone and the earbuds (like, say, my fat body) the earbuds cut out. This especially happens outside, I've noticed, while I'm gardening or washing the car. Sometimes the interference also cuts out audio in the left earbud. And it's not just for a second or two, it could be until I pause my music and try reconnecting the buds, needing to place them back in the case and restarting the connection to my phone. It can be very frustrating at times - hopefully there's a patch coming.<br/><br/>Overall, very good first foray into this design by Sony. I hope they continue to refine this line of earbuds. I know their flagships have settings to allow passive audio but normally those sound too robotic - having open audio is more my preference.</span>

<span>**UPDATE**: They're really growing on me. I find myself using them more often than my usual pair. After tuning the EQ, they sound quite good, and if I'm gentle, they don't really fall out. So, I updated from 3 to 4 stars.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL: I was really excited for these headphones and they are slightly disappointing. Main points being:<br/>- They are difficult to put into your ear, even after repeated practice, reducing the convenience factor of having true wireless headphones<br/>- They easily fall out for me, regardless of which size retaining ring I put on. More on that later<br/>- They have an oddly bright sound, but I don't think they have a poor sound quality at all like many reviewers are saying. More on that later.<br/>- Their direct competitors for most use cases are bone conduction headphones, and I think bone conduction is a better choice here.<br/><br/>I do appreciate the innovation, and I think it's a really cool concept and I love the novelty. If that's enough for you to own it, then these are good true wireless headphones that sound pretty good and don't cause pressure in your ears. But if you actually want them to be useful for most situations where being aware of your surroundings is important, I think you'd be better served by bone conduction headphones (such as AfterShokz).<br/><br/>The rest of this review is just going into more detail about those points, so you can stop if you got the gist.<br/><br/>-- Not good for physical or outdoor activities --<br/><br/>The question to ask yourself is: why do you WANT open back headphones? If your answer is, like I think most people, "to hear my surroundings", then the next question to ask is "WHEN do I need to do that?". If it has anything to do with being outside, then you don't want these, go get bone conduction headphones. Those leave your ear completely open and essentially CAN'T fall off your head without significant effort. I think bone conduction is safer and more convenient for outdoor use or exercise. However, if your answer is instead "because I don't like pressure in my ears", these might be just what you're looking for... see the "Great for relaxation" section.<br/><br/>The Linkbuds are very light and just kind of "sit" in your ear. You can certainly move your head and they won't fall out, and they didn't even fall out for me when I yawn or move my jaw like others said. If you touch them the wrong way however, they just slide out of your ear. I actually think this is the real reason for the (very cool) "wide area tap": see how there's nothing holding the headphone into your ear on the backside? They're only anchored into your ear with two points: the retaining ring at the top and the donut speaker. If you lightly push the headphones forward, with essentially no effort, they pop right out. Most people's ears will have the same problem, because the Tragus (see an ear diagram, it's the pointy bit at the front that the donut speaker wedges behind) locks the front of the donut into place, but in general, the Antitragus (the other side of your ear) isn't a hook, so it's just light friction keeping it in place back there. There's nothing stopping the headphones from pivoting forward, and they DO stick out of your ears, so... something as simple as brushing your hair away could make them fall out. You have to be careful.<br/><br/>The other problem is "hearing your surroundings". The speaker sits directly over your ear canal and thus partially blocks it, and also makes any incoming sounds fight with the speaker. I find that with these, the sound from the headphones almost always drowns out anything important I'd want to hear around me. I can't even have them super quiet and have a conversation with someone, as the sound from the speakers fights so heavily with incoming sound. But with bone conduction headphones, your ear is completely unobstructed, and I find that incoming sounds mix much better, maybe because the soundwaves don't have to fight in your ear canal. That part could be subjective, but at least for me, bone conduction feels significantly safer, because I can still hear everything around me, even if the surrounding sounds are quiet.<br/><br/>-- Great for relaxation though! --<br/><br/>That brings me to the title: who is the audience for the Linkbuds? I think it is for specifically people who want true wireless headphones but don't like pressure in their ears and are NOT looking to use these for exercise or outdoor activities. In fact, you can look at the marketing and features to back this up. These are not "sports" headphones, and maybe that's not why you're buying them. I keep comparing the Linkbuds to bone conduction headphones, but if you don't intend to use these while doing physical activity, the Linkbuds are honestly better. I find myself using them all the time in bed, because I AM a person who doesn't like pressure in their ears, and you can't exactly use bone conduction headphones while lying down (they have a band that extends behind your head).<br/><br/>They also sound WAY better than even the best bone conduction headphones I've tried, which is why I'm surprised people say they sound so bad. I wonder if they've never used open-back headphones before: yes, you don't get nearly as much potential bass as closed-back (and especially in-ear), no matter WHAT the design is. I have Sennheiser HD600's, the "audiophile mainstay", and they sound amazing, but they'll never have as much bass as my cheap in-ears (iems). So if you're a bass head, you won't like these at all, you're stuck with closed-back headphones and iems. To me, the Linkbuds do sound oddly bright though, like over-emphasized upper-mids and top. It's not distorted, just a bit of a strange signature to my ears, but using the app, the EQ is saved IN the buds themselves (along with all the other nifty settings), so it's easy to fix. But, I've also found that small adjustments in fit greatly alter the tone of the Linkbuds, so take that into consideration when reading reviews: they might not fit everyone the same and thus they might not always sound that great.<br/><br/>All that junk being said, I do actually intend to use them all the time, just for relaxation and essentially nothing else. I don't even trust them for cooking, I'm afraid I'll brush them while moving around and they'll fall into the food. But, I'm still gonna use them until they break. Also, the case is VERY SMALL, and I really like it! The picture attached shows one of those older slow iPhone chargers, and these are even smaller than that and only just about as thick, so it's definitely nicely pocketable. The recycled plastic is a nice, unique touch, and the case feels sturdy enough (definitely nowhere near airpods). The lid locks into place if you pull it open enough, that's kinda cool.<br/><br/>The Linkbuds are so cool, and they serve a good niche, and I LIKE them, flaws and all. I gave them 3/5 (edited to 4/5) because I recognize that they have problems and that there are better alternatives for most use cases, and yet I'm still so fond of them. I want them to succeed, even though I don't think they will. I think there's absolutely a group of people for whom these are perfect, and I want these to stick around for those people.</span>

<span>As someone who has suffered his whole life with pain from wearing earbuds (most types) these are definitely a must have if you are in the same boat.<br/><br/>For some reason I can’t handle iems. If they go in the ear, or even AirPods. My ears have always been so sensitive that any pressure results in pain or swelling. I try to stay away from most in ear styles for this main reason.<br/><br/>A secondary reason is the pressure from the sound isolation has never been comfortable to me. Feeling like I’m underwater, rather than silence. It’s awful.<br/><br/>AirPods 3 were my go to since their release late last year, but they still caused a bit of discomfort. They would also fall out. The convenience of using iOS and AirPods plus the higher than average sound quality made me push through.<br/><br/>Before the AirPods 3 I used the Galaxy buds Live. They were great. Most comfortable I’ve ver used. No issues with comfort. Despite enjoying the ANC implementation whereas it focused on outside lower frequencies like hums and engines (opposed to something like the AirPods Pro which attempt to block all sound). I didn’t like how quiet they were. The sound quality was great in a decently loud room but when I was at work with heavy machinery it got hard to hear without cranking up the sound which caused a bit of distortion.<br/><br/>Enter the Sony Linkbuds. Out of the box these things come with the medium wing tip which to my horror began causing some burning sensations from the pressure. I swapped them out for the small on both ears and voila. Perfect fit. Perfect volume.<br/><br/>It feels like you have nothing in the ear. The Galaxy buds live were close to perfect but they did block sound a bit when you were wearing them. The whole in these Linkbuds make it so that’s a problem of the past.<br/><br/>The auto speech detect works well. Too well honestly that I feel like I’m killing my battery by having it on.  Speaking of batter it’s still to be seen how long they last. The app will show one percentage one minute and then it’ll jump down like 20%. I don’t think it updates frequently but it’s jarring.<br/><br/>The extra features like spatial audio and Alexa are cool but I use iOS and those aren’t that well supported. Maybe in the future, but right now don’t buy the buds if you have iOS and want to make use of those features.<br/><br/>The spatial audio is similar to AirPods 3 and pro implementation. It works very well with the supported apps. Seems highly unlikely more will add the feature though.<br/><br/>I’m assuming on android it’s a system wide effect that can be toggled on or off. So if you have an android I’d look for more information elsewhere.<br/><br/>The last thing I want to mention that makes these a must have is the wide area tap. Every time I tap it registers the proper gesture. EVERYTIME! That’s huge. With my Galaxy Buds I would always skip songs, or be unable to accept calls because the tapping was so inaccurate. Most tap to use headphones suck ass and for me, caused me physical pain to use. Here you don’t tap the headphone. You actually tap your temple… sort of. The side of your head. It’s like something out of a sci-fi movie and it works.<br/><br/>Few quirks when using these with iOS but most are now standard fare if you don’t use AirPods. Stuff like sometimes the screen will come on when I use Siri so my thigh will cancel out commands. I don’t use Siri that much anyways. And when I do need an assistant it’s only to do math problems for me that I’m too slow to do on my own. But it is something to be wary about.<br/><br/>Alexa implementation is good and works well, but again, Alexa can’t do as much as Siri: most of the things you’d ask her are like music selections. It’s kind of a non issue for me personally.<br/><br/>Also the app to set these up is kind of annoying to use. Features work, but the menus are confusing to know if they are turned on or not. Certain apps seem like they are required to set up certain features but not really. I spent about five minutes in the soundscapes app wondering how to I use the spatial audio for movies only to realize the app was trying to tell me the soundscapes app is compatible with the buds and that’s the end of the integration.<br/><br/>To use Alexa and Spotify features make sure to go to assign menu and change the left or right settings to the proper apps. Then the rest of the features will work. It’s very confusing at first.<br/><br/>With time as I use these through the warm up period they might get better sounding but the fit and comfort are apparent from the start. If you have sensitive ears please try the xs wingtips. Those are the ones on all the promotional material but for some reason they come with the medium.<br/><br/>This is my first review on Amazon and I just had to let everyone with similar problems to me that we’ve been saved. The perfect earbud is here.<br/><br/>For everyone else you might feel a bit let down. They aren’t as bass heavy as IEM’s and definitely don’t block outside sound. Some people really don’t want to hear anything and these aren’t for those people. For everyone else these are it!!!</span>

<span>If I had to give someone a quick down and dirty written review of these headphones I think this would be it. I have been looking for earbuds like these for a while. I have a small ear canal so using earbuds that fit into my ear Canals comfortably is hard for me. The last earbuds that were every day drivers for me were the Samsung galaxy buds live and those were my favorite because they stayed in my ear and stayed stable regardless of the activity. These do the same thing also, they stay inside my ears regardless of what I'm doing and the fit is somewhat comfortable for long periods of wear they were mort comfortable before I switched to a large wing tip but they feel more secure now. These do not have noise canceling but I think if your looking for ear buds like that then these are not the earbuds for you. If you're getting them so you can hear the environments true outside sounds due to the open hole design its perfect at blending the two, outside sounds and inside sounds. I guess the volume at which you listen to media also determines how much of the outside you hear but don't get it twisted no matter how loud the music is you will still hear extremely loud and important things such as car horns sirens etc. If that is the kind of environment that you live or won't to operate these in then they are perfect. I have use a lot of headphones and earbuds that have accompanied software and I have to say that these have some of the best software that I have used. The companion Sony headphone app has all the useful feature like and EQ and more. It also has some features that I haven't seen before like like tap touch control but their different. Instead of taping the earbud you tap your jaw/temple area to active controls such as play pause etc which is a nice feature. Comes in handy when you're wearing a beanie or hat that covers your ears. They also have one great feature that I have never seen or used on earbuds before...maybe it a sony thing but its cool. The Earbuds will play and pause whatever you listening to when they detect you speaking to someone which is a great feature for me and maybe some of you. It take out that step of having to tap the earbuds or using your watch or phone to stop the music to speak with someone. I love this feature when I'm out grocery shopping and run into these random conversation scenarios. This feature can also be somewhat bothersome when you're into your music and you jamming out and you decide to sing to the song and the music stops. I guess it's not that much or a problem for me though because I just turn the feature on and off when I don't want to or want to use it. Something else that I want to touch on is the case. This is usually where the best headphone manufactures fall short. The case build will be crappy or built without other things in mine. One big thing that was a problem with my earbuds live was the case. If I dropped the case with the earbuds in it they would go flying out of the case when it hit the ground. The case for these is small compact with great reserve charging battery power. The case snaps closed and the ear buds  snap into the case through magnets and clips and the are super secure in my opinion, just incase you drop them. The battery life is great on them also I use them for the past couple of days for long periods of time and I was not able to kill them in a single listen. The case battery life is less than usual but its it still comparable to other earbuds on the markets. You can pair the earbuds with devices with the bottom button on the case without the app which is good and the battery indicator light is basic and strait foward for as charging and and battery usage and you can see it regardless of if the case is opened or closed. These are usually things that the other manufactures mess up. Sound quality is fantastic for open design headphones but not as good as a sealed design. All and all these are my new favorite everyday driver headphones. This review pertains to the points that are import to me. I purchased them at the launch price and I think they are worth it. Get these if they are similar to what you prefer if they get a little cheaper or they go on sale, its a no brainer.</span>

<span>I wish my brother would buy this product, he just bounces around from dollar store to dollar store buying junk and hoping for a bargain.  Lesson to be learned, this handy easy to connect listening and talking device won' t be found in a dollar store.  The quality and durability are a bargain for the price and formed well easy lightweight to keep in place. The bone in front of the ear canal is just perfect not stuffed in the ear like the buds. Take it off and let it stay around your neck. Never lose it and charge it up when you aren't out.</span>

<span>These are great for me. I have lots of ear problems so over and in ear headphones were problematic to say the least. The open ear concept is a godsend for me. I do wish there was a way to make bass more noticeable but that is just the nature of all current bone conduction headphones. The overall sound is good enough for background noise and podcasts. Movies are decent. The 90 degree angle ear hooks are uncomfortable at times but not a deal breaker. Overall fit is snug but not too tight. Its not going anywhere but also not squeezing and pinching your face. Battery life is decent I wear them for about 10 -12 hours a day at work and a charge at lunch keeps them topped off and going till i get off. These are OSHA approved earphones so it's nice to be able to have a loophole for the safety rules on earbuds in the workplace. Overall I recommend shokz as a brand but if you can make splurge for the openrun do it but if you can't then these still will be your new friend. I go everywhere with these and i am very happy with my purchase. Will be getting more when I can.</span>

<span>I wear hearing aids and when I play music through them I lose all mids aand bass. I thought I'd give this a try. The first time I put them on tears came to my eyes. I heard songs that I wrote and recorded in a way I only imagined, I had no idea they came out so good. The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is the bass still has room for improvement, they are too tight and become uncomfortable after a little while and finally you cannot lay your head back and rest. I would love to be able to lounge by the pool or at the beach and enjoy my music. Would I buy again? I would consider the higher line, buy yes, I would.</span>

<span>This product has some fairly good perks, but a few cons. I've used them for week and one day as of writing this review and overall I can not complain. I have a few pet-peeves with it, but I will focus this review into listing pros and cons.<br/><br/>-- Pros --<br/>1) Comfortable - It sits well on my head and it's almost not noticed when using for an hour to two hours of use.<br/><br/>2) Sturdy build quality - These are built in which you can bend them and it will go back into its original shape fairly well. You can twist this the band in loops and it springs back, so these could survive for a while thrown in a bag.<br/><br/>3) Audio quality is decent - For comfortable bone conduction headphones that don't squeeze tight against your head, the sound quality is pretty good. I wouldn't put these up there with high end headphones, but more in the low to mid tear headphones. As the audio can change using ear plugs or not. With ear plugs don't expect them to become high end headphones, but for bone conduction it does make it so you can turn down the volume and pick up on select sounds easier.<br/><br/>4) USB-C for charging is fantastic. I understand why some of these have proprietary designs, but at the same time USB-C is rather small and very universal. If you break this cable overtime, you can easily replace it, verse a proprietary cable that isn't sold separate like with most of these bone-conduction headphones.<br/><br/>5) Ear Plugs provided with carrying case.<br/><br/>6) Nice button layout. Volume controls &amp; sync/power on one side and pause/play button on the side of the haptic speaker.<br/><br/>-- Cons --<br/>1) No easy access to the battery. If the battery ever fails on this, you can't replace it yourself easily. You would have to pry the thing open and hope to not break the headphones in your pursuit. Then hope you can find a potential proprietary designed internal lithium-ion battery that is likely shoved very tightly into the on side which doesn't contain the buttons.<br/><br/>2) Can not be used as wired or charge and use. I figured this would likely be the case, but it's a shame this isn't an option. Specially when they provide ear-plugs for use when in a safe area where you don't need to hear your surroundings.<br/><br/>3) When the battery gets low, every few minutes a ladies voice says, "Charge Me". This can not be turned off and can be rather annoying. As you can still have around an hour and a half to an hour of charge left. It's not super loud, but it's still disruptive to the content you are listening to.<br/><br/>4) The provided USB-C cable provided is very short. I've not measured it officially, but it looks like it's 91 Centimeters or around 3 feet long. Charging from a computer or charge bank is the best option due to this. I wish they would have provided at least a 2-3 Meter (or 6-9 feet) cable instead so you could power brick this easier. Though, as mentioned it's USB-C so this can be easily fixed.<br/><br/>5) Multi-Sync is locked to using a phone application. Upon reading the manual for this online, this feature is here, but you have to sync it first to a phone, install the application, and then use the application to sync to another device. I've not yet used this, but I would assume this means you're using your phone as a bridge between devices. This in my opinion is slight annoyance, since I do not keep my phone glued to my hip when home.<br/><br/>6) Some of the programmed multi-push controls are not the best. Like previous track where you press to hear three beeps isn't the best. There is times I felt like I didn't push the button enough to get a track switch on my music.<br/>---------<br/><br/>Personally I would love these to be wired or at least have a charge and use function. Yet for a wireless device the overall sound quality isn't bad even at lower than 100% volume level. Specially with ear-plugs in. Though without you may need the one-hundred percent volume or if using your OS's sound mixer to amp the volume beyond 100%, if not using ear plugs. (Don't do this to high or to long. Bone-conduction can lead to hearing loss like regular headphones when the volume is to loud. Though, bone-conduction is easier to be to loud). This of course only applies when the volume of the content is super low volume.  I would not recommend these for non-earplug usage for movies or tv shows. Though, content like music and maybe a YouTube video where audio can potentially be higher or well leveled these are great. Since the tiny speaker tweeter can't vibrate enough to conduct very low content.</span>

<span>I have had the Aftershokz Open Move headset for nearly 3 weeks now.  I have been using them constantly.  During the day I wear them at work, where I need to be able to answer my company phone in the lab or out in the field.  I have quickly found that the little button on the left temple can easily be bumped with the back of a hand, wrist or a handy door jamb if I am gloved up and do not want to touch anything directly.  I did not consider that when I was reading up on the product prior to purchase but has worked well for me.<br/><br/>Obviously my ears are open, so when I am in a loud facility or operating equipment, it is so easy to just put in some foam ear plugs and still be able to hear through the headset.  That flexibility of choosing different arrangements of hearing protection has been great!<br/><br/>The headset easily pairs with multiple devices simultaneously.  I was not sure how that would work on a practical level, but when I had it paired with my phone and laptop (attending a webinar on the laptop and using the headset for audio), it automatically switched the audio to my phone when a phone call came in.  It worked just how I would have hoped in that situation.  As soon as I hung up, it automatically gave me back the webinar audio from the laptop.  There may be some trick involving which device you pair first, and I just got lucky about how I did it; I don’t know, but it worked very well in that situation.<br/><br/>So I have been wearing this headset all day long at work, every day, and have been comfortable and pretty happy with the whole arrangement.  When I am home, I use a Creative Labs BT-W3 usb bluetooth dongle to attach the headset to my PS4 for gaming.  If you use the right mode on the dongle, the headset mic works just fine and can be used for game and PS4 voice chats.  So now I’m wearing this headset for a number of hours at home as well.  As you can see, I have been using it a lot over these last three weeks.<br/><br/>If it has a full charge in the morning, the headset has easily lasted through my day at work and for a few hours of gaming at home.  The only time it has died on me so far is when I forgot to charge it one night and ended up trying to do all of that 2 days in a row.  It finally started complaining about 2 hours into the second night of gaming.  Given this, I can’t really say anything about the battery capacity less than it seems very adequate; it is quite good for how much I am using it in a given day.<br/><br/>In terms of audio quality, understand that I am mainly using voice applications.  I don’t use it to listen to music, so look elsewhere for an opinion on music quality.  For voice applications however, it works as well as, if not slightly better than any other small headphones I have ever used.  When I say that, I am including small over the ear headphones as well, but not full size over the ear headphones.  You know, the ones that sound great but make your ears sweat after a while.  For my uses, the sound quality is good and I love the sensation that the voices are in my head…  It is so easy to use the headset and still be able to hear my wife call out that she needs me to bring her something, like she does.  Your ears are uncovered, unsweaty, and nothing jammed into your ear.  The pressure against your temples hold the headset in place, but is not so snug as to be uncomfortable, at least for me.<br/><br/>For my part, I think they are fantastic and wish I had gotten a pair a long time ago.  Ok, now for the good stuff; the drawbacks, the cons.  With excessive volume or bass, they tend to vibrate against the sides of your head.  Nature of the beast I suppose, just the way it is.  It is a slightly annoying sensation.  As some others have observed, I do notice the occasional change of volume for no apparent reason.  Maybe it has something to do with the distance from the Bluetooth transceiver while walking around?  No clue, but I do notice it occasionally.<br/><br/>The headband hangs loose in the back, it is not snug to the back of the head.  So, if I am wearing a collared shirt or a coat, that band is constantly bumping into the collar.  It is annoying, though it strangely does not really knock the headphones out of place for me.  It is simply annoying.  Part of the weight of the headphones, however light they are, is borne by the part that loops over the top of your ear.  Despite being used to wearing glasses, sunglasses, lab safety glasses, etc., it feels just slightly different, particularly when also wearing a pair of the aforementioned glasses.  I acclimated to the feeling quickly, but your personal feelings may vary.  The first few days the tops of may ears were slightly annoyed at me, but they got used to it and stopped complaining soon enough.  Add glasses and a hat and your ears have a few things going on around them.  I got used it.<br/><br/>As you may have already guessed, none of these drawbacks are big enough to dampen my enthusiasm for this headset.  I do wish the head strap in the back was somehow adjustable to fit more snugly.  Maybe that was just not a practical design choice with the electronics needing to reach both sides.  I wish they were less expensive.  Despite these things, I find the headset to be a huge improvement over everything else I have ever used for a headset, at least for voice applications.<br/><br/>Now, if they could just pair this with a bluetooth throat mic that picks up the vibrations in your throat and transmits no background noises, I would brave the noisiest machinery spaces in the world while being on a conference call!  You hear that Aftershokz?  Bluetooth throat mic/wisper mic?  You have to do that to go with these!  I’ll send you my contact information for the royalty checks later, since I did just give you the idea.</span>

<span>If you are aware that these are bone conduction headphones and therefore they produce sound differently!!<br/><br/>That being said, they are also headphones and if purchased new, should be broken in properly. They are very good at what they do which is allow you to listen to music in stereo while being completely aware of your surroundings.<br/><br/>People that think these are just wireless earbuds should realize that they won't hear the bass notes but will feel them 'tickle' their ears.<br/><br/>I went with Shokz (formerly Aftershokz) as they have been in the business of making this type of headphone for a while. They feel great, are lightweight, and are comfortable for wearing while I am at work.<br/><br/>I currently work in a machine shop and have to keep one ear open if listening through earbuds or headphones. Using these for the first time today, I was able to listen to music in stereo for the first time since I started at this job. The quality of stereo sound is really quite good and they are a very good purchase for me.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that these are an investment and should be taken well care of. I will be using these for my biking rides as well as walking.<br/><br/>I value them very good for stereo sound and feel.</span>

<span>This is a very good product from my perspective. I need a wireless headphones when I started jogging and playing tennis but at same time didn't want to lose out on hearing traffic and fellow players around me. I had heard of "Open Ear" headphones from friend before this purchase, it seemed like a good fit for my circumstances so I decided to try them.<br/>Good news right away was that I could wear my glasses and these all comfortably at the same time. But soon after using them on jogging and playing, I found myself wearing them all time. The sound is absolutely great considering that they sit outside your ear canal. They're equally handy while doing yard work, household chores, or working on the computer. On a full charge, I can wear them for five or six hours easily before even beginning to think about the battery level. Also  the built in microphone during calls and no complaints from the person on the other line.</span>

<span>These buds have really good battery life. I use them mostly for spoken voice from an Apple Watch.<br/><br/>There are a couple of curious issues: There is an audible connect tone and a power-off tone, but no power-up tone. To go with that, it is difficult to see whether they are powered up or not if you’re wearing them; the tiny LED is at the top of one of the dongles, so you can’t see it. So you hold the power button down for several seconds, and it will probably be powered up and you can connect.<br/><br/>Very nicely, when you power up the buds, an Apple device will notice and give you a connection window. This even applies to an Apple TV. I use them mostly with an Apple Watch, though, and it works smoothly with them. When connected to the watch, the watch’s power display will show the state of charge of the buds. Other Apple devices will do the same; it’s more than just usual Bluetooth pairing. Call it “deep pairing.”<br/><br/>I think the buffer may fill slowly. If I connect to my watch and strike out walking, they cut out some when my body is between the watch and the buds, like when I swing my arms. That’s irritating, but I notice that this is a problem only when starting out; I don’t notice it happening after a few minutes.<br/><br/>The last noteworthy thing is that allowing the buds to magnetically attach to each other will pause your audio, which will restart when you pull them apart and re-insert.<br/><br/>Finally, don’t be put off by the USB-C charging port. You can buy a cheap adapter to USB-2 so you can use old charging blocks or USB ports on old computers, but USB-C is great for iPhones (8 &amp; up) and Apple watches. It’s fast. Get a USB-C charging block and a cord for your phone if it’s an 8 or newer. It’s the way of the future (for now).</span>

<span>I purchased a set of these wireless headphones about 8 years ago.  They'd probably still be working if I hadn't slammed them in the car door.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The assorted sizes of earbuds fit my ears way better than the clunky Apple earpods, plus they rarely fall out when I bend over, turn my head, etc.  (I love Apple products but their earpods are not made for petite people.)<br/>These are bluetooth.  They have all the controls I need directly on them, so no fumbling for my phone.  Up and down volume and pause, plus on/off.<br/>I also like that they reduce the noise a lot but not so much that I can't hear the cars or other people behind me.

<span>I have had these for about a year now and unlike my many other pairs of earbuds from other companies these have lasted and still work! Battery life is decent as well. After a year I charge them every other day or so and if I use them constantly all day I will have to do it daily.  They don’t have the quality of sound that my over the ear phones do with noise cancellation, but they are decent. I use them mostly for work meetings and listening to books/podcasts so the bass and music isn’t a priority. If it is for you these are OK.

Price is good but expect a headache on the setup an daily use is discourged by the headache of turning them on and gettting them up an runningg. i absollutely hated them for the firs weeek. Sm slowly warming up to them.</span>

<span>I purchased these earbuds after months of waiting for it's release. I used these earbuds for about 3 weeks and the sound quality was rich, with some customization on the EQ in the HeyMelody app. The battery life lasted me about a week with my usage (I used the earbuds twice daily). The earbuds sat flush in my ear and were the most comfortable pair of truly wireless earbuds I have ever worn. They don't fall out!! Additionally, even though, the earbuds are not marketed as noise cancelling, they provide great noise isolation from the surrounding environment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after 3 weeks of use, the left earbud refuses to turn off when placed in the case. This causes the battery to drain and when I removed the buds to listen --- only the right earbud would work because the battery drained in the left bud. I tried disconnecting and resetting the buds from the case, but nothing would work. I even updated the firmware hoping it was just a software issue, but that did not fix the issue,<br/><br/>Pity. I really liked these earbuds. They offered the best bang for your buck,</span>

<span>Great sound with Dolby Atmos, good range and no dropped connections. -1 Star simply because the app doesn't work with my Samsung S10e so I can't use the equalizer. Otherwise I'm thoroughly impressed and extremely happy at this price point.</span>

<span>Great sound when adjusting iOS Spotify settings, some ear fatigue after long usage. Donot pay more than $39 for this. If you see it for more google the official website it’s usually at msrp for $39. Even tho it is worth the $59 upsale I hate price gougers.<br/><br/>Pro tip #1: Disable Audio Normalization in Spotify and use a V Curve in Equalizer for best performance. This goes for airpod pros and everything else too. Adjust it to your liking from there. When you disable audio normalization each song will open up and you can hear it more clearly, each will have its own unique quirks depending on how well it was mastered and how old.<br/><br/>You may find yourself adjusting the V curve often especially if you listen to lots of different Genres like Bass-heavy rap or edm to classical to hard rock and metal like I do. Pro tip#2 disable microphone access from Amazon app so it won’t disrupt your listening. This goes for every annoying app that disrupts your listening experience. Look at pictures I uploaded for better clarification.<br/><br/>I get some ear fatigue from the hard plastic balls like the power beat pros used to do but not nearly as bad. For the price point the sound quality is superb and just as good as Airpod Pros. Battery life is also a solid 6-7 hours as advertised. I do prefer airpod pros simply for the comfort I can sleep with those with minimal ear fatigue, these are pretty close and for the price it's quite impressive.<br/><br/>They also isolate noise pretty well without any actual ANC with a nice seal using silicone tips, just turn up the volume. Watching YouTube videos it stays in sync and you can use one bud at a time if you want. Also if you have android you can use the HeyMelody app to adjust what the touch controls do like triple tap for voice assistance on left or right bud and tap and hold to swap to last 2 recent devices on right or left bud to swap to different devices easily.<br/><br/>Side note the heymelody iOS app does not support these yet as of this writing June 13 2022 so just have to wait. I did message OnePlus on instagram about it and they said they will forward it to the appropriate teams. Call quality is good people can hear me fine. At this price point you can’t really complain.<br/><br/>Update: accidentally left these in my pockets it went thru full washer and dryer cycle on max heat. Works good as new. Amazing. Worth every penny.<br/><br/>Update2: I left my phone in the cardio cinema room at the gym by accident and walked all the way to the other side of the gym and the music was still loud and clear!</span>

<span>I'm on a budget, and can't afford airpods or galaxy buds, and decided to get these. Boy, was that a good idea. No annoying "power on" voice sound, but just a pleasant charm. The only flaw is that the earbud case has a mat finish. 9.5/10</span>
