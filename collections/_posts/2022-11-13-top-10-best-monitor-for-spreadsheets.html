<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I recently changed jobs and decided to change from using a dual monitor setup to this UltraWide monitor, and overall I'm quite pleased with it. The panel in general has been good so far, and looks very nice paired with my MacBook, which was just plug and play with the included USB-C cable.<br/><br/>For the price point, this monitor has been great and has all the features I was looking for, specifically USB-C connectivity with Power Delivery (charges laptop up to 60W, which has been plenty for my M1 MacBook Pro as well as hub/data transfer, which is nice to be able to have one cable without needing a dock (though may not be enough to charge more power hungry laptops). It is quite sleek looking with the included base, and is VESA mount capable, which I'll likely take advantage of in the future. The screen itself is plenty bright, even with backlighting set at 50%, and is quite sleek and close to "borderless". Colors look natural and the resolution is sharp and looks great with MacOS.  The built-in speakers are also fine, better than many other monitors I've used/owned, but not a substitute for external speakers for listening to music, at least for me. For general/office use they're fine.<br/><br/>My one "nit-pick" is that the screen has a factory installed matte film over it which I understand is to reduce glare and finger prints. In concept this is a nice idea, and it does make the monitor easy to clean.  That said, when first opening/turning on i could see a few tiny bubbles/imperfections near the edges which made me think this was a removable plastic film... it's not. The bubbles/imperfections are hardly noticeable, only with close inspection of the borders when the screen is off. Very minor imprecation in this built-in film aside, I do see benefits in glare reduction and ease of cleaning.  All that said, it would be nice if there were no imperfections at all... considering this was pre-installed at the factory and is not removable without damaging the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I've found this to be a good monitor for the price point, and have been quite satisfied with it.</span>

<span>After a lot of research, I found this great IPS monitor that has all the essentials I was looking for: ultra wide screen, IPS, curved and USB-C connectivity. It immediately worked perfectly with my M1 Mac mini as well as my laptop from work (an HP EliteBook 845 G8 which stays charged through the USB-C plug, so no power cord is needed). The picture quality is beautiful...images don't appeared warped by the curvature as I was afraid they might. I don't use it for serious gaming, so I can't comment on that. The monitors stand is wide and takes up a lot of desk space, so you might want to consider a desk mounted monitor arm (the WALI Single Monitor Gas Spring Desk Mount works well for me).</span>

<span>Using this monitor with my Macbook Pro. At first I tried to connect it via my own Hdmi cable and all I got was flickering, white dots and the screen going on and off sporadically. Then I connected it with the USB-C cable it came with and it worked perfectly fine. It will not work by connecting the cables to my dock station. I tried a different Hdmi cable and that also gave me the same issue. So after talking to Amazon customer service (which was no help) and then getting transferred to a LG tech rep, I played around with the resolution of the LG monitor and it seems to be working fine once changed to 2560 x 1080. When I used the Hdmi cable that it came with, it automatically set it to this resolution setting. I then switched it to what's recommended which is 3440 x 1440 and so far it seems to be working fine.<br/><br/>So, my verdict, just make sure to use the cables it comes with and don't bother plugging them into a docking station.</span>

<span>I will try my best to make it as short and concise as possible. Note that I use this screen with two main laptop devices: ASUS zen book, and MacBook Pro M1 14". From prospective of a university student:<br/>--Pros--<br/><br/>* Size! I can't emphasize this enough but this size is just perfect. It allows me to open several apps/programs at the same time. Mainly useful when reading papers or when coding (as will as following tutorials).<br/>* Versatility is pretty good. It is a little shy from perfect. That is because the lack of rotating sideways (around the vertical pivot). You would have to rotate the whole base to do that.<br/>* Picture quality is amazing. Can't be as good as the MacBook Pro screen but it differently doesn't look bad either. When using it with my other laptop (Asus), it shows its true perks.<br/>* USB connectivity is very useful. I won't go into more details about this but I highly recommend searching on the web why this is useful.<br/><br/>--Cons--<br/>* sturdiness is a bit of a problem. If you set the screen at the highest extension, it wiggles pretty easily. You would have to have a super sturdy desk to limit this wiggling but that would still not help that much.<br/>* lack of speakers. Paying this much for a screen would be great to have a built in speakers. Unfortunately, depending on your desk setup, you might want to get external speakers. I am at the point of seriously getting one after few months of use.<br/>* Not enough USB ports<br/><br/>----EXTRA Advice----<br/>You might see reviews of other users online complaining about USB-C connectivity that it stopped working after a while. From my experience, this has happened to me two times where I could connect to the screen but my MacBook Pro was not charging. I found out it got back to normal once I updated the system. My take is you need to keep your system up to date all the time to ensure functionality.<br/>That is said, I am still having a problem of display settings getting back to default once my laptop gets into the sleep mode. It doesn't happen all the time but it happens often and it is not a pleasant experience. I will update my review if I find a solution to this issue.</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these for my wife's work station at home.  The monitors are easy to put together and set up.  The cable connections allow for VGA, HDMI, or Displayport.  The monitors have speakers and sound better than the laptop speakers.  They have a connection for the speakers but with the HDMI cable the sound uses just that connection.<br/><br/>Over all the monitors are reasonably priced, can be installed in 10 mins and look great for work.  The back is also set up for a plate to be used on arm mounts for a desk or wall.  I would buy these again.</span>

<span>I'm very happy with this monitor.  I was able to try it out at a former employer's office.  At home, I had a larger monitor and unfortunately, larger isn't always better.<br/><br/>I like this size of this display.  My monitor is only about 24" away from my face and I have decent vision with diminishing reading vision.  Looking at a larger monitor was more than annoying, it just wasn't good to use and it made me not want to use my home computer.<br/><br/>Using this monitor at 1920 x 1080 (recommended for this screen), and having the magnification set to 100% (Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display = "smaller") is great!<br/><br/>I don't do gaming and I haven't used the internal speakers.  Can't rate those.<br/><br/>I sometimes change the color settings to help minimize the impact on viewing screens late at night (Warm, Neutral, Cool, Low Blue Light, Night, Reading, HP Enhance +, or Custom RGB).  This is helpful.<br/><br/>I am able to tilt the screen down and up with ease.  And the rotate to portrait is great (raise display to highest settings and tilt back to clear the desk), but my old laptop can't change the settings to view in portrait.<br/><br/>I recommend this monitor.  It's great that it can also go on a stand that holds double screens.  And with the very thin left and right frame sides, it would be a great monitor to use 2 or 3 side-by-side.</span>

LG's 32QN600-B’s 32 inch class (31.5" display) screen provides more than 70% more viewable area compared to a 24 inch monitor (16: 9). The QHD (2560 x 1440) clarity and sRGB 99% Color Gamut reproduction of the IPS panel enhance every project, even when viewed off-angle. The easy-to-use On-Screen Control optimizes monitor settings for the job at hand, while Reader Mode ensures comfortable viewing for extended work sessions. And the 3-Side virtually borderless design looks great on any desktop.  Basic troubleshooting - Nothing is displayed on the screen: Check if the power cord is correctly plugged into the power outlet. Check the power cable connection and press the power button. Check that the connected input is enabled.  Screen display is unstable and shaky. / Images displayed on the monitor leave shadow trails. :: - If the selected resolution is HDMI 1080i 60/50 Hz (interlaced), the screen may be flickering. Change the resolution to 1080p or the recommendedresolution. Not setting the graphics card to the recommended (optimal) resolution may result in blurred text, a dimmed screen, a truncated display area ormisalignment of the display. The setting methods may be different depending on the computer or operating system, and some resolutions may not be available depending on the performance of the graphics card. When using the monitor, pixilated spots (red, green, blue, white, or black) may appear on the screen. This is normal for an LCD screen. It is not an error, nor is it related to the monitor's performance.

<span>Have owned two 32" VA panels so far and both had serious issues. This being an IPS panel I figured would be much better. So far so good. It accepts a YCbCr 4:4:4 10 bit signal and displays it with no problems which is very nice. Detects properly as an HDR10 compatible display with all my stuff just as it should with no funny business. Games with good HDR implementation detect it and switch modes automatically, though some need you to manually switch it in Windows.<br/><br/>I bought the model with the adjustable stand and it works fine for my uses. The stand isn't super duper amazing but it's pretty stable. The monitor is well supported and doesn't wobble around like crazy or anything. Don't let other reviews dissuade you from this because of the stand. It's fine. The adjustment feels solid and works nice and holds the monitor in place. Everything is nice and tight and your tilt settings and everything will stay in place.<br/><br/>The raw response time on the old panels was okay but the grey to grey response was very slow. So those panels had excellent color and contrast, but were a little blurry in motion. Games didn't feel smooth and crisp, though they looked the part in still frames. Movies didn't hold their crispness when in motion either. Even disregarding the 75Hz refresh of this monitor, the actual response of an IPS panel is much better than that of a VA. This makes it a solid gaming and movie watching monitor.<br/><br/>75Hz is a treat as well. I have a Club3D HBR3 DisplayPort cable. The big thick one that always works no matter what. It works great with this monitor and 75Hz is detected instantly. It's not really "high FPS gaming" but my 1070 can push my games to 75FPS no problem most of the time. Combined with the better response time this monitor is very smooth and easy to watch in motion. It has greatly enhanced both my desktop and gaming experience. Then you add Freesync in over the top. This monitor has a Freesync range of 48-75FPS. On my old monitors that range was wasted as they were really 60Hz displays. This one being 75Hz means that's a pretty decent range, and a lot of games will stay in that range 99% of the time. Especially when almost all my older games lock vsync. I will however add that Freesync disables color control on this display in favor of some very over exposed presets. My older VA panels allowed Freesync to be enabled independently of other image controls. If you are buying this display for Freesync, that's its one very weak area. I have elected to disable Freesync in favor of running oldschool. It's very well behaved in regards to screen tearing and runs unlocked framerate just fine. Regular old vsync is just fine as well and 75Hz locked is as smooth as it gets. This one is a winner for me as a sometimes gaming monitor.<br/><br/>Contrast is fine and with some fiddling I got the color and brightness pretty dialed in. Black levels aren't amazing but are fine for the type of monitor. It calibrates fine with THX SDR display images. While there is backlight bleed it's consistent and mostly inconsequential to the picture quality. Pixel density is about like that of a 24" 1080p so not amazing but plenty crisp for most people. With my settings dialed in the color and brightness of this monitor are great and I get an accurate and colorful image.<br/><br/>However, I bought this monitor over other similar ones because it supports HDR10. On that promise it does indeed deliver. It took some work but I got MadVR to recognize my HDR videos by adding "hdr=on" to the folder names. Within MadVR's monitor-specific settings I set HDR passthrough to the display. It then switches over and shows HDR on the top right corner of the monitor when playing a video fullscreen. It works amazingly well and videos look very vivid and colorful.<br/><br/>I saw some people saying that this monitor is kind of weak with HDR and I guess I have to agree. It doesn't get super bright, and doesn't show off the highlights and true super brightness of a much more expensive display. It also seems to compress some of the range. However, it still looks great, and I find to be an almost universal improvement over SDR video. It's just above the level where black crush starts, which keeps it from being truly dire. Most of my 4K HDR video looks awesome on it(and it's truly great with SDR content). LOTR and Star Wars at the very least look great. HDR10 doesn't have a very good universal standard so some video content relies on the display's brightness abilities to make the image look correct. In that regard this display will let you down. Some HDR content just isn't bright enough on this display.  It isn't true 1000nit HDR, just 350nit with HDR10 compatibility. However, really well tuned content does look awesome on this display. Far Cry 5 has an amazingly universal HDR implementation and looks JAWDROPPING. Out of all content I've tried that's the best one so far. It looks spectacular.</span>

<span>I had been using an Asus 24" 1080 monitor for years and decided I needed a better (bigger) screen for these old eyes. I had been a PC guy for decades (because that is what work dictated) and now that I have retired, I wanted to get back to my Apple roots, since I'm already in the apple environment with my phone. I took the opportunity when the new MacBook Air M2 came out this summer and made the jump, but quickly learned that Apple manages screen resolutions significantly different than Microsoft. After a lot of research and some testing on 4K screens, I learned that Apple upscales/downscales natively in the 100dpi/200dpi range (which is how they get "retina" quality on their screens. So plugging a 4K monitor will improve quality at the sacrifice of size. However, if you allow Apple to "custom scale" resolution, this can eat up a lot of gpu processor bandwidth and, depending on what kind of work you are doing, impact performance. At the 4K price these days, I didn't need this aggravation. the 1440p monitors are a nice compromise, as they will natively upscale/downscale to the 100 dpi range (you can find the formulas online to check), but when one moves to a larger screen, the benefit of the higher resolution is lost because the larger screen offsets the move from 1080p to 1440p quality - giving you basically the same dpi count. All this to say, I ended up with a larger screen, so I have more real estate, but the quality is not any better than the old monitor, and still noticeably inferior to the MacBook screen - though absolutely useable, even for streaming.<br/><br/>As far as prior comments, I noticed no "wobbly" effect from the monitor stand. It is just as sturdy as any monitor I have ever owned since they went to a flat screen format. Also, the settings on the monitor area easy/peasy, with the small "joy-stick" type input device on the bottom/center of the monitor, rather than the tradition 4 button array found on monitors.<br/><br/>At the sale price I got this at, I'm happy with the monitor, though not pleased I could not find a better and affordable solution to the resolution issue inherent with Apple, but this would be the case with any 1440p, 27 inch monitor, so this is not a "ding" to this particular LG product. At the higher price some of the comparable monitors were selling at, I would have returned it.</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>What this is not is a hard-core gaming monitor.<br/><br/>What this monitor will allow you to do is bridge the gap between a low quality home pc monitor and a better spec'd monitor.

Now if your looking for a cheap gaming monitor that will help you get ranked in CoD,Apex or OverWatch, this ain't it look else where.

The video card of the connected PC must be capable of supporting 1920 x 1080 at 60 Hz and include 1 HDMI or 1 VGA output to drive the monitor at the preferred mode.

<span>I ordered this monitor because I was switching from a dual 22" monitor setup to a single ultra-wide monitor, and required picture by picture (PBP) functionality for screen sharing. To note, I'm only using this monitor for work so can't comment on the gaming aspect. The first monitor that I received was defective - the monitor powered on and off continuously. I tried experimenting with different cables, hubs, and laptops before realizing it was an issue with the monitor itself. Amazon shipped me a replacement and the new one worked like a charm, once I had the right hub (highly recommend the CalDigit Element Hub for Mac Users) and appropriate cables for my laptop. The picture and screen quality are good but not mind-blowing, and the lack of height adjustment is a minor annoyance, but as mentioned, I was primarily looking for a relatively inexpensive ultra-wide that supported PBP and this fit the bill. I would recommend this monitor as the price point is really competitive for the features, and most importantly, the compatibility with my MacBook Pro.</span>

<span>First off, one can't deny the benefit and beauty of so much screen real estate. The flexibility to view 2 documents/screens side-by-side, entire webpages with minimal scrolling, or multiple inputs using PIP/PBP, makes this a versatile monitor for work or play. My primary usage is for business applications in a work-from-home setting. I connect two laptops using the dual HDMI inputs in PC mode and extend the displays. It also includes a DisplayPort and headphone input for added versatility. This gives me the equivalent of three screens to view my work. Where this monitor really shines is crisp text even with 12 pt. fonts, minimal glare, accurate color reproduction, and the eye saver mode for extended viewing comfort (reduces blue light output). Although I can't comment directly with this monitor, it does feature FreeSync (FS) too, but my graphics card does not support it. I have seen FS in action elsewhere, and it is an added bonus if you are a gamer with a compatible card. You can also use the monitor for TV viewing due to the dual HDMI inputs, and the picture quality is very good. You will need to change the setting to AV mode, and you can also adjust the aspect ratios and other settings to suit your preferences.<br/><br/>There are a few aspects of the monitor that are not ideal for a user such as myself (work-from-home), although I suspect they would not impact most people. In the interest of transparency, I will include them in my review. As mentioned earlier, I use both inputs simultaneously throughout the day for viewing work content. When I have a need to switch to a full screen view of either of the inputs, I have to select the small jog button on the back of the monitor to change inputs. This requires it to cycle through the inputs each time until it reaches the one I want. There are no software shortcuts or hot-keys to simplify this process, and it is not uncommon for me to do this a dozen or more times a day. Not only is it a bit slow (5-7 seconds), I worry about the durability of the jog button with so much constant use. Also, there are no height or pan/swivel adjustments, only tilt. For me, I like to stand up periodically during the work day at my desk, so it is not at an optimal viewing angle during this scenario. The monitor is  very light, so it is easy to physically pivot the monitor, but then the stand moves things on your desk. Again, these are not deal-breakers, but small annoyances. Overall, I would fully recommend it to those looking for a widescreen monitor.  I did receive an incentive to review this product, but I hope you can see that I reviewed this as objectively as possible.</span>

<span>Coming from an old 23" 1080p monitor that I purchased in 2010, this is quite the upgrade.  It's amazing how affordable monitors have gotten in the past few years.  We are a long ways from the days when I spent nearly a grand on a 19" LCD.  Still, it isn't a "cheap" monitor, so the value proposition needs to be there.<br/><br/>First, the monitor is absolutely massive.  It's hard to overstate just how large it is at 34".  You can fit truckloads on the screen at once, but the issue with most ultrawide displays is finding content that will fit it, and this is no exception.  Because the 21:9 ratio is different from the traditional 16:9 ratio, you get black bars on the sides with nearly all video content.  This is a non-issue with gaming since the resolution can usually be matched up, and it works great for traditional workflows like video editing, but don't expect to watch most widescreen movies on this without bars.<br/><br/>I didn't end up using the Samsung software that lays out items on the screen since I'm fine with native Windows 10 window management that aligns two things side-by-side, but you'll definitely want to use something or it will feel overwhelming.  In that same vein, I think 32" or so is the limit of a realistic monitor size before it really needs to be curved.  Obviously a curved version would increase the price substantially, but you'll find that you usually have to move your head a few inches from side to side to see all the content comfortably.  Again, not an issue if you understand that limitation going in, but just realize that this is a lot of pixels for your eyes to track.<br/><br/>Regarding the refresh rate, I'm happy that Samsung included FreeSync.  That's a big plus.  Unfortunately, the default range that FreeSync works on his monitor is only 48-75 Hz.  I'd like to see a lower starting point.  Additionally, the only output that allows 75 Hz at max resolution is DisplayPort, so make sure you are using that and not HDMI.  This will get more useful as more GPUs come with FreeSync support, especially with NVIDIA adding support to the 10/20 series.<br/><br/>As expected, the monitor is extremely bright out of the box at around 185cd/m2.  I had to take the brightness all the way down to 21/100 to hit 120cd/m2.  (There is no separate backlight control, so there will be a PQ adjustment when reducing brightness).  Had to adjust my RGB to 57/32/40 to get close enough for a color profile to make it the rest of the way to 6500k.<br/><br/>All in all, a good monitor at a good price.  Disclaimer:  I have received this monitor for free in exchange for my honest review.  All thoughts are conclusions are my own</span>

<span>I use this product daily for communications and playing card games. It is a good clear picture with decent response time. I would have given it 5  stars except that the button on the back to operate the menu and turn the screen off is clumsy and difficult to use especially if you have large fingers. I installed a 10 foot HDMI cable and discovered the screen would not turn off when I turned off my computer. Little icons rolled around the screen until it was manually turned off by the button in back, clumsily. I installed my old analog cable and the problem went away. The screen now turns off with my computer (windows 11). Would prefer an HDMI connection in case it would give a better picture. Does anyone have a similar complaint or solution.</span>

<span>This review is for the SB220Q series (1920x1080) 75Hz monitor variant.  At a $90 price point as of July 2020, all of the praise this monitor has gotten and continues to get is pretty well deserved.  Right out of the box the factory calibration is pretty awful as with most TVs and monitors (I’ll never understand why that is), but Acer’s built-in menu gives you a wide range of control to tweak the image quality to your liking.  Here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past three weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The colors can be very vibrant and the sharpness makes everything nice and crisp both up close and from a distance without going overboard.  Although the spec sheet does not specify the exact Adobe or sRGB color gamut range, it does have a stated 72% NTSC coverage (keep in mind that the NTSC color gamut has the highest level of color reproduction), which would imply that it should have close to 100% sRGB coverage.  This is pretty standard for most sub $200 monitors (note: the unit that TechSpot tested came in at around 93% of sRGB coverage mostly losing detail in the green range so your unit’s reproduction may vary).  The 6-bits + FRC (equal to 8-bits) color depth is also an industry standard for entry level monitors and is completely fine for casual use.<br/><br/>- This montior’s “100,000,000:1” Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) (non-standardized measure of contrast for videos) definitely seems to outperform my other slightly more expensive budget IPS monitors (the HP VH240a and ViewSonic VS2412-H)  that only have 20,000,000:1 and 50,000,000:1 contrast ratios respectively.  However, note that it still has an industry standard 1000:1 Static Contrast Ratio (measure for non-moving images) which isn’t great but is perfectly acceptable for casual viewing since only the highest tiered ($400+) IPS panels exceed that point with 1,500:1 being the maximum native contrast typically achievable with an IPS.<br/>~ A quick side note about that “100,000,000:1” DCR number:  there is no industry standard methodology for this particular measurement so the number itself is mostly useless marketing fluff.  But as I noted, compared to the two other monitors with the same industry standard SCR, this monitor did seem to outperform them both in that area.<br/><br/>- Its 102 PPI pixel density actually makes a subtle difference in image quality when viewing up close compared to my 24 inch 1080p monitors that have a 92 PPI.  Text seems to be a bit smoother in comparison.  This is purely an advantage of having the smaller 21.5 inch screen.<br/><br/>- The Color Adjustment Menu allows you to adjust both the RGB and CMY gains, bias, hues, and saturation levels to get a better color balance.<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu lets you adjust the screen’s brightness, contrast, gamma, and blackness (“black boost”) levels while also providing a ‘blue light’, ‘adaptive constrast’ (ACM), and a ‘Super Sharpness’ on/off switch.<br/><br/>- The Game Menu has FreeSync (for AMD GPUs) and Overdrive options<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- The bezels are a bit thicker than I woud’ve liked (they’re about 1 cm on the top, left, and right sides) making the frameless design nothing more than a gimmick.<br/><br/>- The top-down viewing angle is noticeably darker compared to looking at the screen head on.<br/><br/>- Despite having a good DCR of 100M:1, the blacks are still a bit too bright for watching anything with heavy dark scenes since the display itself does not have any HDR capabilities with high contrast control zones aka local dimming (to be fair, this is completely expected at this $90 price point and is only being mentioned as reference for those that may be thinking of using this monitor to watch TV/movies).<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu’s ‘Super Sharpness’ option is just an on/off switch; it does not give you a more granular adjustment control over the amount of sharpness to apply.<br/><br/>- Even with all of the image quality adjustment options available in the settings, the whites remain on the slightly warmer side of the color temperature chart.  It’s not that noticeable when viewing on this monitor alone, but the difference can be seen if you have another slightly cooler display adjacent to it.  This is most likely just an issue with my particular unit since other reviews have noted their unit had a more neutral or “near perfect” white temp.<br/><br/>- It only has a paltry 15° degree back tilt compared to most other budget monitors being able to tilt closer to 30° degrees (this is super nitpicky as compromises are to be expected at a sub $100 price point).<br/><br/>- The Power button is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the menu buttons (both in shape and spacing).<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a nice quality budget monitor to look at spreadsheets, word documents, and do some internet browsing or even some light casual gaming, then this is a great choice.  If you are a competitive gamer, photographer, professional editor, or a content creator then you’ll obviously need to invest in a higher spec monitor.</span>

<span>My only complaint is more so my fault, but the stand is not adjustable at all, you cannot raise or lower it or turn the screen. It sits on a solid stand. I sort of just expected height adjustment to be standard on all modern monitors.<br/><br/>Otherwise, picture quality is fine for casual users.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>*Update 3*<br/>My replacement screen now has several dead pixels, and several pixels which wont unstick attempting several different methods. Not too pleased with the overall quality control on these.<br/><br/>Potential in this screen, but quality control issues would prevent a recommendation.<br/>Finally if you have two TB3 devices connected, you can switch between the two by powering one down fully while the other remains on, this will switch input and then you can power back on your other device.  Not the most convenient process, but I find it easier than removing cables.<br/>*** UPDATE 2 ***<br/>Some very important items if you are considering this monitor:<br/>#1 Bad item: YOU CANNOT SWITCH SOURCES BETWEEN THE 2 TB3 INPUTS.  If you have 2 TB3 devices plugged into the monitor.  You have to fully SHUT THE MONITOR DOWN as well as both devices, then power on the device you want to use and the monitor will pick up the correct TB3 input...repeat you cannot switch input sources between the two TB3 inputs...this stinks.<br/><br/>#2 Bad item: You can't just press the power button to turn it off.  You have to go through the OSD to turn off the monitor which makes it 3 clicks for a function that should be 1 click.  Really annoying and really terrible IMHO.<br/><br/>#3 Bad Item: The monitor will regularly fail to power your peripherals in which case you may have to power cycle the monitor, unplug the devices from this screen itself.  This is a real annoyance.<br/><br/>I still stand by the picture quality but this monitor has so many other flaws it may be best to wait until the next gen or a different brand has something similar (if your needing 2 TB3 inputs)<br/>***** UPDATE *****<br/>So after having the monitor for only 4 days, the joystick that operates the On Screen Display stopped working when being pressed a certain direction.  Calling amazon to hopefully get this exchanged right now.<br/><br/>Having been used to laptop screens primarily for the last decade, I had been wanting an ultrawide and it was a tough choice deciding which screen to go with.<br/><br/>I was between this monitor, the new LG 34gk950f which was eliminated because it is on backorder everywhere, and the old Alienware AW3418DW.  The Alienware I had seen in person several times and while gameplay is fantastic on the screen, the colors were not very vibrant and it seemed a little dull.  Since I will be using this for work, media and gaming I saw the samsung and the contrast compared to the Alienware is a good bit better.  So my choice was made, and I hoped for the best for gaming.  Now here are my thoughts after one brief day with it; I'll update this review down the road.<br/><br/>********NOTE********<br/>In windows with 100% scaling the text is clean and crisp looks great on websites and documents etc.<br/>On Mojave 10.14.3 the scaling is not perfect.  Pictures images still look great but the text is a little jagged.  You can mess with the settings and make it a little better but oddly it does look better in Windows 10.<br/><br/>Build Quality/VESA MOUNTING -<br/>So let me get the red herring out of the way and put it out there; I don't like the VESA Mount setup for this monitor at all.  Sure it's actually pretty easy to remove the pre-attached stand and install the mount, only 2 phillips screws, but the way it is designed it adds about 2" of depth to the monitor when depth is the area that I am already lacking.  This could have easily been solved by having a flat portion on the back of the monitor or having the vesa mount point on the monitor itself be vertically positioned against the rear of the monitor and having the adapter plate attach the same way.  Either way just know if you do plan on mounting this that the screen will end up 2" deeper than it should be.<br/>Build Quality of the frame and stand itself is fantastic. It's all plastic all around, but it doesn't reek of low quality, it definitely feels sturdy.  A 'joystick' on the rear of the display controls the OSD easily and when it is pushed it powers the screen on/off.  If you plan on using the stand, it has a removable panel for cable management but it doesn't look like it will fit more than 3-4 cables max.<br/>Last thing to note about the cables; they are NICE! Samsung stepped up and gave use some very high quality HDMI, and power cabling here make sure you account for the HUGE power brick.  They also included a 2m Thunderbolt 3 cable in which is high quality as well.<br/><br/>Screen Quality-<br/>So I don't have any professional tools but there are calibration results saved from the factory you can look at in the OSD and there is ability to do fine tuning.  Beside my 2018 Macbook Pro the colors have a little bit of a red tint to them but they are very very close, the blacks on this Samsung VA panel are far superior to the macbook's though. It's not perfect, the blue/green colors aren't as well defined on here, but again overall this is a fantastic picture on this panel and the 100hz refresh rate makes web browsing and videos playback very smoothly.<br/><br/>Features-<br/>Part of the reason the 21:9 34+ monitor decision is so difficult is because seeming no one monitor has everything, KVM, 1440p+ resolution, 120+ refresh rate, Speakers (i know they suck but I want them), gsync/freesync, Thunderbolt 3 connectionS.<br/>This Samsung does not have everything indeed, but the TWO TB3 connections (1 85w 1 15w), KVM functionality, and decent 100hz refresh rate sold me on the screen.  I use KVM lightly because this isn't a true KVM, BUT if you are using two machines with TB3 it works fine and you can simply select which machine will have control in the OSD...super easy and a great feature for me as I have the screen connected to my 2018 mac and 2019 Razer Blade 15 and I can switch which gets the KB/Mouse functionality, have the screen split or PIP.<br/><br/>Sound Quality-<br/>Not too much to say here. It gets loud enough to fill a small room, no real base or clean treble but its not the worst things I've ever heard and it's significantly better than 99.99999% of laptop speakers out there. Its acceptable for what it is no more no less.<br/><br/>Gaming -<br/>So being 100hz and coming from my 2019 15" Razer blade's 144hz screen I thought the step down would be very noticeable.  I can definitely tell it's not quite as smooth, but it's still a very smooth gameplay experience.  There is no Free/GSync so that can be a concern, but as a casual gamer while I noticed a difference it wasn't significant and I am happy to sacrifice that by upping the resolution and having a wider FOV (in most games).<br/>Besides the refresh rate, input lag was pretty good and shouldn't affect anyone outside of top pro gamer types.<br/>This kind of brings me to the next topic which isn't so much about the quality of the monitor but an idea of what you might need to run it.....<br/><br/>Horsepower-<br/>So gaming 'rig' wise my Razer Blade 15" has a 2060RTX, i7 8750h hexacore, 16GB DDR4 and a 512GB Samsung NVME.<br/>Two games I've been playing lately are Path of Exiles and Apex Legends here's a very brief breakdown of the frames:<br/>Apex Legends @ 1080p w/RTX 2060----------@3440x1440p<br/>------------------avg ~105-------------------------avg ~80<br/><br/>In apex settings are mostly maxed (no AA), still very playable at this resolution with a 2060 RTX and doesn't dip below 70fps (on mobile 2060 even mind you!)<br/><br/>Path of Exiles @ 1080p w/RTX 2060 -------------------- @ 3440x1440p<br/>------------------avg ~120fps --------------------------------avg ~90fps -------<br/> windows<br/>Not sure why but PoE took a much bigger frame hit going to the higher resolution but still averaged 90fps at native resolution with maxed settings.<br/><br/>So as far as horsepower and today's current games I would say a 1070/2060 would probably be the minimum you would want to have if you plan on gaming at the native res and getting framerates in the 60-100 range on MOST current AAA games.<br/><br/>So other than the design of the VESA mounting bracket I really enjoy this monitor.  It's bright, vibrant and contrasty and plays games smoothly with little to no motion blur.  The speakers are decent and with 2 TB3 ports KVM functionality its a great value @ $800 and below!</span>

<span>Looks great, the stand isn’t strong enough and it wobbles. I have trouble getting the monitor to consistently show my computer screen but I think it’s a setting or computer issue not the monitor.</span>

<span>The Samsung curve monitor arrived in excellent packing and  new condition. After returning an LG from Bestbuy times 3 and then disappointed with Dell monitor's screen (love my screen on my Dell Insperion though). I knew that I was going with a Samsung but almost went with the M1 and thought the curve would be too much. But I never got the chance to find out because I fell in love with the screen quality and slight curve...ordered a second and its been great ever since.</span>

<span>There are tons of reviews, so I'm going to get straight to the point. There were a couple things that were required, and a couple things I wanted in a new monitor. Some context, I work from home and I'm getting my Masters degree online, so I often spend 50-60 hours a week at my computer. I wanted to get a monitor I would be happy with for work and play for several years. I like the ultrawide aspect ratio a lot, so that's what I was looking for primarily. I've now had the monitor for about 4 months.<br/><br/>Required:<br/>- 34+ inches ultrawide<br/>- 75hz+ refresh rate<br/>- 1440p+ resolution<br/>- VESA mounting<br/>- Freesync/G-Sync<br/>- Good build quality/long-lasting<br/>- Curved (upgraded from a flat 34in monitor)<br/>Wanted:<br/>- 144hz+<br/>- Vibrant colors, good contrast<br/>- HDR<br/>- Thunderbolt docking<br/><br/>First off, when I bought this monitor it was on sale for $650. It was a bit more than I wanted to pay, even though that is cheaper than regular price, but I decided to shell out the money because it hit all of my needs and most of my wants (I actually didn't notice that it didn't have HDR until after I bought it but that wasn't a deal breaker). I'll go through them and score them individually using a number of stars.<br/><br/>-34 inch ultrawide (5*) - exactly what I wanted, nothing else to comment.<br/>-Refresh Rate (4*) - 100hz is the best I've ever had and I'm happy with it. More might be better, but I currently don't have a computer that can even handle 100hz all the time when gaming so it doesn't really make much of a difference, however I recognize it might be lacking for some people.<br/>-Resolution (5*) - I just upgraded from a 1080p, and I don't have a fantastic GPU, so again, I'm happy with it for just about everything.<br/>-VESA mount (2*) - Not my favorite. Instead of just putting the mount right on the back like most monitors, this one has an adapter that attaches to the existing adjustable arm. I have this mounted to my own monitor arm. What that means is that there are now 2 pivot points for vertical adjustment on this monitor, one on the monitor itself, and one on the arm. It is functional, but I would much rather just mount right to the back of the monitor instead.<br/>-Freesync (3*) - Freesync doesn't work through the thunderbolt connection, and this was not mentioned anywhere. I could have done my own research to discover that, so I recognize this is partially on me, but it should be made clear and that bugs me that it was not mentioned anywhere.<br/>-Build Quality (4*) - I haven't had any issues with this, it seems to be working fine and not showing any signs of wearing out, but there is a lot of plastic, and I'm not crazy about the mount system. So, it's pretty good, but could be better for this price.<br/>-Curve (5*) - 1500R seems perfect to me. Not too aggressive, very comfortable.<br/>-Colors, contrast (5*) - This is the best screen I've used to be honest. I'm not as picky as some people are, so I'm sure some people will have their complaints, but the screen is amazing in comparison to my old monitor (cheap VA panel). I love the QLED, bright colors, great contrast. I'm happy with this part.<br/>-HDR (1*) - No HDR. This was my fault that I wasn't paying attention though. Still a point against this monitor though.<br/>-TB3 Docking (1*) - I'm not happy with the TB3 docking. This is one of the primary reasons I bought this monitor over others, but it doesn't completely work. I use this monitor on 3 different computers for different things, so I wanted the docking capability (rather than just buying an expensive separate dock) to make my life easier when switching around all the time. Issue 1, no Freesync through TB3. This isn't exactly Samsung's fault, but that needs to be made clear. Issue 2, the TB cable that it comes with does not support daisy-chaining monitors. If you're going to sell a monitor and advertise that it can daisy-chain, then it had better support daisy-chaining out of the box. This was a ripoff to me. I had to buy a separate cable, which aren't exactly cheap. Issue 3, USB plugs in the monitor don't work properly. I have a couple of devices that work, but most don't, so even though it is in USB hub mode and is supposed to be just the TB3 cable I switch between computers (and leave all peripherals connected to the monitor), this doesn't work and I have a separate USB hub that I move around also. I contacted support about this and the only way to do anything about it would be to ship the monitor to a service center where they would keep it for several days/weeks to service it, but I use this monitor 50-60 hours a week. I can't afford to be without it that long.<br/><br/>tl;dr - great quality monitor if you're looking for curve, vibrant colors, lots of space, but don't get it for the docking because it doesn't work as well as it should.</span>
