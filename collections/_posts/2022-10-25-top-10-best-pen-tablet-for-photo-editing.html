<span>Easy to set up, I just followed the instructions and it led me to the website. Even easier from there. Got my code for two years so CSP and I haven’t had any problems!!

<span>I use this mainly to annotate Word documents, using the tools on the "draw" tab in Word. For that, it works well. It has fairly good control to allow me to mark or write where I intend. I would not say that I can make writing look great, or as good as I can with a pen and paper or even with an Apple Pencil on an iPad, but on the documents I am annotating, it is not important to make things look perfect.<br/><br/>I will say that this is not exactly plug-in-play (at least on a Windows machine). When you plug it in, Windows does recognize it and does some setup. But, I did have to go onto Wacom's site to download the setup file and manually run it. Once I did that, it opened a pretty typical setup dialog box and it was very easy from there. You do have to restart your machine halfway through the process, so it is best to close everything besides your browser before you start the setup. Once the setup is complete, it works very well. The pen comes with one nib already inserted and then there are three extra nibs stored in the base of the pen (which screws apart).</span>

<span>I have a huion 22inch display tablet for my desktop and I got this guy for my Mac laptop. It was exactly what I needed, I started off on a small ancient Wacom (3x3) so this was easy to adjust to. The express keys at the top save a lot of time and are easy to set up. I also love how light and easy it is to carry but doesn't feel flimsy. I got the Blutooth version and the charge holds for a very long time even with heavy use. Surprise bonus was the free software! Plus, I love the cute teal color I got it in.<br/><br/>The price is fair but might be steep for a beginner artist, I recommend to wait for a sale or consider other brands— I personally recommend Huion, as XP Pen has a reputation of taking advantage of artists through 'contests' and conventions.  But please feel free to do your own research and come to your own decision.</span>

<span>Wacom is pretty much the go-to company for tablet brands. There are a few other brands out there but they don't have the kind of reputation Wacom does. That doesn't mean they're bad, but it's hard to familiarize yourself with a new brand as far as new expensive hardware goes. This tablet is definitely worth it, but there are a lot of drawbacks that make it seem like it isn't. Much like a computer, if your only alternative is to not have one or be able to use one, then you feel kind of pressured to get it. When I bought this, there were a lot of surprises, some good, some bad.<br/><br/>THE TABLET ITSELF<br/>The physical machine is nice and sturdy. It uses a USB-C to connect, and the USB-C cable detaches from the other end, which is useful if you need to transport it so you don't have to coil the cord around it like some older Intuous tablets. The cable is used not only to plug it into a computer, but also to charge it. So you could plug it into your computer if it doesn't have bluetooth and use it that way, or you could plug it into a USB charging outlet and just juice it up if you're more of a bluetooth person. It does charge while plugged into the computer. It has a physical on/off switch too. Unlike the other smaller Wacom tablets it doesn't use a dongle to connect, but bluetooth. That may or may not be good for you if you have luck with bluetooth or not. It seemed to work on my Surface laptop just fine, but as of right now my desktop doesn't have bluetooth so I have to use it on a wired connection, and it seems to pick that up just fine anyway.<br/><br/>INTERACTION WITH THE COMPUTER<br/>Once you've gotten it plugged into your computer you'll need to spend a bit of time with the drivers to get it to work on your computer. I'm installing it on a Windows 8 desktop. If you are using an older tablet, I would recommend uninstalling the older drivers from the old tablet before installing the newest drivers from the Wacom website. You may not be able to have the old tablet and the new tablet on your computer at the same time. The Wacom drivers don't seem to coexist, and merely default to one section. If that section of drivers doesn't resonate with both tablets you'd be SOL.<br/><br/>DRAWING ON THE TABLET<br/>The pen from my old tablet doesn't work on the new tablet, and vice versa. I wouldn't expect it to, but just so you know. The pen holder also has a tool for removing the nib from the pen in case you want to change it out with a different one. And you'll definitely be doing that because the surface of the tablet by default has an incredibly destructive surface as far as pen nibs go. Every other reviewer has said it and they're not joking. The "marker" texture pen nibs seem to be stronger than the black regular ones, but who wants to feel like they're putting sharpie on cardboard? Normally I wouldn't have a problem with just buying new nibs because they're not so expensive, but this makes drawing difficult. Assuming you draw at an angle and not straight down onto the tablet, your pen will ultimately gain a flat edge to it. If you don't press the flat edge to the surface, the nib could rotate and screw up all of your precision lines, making it not worth having. Some people have said there are more indestructible rubbery pen nibs but I haven't found any that go with this tablet sold on either the Wacom website or on Amazon. There are some for the old tablets, but, y'know...this isn't old. Instead, a lot of people have been taping soft paper to the surface of their tablet and that seems to work for preserving the nibs, as well as the tablet surface, which seems to scuff easily. Not only that but it makes for a more pleasant drawing experience. According to my friends who own Wacom tablets, this works for even really thick flat items, including books and glass. Methinks this is because the pressure sensitivity is sensed not by the tablet but by the pen, so as long as the tablet sniffs the pen and the pen is being pushed down, it works. As for how the tablet seems to power the pen, beats me. Either way I'm going to try that "smooth surface" overlay they sell on the Wacom website, since other people say it's not always easy to get the "new surface" to adhere to the tablet.<br/> - Oh yeah and I can't get the tablet buttons to work. I'm just gonna use a Nintendo Switch Joycon and map it to keyboard shortcuts using XPadder. (If you have one, and you draw, try it; it works so well!)<br/> - One thing I fell in love with was the ability to use the Wacom tablet as a touchpad. The old Wacom tablets came with a mouse that was powered the same way the pen was, by the surface of the tablet itself. This works the same way except imagine it's a giant laptop touchpad and you don't need a mouse! It's compatible with all modern gestures including two-finger-scrolling, zooming, and programmable multi-finger clicking all the way to 11 fingers. You know, in case you have polydactyly. However if your hand tends to interfere with the pad while drawing, you can turn it off using a physical switch on the tablet itself, so no digital crap involved and it works instantly. Turn it back on if you get bored and want to finger on the pad for a while.<br/><br/>FRUSTRATIONS<br/>Now I had a LOT of problems getting this tablet to work at first. I'm not using ancient equipment either. I got so frustrated that I considered returning it. I know that coding drivers is probably a tedious task, and don't expect everything to be perfect all the time, but there are some egregious issues that Wacom doesn't even really want to acknowledge fixing. I spent an entire week sifting through every single topic on every single forum to try and get this thing to work and that was a nightmare. The forums were filled with chaos from people with working tablets whining that the people with not-working tablets were sick of trying to troubleshoot their tablet and just wanted to do some drawing! That's not Wacom's fault per se, but they don't take a proactive role in improving the driver experience for their tablets as well as we'd like them to, given we each paid $300 or more for this thing.<br/> - Initially the precision was unprecedented. You can definitely tell the difference on the new one versus the old one. Then I started to run into problems with the pressure sensitivity. In Photoshop CS6, I couldn't get pressure sensitivity to work properly at all. It would randomly draw thick lines and I couldn't replicate a pattern in the thick lines except for when I let my guard down. In fact to this day, I just stopped using it, and I'm not happy about having to get used to different programs like that. Why create such bloated drivers for your tablets if they aren't compatible with all the different programs out there? The tablet maker says it's the fault of the program despite that it didn't happen with other tablets, and the maker of the program says it's the fault of the tablet maker despite that the tablet works great in all other programs. Then you, the consumer, feel cheated out of your money. When you voice your opinion about it, the internet community at large thinks you're not entitled to voice your concerns. It's been a while since the first week of owning this thing, so I don't remember ALL the troubleshooting steps, but they got pretty bad. And some of them contradicted each other.<br/> - Make sure Windows Ink is off in the Wacom Tablet settings. If it's off, make sure it's on.<br/> - Turn off double-clicking in the Windows pen and/or mouse settings.<br/> - Turn off hold to right click in the pen settings.<br/> - Install the latest drivers, or reinstall the same drivers. Install specific drivers from an earlier generation, but install the old drivers first. Now uninstall the drivers completely and install the latest drivers, even if this is your first time installing drivers, drivers drivers drivers. Blah Blah Drivers Blah Blah Wacom website.<br/> - Enable/disable pressure sensitivity in Photoshop.<br/> - Enable/disable hardware acceleration in Photoshop. And/or enable/disable graphics card usage. (I believe one guy said it best, why pay $300 for a nice graphics card if you can't use it?)<br/> - Try using it on bluetooth instead of a direct wired connection<br/> - Check for Windows updates.<br/> - Disable the tablet buttons<br/> - Try a different nib<br/> - Try a different pen<br/> - Make sure touch controls are off while drawing<br/>Never really fixed Photoshop CS6. But using other programs, works real nice. I'm not so picky, I just like things to work out of the box when they're this expensive. I guess working a tech career should open my eyes to the fact that it'll NEVER be that way.<br/>Anyway, tablet's nice.</span>

<span>Costly, but in this case you definitely get what you pay for. Tilt support on this is amazing in comparison to other brands and even the pen seems to just control better, though that may be more related to the nib than the hardware. I do have a minor complaint about the inability to set multiple precision modes: You can set multiple keys to precision mode, but they all share the same sensitivity setting. A pretty minor issue since you can just zoom in and get the same precision. The bluetooth and ability to toggle between allowing finger touch input are great, although I don't use them much, so I can't speak on the finer details for them.</span>

<span>I want to preface this review by stating that I have never used anything like an actual Cintiq or similar. The closest comparison is my iPad Pro, which I had been using to creating fantasy art digital paintings for a good two years as of this review. My switch to a Wacom Intuous Pro was spurred by the fact that I'm now doing more complex illustrations and I really need the power of desktop Photoshop. Not iPad Photoshop, but he real deal app! I love Procreate, but Photoshop has the true power that I need when working on my drawings.<br/><br/>Yes, you can draw and compose and paint all day long on the iPad Pro with Procreate, but I needed more processing power and, quite frankly, more layers! I previously had a Wacom Intuous 3, like probably 12 years ago or so. I used it back then, but never got into digital painting like I have in the last two years. I have no problems going from using the Apple Pencil which draws directly on the screen vs. using the Wacom Pen 2, down on my desk with myself staring at the screen. In fact, I think there is a slight advantage for me personally because now I no longer have a tendency to hunch over the iPad. It just seems to work for me just fine.<br/><br/>I like to use my Wacom Intuous Pro M in tandem with the Apple Magic TrackPad 2. There are times when I connect via Bluetooth and my Wacom has a lag. I find that if I turn off the trackpad, then turn it back on, the Wacom pen and trackpad work without disrupting the either. I do find that I need to turn off my Magic Mouse entirely however. Yes, I like to work with both the Apple trackpad and mouse, I think it keeps my wrists from going bad and it just keeps my brain guessing, I suppose. You know, using multiple inputs for moving the cursor around and all.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this to anyone, the Wacom Intuos Pro M. I had one of the smaller Intuos, and it was fine, but the Pro has much more sensitivity, thanks to the Wacom Pen 2. The nib does wear down faster than I remember, but it doesn't really bother me. I think the pressure can be adjusted, but I really haven't messed with it. Should beginners use this? I think for the level of control, levels of pressure, it might take away the frustration with using a cheaper tablet. It's like when I was learning to paint traditionally: when I went from student grade paints and brushes to pro grade materials, there really was a difference in how I could manipulate the paints and use a brush that actually held its point.<br/><br/>I imagine working on a Cintiq with Photoshop would be just as awesome or maybe even more. But, I will say that the level of control I feel I have using the Intuos Pro M in Photoshop to draw, sketch, paint is so spot-on, that using the Intuos Pro M will save me hundreds of dollars when compared to a Cintiq.</span>

<span>I bought this to use with GIMP and Blender on my Linux machine and had an awesome experience with it. Wacom doesn't advertise as being penguin-friendly but the Linux kernel has the drivers for it. For both me and a friend of mine, this brand is truly plug and play (Mint and PopOS).<br/><br/>For actual use: You don't need the glove, it won't register input from your skin, you can put your hand right on it but the glove does make it feel smoother dragging your hand around which is nice. If you hover the tip over the pad it moves the cursor, touch down to click, button one is middle mouse, button two is right click. Perfect for controlling the viewport.<br/><br/>Also a super useful feature is being able to set the tablet's rotation/orientation and the ability to switch between relative and absolute cursor position. So in other words the tablet can represent the whole screen or it can work like a laptop trackpad in how it moves the cursor around.<br/><br/>If you're worried about not having shortcut buttons then remember you still have a keyboard for that so that makes this, in my opinion, the best value for a graphics tablet since it's the cheapest medium sized one I could find [for brands I know are Linux compatible].</span>

<span>As someone who has now had this for over two years, I feel like I can give it a somewhat proper review despite only having a couple of small experiences with other (drawing) tablets.<br/>For starters, this tablet overall is fine, but there are a lot of cons surrounding it that have soured my opinion on it within even the first week of this product.  I'll, however, start with the pros:<br/>1.  Cheap, but decent in quality.<br/>To bring up some experiences I've had with other drawing tablets, I've on a couple of occasions used my friend's iPad that was compatible with the Apple Pencil, to which I can say that the screen on the Wacom One is rougher and matte (kind of like paper, but much smoother feeling), which is ideal for less glaring on the screen (unlike the iPad).  It's simple, it has a decent stylus that is both wireless and doesn't need to charge, the corners are smooth, the built-in stand is about 2-3 inches high and holds the screen decently at a downwards incline toward you (unless you use it backwards like the chaotic person you aim to be).<br/>2.  Comes with some free test-trial products<br/>I never used them and have long forgotten about 'em, but a free bonus is a free bonus— and my Asian heart eats that up and requires me to list it.<br/>3.  Comes with Wacom Benefits<br/>I'm sure other tablets will come with a certain program to install that allows adjustments to be made for both the screen and the stylus, but it's still worth listing as the program Wacom uses is simple enough to use, but I do still get confused about options relating to the stylus and pressure (because the program gives you an option to have automatically varied pressures 'n whatnot to be set for different programs on your computer (i.e. Clip Studio vs just on your Browser)).<br/><br/>Now, the reasons as to why I really regret this purchase:<br/>1.  Lack of Research (on my end)<br/>I am at fault for this, but I do strongly implore others to thoroughly research the best tablet for YOU.  There are much cheaper options from 'lesser' brands that are often recommended for good reason;  they're cheaper, and a lot of that is because it just ain't from Wacom.  I now look back at such great deals for tablets with larger screens, the same benefits as this one, buttons on the side of the tablet, and a more robust stylus (that does likely require charging, but I'm just clumsy and lazy).  PLEASE do your lengthy research!<br/>2.  The Quality<br/>I did somewhat command the quality, but that's because it isn't a flimsy product and has lasted me this long with no needed replacements so far.  But, and a BIG but, is that I hate the execution of it all.  For one, the wires;  they make my laptop setup messier that it already was because of how inconsiderate everything was made.  The HDMI is on the left, the USB on the right whilst branching off to the outlet.  Did I also mention that these wires— while still being two wires as they acknowledge the fact that not everyone owns a PC with a comfortable layout for plugs— is connected by a bulky square in order for it to be one plug only (despite the plug taking up the space of two outlets anyways).  It's bulky, but that doesn't mean that it's sturdy, as— guess what?  It's stiff and hard to bend while also being put in a situation where most laptops will require the wires to bend around (unless you used an adapter (which I tried for multiple varying adapters, but the wires are so picky that the tablet either won't detect the laptop and therefore won't turn on OR the tablet is a blank screen).  The wires have also opposed a BIG problem within the first week that has lasted to this day:  It glitches out the screen.  Due to whatever factors I just listed, within the first week did I already encounter issues with the screen quickly flashing black to then come back.  I evaluated a bit, and not only is the wire just bad quality for what it is supposed to do, the PORT connecting the tablet to the computer isn't secure for the plug, and it feels flimsy and therefore often disconnects from simple movement of the wire or screen or even just pressure on the screen (like from drawing.  On a DRAWING tablet.  Made by a brand known for DRAWING TABLETS).  On top of that, over time, sometimes the screen would reconnect and be shown with RGB colors as if all glitched out, so I then have to wiggle the wire into the port again multiple times to get my actual screen and its colors back to normal.<br/>3.  HDMI issues<br/>If you wanted to try using the tablet with your phone, it's possible, and I can attest to that;  however, the wires and everything are just so finicky that it took me 3 different adapters to get it to work, and not for the reasons you may assume.  The tablet always properly connected (indicated by the tablet being able to be turned on at all), but the screen would either never turn on or just show the error of not being able to read the device.  For starters, I believe that you unfortunately need to access the driver prior to any phone usage (which I didn't know until researching about it a lot after getting the tablet since there was no actual information prior at the time of my purchase).  Secondly, I forget how, but I did find a workaround since I didn't have a laptop or any computer at the time, and the problems with the screen persisted with EVERY DEVICE until I did some inconsistently varied means (amongst trying different adapters, slots, etc.).<br/><br/>So, yeah, I kind of hate this thing, so thanks past me for being dumb and buying this for me on sale for my own birthday.<br/><br/>EDIT:  Wow, I think I jinxed myself since— despite my initial thoughts of its durability— my screen now has small glitch-like marks on the top right somehow.  They're very small and barely noticeable, mind you, but I notice it and it's a downer.</span>

<span>I was deciding whether or not to dive into the world of iPad based on the portability and recommendations for Procreate, but since I have zero other Apple products and planned to use it for only art and learning digital, I decided to go for the Cintiq 16 even though that would mean limited portability. I'll just have to take my laptop with me if I travel with it. I've tried other Tablets before - I have a Huion 1060 and an old Wacom Bamboo tablet, but coming from traditional media, I had a difficult time adjusting to not viewing my work right under my hand. I'm actually excited and enjoying jumping back into learning digital art now that I can focus on the screen that I'm drawing on!<br/><br/>I experienced the "No Signal" issue at first and was immediately freaked out, but it turns out I was so excited that I didn't pay attention when I plugged the HDMI cable into my motherboard instead of my GPU (lol). Just a little bit of fiddling with my monitor setup and I had software running after a few mins on its own screen.<br/><br/>I was able to register the device with Wacom and got the free trial for Clip Studio Paint, which is AMAZING. I am so overwhelmed with the capabilities - I was used to playing around in Autodesk Sketchbook, so it was a bit of shock and it's going to take some time to learn the ins-and-outs.<br/><br/>Absolutely loving it so far!!</span>

<span> I am an illustrator and animator (@inkshift) with over 14 years of experience working for Disney &amp; Cartoon Network here in Portland, OR. I've also been a Wacom user for over 20 years, so let me open this review by saying they really knocked it out of the park with this new Cintiq 22.<br/><br/>This is also my 4th Cintiq, so you judge for yourself if i have a problem or not ;) I have the 27” pro at my office as well as the new 16 and a super old 12” in addition to a handful of tablets dating all the way back to the late 90s.<br/><br/>This Cintiq 22 is part of their new line of more affordable Cintiqs Wacom started rolling out this year and it really seems to be the golden mean between the smaller 16 and the larger Pros. Full disclosure: Wacom DID provide me this unit for review purposes but I hereby solemnly swear all views in this review are entirely my own and 100% my own opinions.<br/><br/>First off: the pressure sensitivity is beautiful and virtually indistinguishable from my 27” pro, which cost over twice as much.  As you can see in the attached timelapse of an illustration I did on this 22, each line came out exactly like I wanted it: smooth tapers, no shaky lines, no blotches, weird unintended textures or weird ends to my strokes.<br/>The included Pro Pen 2 is a solid, comfortable pen and really helps you feel the 8192 levels of pressure. You can also the new Pro Pen slim if you want a sleeker pen but i prefer the stubbier feel.<br/><br/>Secondly, the overall build quality and polish impresses, it is very solid and the design is professional and clean. Small detail but important to me: the power button is easily pushed and feels pleasant and responsive.<br/>The entire machine feels very sturdy while not being too heavy. I kind of wish they brought back the side buttons they had on the 12” and 21” but I can see how it makes sense ergonomically and aesthestically to leave those off.  It should be noted that this 22” doesn’t come with a remote or a bluetooth keyboard, which is not a deal breaker for me because my 27” came with the remote and I never use it.<br/><br/>It DOES however come with a fantastic, preattached stand!  The new stand is sturdy, stable, lightweight, solid metal with non-slip rubber grippy feet, easy to use and highly flexible. Wacom REALLY came through for its users with the stand this time, as I have not been a fan of the stands of the past: they’re either huge, expensive, cumbersome and awkward to operate or they just have the little fold out legs, which are simply insufficient for long term use and you’d need to invest in an extendable arm that can keep your Cintiq suspended/supported.<br/><br/>One difference between the pro line and this newer, more affordable line is that these units do not have a bonded glass display. THis means that there’s a tiny bit of space between the pen and the screen and that generally means there is more parallax (the offset between the cursor and the pen), but it was not noticeable to me once I calibrated it properly. The screen has an anti-glare surface which feels nice and smooth, not slick or slippery at all with just the right amount of texture to it.<br/><br/>Another difference between this 22 and the pro line is the Adobe RGB colour range. This Cintiq sports a 72% Adobe RGB vs a 97% for the pro line, but I don’t think you will be disappointed (or honestly really notice? I didn’t) unless you’re super tuned into colour and colour correction or need the most accurate representation possible. But at that point, you should probably be investing in the pro line.<br/><br/>Like I said, I also have the new 16 which is also great but felt a bit small to me and became cumbersome very quickly for when I needed a number of palettes/windows open. At 22”, (21.5” viewable), that is is not a problem here at all.<br/><br/>Wacom has paid great attention to detail in packaging as well as the attached power cords: it includes a British power plug free of charge, as well as 2 different orientations of power cords: horizontal and vertical. As you can see in my unboxing clip, I’m a little surprised by the amount of power cables at first glance but upon further inspection it all makes sense.<br/>Setup was very easy: 3 cables as seen in the picture. The HDMI cable is a welcome addition compared to the 3-in-1 cables, which are a bit messy, cumbersome and require complete replacement should ONE of them have an issue.<br/><br/>Things to note!<br/>I didn’t bother adjusting the pressure curve settings because they were great out of the box, but I did change the click speed and I also deactivated Windows Ink (I use windows 10). I don’t understand what Windows ink is for but all it seems to do to me is make you unable to drag/select text in input fields.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>All in all, this is a beautiful and affordable piece of equipment. It is technically part of their ‘budget’ line but there is nothing budget about the size or the quality of this device. The size, design and build quality exude class and quality and the pen and pressure sensitivity are best in class.<br/>While the unit is not small, it strikes a perfect balance between spacious and compact. It doesn’t take over your whole desk like my larger units nor does it break the bank at $1200.  I would definitely recommend this to the professional on a budget or a very lucky/forward thinking student or hobbyist.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Buttery smooth &amp; responsive pressure sensitivity<br/>- Smooth but not slick anti-glare surface<br/>- Solid build quality and professional look &amp; feel<br/>- Comes with a sturdy, stable and flexible stand<br/>- Great size with room for longer strokes and all the palettes/windows you may need open<br/>- Stays cool even when working on it all day<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- “Only” full HD (1920 x 1080) vs the 4k of newer models but I have the 4k model as well and I haven’t been bothered<br/>  by any potential pixelation. All my illustrations are all made at 600 Dpi and I haven't noticed any problems.<br/>- Mine had 1 dead pixel but I only notice it when I look for it. I streamed a commission earlier today in my<br/>  Inkshift Facebook group and didn't notice it once.</span>

<span>My background: I'm a traditional and digital artist and graphic designer with ten years' worth of off and on experience with traditional Wacom tablets, most recently the Intuos 3 Pro.<br/><br/>Pros: This thing works exactly the way I wanted it to. My struggle before was the hand/eye coordination involved with drawing on one thing and looking at another. The Cintiq closed that gap the way I was hoping! Once you calibrate the pen, you won't notice the parallax. There's the tiniest delay between pen input and output, but after you get used to it, it's just not an issue. The pen works great and the pressure sensitivity is exceptional — no weird glitches or blobs the way my old tablet would sometimes do. The built in stand is super sturdy and useful. And I'm finding that the 16 screen width is actually plenty of space for the kind of hobby art I want to create — and the trade off for the slimmer profile of the smaller size is actually preferable to me. It's also relatively plug and play: just download the driver from the website like the booklet says. No issues getting it all to work on a Mac, so they must have fixed that connection problem some other reviewers mentioned.<br/><br/>The cons: There's no gesture support, and it would be nice to just have pinch to zoom at my disposal, but I knew going into this what I was buying and I can live without that for the price point. I have only two real complaints. The first is that the color accuracy is actually noticable when you check against a MacBook Pro screen. I guess this can be managed by having your monitor close by, but it can be a bit of a pain to keep checking when you're doing digital paintings. But it's not the end of the world for my particular use. The second issue I have is with the cords. The power cord is three pieces long if you include the three-in-one, and it's obnoxiously inflexible. And if you want to use this with something like a MacBook Pro that only has USB-C, you may need to get a couple of adapters for the Cintiq and your external monitor in order to accommodate two HDMI cables. I was fortunate to have one on hand, as well as a USB to USB-C, or I wouldn't have even been able to test this out upon receipt of the product.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're a budget-conscious artist and you want to make the leap from traditional to screen tablets, you can't go wrong with this one.</span>

<span>please please please make sure your laptop or pc has an HDMI port, this will not work unless you can plug in the HDMI cable along with the USB cable.  My newer laptop does not have an HDMI port and I tried using an HDMI/USB converter (this does not work).<br/><br/>i tried using it on my older laptop with the HDMI port and it works beautifully.  I am AMAZED by the pen control and sensitivity.  I tested it out on some older drawings and I'm really excited to start really digging into my art with this new tablet.<br/><br/>please note this device is basicallyyyy like a 2nd monitor you can draw on, and NOT a pc device in its own right (like an ipad or pc tablet).  That being said, once you get it plugged in right you are good to go, no color calibrations needed.  The colors are true and you can just open your art program of choice on your laptop or pc and just draw.</span>

<span>The second generation of the MSP is great, noticeably brighter screen and faster. I had the MSP 16 first generation and it was just a bit to big to practically be portable (personal preference) so I went with the MSP 13 for the second generation.<br/>Wacom advertises both the SSD and RAM are user upgradable however on the MSP 13 there is only one RAM slot while on the MSP 16 there are two (one is empty). All the advertising you’ll see doesn’t mention the 13 only has one slot. The only place you’ll find it is in the deep tech specs on the Wacom site.</span>

<span><br/>I’ll premise this with I’ve used Wacom products since the early 2000’s and have experience using a variety of products.<br/><br/>Mobile studio pro is great for people who want a break from a desk and sit on the couch or anywhere :)<br/><br/>I am a professional artist in the arts industry and having the ability to sit on the couch comfortably without sacrificing the art, is a huge plus.<br/><br/>I use photoshop mainly and I’m able to run full program without any lag. It has a small side fan to allow it to run properly. It’s also about 3lbs and about half an inch in terms of thickness so it’s not crazy heavy! You can also work on it without it being plugged in to the charger. Battery life runs just as long as any laptop computer that’s been unplugged. It also comes with a detachable stand you can adjust at various angles. I personally like to prop it on my lap while watching tv on the couch!<br/><br/>I’m primarily an iOS user, so using a windows based machine took a second to get used to but nothing complicated. Downloading anything was easy and no issues. If anything,<br/>tech support is easily accessible through their website or social media- theyre there to help!<br/>It also has side ports in case you want to plug in a mouse or hard drives, etc. You can hook up Bluetooth keyboard if you wanted but it also has a on-screen keyboard you can use. So I haven’t had the need to use one yet.<br/><br/>The screen doesn’t have a glare, and mimics the same surface as a cintiq. I also own a cintiq and works the same as mobile studio pro. Pressure sensitivity is also the same and zero lag. I like the mobile studio pro because it allows me to run full photoshop without having to sacrifice any tools.<br/><br/>In comparison to an iPad, I’d say you’re able to create completed pieces using all the tools because it is essentially a full computer- how cool is that?? On iPad, I can’t run photoshop using all the tools or have the extra buttons on the pen. Mobile studio pro pen has the buttons so you can use your favorite shortcuts. I use it to change in between tools.<br/><br/>I’m also left handed and I am able to rotate the mobile studio pro to make the buttons be on the other side. Right now, I have it defaulted on the left, but I can switch it at ease if I need it to. I was worried resting my hand was going to recognize it on the screen, but it doesn’t! It recognizes the pen allowing me to draw normal as I would on a cintiq.<br/><br/>The pen also comes with different pen nibs. I personally like the felt tip but the default one is just as great because the screen has a matte screen allowing you to get that paper feel. If anything, you can just compare it to any cintiq if you’ve used one before!<br/><br/>The 13” screen size is perfect for me. I was worried it would make buttons small, but they’re at a normal size and easy to see. Installing brushes and any other tools was pretty simple. Same process as I would do it on any machine.<br/><br/>I have to say, being a Wacom user since I was a young teen, it’s really amazing to see how far they’ve come with all their products throughout all these years. They continue to impress me.<br/><br/>I rate this 5 stars because I’m able to create full pieces without having to miss any tools, being portable, and working at full speed.<br/>I would recommend this to artists who are looking to take a break from their desk, sit on the couch, and have fun creating art! :)</span>

The package arrived just in time for a presentation that I was about to begin in Teams. Used it for highlighting my PowerPoint and with the MS Whiteboard. Beats trying to draw with my mouse. It was nice to have the extra glove and a USB A to USB C adapter as well.</span>
