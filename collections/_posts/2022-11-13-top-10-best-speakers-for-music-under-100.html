<span>I've bought many Logitech speakers, some around $200. NONE of them lasted. All of them used RCA connections. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! It's outdated tech and has ALWAYS failed on my speakers and my guitar,  and the internals on their RCA connection speakers are garbage. Most died in almost exactly 91 days. If I didn't know better I would say they were designed to fail exactly after the particular store's return period. But Logitech has always replaced them, even the one I bought off of Ebay from a personal seller! Same thing for one of their mice. Ebay again! LOL But to have such expensive speaker systems fail again and again made me sick to my stomach.<br/><br/>Solid sound, too. I've bought many Logitech speakers, some around $200 or more. NONE of them lasted. All of them used RCA connections. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! It's kind of outdated tech and they have ALWAYS failed on my speakers and even on my expensive guitar. It's probably the internals on their RCA connection speakers. Most died righ tafter 90 days of usage. But to have such expensive speaker systems fail again and again made me very wary of the hardware they make and I made it a rule never to buy anything remotely expensive of theirs ever again.<br/><br/>If I didn't know better I would say they were designed to fail exactly after the usual return period found on most online stores (now its 30 days everywhere you look, not Logitech's fault). But Logitech has always replaced them, even the speakers I bought off of Ebay from a private seller! Same thing for one of their mice. Ebay again! LOL Their support has always been that good.<br/><br/>I didn't want to spend much on ANYTHING Logitech makes anymore, so I bought the Z313 for a Whopping $35.39 with tax. 4 entire years have passed and they are still good as new! Probably because the speakers don't use RCA connections. :p Now they cost $60! Are you kidding me?! They can blame the pandemic, the supply chain, etc., but these are ALWAYS in stock no matter where I have shopped for them. I don't think there is any excuse for this pricing on 2.1 speakers that came out 13 years ago.<br/><br/>I really wanted an extra set of speakers for my other room, but this just costs too much for what they are. So one star off for the pricing.</span>

<span>These speakers are nice. I like that they have a lower center of mass. makes it hard to knock them over. The bass is nice, not overpowering though, nice and subtle just like it should be. I like it, 5 stars</span>

<span>Overall for the price-point this is a great bluetooth speaker. But where it makes up for in price, it lacks in sound quality.  Specifically the sound is seemingly driven by two small speakers that lack bass depth and top-end volume in comparison to other &lt;$100 products.</span>

<span>The first time I used this device and powered it on, the volume came on super loud. I was able to figure out how to turn the volume down (press and hold the "Previous" button) and comfortably listen to the device. Next time I turned it on, same thing: the volume was max'd out. I thought jeez, I must have been partying or listening to a song that had really low volume and turned it up a lot. Wrong: I found out today from the company that this is the way the device was designed! So this means your speaker and battery are going to have a shorter life than they otherwise would have.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a possible work-around would have been to power-up the device without the USB thumb drive plugged in, but apparently you cannot even turn the volume down without the USB drive plugged in! Ears blown out again (I still have a headache from the experience).<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is a very flawed design and I am amazing Pyle has not fixed such a serious problem.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>BOTTOM LINE: Decent, clean sound from a compact sized speaker. However... beware of teeny-tiny control buttons / user interface area; fumble-fingered folks and those with large hands could find using this thing a challenge. Another minus is that when you turn it on the volume is automatically set at max. Worst offense: internal rechargeable battery died in less than 6 months. In the end, if I had it to do over again I would've kept looking and spent a few more bucks and bought something a little more user-friendly, without some of the poor built-in choices this Pyle PBMSQG9 speaker is saddled with. So... 1 STARS.<br/><br/>THOUGHTS: I've been doing some remodel work in my basement and enjoy listening to music while I'm down there. I have an ancient Sony boombox but was sick of the seemingly endless commercials on the radio and sadly my old cassette tapes are on their last legs. I knew I wanted something that could play tunes off of a USB stick and I didn't want to pay an arm &amp; a leg; something compact with decent sound. I looked at a LOT of various units from several manufacturers. This one from Pyle *seemed* like a solid overall choice.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: It checked off all the boxes on my 'must-have' list and the large rubbery wraparound bands/feet at each end keep the speaker in place and take a fair amount of bumping and punishment. The ability to recharge the battery from a USB port is a nice touch.<br/><br/>THE NOT SO GOOD: You can't leave this thing plugged in or you risk cooking the rechargeable internal battery. I don't know if it's replaceable and even if it is, it's probably not cheap so you have to unplug it as soon as it's done charging or...  very annoying. Entry-level pricing means simplicity... to a fault: the tiny controls are jammed into a space literally smaller than a matchbook cover. 2 buttons (&lt;&lt;/&gt;&gt;) do most of the selection work; you have to toggle or doubletap them to change song selection &amp; volume. That's a major pain, but whatta ya expect for $30?<br/><br/>THE BAD:  When you turn this thing on the volume is automatically set at the MAX level. Whichever engineer or marketing genius thought that this would be a good idea should be repeatedly kicked in the nuts. I haven't tried any of the wireless/Bluetooth features yet, so I cannot comment on those. Others who have can give you the straight poop on those.<br/><br/>THE UGLY: After less than 6 months of infrequent use totaling less than a dozen recharges, the internal battery has DIED!  I am not about to spend the $$$ money to replace it (if it can be), so this cheap junk speaker has regrettably been pitched in the garbage. Why ANY company would not set it up to have a choice of either running off a 110v plug-in outlet OR using the internal battery is beyond me. With a full-charge runtime of only 8 hrs, it's ridiculous to force the user to have to turn it off and fully re-charge before using it again, instead of just plugging it in. And it should be able to play *while re-charging* too! Other portable/rechargeable speakers out there do, so there is absolutely zero excuse from Pyle. Very serious design flaws, IMHO, regardless of whether it's an entry-level unit or a top-of-the-line model. I might as well have driven down the road and thrown my $30 out the window. Very, very disappointed! This was my first Pyle purchase and I can guarantee you that it was my LAST. As for as I am concerned, "Pyle" stands for "pile of sh_t." Potential buyers BEWARE!!! Just pony up a little more cash and buy yourself something with more intelligent options and better user flexibility for your hard-earned $$$. :-(</span>

<span>SO i got this thing for my wife who does massages, her old stero was a cd player that would only inspire comfort and relaxation in people if you beat them over the head with it. Got the package in charged it up and wanted to test out the battery life and sound quality. Turned it on placed it in the room at about medium volume the sound was clean, crisp, and clear. Went down stairs to fold some laundry and maybe play some ESO had some people to shank. Went back into the room to check on it only to find the dogs, cats, and wife all passed out taking a nap. ( lazy bums). Took it outside and turned it up and could hear it clearly without distortion. Instructions could be a little better though.</span>

The desktop studio monitor clamp-on stand pair by Gator Frameworks supports most small-sized studio monitors in both vertical and horizontal orientations to improve speaker performance during playback and mixing. The GFWSPKSTMNDSKCMP functions by separating and elevating speakers from your desktop surface, giving you a more isolated audio response for improved accuracy during studio monitoring. Easily adjust and lock the stand height from 10. 5” to 14” and speaker tilt angle from 0 to 15 degrees for preferred positioning. The stand clamps to desktop surfaces up to 2. 25” in thickness to free up space on your workstation table and will hold a max load of 60 lbs. In addition to studio monitors, the multipurpose top deck platform works great for MacBook Air/Pro models and will fit similar-sized laptops.

<span>I jumped on a sale on these Amazon had, and I'm so glad I did. We're using Auralex foam risers on the stand platforms, underneath Kali LP-6 v2 monitors for the DAW.....these stands do the job well and, with the Auralex for further decoupling, really allow the Kali's to sing. I'm pretty impressed. There were no missing parts, or anything wrong with the stands I received; and they adjust beautifully. They will also easily handle monitors bigger than the aforementioned Kali's we have.</span>

<span>Are you looking for some clamp-on studio monitor stands to free up some desktop space? Your search is over, just buy these!<br/><br/>- They are *incredibly* well built and rock-solid!

Height, rotation, angle/tilt - they move in every way you need to get your speakers in just the right place, and then they'll stay there.<br/>- They have a soft rubber-like coating on the top of the plate, so your gear and/or vibration mats stay in place -- even at a slight downward tilt like mine.<br/>- They're easy to assemble. It took me about 2 minutes to attach the plates to the stands and clamp them to my desk.</span>

<span>We have Bose speakers in our home and value good sound. Honestly, I didn’t expect much from this unit, sound wise, but My daughter really wanted a Juke box for her birthday so after reading numerous reviews, I bought her this one.  She absolutely loved it, it looks great and it sounds great too!  I’m very impressed with the sound quality.<br/><br/>We had some technical issues after about a month and I contacted the company through email. They responded very quickly and resolved our issue right away. I highly recommend buying from this particular company, their customer service is outstanding!</span>

<span>It is advertised as wood But I think it is all plastic. It sounds pretty good. A little disappointed in the size For the money. After 2-3 days it sounds like it is not getting full Bluetooth signal. It sounds like it is skipping and the music is fading away. It goes low then comes back up.</span>

<span>My wife and I like the look of these speakers. We just used them for an outdoor movie night with our boys. The poles are made of plastic and broke easily when trying to push the stake into the ground. Put the stake in first and then attach the poles to avoid breaking them. I’m going to Lowe’s and getting some metal pipe cut because we like the speakers, but can’t abide with the cheap plastic poles. Even if they were replaced, I still wouldn’t want them.<br/><br/>Sound was a little muted at first. However, that appeared to be more about the projector sending the signal over BT than the speakers themselves. I connected the speakers directly to my phone and they sounded great.</span>

<span>Initially thought these were perfect except you can’t have them too far apart. However after only a few months, one will not charge at all. A shame really as we did like them. Not worth the cost to have only one working after such a short timeframe.</span>

<span>These speakers are perfect for outdoor get togethers or a party where you need some music and a little tropical ambiance.  I placed them outside around my pool and the flickering "flames" of the speakers look amazing at night while playing music.  Surprisingly the flames look very realistic and i got several compliments on them.  The speakers themselves sound really good and don't play music individually, instead they actually sync up together giving you wireless stereo sound.  Once setup - you have the option of turning the flames on or off which i found useful for maximizing the battery when I was wanting longer music sessions.  Using them was very simple, I just had to connect to them through bluetooth using my phone and they immediately wake up and start playing music.  All in all a fun way to spice up your patio or back yard with some music and mood.</span>

<span> This speaker is simply beautiful.  The flickering light replicates a tiki torch without the danger of my kids getting burned or knocking it over.  I’m so pleased with the sound and the whole ambiance of this.  I’m definitely going to order a few more to create a backyard oasis because I love to sit outside in the summer evenings.  It’s very calming.  Setup is super simple.  You literally take it out of the box, charge it up with the usb cord provided (no block) and then pop the pole together and twist it on the pole.  Touch buttons at the top easily turn it on and off, turn the flickering light on or off and volume up and down.  Bluetooth pairing takes seconds.  I haven’t used it at full volume yet because I’m trying not to disturb my neighbors too much but it can definitely play loud. I can just imagine how cool it will be when I add more to pair up and create surround sound!  Honestly, get one for yourself.  You won’t regret it!</span>
