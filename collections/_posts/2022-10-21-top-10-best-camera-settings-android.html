<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Getting the camera to connect to the WiFi took some experimentation. If you have a 2.4/5 GHz router you must use only the 2.4GHz band. To do this I finally connected to the camera with Ethernet directly to the router and manually selected the 2.4GHz channel and then entered the WiFi password for the router manually. The audio based communication to enable wireless via the smart phone to the camera didn't work, I believe due my router defaulting to 5GHz, which they do tell you in the instructions won't work so definitely read the instructions.. The pan/tilt/zoom functions are as expected and even though it's digital zoom it works nicely for me in my application to watch the dog while we're out.  The mic and speaker provide intelligible speech both ways. Once wireless was enabled I was able to take the camera to anywhere in the house and use it. I might get another one to do additional surveillance. The app (I have Android) was easy to install, had no hiccups along the way and functions very intuitively. BTW I am writing this review on the day I did the install so it's still pretty fresh in my mind.  If you write a review they'll send you 16GB micro SD card which just pops into the back base section of the camera.  The mounting 'stand' was essential for how I mounted it and I thought it was well engineered as it works in either vertical or horizontal orientations. They also provide an Ethernet cable so you don't have to go scrounging for one. I would have given 5 stars across the board if the camera worked on both bands and also the speaker audio while perfectly intelligible sounds a little tinny which I guess is to be expected given the small size of the thing.</span>

<span>I used this product to check in on my pets.  What I like about it is that you can rotate up or down or to the sides so this makes it very useful.  I also like that you can record and speak through it.  I have since moved it to my front window because someone kept turning off my Xmas lights.  It has helped me resolve some issues in my condo complex.  A good surveillance product.</span>

<span>Camera is very easy to set up and link to your cell phone. Gives great picture easy to use. A very easy way to keep an eye out around the house, your pets, your children. Only downfall is this company tries to get you to give a good review by offering you an SD card for free. You do have to jump through a bunch of Hoops just trying to download and give verification that you made a review and have to email them. It's not even worth the time for a 16 gig SD card.</span>

<span>The camera works well, and I like the fact that you can control it over the Internet, rotating, tilting and zooming the view. The WiFi setup with the sound didn't work for me, but it connected fine with the Ethernet cable, and I was able to set up the WiFi that way instead. I can't get the motion detection to work reliably without a ton of false errors though.</span>

With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<span>I like these little cameras!  Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below).  Real time live video is important to me for various reasons.  For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.<br/><br/>These cameras are small and light.  The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting.  Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.<br/><br/>The app is so-so..  it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked.  For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings.  To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline..  it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead.  I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain.  You have to guess where to look for things.<br/><br/>For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events.  Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.<br/><br/>Speaking of recording events only to your SD card:  SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings.  If you choose "events only" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops.  This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information.  I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook.  The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.<br/><br/>The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events.  It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone.  When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good.  It is slightly better indoors.  I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera.  (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that.  The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).<br/><br/>For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio.  Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced.  As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.<br/><br/>Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons.  This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.<br/>I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all.  You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings.  I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet.  No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.<br/><br/>1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017.  They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years.  They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal).  The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed.  (My network is not the issue.)  It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise.  I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards.  No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.<br/><br/>3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc.  Priced around what wyze cameras cost.  As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house.  Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them.  That feature does work and is actually really nice.  Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.<br/><br/>4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit.  These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point.  The cameras seem really solid and well made.  I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked.  Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay.  For the price, they would have had to be perfect.<br/><br/>5. Eufy Solo  IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more.  I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster.  I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras.  Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion.  Audio quality was really good with these.  But the delay was a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>The End.  I applaud you if you got this far!</span>

<span>The Wyze team are killing it with this one.  Their low cost products have always been a good draw.  My prior Wyze camera was the pan camera - good price for one that I could make spin around and look up and down.  I bought two v3 to get my side yards.<br/><br/>My primary cameras are nest...traditionally seemed to be the top of the line for this new generation of cloud based IP cameras - highest quality but highest cost.  But at least with the nest app I felt I was getting what i paid for.  Now those guys at Google made their new cameras not work with their own nest app, only the Google Home, which is crazy to me.  The Google Home currently doesn't let you see the *entire* 24 hour history within your subscription time frame, which was always a key distinguisher from Ring and other IP cameras - only highlights!  I had ordered a 2 pack of their new cameras  on Prime Day but then did some more reading and found out about the lack of nest app support, and found my existing nest cams could not access more than highlights/alerts in Google Home app, and decided that was just not going to be good enough.  I want to be able to look through the entire feed in case an alert didn't catch everything.<br/><br/>Then I decided to look at Wyze - I'd read their emails and was interested in their skylight night color and decided I would 'try' their $35 camera instead of the nest $120 camera.  After all, the new v3 is outdoor rated, has great night vision and has a lower cost, can install SD cards for onboard extended feed coverage (not just alerts) and I'm already using the Wyze app for my two pan cameras so I'm already in the ecosystem in my Google Home.  So I ordered 2 Wyze v3 cameras.<br/><br/>Installation - First, even the box is small...reminded me of the Blink camera size.  I ordered SD cards for the v3 cams to give me that very long look-back ability (very cheap for the sizes needed).  When I went to install I realized the USB cable/power line was thin - and I was able to run it inside my window track so as to NOT DRILL into my siding (because lets face it, eventually i may change to something different and who wants to put holes in their siding).  Unfortunately I did have to poke the cable through the screen b/c my screen didn't slide up/down.  Like I said, the camera is very small and light, so when I mounted I only needed one small screw (provided with kit) to hold it in place.  There was a magnet ring around screw area, and that could have helped with the mount, but I didn't use it.  The camera has left right and up down hinges so I was able to point it in the place I wanted to.<br/><br/>Performance - I am happy with the camera's performance.  Its 1080p.  One camera is on side with street light, and that area stays color lit with the starlight feature and yes can see pretty well.  The other camera is in more shaded part and uses the gray IR feed, and yes I can see what's going on there pretty well.  Unfortunately I don't think any of these cameras can "zoom" in and really see someone's face or a license plate, but that's just a limit they all have if you don't have a mechanical zoom presumably like the traditional fully wired camera security systems.  But I'd say the picture quality is on par with my $350 nest outdoor v2 IQ camera.  I haven't tried the higher level wyze plans with their version of person recognition, so can't comment on the facial recognition aspect, but I'm totally fine with losing that one feature when everything else has the $35 camera totally pacing the $350 camera.  What a value difference and its crazy the quality you get for this price point.  Wyze is really a super top level choice in the budget to mid-level home camera market.  Extremely happy.</span>

<span> EDIT: I uploaded a video of the camera's sound quality in action, so if you view the video turn on your sound BUT KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN (initially). No need for bleeding ears.<br/><br/>During the Wyze portions of the video I was sitting roughly 20 feet away and six feet below the camera; There should be no feedback at that distance.<br/><br/>During the iPhone portion (where I filmed the same space as the one the V3 is normally set up to film) I was roughly six feet away and six feet below the camera. The point was to capture the same sounds in the same room.<br/><br/>All the videos were taken very early in the morning, with no traffic or human noise outside, and with what I'd call regular ambient interior noise (the humming of appliances, the running of a computer in the vicinity, etc). No other people were present to make noise inside.<br/><br/>The first portion of the video is the sound that the V3 produces when I am viewing the live feed. It was screen-captured with my iPhone.<br/><br/>The second portion is a comparison demonstrating the sound my iPhone picks up in the same general space, at the same general time, in the exact same conditions, and with the exact same ambient noise in the background as in the first portion; This is not to show how much better the iPhone's mic is than the Wyze (obviously it's better) but to give you an idea as to what noise and sounds were actually present in the room while I was viewing the V3's live feed of the same room, and capturing it with my phone camera.<br/><br/>The third portion is the same space with the same ambient noise, plus conversation from the television that is eight feet from the V3. I chose a scene that sounds a lot like regular conversation, set it to conversation volume, and it has some light score that comes in at the end.<br/><br/>The final portion is what my iPhone picked up in the same space during the same time and conditions, and while playing the exact same scene/conversation on the TV at the same volume as while capturing it on the V3. If you listen VERY carefully you MIGHT be able to pick up a word or two in the V3's video that you can compare to the iPhone's. Maybe. It took me three tries. Hint: listen for the word "Garrett".  Hope the video helps you make a more informed purchasing decision!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Picture is ok. Night vision/low light is very good. Motion detection is spot-on. The camera looks good, design-wise.<br/><br/>Why the one star?<br/><br/>Because that's where the good ends.<br/><br/>The problem is the mic/sound quality is appalling bad. That's such an old, tried-and-true tech I have no idea how they managed to bungle it so much, but managed they did.<br/><br/>Maybe they are using the very cheapest, most absolute garbage quality components on the face of the earth, which sucks, because better components don't cost that much, especially wholesale. They're just squeezing every penny out of profit and selling garbage wrapped up and promoted as quality.<br/><br/>Frustrating.<br/><br/>So, what sound does it pick up?<br/><br/>From what I've read online there are various audio manifestations/issues ranging from nearly no sound at all, all the way to my problem, which is the sound picked up becomes a garbled, distorted, feed-backed  jumble of sometimes jarring noises that maybe sort-of could be interpreted as words (in the case of people taking) but nearly nothing's decipherable by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Pet noises, like barks, meows, growls, etc. are literally non-existent. If it picks it up at all it's just converted to "noise".<br/><br/>All other sound is just as bad. Sometimes there's these random-seeming staticky "bangs" every once in a while. Who knows what that is.<br/><br/>I hate it.<br/><br/>You hear that developers?<br/><br/>I. Hate. This. Camera.<br/><br/>And I wish I didn't because otherwise I like so much about it.<br/><br/>But, alas,  I need sound so I am able to use the function where you talk to someone through the camera and hear them when they respond. I also need to be able to hear what's going on with my pets.<br/><br/>I need to be able to hear when the camera's motion-detection is tripped and the cause of the trip has moved out of the line of the camera but is still out there rustling and bumping around, or otherwise making noise out on my porch and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>If I had children I wouldn't be able to hear them, or speak to them through the camera. or hear when one is crying.<br/><br/>So, be forewarned, if any of the above is one of your needs/goals you probably won't be able to do that with this camera. Buy elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's incredibly stupid they didn't fix this problem before releasing the V3. A lot of people online report the V2 being awful as well, so the developers knew. That means you shouldn't put off buying one for when the next gen comes out (whenever that is). They probably won't fix it.<br/><br/>The worst part, I think, is it doesn't support the use of an external mic, which would be such an easy solve. There's no input port and the simple hardware and software to support that, and that really is stupid AF. If it did allow the connecting of an external mic all I'd have to do is plug one in and I would have the sound I need. At least then I wouldn't be writing this scathing review. It would be a win-win for everyone!<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>Finally, apparently contacting customer support is a total waste of time, and the people you talk to (bless their hearts, it isn't really their fault) have no tech experience or understanding whatsoever of how these things work. I don't know about you, but I find that exhausting. If one were to spend the time necessary to troubleshoot all the garbage products we wind up with one would never have time to do anything else, and even with that effort 95% of the time it results in no improvement, and no resolution. I'm tired of it. Just make a solid product, and when something goes wrong, replace it or refund the money, don't make anyone jump through hoops.<br/><br/>Finally, fix the issue, fast. And don't repeat it in the next iteration.<br/><br/>Long and the short of it is I need a camera with a functioning mic and/or that has an input for an external mic. The end. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even at the price-point these cameras are at.<br/><br/>I regret buying these, as now they're going to be tossed after I buy another brand (according to message boards even cheapo Chinese no-name brands have a better mic than these things!). What a waste of time, money, and resources.</span>

<span>We bought a set of these on sale to help keep an eye on our dogs while we are away/ to keep an eye on the baby cribs when the children go to nap.<br/><br/>They work great for the dogs but it took a little adjustment for the babies. The reason is because at night the cameras have to switch to night mode when activated. This causes the camera to make a slight ticking noise. Of course babies being babies, picked up on this right away and were originally weary of the camera.<br/>However, they got used to it quickly and now have no problems with the camera.<br/><br/>I can say that the night vision works well and I like the alerts provided when movement is picked up.<br/><br/>Another slight hiccup I've experienced a few times is that if the motion alert is activated, you can't turn the alerts off until the camera is done with its 10 second recording.<br/>Not the biggest deal but it makes it challenging to time it correctly to deactivate the alert.<br/><br/>Overall, I think its a good budget camera and it works well with the rest of our Blink system.</span>

<span>I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.<br/><br/>Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.<br/><br/>I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!<br/><br/>Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.</span>

<span>I have several of both the Minis and the outdoor models, and this Mini is almost identical to the outdoor and indoor models in terms of quality and features. The only real difference between them is the Mini isn't weather-proof, cannot handle the extreme temperatures of the outdoor models (-4 to 113 F), has a better mount, can be image-flipped, and runs solely on a power adapter instead of batteries.<br/><br/>* Not Weather-proof: DO NOT use this mini camera outdoors or in an uninsulated building. It is not water-proof and will likely be damaged by humidity and high or low temperatures.<br/><br/>* Mount &amp; Image Flipping: this mount is great and allows easier installation locations than the indoor and outdoor cameras, because it's mounted from the bottom/top instead of the back.  Since this Mini can be mounted from the bottom or top, this means it can be turned at many more angles on all 3 axes than the Indoor/Outdoor. If you have to mount it upside-down, such as from a ceiling, the app simply allows you to flip the image vertically. The problem with the indoor/outdoor models is the mounting is on the back, which means you can't "hang" it from a ceiling and point it in any direction. Instead, if you want to mount the Indoor/Outdoor on a ceiling or near the ceiling, you have a very small angle to point it. This makes the Indoor/Outdoor cameras inconvenient to install from above in most situations because you'll end up having to point the camera directly outward from your mounting surface. If from a ceiling, it'll face down. If from the top of a wall, it'll face outward along the ceiling. The Mini's mount is much better.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>* The "Talk" feature is totally useless. Regardless of bandwidth or proximity to the router or a sync module (purchased separately), the Talk feature produces broken sound that is impossible to understand. Plus there's a long delay of 3-6 seconds, making this feature useless for conversations, even if the other person understood anything you were saying. Over several tests with all of our different Blink cameras, none of them produce clear enough speech that someone can understand you, no matter where the cameras are located.<br/><br/>* No wired Ethernet option. This camera can only be used with a wireless router and Internet connection. There are no other options.<br/><br/>* Cannot be used as a USB web cam<br/><br/>* Cannot be used for continuous live feeds. The live feed only allows up to 30 seconds of viewing, and you must hit a Continue button every 30 seconds to keep it going. So if need a camera to leave running for frequent live video, Blink isn't what you're looking for.<br/><br/>* Cloud Storage Subscription semi-requirement: the Blink Home Monitor App's features become limited if you don't purchase a cloud storage subscription. If you stick with the Sync Module for local storage and do not purchase any of the cloud storage plans, VIDEO CLIPS CANNOT BE VIEWED THROUGH THE APP. The app will only allow you to view the live feed, adjust camera settings, and use the Talk feature. Without a cloud storage subscription, the only way to view your camera's video clips is by physically taking your USB storage device (purchased separately) out of the Sync Module (purchased separately) and placed in a USB port on a computer (purchased separately).<br/><br/>To be very clear here, if you do not purchase a cloud storage subscription, you will not be able to view any of the stored video clips (including motion-activated clips) from your phone. Period. This point has not been made clearly anywhere in the advertisements, support screens, Amazon product pages, or Blink Web site, but it's a crucial piece of information that the company is being very ambiguous about.<br/><br/>To repeat, IF YOU DON'T PURCHASE A CLOUD STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU CANNOT VIEW YOUR VIDEO CLIPS THROUGH YOUR PHONE. I have seen some reviewers assert that this isn't technically possible, but as a software engineer I know this isn't true. The Blink developers clearly focused on developing the cloud storage and subscriptions, using the mobile app as the user's "portal" app to access and view the cloud-stored video clips, and have simply decided not to develop a mechanism for the mobile app to access the video clips stored in your Sync Module. I want to be very clear here....this IS POSSIBLE and would require a lot of development to accomplish, but Blink just doesn't provide this functionality (yet). Whether they are working on this feature and plan to add it in the future is unknown. But the lack of direct integration between the mobile app and the Sync Module's local storage (over the local network, especially) is a significant shortcoming in the entire Blink system. This also means that if your camera loses its internet connection, it will not capture video, you can't view the live feed, the Talk feature won't work, and you can't change the camera's settings.. The Blink system simply does not allow the mobile app to connect directly to a camera or Sync Module on your local network. It is designed to use the Internet only. This is a very important point that customers must understand. Both the camera and the Sync Module require an active Internet connection to function. They will not work independently or with just a wifi router. Internet is required.</span>

<span>We purchased our first Blink Home Security Camera July of 2018. We were going out of the country and wanted to make sure our 18 year old son closed the garage door and locked the house. It did the job and we felt better knowing while on the other side of the world we could monitor our home.<br/>The following Summer we were so happy with our indoor system, we decided to purchase 2 outdoor cameras with the 2 way audio, and were so happy with the video and audio quality, we bought another add on outdoor camera, the next month.<br/>A year later we found the mini indoor cameras. We have one for a child's bedroom and one for the playroom.

This can take a few days to work out the kinks.<br/>Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling.  The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.<br/><br/>Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.<br/><br/>Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.<br/><br/>We highly recommend Blink to anyone who would like to have a home video camera system that works, and won't break the bank.<br/>We love that you can start out small and work your way in to as much as you want/need.</span>

<span>I purchased this item to use for my recently adopted kitten. Set up was incredibly easy, and the associated app and device are VERY userfriendly - which was what I was worried about. You're able to customize the recording and monitoring in many different ways: manual, scheduled, geofencing. I'm currently using the geofencing timer for this device, and I got the alert that it switched the second I stepped into my vehicle to leave. The camera quality and zoom feature are great. You're also able to easily rotate or communicate through the camera easily. I got an alert of pet movement, and it was when my kitten woke up and walked a few feet to the feeder. The motion sensor works very well. I would definitely recommend this item to friends &amp; family. There is also a setting to alert for crying if you have a baby or toddler.</span>

<span>I bought this to keep an eye on my digital printer. It works well, has a good range, it was able to connect to the wifi in the basement, 2 floors to where the modem is. Night mode is very good, better than the lights I have now.<br/><br/>The software needs work, I would love to be able to create zones of interest or a program but it doesn't have that. The sounds in the camera viewing are loud, but the camera itself moving, is not. There is also a loud click when the nightmode turns on, not sure if the camera makes that noise or its just on the recording.  But if you are listening for sounds in the room, the camera makes it while watching.<br/><br/>There is no graphic on the screen showing the viewing angle or limits.<br/><br/>It does have a nice feature where you can hit 360 and it will spin around then go back to the original position.<br/><br/>There is a notification if there is someone in the room. But only when viewing the camera. If the app was open it will send the notification, but often it doesn't send me anything if it wasn't open. It seems intermittent.<br/><br/>Now the good and bad - I can access this camera anywhere on any network. Which is good, I can view my house from my hotel room and move it around... But that also means it has to go through their network which means:<br/><br/>1. If the cable is out, I can't access the camera (I haven't tried that yet but it makes sense). There is no way to switch it to just MY OWN network.<br/><br/>2. Because it goes to their base first, its not really protected. While they claim its encoded, they have the decryption key and anything can be hacked. So don't be naked in front of this camera.<br/><br/>3. Because it has to go to home base, the keys are often not all responsive. So like in the morning, I was trying to move it but couldn't because it lagged or something. But at midnight it moved around without any effort at all. So if a lot are using their system, you may not be getting a responsive touch.<br/><br/>I'm also not seeing where it stores the videos on the card.<br/><br/>And it also bugs me that there is no way to disable the very obvious light on the front of this thing. If its hidden, you can totally see that light.<br/><br/>The tracking works pretty well but its not smart. So like if I have it on and I put a hand in the screen, it does nothing. If there is a head, it will track it, but if I quickly jump back out of view, it stops tracking.  I haven't tried the sound alert yet.<br/><br/>The controls are jerky, I want a smooth transition, this is more like a pump the gas, pump the breaks sort of movement. Hard to fine tune it.<br/><br/>Its a good camera for the price, does a lot, but has some issues.<br/><br/>Updated 5-6-22<br/><br/>a few things I learned.<br/><br/>1. If you lose connection to the net, you can't use this camera. If the site is down, too bad, if they go out of business, you can't use this camera.  There is no option to have it on your own network only, everything has to go through them.<br/><br/>Which also means that if there is lag and there is a lot of lag, your camera lags. So like if there was a person in the room, and you wanted to spin the camera, it may not respond at all. I've had that issue with the night vision turning on and off.<br/><br/>2. The motion works but not well. Its not smart. If you quickly run under it you can move behind it fast. If you are static in the picture and move your hand, it focuses on the hand or the movement. If you are in frame and move out of frame fast, it stays in that position and then in 30 sec then it goes back. But it doesn't look in the direction you left in.  I think it should rotate a bit if it lost the prey.<br/><br/>3. If you set motion to everything, it catches invisible dust flakes, even on the lower positions. I kept getting alerts it was annoying.  And if you have a black out period on your phone, it won't show you that someone was seen unless you look at the camera in the app.<br/><br/>4. YOU MUST HAVE A PHONE TO USE THIS CAMERA. They don't have a PC app, only a phone.<br/><br/>Would I get another one of these cameras? No. I would look for something that used my own internal private network with the option of using the cloud. I don't like the thought that someone could hack the line and become an intermediate. And as much as they say they respect my privacy, the thought that my signal is traveling across to who even knows where, does bother me. And it bugs me that there is a lot of lag in the system.  I won't change my rating, because the camera does work, it has a nice picture. I do wish I could turn on the night vision as an exclusive option, I can only turn it off.<br/><br/>I use this as a way to see my shop, printer, etc. As a security camera, I would probably choose something else. Not to mention that I think if someone were to scan the bar code on the bottom, they would probably have a feed too.</span>

<span>This is a great cam, I didn't want to pay monthly fees, nor have my video sent out to the Internet.  I can get notices when I'm away. I can use my cell phone to check up on the puppies and even talk to them and hear them. We tested it and my wife said the sound quality of my talking was like I was right there in the room. You must buy a micro SD card if you don't want to pay for their Cloud service. The stall manual does say how to set up, but I think my difficulty was terminology was written for someone already familiar with them. The YouTube video saved me.  I bought this and was given nothing to endorse this. Also, this is the single cam only, don't confused it with the tree pack which can connect to each other.</span>

<span>Impressive! This camera does so much for the price. All you need is wifi! Fantastic picture quality, camera moves when motion is nearby and stays on target, you can talk into the app and it plays through the speaker, it has a icloud for playback, you can set up notifications through the eufy app when motion occurs, it even comes with mountings for the ceiling or wall, overall great camera! I have piece of mind now and plan to buy more eufy products! Oh and delivery was next day! Thank you.</span>

<span>Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe's alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well.<br/><br/>First thing's first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good)<br/><br/>Blink Outdoor:<br/>Motion recording speed &amp; Delay:<br/>The Outdoor cam's trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam's onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what's happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --&gt; Encode --&gt; Cloud --&gt; Decode. I"d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too.<br/><br/>Motion sensor &amp; sensor distance.<br/>the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe's cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn't have an outdoor solution.<br/><br/>Speaker/Mic<br/>the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn't sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic.<br/><br/>Wifi Wireless<br/>i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they're genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this "might" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage.  it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam.<br/><br/>AC Wireless.<br/>part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it'll be less than 2 years, well less. but i'd be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount.<br/><br/>Resolution/video quality<br/>the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon's 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield "some" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won't be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there's no app available for desktop computers. you'll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop.<br/><br/>Storage<br/>ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don't need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don't explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup "from their cloud server" "once a day". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There're a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It's not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It's simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you'll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what's the point of local storage? it's almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that "local storage" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it's a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription.<br/><br/>Now onto Blink mini (junk)<br/><br/>Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn't released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it's pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it.  The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you're thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don't say i didn't warn you.<br/><br/>Software UI/UX<br/>the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you're using it outdoor, since the "motion sensor" distance (not wifi distance)  is well shy of advertised 25ft.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it'll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don't mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers.<br/><br/>i will update the review on the battery life</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy.  I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly.  Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there.  The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions!  Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order.  I should have been.  Inexcusable that there were no instructions.  I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful.  But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues.  I am after all a klutz.<br/><br/>The first step in installation is to download the Blink app.  Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer.  It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone.  Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC.  I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand.  I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.<br/><br/>The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap.  One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras.  I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating.  First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate.  You need to take that plug out to access the screw.  The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw.  Simple right?  Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off.  I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed.  Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off.  (I warned you that I was a klutz.)  Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body.  That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions.  But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on.  Why?  Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers.  Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way.  The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.<br/><br/>Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps.  The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps.  But here's another setup klutz problem I came across.  To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located.  Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky.  First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to.  But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached.  So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera.  The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.<br/><br/>OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block.  Again - no guidance because no instructions.  Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected.  OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.</span>

<span>When we first purchased cams back in 2017, we compared to Arlo and Ring before we chose Blink. Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more):<br/>PROS:<br/>&gt; #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams.  POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use.<br/>&gt; So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes.<br/>&gt; The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few "advanced features" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas  and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam.<br/>&gt; Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I'm running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year.<br/>&gt; Super easy playback and control of cams. It's instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle.<br/>&gt; Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds.<br/>&gt; No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos.<br/>&gt; Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there.<br/>&gt; Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that.<br/>CONS:<br/>&gt; So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA's, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides.<br/>&gt; The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed.<br/>&gt; You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it's not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break.<br/>OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.</span>

<span>Honestly, this is a good-almost great camera to use. I don’t have a doorbell so opted for this one instead. It will do what you need it to and the night vision is not terrible either. The main complaints I have with this model are the battery life and motion sensors. The battery life is supposed to(according to description) last for about two years- but that’s very far off. I have to change my batteries like every two months. granted, in the app it says my camera has high usage, but that’s the point of it lol. The motion sensor is iffy for sure. I have a lot of stray cats by my house and it rarely picks up on them walking through my porch… and if it does pick it up it’s always super delayed (the cat is almost off my porch by the time the camera records it). Oh one more thing - it gets super frustrating when you get the notification of movement on your phone, I click it, and it takes forever to load the live view (usually the mailman is gone by the time it pulls up and works). Usually, when doing that or just checking live view in genera the app sort of like crashes and I end up having to close it and start over. So I can never really use the talk feature since it usually takes awhile to load and then the person is gone by the time it works lol. But those are things I can live with and it overall works like it’s supposed to!</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>I have many cameras using many apps. From my experience Wansview is one of the best brands for all around quality and capability. I mounted this camera up high so I could see multiple rooms and check in on my dogs. It came with an adjustable mounting bracket that you can mount on the wall or ceiling or you can just set on a table top. Whether I am in my office or away from home, I can quickly look at the video feed and PTZ around the room to see what my dogs are doing and where they are. The camera was easy to set up and the controls are smooth and responsive. The Wansview android app works great with all the settings you might need. You can also tell Alexa to show the camera on your appropriate device and it works.<br/>(*Alexa compatibility - all the Wansview Cameras work with Alexa Show devices, Firesticks, TvCubes, but not in the Alexa PC app or the live preview in the Android app. With the PC or Android app, you can still tell Alexa to show it on one of the other devices)<br/>This camera and all Wansview cameras also works with my Home automation software I use.<br/> With all PTZ cameras, when you use the PTZ you can hear the motors because the mic is located in the device, however you do not hear the motion of the camera when you are in the room with this camera.</span>

Puse que me enviara notificaciones cuando hubiera movimiento en la casa y a veces la alarma se activa con el cambio de la luz del amanecer y atardecer, lo cuales me gusta ver y me recuerda a echar un vistazo a la casa todos los días.

<span>This is great camera for those locations where you need active monitoring.  I carry a couple with me as I travel to use at a location doesn't need a full blown camera security system, but just a way to remotely monitor an area or employees.  For that these cameras are great.  Setup can be done in about 5 minutes, and the ability to remotely move the field of vision is a great feature on such an inexpensive web camera.  Picture quality is also great, and the night vision works well too.  I which the desktop software worked better and was easier to use, as I would rather store my video locally than in the cloud.  Overall though if you need a quick and cheap monitoring solution, this is it.</span>

<span>Great product! I had owned a 10" Ring Light of another brand and this one by UBeesize is so much better!<br/><br/>1. The ring light is actually big enough so I can put my phone in the middle of it without the light obstructing the camera lens.<br/>2. It doesn't make any weird high pitch ringing noises like the other cheap brand that I had.<br/>3. It actually goes to the highest setting without turning off randomly (another issue I had with the cheaper brand).<br/>4. Comes with nice features like a built-in leveler in the stand, etc.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the best bang you can get for your money! Very satisfied with this!</span>

<span>So I got a ring light that was white but I also wanted one that was RGB for cool effects and coloring my shot better. When I turned this light on I was amazed at the dazzling and beautiful color patterns… then I accidentally hit another button and I was mind blown…. It has bright white and yellow light as well! I thought this was only a rgb light with no white or yellow! And the craziest part of all is that these are powered by USB! Which is absolutely incredible and hard to believe. Get a 4 port usb Wall adapter and 3-4 of these lights and you got a studio! No need for umbrella lighting or expensive LED video lights</span>

<span>This is super high quality for the price! The tripod is the nicest I’ve ever seen for this size light. Locks at the bottom, is actually easy to adjust the height. The mount for the phone is wider than others and fits my phone with a wallet case on it. The light itself is easy to control and has warm, natural, cool, and lots of color and intensity options.</span>

<span>The last time I bought a tripod was for a digital camera I got in 2004.  In those days, they all had standard sized holes that you screwed into a pad at the top of the tripod.  Pretty low tech device, and it worked fine for years.  But my newest cell phone has an incredible camera and I found myself wanting to use it in situations that would require a tripod, like taking a video of myself doing something.  So I went looking for the kind of tripod I had previously that would work with a cell phone.<br/><br/>I was amazed at what current tripods can do.  I bought this one because it has some interesting features that will be useful, and it wasn’t that expensive.  It has turned out to be a perfect fit for my needs.  It does the basic things I need well enough - it holds my rather large phone steady, is easily adjustable, and is very portable.  The ring light is not something I had ever used before, but it is turning out to be very useful.  It keeps enough light on a fairly close subject to improve the quality of images, and I guess you can adjust the color for different effects, although I haven’t really used that much.  I like that it is USB powered, so I can use it anywhere without needing a clumsy lamp.  Even has a remote button so you can control the camera function without touching the device, which is cool.<br/><br/>Basically, a handy and practical device, perfect for occasional or field use.  If I were using it professionally, I might want something bigger and sturdier, but that would certainly cost more.  This does everything I need, and the price was right.  I am very happy with it.</span>
