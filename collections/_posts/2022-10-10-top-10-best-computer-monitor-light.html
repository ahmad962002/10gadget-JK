<span>I purchased this BenQ light as I was looking at ways of adding more light onto my desk without using more space.  I started with some Ikea lights where it clamps on the side of the desk, but found them to be cumbersome for the most part.  Then I saw a few reviews of this BenQ light on youtube and found them to be a little sus as all of them were reviews where the products were provided for free.  But I figured, if it sucks, I could always return it.<br/><br/>Turns out this is one of the best purchases I've made.  The light is decent and great for both dark and lit situations.  The automated sensor is not something I care to use since it doesn't allow me to create presets, but manually adjusting has worked out great for me.</span>

<span>Not cheap I suppose, but very high value. I was on the fence about whether to buy the one with or without the control pad. I paid the extra dollars for with. Glad I did. While it is true that it is probably not difficult to reach up and control the ScreenBar with buttons on top, the fact that the ScreenBar is not actually attached to the monitor makes me feel more comfortable controlling it without having to guess and fumble and possibly knock it off [maybe not likely but possible]. The small controller is easy to relocate out of the way and access when needed. The ability to control brightness [or use auto] and temperature is excellent. My workspace is now much better and more evenly illuminated than it was by an overhead spot. Further, screen rendering seems much easier on my eyes and with less glare. Should have bought one long ago. Highly recommended. [Amazon, next time you send me a returned product, at least make sure someone re-packages it competently.</span>

<span>Im defiantly a function over form type guy but this is one of the most elegant looking accessories on my desk.

<span>TL;DR Great budget option that still delivers while not breaking the bank. Would recommend if budget is a concern and you don't want to settle for the cheapest of the cheap chinese knockoffs (assuming you get it at the $50-$60 price point).<br/><br/>Overall this light was very solid and I honestly would have kept it if I didn't enjoy the BenQ light more. This review will mostly be a comparison to the BenQ Screenbar and I will be posting a similar review on that product as well.<br/><br/>A bit of background: I've always used/preferred task lighting when it comes to working at my desk and doing work on my computer. Up until about a week ago an architect style lamp from Ikea was filling the bill, but then I upgraded to a monitor stand for more desk real estate and now my my monitors are too high for that style lamp. After doing some research, I came across the BenQ Screenbar and similar styled lamps (i.e. TORCHSTAR Computer Monitor Light)--shopping around and reading reviews I narrowed it down to those 2 (thanks especially to Ken Y).<br/><br/>I went ahead and purchased both from Amazon and after some light use decided to keep the BenQ Screenbar. At the time of purchase, the BenQ light was $99.00 and the TORCHSTAR $57.99 ($77.99 with a $20 off coupon) before tax. I've included photos to show the "differences" between the 2 lights--for all pictures the lights are at maximum brightness and maximum "warmth" or "coolness". All Photos are also captured at the same exposure settings with the same white balance for consistency.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>-Cheaper than BenQ while nearly being a clone<br/>-There's a diffuser over the LEDs (less harsh on the eyes, but this may be a choice on the BenQ as diffused light scatters more)<br/>-Smooth when dimming (slight flicker on the BenQ which might be a pro though because on the torchstar sometimes I can't tell if it's working)<br/>-Auto mode disables if you tap it again (it doesn't on the BenQ)<br/>-Torchstar came with an allen key to adjust the clamp tightness (I think the BenQ has a similar access panel but no key)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Not as bright (not sure if the LEDs themselves actually get brighter or there are just more, but this was a big reason I chose the BenQ)<br/>-smaller illumination area (about 3.5" shorter than the BenQ which translates to a decent amount of space)<br/>-Auto LED is blue and kind of sharp in the dark (the green on BenQ is very mild)<br/>-Clamp feels cheaper<br/>-Controls feel less responsive and intuitive (sometimes I felt like I wasn't sure if the torchstar was working but I always knew if the BenQ was. Also with the Torchstar the brightness or color ALWAYS alternated between touches making it kind of difficult to reach exactly the right settings)<br/>-Flat cable USB on the BenQ feels more premium<br/><br/>SIMILARITIES:<br/>-Both work fairly well with curved monitors. (I use a Samsung CF398 27" as my primary display and a CF390 24" as my secondary)<br/>-Both have directed LED strips to minimize glare on the monitors (some of the chinese knockoffs aren't built well and create a ton of glare)<br/>-They honestly both just work well<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I can kind of recommend both light bars, but I just personally preferred the BenQ more and am willing to pay the premium for it. My complaints with the TORCHSTAR are mostly minor and especially if you don't change the settings much won't even be very noticeable.<br/><br/>I will continue to update this review with usage as well as try to answer any questions that might come up.

<span>I tried the BenQ monitor light for $99 and it was such a great monitor lamp. But it never sat good with me to pay so much for a light. So I searched around and found this TorchStar lamp at half the price.<br/>It is pretty much the same lamp, AT HALF THE PRICE! Some will mention the build quality and led brightness as being superior on the more expensive lamp. As far as build quality, they are almost identical. Same size, material, feel, buttons, etc... The brightness might be slightly brighter on the BenQ but for me that wasn't an advantage really. I don't need a lamp that close to me being that bright. I keep the lamp on the warm setting and let the auto dimmer adjust it. Works perfect.<br/>Included image of the TorchStar sitting above my Acer 27inch monitor and it is the perfect size for that size monitor.</span>

<span>This is a great accessory for your desk hands down! It works perfectly for my setup!<br/><br/>The light is bright and dimmable so you can find the right brightness level for you. It casts the light perfectly on to your work area without shining in your eyes or washing out your monitors image.<br/><br/>The versatility is great as well you can change the color temp between varying warm and cool white. You can also change the lights angle to adjust it to your setup.<br/><br/>The only feature I don't completely like is the auto-dimming. It tends to just always be a bit too bright for me, but that's ok with me. I just use the manual dimming to get my perfect lighting.<br/><br/>To conclude my ramblings it is a great product at a great value for your money. Similar products with the same features sell for typically $30 or more than this one. Definitely give this one a shot before you decide to spend more on other brands with the same features.<br/><br/>I give it a five star recommendation!</span>

<span>I really like this light. The best thing about it is that it has a nightlight setting and I just keep it on all the time. It provides just enough light to see my desk in the dark.<br/><br/>The only thing you need to be careful of is when mounting it, make sure it isn’t putting any pressure on the screen—it will create a light spot below the bezel.<br/><br/>I would get this light again and would recommend it.</span>

I couldnt get a good hold on my curved monitor without modification, and when it did, it caused pressure, which I was afraid would cause damage after prolonged use. The mount on this monitor light is leaps and bounds better. It just rests ontop of the monitor, but still feels very secure due to how heavy the clamp mechanism is. The silicone pads provide just enough grip that I am not afraid it will slide or fall off. I also really like that the brightness levels have a lot more steps than simply three. The power button is surrounded by a dial that u can just turn to get ur desired brightness. A lot more intuitive than touch sensitive buttons in my book. All in all, if you have a curved monitor, this will 100% be my recommendation.</span>

<span>Like many people, I found myself actually considering the ridiculously priced BenQ ScreenBar ($130 last I checked), but only because all the alternatives looked like cheap trash. Glad I kept searching and found this. Very impressed so far.<br/><br/>Build quality is very nice. It's all metal and feels hefty enough to take on the zombie apocalypse, but don't worry it's not as heavy as it feels. Most of the weight is in the base that sits behind the monitor and keeps this thing anchored. Controls are intuitive. You get 3 light temperatures: incandescent, fluorescent, and a neutral white in between, akin to the midday sun. I prefer the neutral color but they are all pleasant.<br/><br/>Note: It will remember your settings when you turn it off and on, but it resets if you cut off its power source, so I'd recommend connecting this to a dedicated charger rather than your monitor or computer ports.<br/><br/>IMO, SIKAI may be a new brand but they've definitely got a winner on their hands with this light.. They did a really great job with designing it and using quality materials, and all for pretty much the same price as the plastic versions the other Chinese competitors are producing.</span>

<span>I've had this for about half a year now, and this lamp is seriously one of my best purchases.  It's very low profile, and the spread of light from it is perfect without any light shining in your face.  If you're looking for a space saving light, you found it.  Really nice construction too, I was surprised by it.</span>

<span>The brightness/lighting quality of this bar is good, but the design for sitting on top of the monitor is poorly thought out. It doesn't have any kind of tab to hold on to the front, so due to the shape of my monitor, it's basically just balancing on top. If I bump my desk or when I press the power button, it wiggles out of place and sometimes even nearly falls off. As other reviews have mentioned, it loses its memory for what your last setting was if powered off, so you won't get that feature unless you can plug it into an outlet/power strip. Overall I wouldn't recommend buying the name brand benq bar as it's ridiculously overpriced, but you may want to look for a little bit better knockoff than this one.</span>

<span>I am impressed by the build of the lamp, and the high quality of the lighting.  I am using the lamp at my desk in front of a couple of monitors on stands.  The lamp is very heavy and sturdy, and easily holds the position you set it up in.  It is extremely adjustable and has great pivot points on the arms as well as a ball adjustment on the light head itself.  The LEDs are very high quality and it easily illuminates my entire desk with high quality light that reveals details that I had not seen with my old light-including a lot of dust!  The lighting itself is quite adjustable,  Not only can the amount of light be dimmed but the color temperature can be adjusted between cool and warm tones.  The reason it is called an e-reading lamp is it has automated modes that adjust lamp automatically for an optimal amount of lighting for your room for either reading or computer screen reading.  These function very well. The look of the lamp is very cool and modern, with the swooping angle of the light head and the dramatic length of the arms.  My only criticism is the dimming feature.  It doesn't dim as low as I would have liked.  I enjoy fairly dim light most of the time and even at its lowest setting the light was very bright.  This is more of a personal preference and of course people are buying this light for work or reading but I would have liked to be able to dim it all the way to zero, like how most dimmers work.  Aside from this complaint, I think it is a great lamp and a real upgrade to my work area.  I think, from an eye-health perspective, having high quality lighting like this will spare my eyes from strain, which is a huge plus.  I recommend this lamp if you can afford its high price.  For the money, you get amazing build quality and incredible technology,</span>

<span> This is a review of the BenQ WiT, LED desk lamp. I received a free sample for review.<br/><br/>I've been happily using this for a week or so. What a unique and highly functional light.<br/><br/>This has a very hefty base so the light is solid. The articulating arm has limits to its travel, but it moves just about any which way within its limits. It is highly adjustable. Even the curved LED head has a ball joint to allow fine tuning of the light direction.<br/><br/>A Chromed ring at the end of the light where it attaches to the arm is how you turn this on. Just a brief touch does the trick. Once the light is on, a turn of the dial changes the brightness of the light. A press of the dial changes the mode to color mode and twisting the dial allows you change the color temperature of the light from warm to very cool.<br/><br/>Going back to the chrome ring... if you touch it for about 2 seconds the light enters auto mode. A light sensor in the light reads the ambient light and adjusts the LED automatically. While in this mode you can not change the temperature or brightness. It is what it is. And if the ambient light changes for one reason or another you will have to engage the auto sensor again as it is not dynamic, It adjusts once until it is invoked again and then it readjusts at that point.<br/><br/>The power cord (about 7 feet in length) is very supple with a woven fabric covering. A power adapter with a short amount of cord of its own plugs into the longer cord that goes to the light. This is not desireable to me. For one thing, the connector that connects the two cords together is not secure enough for my liking. If you have an AC outlet that is halfway up a wall for instance, just the weight of the hanging cord is almost enough to cause the connection to pull apart. This is the weak link in this light.<br/><br/>Other than the power supply connection, this is a novel and extremely appealing desk light. It can be very bright or not so much and the ability to change the color temperature is fantastic.<br/><br/>The curved LED array allows the light to cover a much wider area than a conventional light.,<br/><br/>This is one cool desk light... and an expensive one. In this case however I think the price may be justified,</span>
