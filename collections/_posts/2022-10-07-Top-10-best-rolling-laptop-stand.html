<span>I bought this for our church as we often have events outside and have to gerry-rig a way to set up the projector &amp; computer. This projector mount is perfect for when we do that as it is stable (the projector is not going to sag under the weight) and easily moved and height adjustable. The slim profile also means that it will take up far less room than the card table we used to pull out.<br/>We haven’t used it outside yet, but have it in the sanctuary. This allows us to put the projector in a better position &amp; prevent the weight issue their too.<br/><br/>The only con is that the wheels are a pain to get on and they come off easily too. - the rest of the assembly was very easy.</span>

<span>See info on why I chose to buy this below as the rest of the review is TL;DR long.<br/><br/>Price  : 3.0, in 2nd price tier (see below)<br/>Assembly  : 1.8<br/>Fit/Finish  : 2.8<br/>Overall  : 2.6-2.8, round up to 3 stars<br/><br/>[Q] Would I buy it again knowing what I know now?<br/>[A] Maybe, but probably not.  Would break my budget and<br/>  go up to tier (c) -- see "why I chose..."<br/><br/>My use: projector inside/outside on temporary screen for movies with<br/>friends. Stability was #1 criteria, which is mostly meets with caveats.<br/><br/>Has some design flaws that could easily be overcome, but they impose<br/>some stability issues which required me to constantly adjust the feet<br/>after every 1-2 uses. Either the design needs closer tolerances or<br/>there need to be top screws at the base's cross bar/leg bar attachment<br/>point same as used on the vertical pole has. Using metal shims can reduce this<br/>and make it more stable on one-off basis if so inclined.<br/><br/>Not easily adjusted, but the lower fixed shelf at ~27" and top shelf<br/>at lowest adjustment of 39 1/2" are close enough to what I need for<br/>most uses, I don't have to go through the pain of adjusting the<br/>height.  My opinion is the "adjustable" part means at assembly time<br/>choosing the height you want.<br/><br/>Its good enough for now.  Got what I paid for, I guess.  But adding<br/>just a minimum of 4 additional screws would have made this soooo much better in<br/>terms of base stability and alignment.<br/><br/>Mid-weight mild steel frame. Shelves seem to be 3/32" mild steel also.<br/>The steel was fairly easy to bend into/out of shape (which is what the<br/>bolts do during assembly as this is required to overcome the loose part<br/>fit.)<br/><br/>--- Why I chose to buy this item ---<br/>There seem to be three price ranges:<br/>a) low end  (30$ +/- 10)<br/>b) mid level (70$ +/- 20) 2x bump up<br/>c) high end  (180-250$  ) 2x bump up<br/><br/>My criteria for choosing was fairly simple:<br/>  1. stability confidence that a mid-level $400-500 projector and/or<br/>  $800 laptop wouldn't be at risk, due to stability, of falling over<br/>  and being broken (would I be willing to risk use of my least expensive<br/>  portable LED projector w/replacement cost of $250 on this choice?),<br/>  2. keeping it within a comfortable budget.<br/>  3. adjustable range of 24"-42"<br/>Non-criteria, but nice to have:<br/>  3. setup on flat/hard surface or uneven grass.<br/>Non-criteria<br/>  4. small storage footprint<br/><br/>#1 means there will be stability that once set up it wont jiggle/bounce<br/>the image on screen as someone walks by.<br/><br/>Short version as to my end choice:<br/><br/>(a) was mostly (all?) tripods, and the mechanical base footprint<br/>is either too small, in my opinion, for the stability level I'm looking for or there was the<br/>significant potential added mechanical instability (slop) due to<br/>its design principals employed or mechanical fit &amp; fitness issues in its manufacture.<br/>  - reading the reviews seem to reflect those concerns had merit<br/>  - all dropped because these less expensive models do not have my confidence<br/>  of repeatable use via-a-vis stability, aka my projector/laptop are at the potential<br/>  risk of falling/breaking.<br/><br/>So, the majority of (a), even though the tripod designs seemed ideal for my purpose,<br/>were dubious choices for me as I had reservations about long term stability. The vertical<br/>moment arm with a weight at the end (my laptop/projector) can quickly hit a tipping point<br/>based upon the base footprint, especially as the set height increases.<br/><br/>(c) out of my price range. But Roland SS-PC1 or Roland PDS-20 ($180) tripod design would be<br/>on my short list to look at, along with ULINE's H-9014 ($200) portable desk design.<br/><br/>There were two main choices for sale in (b) which are the same exact design.<br/>The design seems to have three specific design/mechanical flaws:<br/>  - the attachment point between cross bar and leg bar in base has inherint wobble, and<br/>  - ease of adjustment of vertical height (more of a choose at assembly time).<br/>  - a few tack points of welding vs full seam welded<br/><br/>--- Assembly and use experience ---<br/><br/>The metal is mid-weight mild steel.  The "mild" part plays a significant role in that<br/>the fit of parts is quite loose, cross bar to leg bars had a 1/8"-3/16" gap once legs<br/>placed into U holder for same.  So the key to stability in the base is to tighten the<br/>screws to bend the mild steel up against the leg bars to provide stability.  A 2nd issue<br/>is there is a 1/16-3/32" gap between the top of the leg bars and the cross bar.  The good<br/>news is you need this slop to get the feet to lay close to flat so you don't have to keep<br/>adjusting the feet to maintain 4 point contact on a flat surface.  The bad news is that<br/>even tightening the cross bolts to near striping failure point is not sufficient to prevent<br/>the leg bars from changing position over time of repeated use and thus requiring readjustment<br/>of the feet to maintain 4 point contact stability.  Am thinking of getting some metal shims<br/>to push between the two mating surfaces to help.  A design change to include two screws on<br/>the top would also solve this in that they would prevent the ability for the leg arms to<br/>pivot up/down due to that gap in mating surfaces.  I can easily insert 22mil metal sheeting<br/>between the cross bar and leg mounting surfaces once it was assembled and all tightened<br/>down.  And while there are 2 cross through bolts they're attachment tolerances are proving<br/>insufficient at preventing up/down pivoting/movement.  Adding shims between the mating<br/>surfaces should help with this I hope.<br/><br/>The rolling feet only have 2 locking members, the instructions says to place them at the<br/>same side of the two leg bars -- that is 1 locking wheel on each leg bar.  Because of the<br/>issue with the 4 rollers having alignment issues over time, even when all four wheels are<br/>in contact with floor, one tends to have less weight on it making just 2 locking wheels<br/>insufficient for the placement stability I was looking for.  Using 4 locking wheels with<br/>this design would have been better.  Bottom line is that more often than not only one of the<br/>locking wheels had sufficient contact weight resulting in unit constantly at risk of pivoting<br/>if any brushed up against it.<br/><br/>So I've used this 3 times and have had to adjust the wheels 4 times to keep it from wobbling<br/>and get near same weight distribution per wheel for stability.  Also I've found for my purposes leaving<br/>the wheels unlocked has been more helpful than locking them.  The wheels are a hard plastic<br/>and tend to glide when locked anyway.  If I decide to keep using this vs chucking it into<br/>the metal recycling bin, replacing the casters with neoprene versions is the 2nd thing I'd<br/>do (1st being the metal shims to take out bottom cross bar/leg connection pivot/wobble).<br/><br/>The upright is fine, 4 top screws to take out wobble -- applying this same principle to the<br/>cross bar and leg bars would fix a lot of sins with this design! -- and a cross through<br/>bolt.  I'm not convinced the cross bolt actually does anything with regards to stability...<br/>I mean the top 4 bolts provided the same amount of connection stability in both axis, so<br/>why the cross thru bolt.  I appreciate it, it provides a some reflection of thought,<br/>but what I expect is that the cross bolt was the only bolt in the original design interation,<br/>and the 4 top screws were added later to remove unacceptable wobble on the vertical pole.<br/>Which makes sense give the higher the vertical pole is adjusted, the more moment arm you have<br/>and the easier it would be for weight (your laptop) at the end of that arm to induce wobble.<br/><br/>So the lack of tight tolerances in the base are where fit and finish get knocked down by<br/>a serious amount in my personal view.  That and the top plate had scuffs and wear from<br/>how the shipping container was designed (or they are just from the manf process).<br/><br/>One of the other knocks on fit and finish, is the 4 point tack welding of the vertical pole<br/>to the mounting plate and ditto for the side arm.  Welding completely around the pole to the<br/>mounting plate would have given me more confidence in the mechanical wear ability of this<br/>design.  As it stands, on fatigue crack in one weld point and the other three are likely<br/>to not be far behind vis-a-vis time/use basis.<br/><br/>The vertical pole is adjusted using two cross through bolts.  To adjust you have to manually<br/>align the top pole as you raise and lower looking for the holes in the inner pole that is<br/>being moved up/down.  And at the lowest setting the top bolt goes through the plastic end<br/>cap that freely spins, so a 2 stage alignment.  To adjust the pole height, undo the bolts and<br/>go through the whole procedure again.  *If* or when I have to do this in the future, I'll use<br/>a permanent silver ink marker for a vertical line through center of each bolt hole on the inner<br/>pole and draw horizontal lines around the pole at each inner pole hole to help with ease<br/>the issues of finding black on black on black holes to align.  Note two bolts are needed to<br/>prevent pivot wobbling of the inner pole as tolerances as such there is a lot of slop in between<br/>outer and inner poles.  Again this is ok for this price point, but was another vote point when<br/>I was assembling that "adjustable" height meant at assembly point in time... not at every use.<br/><br/>Other issue was the twisty knob placement, pictorial directions are on the left, but I'm right<br/>handed so put them on the right ... but this was above the fixed shelf so after one use and<br/>finding that they were difficult to get to while the shelf was in use (to re-tighten them),<br/>I switched them to the left.  This would be more of a problem if the unit was more easily<br/>adjustable, but since its a pain to adjust due to having to manually align everything using a<br/>flashlight to see when the black hole shows up vs the black pole... well, I won't be adjusting<br/>this too often or at all.<br/><br/>Attaching the top plate to the pole was a bit of a pain as there are two plastic shims that<br/>are slightly rounded to help mechanical connection.  I ended up pre-fitting these and attaching<br/>them with a bit if silicone, letting that set, before adding the top plate.  A temporary<br/>method I tried was with using scotch tape to hold them in place while assembling, and then cutting<br/>off the pieces afterward.  But I had to disassemble to switch the bolts around trying to get the<br/>cross through carriage bolts square end to seat better -- but it didn't the top shelf bracket<br/>has square holes but the pole where it attaches does not.  Another fit/finish or manf issue<br/>with both needing these plastic shims and the carriage through bolts not seating as the hole within<br/>the pole was not square cut as needed.</span>

<span>Bought 3 of these for our clinic. Perfect for a small laptop with space for charts and paper work. The table goes up and down easily and large caster wheels make it easy to roll around. We all recommend it at the our clinic.  The only thing is I wish it would go up a little higher maybe 4-6 more inches.</span>

<span>This works as a desk, TV tray, stand for watching electronics while on treadmill, and you can park it next to your bed to watch iPad or as a nightstand. I use it as a table to put bird food in the trays too. I love it. Put it together myself except my husband tightened up the screw bolt things to make it sturdier. I especially like how I can put it next to wall when not using and then park it in front of window to work. Of course it’s awesome as a standing desk which I use for short zoom meetings and if I know I’m going to be doing things here and there on my laptop during the day. I have hardwood floors, so it’s easy to move it around. Have had it for months now. Warning on white surface, it can stain slightly if you scratch it with a bright colored item. If you aren’t clumsy like me you’ll be fine.</span>

<span>I've used this daily for the last 12 months and love it. The first one had a bad cylinder and customer service was quick and responsive. I change positions sometimes every 15 minutes and the new one continues to work smoothly. I'm 5'4" and many similar tables didn't go down low enough. I learned the hard way to put something under hot mugs and dishes. There's a very faint ring on the white top that can't be seen unless you look very hard in the right light.<br/><br/>I would have given 5 stars if it didn't have a beveled edge. After searching high and low for a week, I finally found the Came-TV Heavy Duty C-Clamp Desk Mount. On top of that goes the WELLMAKING 2PCS Rapid Adapter followed by the CAMVATE 5/8" Male to 3/8" Female Screw Thread Adapter, giving  you a 5/8 male stud for a mic clip.

<span>Pros: Lightweight, rolls easily, relatively small footprint. It's a replacement for a larger more cumbersome one. Unlike some others report, mine is pretty sturdy. Holds my MacBook Pro and iPad Pro well, even side by side. Cheap price. Pneumatic cylinder works well although you have to lean on the table to make it go down, not a big deal. Pneumatic cylinders are supposed to have some resistance, wouldn't want it to go up and down too easily, We'll see how long it lasts, have only had it for a day.<br/><br/>Cons: Before I describe my assembly struggle let me say I'm a motorcycle mechanic, not a stranger to parts assembly and use of tools. Assembly instructions are less than stellar. Here's why: On my instruction sheet the picture of the top support shows a square base on which sits a round piece on which sits a square bracket. The picture shows the cylinder end going into that square bracket. Mine has no square bracket. The instructions also say that one must remove the plastic cap from the end of the cylinder that goes into the bracket. Mine has a small white plastic "cap"(?) Gentle tugging with pliers would not dislodge that cap. So I called Flash Furniture. I think they're in GA (770-721-8391). Fortunately the woman who answered was English speaking. I swear she announced her name was "Vicky". I also swear that in the background I heard another woman announce herself as "Vicky". How many "Vicky"s do they have there?? I explained that I purchased the product from Amazon and provided the order #. After not being able to find the order # in their system she said I must have purchased it from Amazon. Really? When I asked whether anyone there was familiar with this product she answered haughtily that they're a distributor and they sell thousands of products. But she'll try to help. So I explained that the square bracket shown on the instruction sheet is MIA. She explained as if to a toddler that sometimes the pictures are only an approximation. Hmm, but somehow the cylinder end has nothing to attach to. If I just push it in the lever pops it off. Perhaps it's because I can't remove the plastic "cap". The plastic cap absolutely has to come off; you have to pull on it pretty hard. So much for not knowing anything about your products. Well, she replied, that's just true of all cylinders. So now this woman who has no knowledge of the thousands of products they sell is a cylinder expert. While talking with her I tugged and tugged with increasing force but if that plastic piece is supposed to come off I'm a frog. By now she was barely hiding her attitude behind her southern drawl. She finally said she would send me a replacement top support. What's my name and address? I started to give it at a normal rate of speech but heard, ma'am, ma'am! MA'AM! I HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN SO YOU HAVE TO SLOW DOWN! No problem. What about the cylinder on which I have now damaged that plastic piece that she insisted I must pull off? She's sending a new cylinder too. In the end that's decent customer support but I could have done without the attitude.</span>

<span>These may be factory seconds, given that the price has been so low, however, I am writing this assuming that there is a standard quality they should meet in order to be packaged for sale.<br/><br/>The unit is not bad, by any measure. It functions and functions as described. That having been said, the Chocolate coloring is not paint (and I think we all know it isn't stain) but actually a PVC or poly-vinyl coating that has been sprayed on like paint. As such, there are some hairs and fibers, dust particles, etc. that will be permanently under this coating that you will never be free of, as with many products of this type. It is no worse on this unit than any I've purchased of this type and may actually be better on that front.<br/><br/>The PVC however, does scratch easily and, therefore, will arrive with scratches due to the standard Ikea type packaging of each piece separated only by a thin sheet of foam fabric or a waxy type of tissue paper. It etches, has oddly sticky places (due to melting) and the like, and the scratches are random in that some pieces were packed to keep the right side more protected but some were not. These imperfections can be cleaned gently with water and the pad of your finger and then a microfiber cloth (remember it is PVC so standard abrasives and even paper towels are out) or they can be left alone which is probably the safest option. Either way, you will see them up close but not from far away or even a few feet away if the room is not in full sunlight. Oddly, the instructions say to keep the unit out of full sunlight (presumably to prevent PVC melting), so this shouldn't bother you too much.<br/><br/>The unit is easy to assemble, if you use a tool to pre-poke the holes as the PVC coating is over/covering and inside the holes (which makes it nearly impossible to put the bolts into them without some cleaning out and scraping) but once you clean those tiny holes, they end up being the right size and the bolts will fit. All told, it is very similar to an Ikea kitchen cabinet base or bookcase with lots of bolts screwing into lots of holes, followed by lots of screwing tight those little circular gripper fittings on the receiving side/piece (that probably have a name but I've never bothered to learn it.) If you follow directions, you'll get it done in anywhere from one to two hours. (I took two, but I'm rubbish so figure on one to one and a half, two if you're drunk or have the flu, basically.)<br/><br/>The  pieces are differentiated, well enough, and marked, well enough, that they can be easily counted and sorted and a little screwdriver is included so you'll be able to work inside the tiny spaces you'll have to get into once it is mostly but not completely assembled. If you forget and close the little door after placing the magnetic strip but without installing the knob (like I did) just stick the knob's screw into the hole and pull the door back (and it will open so you can install the knob). That having been said, installing the knob first is better.<br/><br/>The casters are sturdy, all four roll well even on carpet, but they are not large casters so you have to go slowly or they'll catch up and the unit will tilt. The front two do lock, the back two do not and, for balance, given that they are staggered with the wide casters in front and the narrow arrangement in the rear, the unit has been designed very much with those magazines in the picture in mind. If you put no books, it feels a bit unstable, leaning back. If you put in smaller books, to the rear of the storage compartment, it starts to lean back, not enough to fall but enough to be nervous that it might fall. If you put books to the front of the unit or large books that occupy the entire space, then the unit feels very stable and doesn't lean. Put plainly, the books or magazines or files are meant to pull the weight forward a bit as it is back side heavy.<br/><br/>Overall, though, with all of that having been stated, this is the safest, most stable, and most attractive option I've come across in years of searching,  buying and returning, even with a PVC faux woodgrain finish. This is a high quality, for the money, standing desk for under three hundred dollars. It is strong, well built, does not lean too much or fall over and does not place a laptop in a precarious position on a bending metal arm and is actually mobile without having to pick it up and carry it with you, so, already, it wins against the competition.<br/><br/>The only other issue is the mechanism for raising and lowering. The bars are not drilled for the tightening knobs that hold it it place. It is designed as a pressure system, with little knobs pressing a blunt end screw knob into the rod to hold it in place. As a result, you don't have to look at unsightly holes but, rather, unsightly scrapings and scratches that form over time. Pre-drilled holes would have been nice but, again, it is still the best for the money and, most importantly, will not put your laptop at risk. Also, being adjustable, it allows you to sit when you feel like it, which I do about thirty percent of the time so, maybe you might too. Good luck in your starter standing desk search.</span>

<span>I absolutely LOVE this desk. I am an artist who prefers to stand most of the time when I am working on an illustration. I needed something to act as a desk that was multi-functional and was also easily adjustable from a sitting position to a full standing position, mobile, stylish, sturdy and affordable.<br/><br/>The Techni-Mobili Sit to stand laptop computer cart is everything that I wanted, needed and could have asked for all in one super affordable package.<br/><br/>Not only does it perform as needed it also has two foot rests on the side for when I’m sitting, an open magazine/storage cubby, a small storage cabinet with a pull down door, and a desk top within a desk top which allows me to set a drink, PS5/TV controller, and reading glasses when the adjustable computer desk is raised up for a standing set up.<br/><br/>The adjustable desk top has a small ledge to hold your tablet, laptop, sheet music, work or school folder, etc.<br/><br/>The desktop can be quickly and easily configured to go from a flat table top and adjusted to any angle up to about a full 90 degrees using the adjustable nobs which when fully tightened provide a firm, secure and study grip.<br/><br/> Once the adjustment nobs are well tightened with a just few turns of the nobs, the table is as stable and as sturdy as any high end piece of office furniture which you would easily expect to pay a few hundred dollars for.<br/><br/> The wheels lock and unlock with ease and when unlocked the desk rolls around with ease even when on the carpet.<br/><br/> This miracle piece of functional furniture is a must have for anyone who works at home as well as is a legacy fit for anyone who gives presentations or lectures.<br/><br/>When it is fully extended the desk stands nearly 5 feet tall or more when adjusted to act as a podium. I am almost 6ft tall and when standing with the desktop adjusted at about a 60 degree angle, the top of the desk sits at mid to upper chest level and when adjusted to operate in a flat desk configuration it sits just at or right below my sternum.<br/><br/>Whenever I use the desk in the standing position I feel like I’m a school teacher about to give a lecture to a class of students.<br/><br/>When I first began searching online for something that would allow me to stand while I was drawing, I saw a few other options that were available but as soon as I came across the Techni-Mobili and the price was far better than some of the other options as well as the desk was also available for prime next day free delivery.<br/><br/>I am so pleased with this product that I have even considered buying another one just to have around the house in case anyone needs it or to give one as a gift to one of my friends who is also an artist.<br/><br/> If you have been looking for the perfect mobile desk look no further and BUY one right now! Heck buy 2 if you can spare an extra $70 bucks.<br/><br/>You will thank me when you realize what a truly amazing piece of functional furniture the Techni-Mobili mobile laptop desk is.<br/><br/>If I had one tiny critique it is that I would have preferred that the lip on the desk was about a half an inch higher to give a little more room to better accommodate the extra thickness of a protective case such as the Logitech case/keyboard I use with my 12 inch IPad Pro. This is a minor issue which is really not an issue at all unless your desk is at an extreme near 45 degree angle and you accidentally bump the desk hard enough to cause it to slip off the lip/ledge.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has any need for an adjustable mobile desk or podium, it is well suited for home use, the office, classroom, board room, medical office or anywhere else you can think to use it.</span>

<span>Pro's: small, lightweight, rolls, adjustable, looks professional, easily transported in your vehicle if you need to use it multiple places or travel.<br/><br/>Cons: Adjusting Process.<br/>Overpriced considering the quality of adjustment mechanism (s).<br/><br/>Adjustments are all manual using the knobs and levers. The wheels are a little touch and go also but it still rolls.<br/><br/>There are no markers that allow you to remember your specific adjustment if you decide to sit or another person uses it. It does not adjust as a whole either. You have to manually check that both sides are even.  I'm going to use a permanent marker to mark my desired heights. The adjustment isn't always truly secure either so turn the knobs tight once you figure it out.<br/><br/>Last thing is this is not for tall people. I'm close to 5'5" and standing sometimes I wish it could go a tad higher. Otherwise it's something I use regularly and I'm pleased to have found it.</span>

<span> I'm particular about lecterns. I want size--big enough top to hold an iPad either portrait or landscape mode PLUS two books, one of which can go above the iPad if it's situated in landscape mode. I want sturdy--sturdy enough that I can lean on it with my elbows without it moving up or down or across the floor. I want an open front, not an ugly modesty panel or whatever. I want simple, modern and without flamboyance--no cute little curlicues or impractical contrivances such as weirdly angled or crossing uprights that are guaranteed to look outdated in ten years. I have a twenty-year-old lectern from a major furniture manufacturer that looked weirdly outdated when we got it and still looks out of time today--wood laminate top and base, 5-inch square aluminum column--that has become my ideal. It's not adjustable, but it's rock steady, has a large top that holds all I need it to and looks basically as new today as it did twenty years ago.<br/><br/>This lectern was the one I chose after a lot of agonizing over various lecterns on Amazon. I read reviews. I compared sizes. I put three very different lecterns in my shopping basket intending to keep the one I liked best for myself and place the others out in the building for general use--though I really didn't like the idea of a hodgepodge of lecterns. Finally, I took the other two lecterns out of my basket, deciding to go with just this one. And I'm glad I did. This is a great lectern. Why?<br/><br/>1) It is sturdy as can be. Heavy, solid, sturdy, despite being adjustable.<br/>2) The top is huge, accommodating all I want it to.<br/>3) It was elegantly packed and the pieces went together easily. Except for a philips head screwdriver, all the tools needed were in the package.<br/>4) I like the modern simple, kind of industrial look with matte black finish.<br/>5) The parts are heavy. You could work to bend the top of the lectern and you would likely fail without a hammer.<br/><br/>Enthusiasm for this lectern was universal in the office, including men and women.<br/><br/>Finally, two slight negatives.<br/><br/>First, I don't quite understand the reason for the bottom lip covering only the central 1/3 of the lectern's top--especially since the lip turns underneath the top on the right and left sides. I wish it went upward across the whole bottom edge of the lectern top.<br/><br/>Second, I would love to have some sturdy rubber feet in place of casters. The casters are solid pieces of rubber/urethane with ball bearings to allow rotation, but they can slide on concrete if you push on the lectern hard enough. Really nice casters, but I'd pay $10 more to have non-moving rubber feet included as well that could be put on in place of the casters. The casters DO lock. They're excellent as casters go. But I would prefer an absolutely stationary base over casters.</span>

I had no issues with misaligned holes, or painted threads, which is typical of cheap manufacturing.  Everything was perfectly aligned and well thought out.

<span>Overall a pretty great height adjustable desk. Very sturdy, and easy installation (took me about 20 mins). However, there are a few caveats.<br/><br/>1. As you can see from the pictures, the installation manual shows a way to screw in the adjustment cable in place at the bottom of the table, it also comes with the screws and clips, but as you can see from the other picture there are no drill holes for them which means you are supposed to drill them by yourself. I didn’t drill and cable sits flush to the bottom.<br/><br/>2. The surface of the desk top (and bottom) is pretty slippery. My MacBook slides at the surface pretty easily. Just a little risky.<br/><br/>3. The height adjustment mechanism consists of two steel cables. However, since the height adjustment is manual, as compared to some other tables where the mechanism consists of an electric motor, the amount of stress (pull) you would put on the cables would be different every time. This may cause uneven stress on the cable (just like bicycle break cables) and may eventually snap after prolonged use. But it will all depend on how frequently you adjust the height of the table on a given day and how long you plan to keep the table. In immediate use it looks like this will last pretty long anyways and especially since there are no electric motors involved there’s less risk of the motor dying on you and rendering the whole thing useless.<br/><br/>I ordered the 47x27” model, mostly because of space constraints at my home. I feel this size, although reasonable, could be smaller for folks who intend to use two 32” or 28” gaming monitors. But that’s pretty obvious given the length is merely 47”. Dual monitors of smaller Size should be fine. The edges of the desk are rounded so I am not entirely sure how well it will work with some of the monitor arms. But either way you will probably need to drill holes for monitor arms or even for cable management trays because it doesn’t come with any sort of cable management tray.</span>

<span>I just received my new Apex ALF 59 Pneumatic 59"x29" Desk! I shopped long and hard for a sit/stand desk! The more I looked, the more I kept coming back to the Apex Desk! I stopped by a local office supply furniture store and while they had some very nice desks, the desks that they had in stock were priced well above what I was expecting to spend.  So, if price is a consideration, the Apex Desk is fairly priced and well below what you will find in an office furniture store.<br/><br/>As for assembly, putting the desk together was not hard at all! It took less than 45-minutes to unpack and assemble! And, all the parts fit perfect! All the screw holes were perfectly matched up! The Apex Desk is sturdy and solid! There were no left-over parts!!! I did notice that there was no warranty card enclosed with the instructions. After I assembled the desk, I wrote to APEX and Eric (Customer Success Manager) wrote me back in literally minutes! The Apex desk comes with a 5-Year Warranty! The warranty alone should give you confidence to purchase the Apex desk! In addition, the Apex Pneumatic is very quiet and raises and lowers with very little effort. It moves very easily too!<br/><br/>In a nutshell, easy to assemble (you can do it yourself-no tools needed-the desk comes with an allen wrench!) Has a 5-Year Warranty. The Apex Desk is fairly priced! Home run!!!<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!<br/><br/>Steve C. in New Jersey</span>

<span>Written instructions always sound complicated and get you overwhelmed, but it still would've been nice to have more than just a diagram to study. But I finally got it put together and I'm sure its right. However it still isn't as sturdy as I would have liked...<br/><br/>Main problem: my mouse keeps sliding off (but I can probably fix that with a mouse pad soon). And the wheels don't roll well at all!!<br/><br/>I wish it could be a bit taller, then I could use it as a standing desk too.<br/><br/>I also wish it would extend further. I can't use this in my bed because it won't extend enough to cover my lap!<br/><br/>Trying to use it with my couch was impossible... The legs are too tall to fit under it unless you pop open the recliner and then the extended footrest gets in the way of this thing so you can't pull it up to you.<br/><br/>Honestly!!!<br/><br/>For now I've settled on using it with a chair and its still a bit better for me than a regular desk because I can draw on my tablet with out looking down the whole time. So I'm only subtracting 1 star.</span>

<span>This category of furniture is prone to the overpriced, ugly, and the cheaply constructed. But this product is none of those. So cheap I was worried, but turns out to be easy enough to assemble, sturdy, and just about perfect in size.  The lines are fine, as is the finish on the base.  The adjustments are really solid--enough that I don't think twice about putting my coffee mug on one side, Macbook Pro on the other.<br/><br/>The table surface is pretty much what you'd expect: very plastic-y "woodgrain" laminate. Not ugly, just never going to be mistaken for real wood or high-end.  My original thought was to cover it with a more interesting vinyl, maybe something like Black 3M DI-NOC Carbon Fiber DINOC Flex Wrap CA-421 24"x12"<br/><br/>But this table has been so handy, I began using it right away, and I'm not sure I'lll even bother with covering the "woodgrain".  In the modern world, woodgrain laminate is just about invisible.  And mine now usually has a book, laptop, or writing pad on top, so you don't see the table at all.</span>

<span>I purchased this for my husband when he was released from the nursing home thinking that it would be great for him to use for reading etc. The level of the table can be raised and lowered by a knob on the leg but it does not secure in place, just tightens against the metal. However, it does not tighten enough so that once raised you can then watch is slowly lower all by itself! It also has locks on the wheels that continuously apply themselves, so I try to roll it and it won't move. Overall it's a frustrating little table.....regret not returning it</span>

<span>I owned a fairly inexpensive bed table before this because I like to use my computer to play games while I'm lying (but sitting up) in bed. That one lasted almost 4 years before I had an issue with it, which was the tilt.  That is the problem with this one, except it's right out of the box.  You cannot lean on it to type without it tipping.  Now, if you want it tipped, it might not be a problem, but i want it flat, so this is useless for me.  Also, I sleep on the left side of the bed and this is set up to use on the right side.  My last table was, too, but since it stayed flat, I could just move my laptop over on to the side part a bit and use my mouse on the side that it wasn't intended to. Again, if you don't use a mouse, this won't be an issue for you, but I play games that require one.  Overall, I am disappointed with the product because it doesn't meet my needs.  If you have different needs, it might work for you, but I would suggest trying something else.</span>

<span>Exactly as described; very sturdy, portable and well constructed. The instructions were clear but it took me several hours to assemble. I admit I have bad hands and I’m generally not  proficient at assembling things but I did have to use a screw driver not included in the packaging and many of the holes had to be punched to make them wider. Other than the moderate difficulty assembling the desk cart, I’m extremely pleased with this purchase.</span>
