<span>Battery life every once in a while like any solar charged battery will need to be pulled and fully charged. Not every day is a sunny day and many over cast days in a row can drain the battery. Picture quality is no where near as HD as some of our non-cellular non-Solar Cams but are plenty clear enough to see what we need to see. We love these Cams for our most remote areas we don't have time to be pulling cards from frequently. It is easy to relocate then also when we need to check another area for inhabitants.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I recently purchased two LINK-MICRO-LTE-V cameras.  Set up was not as simple as I expected but to be fair, I did not have great internet service when initially setting up.  Now to the cameras, camera one works fine and sends pictures.  Camera two, nothing but problems getting signal connection.  The two cameras side by side had signal strength of 100% and 25%.  I spent over an hour with spy point representative with no success.  They said buy their batteries and that would solve it.  (batteries did not make a difference) as I tried what they suggested.  Tried to call them for tech support, the shortest wait time was 73 minutes so I never could speak to a human.  I emailed spypoint - their response was to call if I had questions.  I explain in the email I cannot sit on hold for over an hour, no response.  After trying to let them know that one camera must be defective and no help from their service reps, I have manage to figure out that one camera that works, interferes with the other camera.  This only goes one way which to me means that one camera is defective.  Now I have to return both or accept one might be junk out of the box and Spypoint isn't a great company to work with.  They claim they have a two year warranty on their product.  If so, why not just swap the brand new camera with one that works and try to keep the consumer happy rather than make them waste hours of time?  Good luck, it appears you get one that works or you get junk and Spypoint isn't to quick to work with you</span>

<span>I bought this and first of all the 100 picture free plan - well, that's a joke.  The camera took 100 pictures on the 1st day and they were of nothing.  Maybe the wind blew?  The 2nd thing, the website doesn't work for configuring the camera.  When I try to configure the settings for time settings, which btw, you can ONLY do on the website and NOT on the app, the system kicks out an error and you can not configure the settings.<br/>So the concept is great, but the free picture plan, the customer service, and the ability to configure settings is really poor.  I'm thinking of sending it back.</span>

<span>After trying it out with the 100 free photos, I decided to buy the premium unlimited photos. The photo quality is not the greatest but at least I get notified immediately when motion is detected. I bought this to watch over my camp lease. So I paid an extra 5 dollars for 50 HD photos. If you have a photo you want to enhance to HD quality, just pick the picture and click on the HD option and now that picture will be a little clearer. I'm just hoping if someone walks unto my property, I'll get a clear enough face shot to identify them.<br/>  I chatted with tech support about some questions I had before buying the premium and they were very nice. It took 15 minutes maybe for someone to come online but they eventually did.</span>

<span>I don't like the fact that my AT&amp;T phone data is fine, but the Moultrie is always stating "weak signal". If I had to do it again, I'd try the Verizon model.<br/><br/>Pictures are good and the AI works well at categorizing the photos.  I like the app that comes with it;. I have it set up to alert on all categories - human, deer, etc.  I had to zoom in on one picture before I could find the deer!</span>

<span>I got this one in AT&amp;T because I knew it was the best local option.  Battery life is better than the Edge.  I have left it in the Alabama woods for weeks without needing to change the batteries.  I also have it send images to my phone immediately after it takes the image (which is supposedly the hardest on the batteries).<br/><br/>Image quality also seems the same as the Edge camera.  The Edge might have advantages when you are moving the cameras around a lot and do not know the best provider, but if you know Verizon and AT&amp;T are available in your area I would save the money and get the Delta over the Edge.  Edge doesn't require and SD card which is its only advantage for me.</span>

<span>It was time we got a cell camera as our cabin is a 6-hour drive from home. I was looking for an inexpensive option and found spypoint to be a good deal. The camera is very easy to set up HOWEVER i would HIGHLY recommend you set it up at home and make sure everything works before taking it to the field. Customer serivce told me (while in the field) that the new cameras need the update and the update needs to be downloaded and installed via SD card into the camera. So please do all this before you head to the woods. Spypoint has a basic plan which is free (100) photos. These photos will go quick but the next plan is like 5bucks for 500 photos. I have my camera on my game feeder and it takes about 700 photos a month. Some of them are grass blowing in the wind but most of them are legit animals. AS you can see the picture quality is great and I'm not even paying extra for the HD photos. So far the camera has been at the cabin for 2 months and its reports 75% battery remaining. I also bought an aftermarket antenna. (not a spy point one as that was too expensive) I would highly recommend the antenna if you are installing the camera in a low cell coverage area. The antenna is cheap (Link at the end) like 13 bucks so just buy it in case you need it!<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/Bingfu-Waterproof-T-Mobile-Cellular-Amplifier/dp/B07R9JGLV5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=33VQWO6C7LPUB&amp;keywords=game+camera+antenna&amp;qid=1661375180&amp;sprefix=game+camera+antenna%2Caps%2C149&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzODJYNzhVT1dDS0RIJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTE5NDEzVUpUOFpJTDRWUFY5JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1MTMwMjkzOERYMTFNN1dTQVoyJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==</span>

<span>Worked great for just over 1 month and 1k pictures<br/>. Suddenly it stopped working. Narrowed it down to the sd cars cord. Customer service was a pain. They made me run through every little thing from batteries to firmware just to make sure nothing else was wrong. This tied me up for over 1 hour. They will be sending a warranty replacement however it may be 2 to 4 weeks. If they can come out with a more durable sd card cord this item will steal the show. Until that day comes this is no good to me if it doesn’t work, especially during the active deer season. FYI the cord wasn’t pinched in the door. I went as far as cutting a hole in the bottom of my older Bushnell camera to prevent cord damage. Oh well………</span>

<span>I wish Amazon would allow less than a 1 star review. I have been using multiple spypoint cameras and links for 3 years now, this is the first and last year for the links.<br/>Problem #1 - the coating on the wire that connect to your camera must be made with some kind of corn or soy based oil because the squirrels and raccoons will eat it before the corn in the bait pile. After multiple cables I have figured out a way to keep them from getting chewed but it’s not worth the hassle because even with good cables they don’t communicate As they should which leads me to…<br/>Problem #2 - just flat out unreliable. They will communicate and work perfect until you leave your hunting spot and get home, in my case 3 hours away, and then they will just stop after a day or two.<br/>So all in all I have 4 links, 2 link micros, and 1 link evo. All on Verizon and my hunting property gets great Verizon signal. I can stream video on my phone right beside all of the cameras (and the cameras show full signal).<br/>So with the equipment cost and the countless $15/month plans over the years i am probably at close to $1,000…and a TON of frustration! I have got very few months of consistent hassle free pictures. I will say the evo worked great for the 1st year, but now it just won’t connect. And I am fairly tech savvy and have followed all install and troubleshooting to a T…new sd cards, formatted correctly, updates installed, ect.<br/>So I have chalked it up to an expensive lesson and decided to move on. Being the nice guy I am I called spypoint and explained to them (very nicely) that I have decided to stop using their equipment and wasn’t calling go complain or ask for any type of refund but rather I though their company had great potential and I would like to send the cameras back to them for R&amp;D so they could better their product. The only thing I asked for was a return shipping label.  I got a very short and sweet answer of: we do not want them, throw them away.  I think that tells you what kind of company they are.</span>

<span>The camera came to me as a "Used In Great Condition" stating original packaging and minor cosmetic damage. I had to purchase a Verizon plan before it would even function, or even let me test it out. After testing it, I could tell it had an internal electrical short that would not let it work. That may be why it was returned the first time, or second, or third, or fourth. I wanted to stop the vicious cycle of passing the troubled unit to the next un-suspecting Amazon Prime Member. I feel if I would have returned it as it was, in beautiful cosmetic shape, it would have been passed on to the next un-suspecting Amazon Prime Member. I sent it back to the factory on my own dime. ($35). And I have spent $20 on a recurring monthly Verizon bill I may NEVER USE. Now I wait to see If it can be returned in working condition. But, I did save $17, by buying it from Amazon, in used-GREAT condition, on my purchase price.  But.........I did save other Amazon Prime Members the trouble of having to go through this themselves, by handling the problem with the camera myself. I only hope for a quick turn-around from the manufacturer. This is a review of the camera itself and no reflection on the delivery service, delivery person, online retailer, warehouse personnel, or fulfilment center. I may or may not be able to use a $100 Amazon credit for my trouble anyway.<br/><br/>Update: 11/28/2020. They sent me a brand new unit within a week. It seems to work well. There is a feature to remotely trigger a real time photo. It costs $.03 to do it. I send the command occasionally. I always get a response of a successful request. I rarely get a photo returned.<br/><br/>I get pictures to my phone of no apparent object. Once I got the tail end of a deer. I am trying to dial in sensitivity. I wish Covert had a better interactive site to help users with set up and function.<br/><br/>When SD card is collected, you get a better idea of what happened and more useful pictures. The useful remote information of what is going on at a given time of day is lacking.</span>

<span>This camera takes really good pictures. It is very well camouflaged in the tree where we placed it. We actually use it to track traffic coming in and out of our privately maintain road. In most situations, we can even read the tag number. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because, after the first month of superior service, the camera misses some of photos/traffic on a regular basis.</span>

<span>When I turn the camera on an let it boot, the camera will send a single photo (usually a close-up of me setting it up or some other silly pic). However, after this, the camera will never send another picture. I can walk in front of the camera, let it sit for a while and walk straight through its field of view, and I never get a single photo. In addition, we have animals that constantly parade past the camera all day long (2 donkeys and a half-dozen sheep). Not a single picture comes through.<br/>I'm sending the camera back for a full refund.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/>I started the return process with Amazon but kept using the camera for a few weeks. Unfortunately, the performance did not improve. The camera will trigger and send a picture if there is movement within 10 feet, but the reported "80 foot detection range" is wildly inaccurate. I can stand 20 feet away and wave my arms around and the camera just ignores it. Since we are using the camera for remote security at our property, it's unusable and, sadly, has to be returned.</span>

<span>Bought 2 but one takes lots of nice pictures but no animals. Even when I drove by it on an ATV, it not take any pictures of me! Something definitely wrong with its sensor. Honest;y , I have not contacted support but will do so. The second one is doing well, as far as I can tell but who knows what it is missing?</span>

<span>I have two of these at my cabin. One camera is covering the driveway.  I like knowing if anyone is walking up the driveway when I'm not there. I also can tell how much snow has fallen since the last time I had the driveway plowed. The cabin is off grid with solar panels and batteries. The second camera covers the cabin and solar panels. I have an alarm system that runs by batteries, so it's helpful to know if the solar panels are covered with snow and not keeping the batteries charged. It's also interesting to see an occasional deer or turkey walk by. I like getting an automatic photo every day, so I know the cameras are working and the status of the driveway snow and solar panels.</span>

<span>STAY AWAY!!!<br/>We had 3 cameras on a yearly data plan. Someone stole one of the cameras and SPYPOINT allowed them to activated it on a new plan. When the thief did that, it deactivated all of the cameras on our active plan. SPYPOINT did NOT contact us to verify that the camera was not stolen before activating it for the thief. They claim no responsibility for removing it from an active yearly plan and will not help by providing information so that I can file a police report.<br/>Don’t waste your money.</span>

<span>Bought 2 of these in Sept. I use the verizon plan.  Started w/ the free plan then upgraded to premium.  Great pics day/night. No issues. Solar panel works great; have not replaced batteries in 3 months. They are fully charged.<br/>I am ordering 2 more. I've had other brands that just do not perform. My cams are 400 miles away so the cellular is great. Really a valuable tool in developing hunting strategy/plans. After Dec I'll stop the cell plan til next Sept.</span>
