<span>I bought this on sale during Prime Days in July in order to more easily carry around my Kindle reading material and other tasks.  My iPad Pro is too large and heavy and a  my iPhone Max too small to read on comfortably.  I am very pleased with this lightweight tablet for reading.  The screen is just the right size and it tucks easily into most medium size purses.  Since using it for a while, I discovered that I am able to create a wifi hotspot with my iPhone and now this cute little tablet is even more versatile.</span>

<span>It functions good enough for making notes for school. Only problem is the battery is not good only last about 6hrs and that's using battery saving which basically slows down the device CPU and makes things slower. I even notice at max performance it has some lags now and then in terms of opening and closing apps, windows, or even keyboard launching. If you need a cheap tablet to make notes then this is perfect but If I was you I would save for a stronger version.</span>

<span>So I primarily wanted this for my photography. Something I could show my photos on to my clients without having to take around a big laptop. This this the trick and more!!<br/><br/>First the build quality is very nice. It has a metal cast matte feel to it. Feels very sturdy yet so light weight. The screen is nice and bright and is very clear. This just feels like quality.<br/><br/>A lot of reviewers want you to stray from buying the entry level model because it's "super slow and sluggish and not worth the money" but that couldn't be further from the truth. The fact is, this little machine can multitask very well. I even had a long list of updates to the apps that are already installed and it updated each in minutes and updated maybe 3 or 4 at a time. Done super fast. The browser is smooth and works just fine. It does have a very minor stutter when you load the web page but nothing to get into a fit over. I even tried playing YouTube videos and they work just fine. I pushed it to do 4K and it played very smooth with no stutter or lag. Your internet connection will play a factor but if you've got that good connection then you should have no problem at all. I also have my phone connected to windows and it works great. I can keep focus on my work without having to look at my phone when I can just reply on the tablet itself with no issues.<br/><br/>The only downside is, unless you really don't mind using it just as a tablet, I highly recommend getting a mouse and keyboard for it. At the very least a keyboard with track pad. Its very bad choice that Microsoft chose to leave these necessities out of the package. I highly recommend looking at less expensive alternatives to the Microsoft type cover and mouse. I have a $12 Bluetooth mouse and $30 keyboard that works just as well as the type cover. Both these devices have great connections and response times. These 2 devices are key for using this 2 in 1 to its potential. Specially if you're working from home or have some work to do.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great 2 in 1 for the price. At $399 I highly recommend this for anyone looking to do some simple work from home such as video calls, Office projects, or even watch movies and videos or just check social media and have something to take on the go. Works like a charm.<br/><br/>Fun side story, when I first got this, I was setting up the tablet. My 1 year old was getting curious and playing with all the accessories that I got. I put the tablet down and was moving the stuff. She grabbed my phone and threw it towards the tablet. The corner of my phone smashed into the screen. Not even an hour of owning it and its getting stuff thrown into it. Tablet was fine, glass screen protector never cracked, and phone was ok. Talk about build quality. Lol</span>

<span>I bought this primarily to use with teleprompter pro software, and it does a perfect job for that. Beyond that, it is a super little unit in many respects. I happen to have a touch-screen pen, which I think would be an essential addition. I also bought an Inateck keyboard for it at the same time - saving a lot of dollars over the MS version. Works great. And a Ketaky docking station for USB connections to my PC. Perhaps the best thing so far is the WiFi connection to our Roku TV. The reason for only four stars is I haven't had it long enough to evaluate battery life and storage capacity - but more importantly, because in setting it up, there is an "S" factor built in, which I discovered by accident - which is intended to pretty much keep you trapped into MS products (*browsers and apps). But you can switch it off, which I did. That said, maybe I should give it 4.5 stars so far.</span>

<span>I'm using the Gold processor with  8 gb of ram wifi only. I never understand the bash about this processor. It handles spotify, web browsing, installing updates or Office workflow just perfect. This isn't the fastes neither the smothest experience, but for the size, price and overall experience, it just works. Fluid and decent<br/><br/>Battery life is around 7 or 6 hours using 75% brightness and just wifi. But you can improve battery life with just moderate usage.<br/>Great screen, it looks nice and clean, sound is also great, not crazy loud but decent with clear voice and audio.<br/>Camera is top, better than many laptops.<br/>I would recommend a keyboard, The official one. Add a great value as a small computer but also work as a case for tablet use.<br/><br/>I understand people using Apple for the great apps and amazing product quality, same with Samsung and the best speakers and screen outhere. But this device stay behind in those aspects but still it has a great screen and great media consumption experience.<br/>Surface give you the chances to use this tablet as a small full laptop with real desktop apps and it totally defeats Samsung and Apple.<br/><br/>If you ever hesitate about purchasing this device, but maybe in the future you are planning to use a tablet as a small personal computer. This is the device to go.<br/><br/>I'm writing this review using Surface Go 2 with Windows 10 Pro. Still perfect</span>

<span>I have pretty much all Samsun products in my home from TV's to computers. I purchased this tablet after my DragonTouch died. While it is a bit pricey it has better features. One a long battery life I have yet to run the battery to zero.I use it for five to six hours a day and the battery stays above 50%. The storage is also great the picture took a little getting used to I thought it was poor at first it was just a matter of settings. If it is in your budget pick one up.</span>

<span>Updated 9/21/22<br/><br/>Beware the model they send you.  There is more than one model of the TabA8.  Unfortunately I received model SM-X200.  The Samsung updates to this model are horrendous and as a result pose a security risk to the user.  it is still on Android 11, One UI 3.1 and Android May 2022 security patch.<br/><br/>I read somewhere, not confirmed that Samsung is not updating this model of the TabA8 to Android 12 and may update it to Android 13 at some point in time after Android 13 becomes available.<br/><br/>I also have a TabA7 released one year before the TabA8  and Samsung updated my TabA7 to Android 12 months ago.  Also, Samsung keeps the TabA7 up to date on Android Security patches<br/><br/>The TabA8 works fine that is why I am not giving it a one star rating  It is also very slow to charge.  A lot slower than the TabA7.<br/><br/>I can not recommend the SM-X200 model of the TabA8 at all.  Maybe if you are in a different location this model of the TabA8 will update.<br/><br/>Updated 3/22/22 See bottom of review<br/><br/>Not reviewed for typos.<br/><br/>I ordered a 4 x 64 version.  The box said 4 x 64.  The actual device as a 3 x 32.  I contacted Amazon about the problem and they sent the correct replaement immediately and I received the replacement on the same date that i was scheduled to receive the original<br/><br/>Now about the Tab A8.  I had previously purchased a Tab A7 3 x 64 from Amazon.  You should be able to find my review of it on Amazon.  This review is bascially a comparison of the A8 with the A7.<br/><br/>First off.  I recommend against buying the A8, 3 x 32  It wasn't unitl I had used Switch to copy over my apps and data from the A7 to the original A8 that I received that I discovered they had sent me a 3 x 32 intead of a 4 x 64.  If you order the 64GB version of the A8 it automatically comes with 4GB RAM.<br/><br/>In any case the transfer of the apps and data from the A7 3 x 64 to the A8 3 x 32 took close to two hours using Samsung Switch.  Transferring the data from the A7 to the A8, 4 x 64 took less than 15 minutes.  There is no doubt that the extra 1GB  RAM and 32GB of memory makes a big difference.  The Tab A7 with 64GB is a very nice tablet but compared to the Tab A8 with 64GB the Tab 8A is signficantly faster.  I opened multiple apps and switched between them without any lag.<br/><br/>As I have posted before I am no gamer so I can't comment of the gaming capabilities of either tablet but when it comes to everything else including downloading and installing updates the Tab A8 64GB is noticeably faster than the Tab A7 64GB<br/><br/>The display comparison is bit more complicated.  The sharpness of the display is better on the A7 but the Tab A8 display at 10.5" vs 10.4" of the Tab A7 is more boxy and looks more like a desktop display than a tablet display.  I put up a video on the Tab A8 and a 23" Samsung desktop display monitor.  While some of the picture is lost on the Tab A8 it isn't a lot compared to the Tab A7 which crops off a good deal of the top and bottom.<br/><br/>For some reason, the Tab A7 has a better; i.e., signficantly louder audio than the Tab A8 both running on Android 11 with Samsung UI 3.1.  The Tab A8 audio is good for watching videos etc but the Tab A7 can give you room type audio when you are listening to music.  I can't judge the distortion but in any case while the Tab 8A audio is fine the Tab A7 audio is better.<br/><br/>While neither the Tab A7 or A8 batteries will charge very fast I haven't noticed much diffenece between the two with the Tab A8 charging a bit faster using the Samsung charging block and cable that came with the Tab A8.  No comment on battery draing speed as that will always vary based upon usage.  I ams satisfied with the battery drain speed on both the Tab A7 and Tab A8,  Then again I don't play games.<br/><br/>Final comment.  The Tab A8 is year newer so it came with Android 11 vs Android 10 for Tab A7.  So it should get one more Android update and Samsung related UI update down the road.  Both are nice tablets but the extra GB of RAM along with a different CPU makes the Tab A8 a lot more enjoyable to use.<br/><br/>Update 3/22/22<br/>Heptics -  The heptics on the Tab A8 are super sensitive which makes for very light touches.  On the Tab A7 the heptics are not nearly as sensitive.<br/><br/>Startup -  With the Tab A8 there is very little impact on usage immediately upon startup after logging in.  Upon login you should be able to alsmost immediately begin doing whatever.  On the Tab A7 you have to wait for software like anti-malware to do their thing after login before you can do much of anything.  The wait time will vary depending on your software.<br/><br/>For that reason I don't turn off the Tab A7 except when I know I won't be using it for an extended period, like a day or more.  I think the extra GB of RAM in the Tab A8 makes the difference since both my Tab A8 and Tab A7 are loaded with identical software including Android 11 and Samsung 3.1 UI.<br/><br/>Battery - Samsung UI 3.1 does a good job of saving battery after it learns which takes a few days.  Therefore, leaving the Tab A8 or Tab A7 on does not drain much battery once the devices are optimized by the Samsung software as long as you turn off the display when the devices are not in use.  I also recommend turning off the display for playing music, streaming or otherwise if you want to save on battery drain.<br/><br/>In order to assure continuous playing of music when the display is off you have go to the music playing app and turn on allow in battery saving mode.</span>

<span>The Samsung A8 is near bottom of the Samsung line up of tablets.  It comes in two memory sizes, 3gb and 4gb versions starting at 64gb of storage.  Let me start by saying, there is no reason whatsoever to buy the 32gb variant as it comes with only 3gb of physical ram.  That extra gig of ram is what makes this tablet worth the money.  I only recommend the 4gb variant, and find the 64gb storage model is really the sweet spot with this tablet.  So let's get into the review.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed is the weight.  It is a heavy tablet.  This is not a deterrent to me as I do most of my gaming using an Xbox controller (bluetooth) so I am not holding onto the tablet for long periods of time.  This is good because the weight of it becomes cumbersome very quickly.  The 10.5" screen is good, not great, but good.  The tablet resolution, while not fantastic does allow HD playback on netflix.  This is a nice touch.  There is however, a one inch bezel round the screen.  This makes the tablet look dated, as the era of large bezels is well beyond us.  The only good thing about such large bezels is it gives the user a place to put their fingers when holding onto the tablet.  The screen is quite bright, although the glossy surface does make use in bright environments difficult.  My biggest issue with the screen is that it does not brighten or darken well when there is a change of lighting environment.  This is a feature we have become used to, so it feels like a real miss in terms of ease of use.<br/><br/>There are four speakers on this tablet on top and bottom (portrait mode) and they get quite loud.  Don't expect audiophile quality here, but they do the trick, and were able to create a wide soundstage when watching a movie.  I would recommend the use of a quality earphone solution.  I use QE2 monitor headphones and the sound was much better.  There is no EQ baked into the OS, which is a letdown.<br/><br/>There are few buttons on the side, a volume rocker, power switch and an earphone jack as well as USB C charging.  It does support Bluetooth, which is good.  I was able to have music playing on the tablet, and wash dishes in the kitchen while the tablet remained in the living room without any loss in signal.  I also used it at the laundromat, with the tablet in a backpack, and was able to stay connected.  One thing that is missing with the Bluetooth is hearing aid compatibility.  While I can download the hearing aid app, connecting my aids to the tablet is another thing.  Most hearing aid connections are established through the accessibility options in settings, however, Samsung chose not to include any hearing aid connections in their accessibility options.  This is a huge miss.  Those of us who are reliant upon hearing aids will find their experience reduced as a result.  Considering this connection is just a software fix, not having it is a huge middle finger to the deaf community.  Shame on you Samsung.  The battery life is okay, but when connected to a 30 watt charger, it did recharge quite quickly.  Unfortunately it comes with a very low wattage wall wart, so I recommend buying a higher wattage charger.<br/><br/>This comes with Android 11.  I installed a few apps such as the Kindle app which surprisingly works much better as an app then the native program on the Kindle HD 10.  I also installed a few games, Asphalt 9, Castle Wreck, Bubble shooter and Klondike Forever and lastly the You Version Bible app. None of those apps besides  the kindle were available in the Kindle app store.  All the apps worked well enough, although Castle Wreck did cause the tablet to slow down due to the amount of rendering involved in that game, and the low amount of physical ram.<br/><br/>So why should you buy this tablet?  If you don't want to pay for a pad from another fruity company, but want more than can be had from the Kindle HD 10 this is for you.  That is really the best comparison to The Samsung A8.  Provided you purchase a 4gb model, it functions much better than the HD 10, the biggest advantage is native access to the Google Play Store, and a full fat version of Android 11.  Don't expect a feature rich tablet like the S line of Samsung, but if you are interested in light web browsing, casual gaming and reading, as well as streaming media playback, this tablet will work well.<br/><br/>So in the end, this tablet is a good enough introduction to the tablet market.  With the affordable price, it is a good tablet for children, classrooms with a good screen protector and case, or for that family member who could use a tablet, but would not have the use of a more expensive unit.  I started this review by recommending only the 4gb models, (64/128 storage).  Believe me, you will notice a difference.  4gb of ram is quite low by today's standards, and you will notice that in the performance.  Web pages refresh a little to quickly, and after a day of use, the tablet will become noticeably slower, requiring a reboot.  This can be mitigated a bit by fully shutting off programs, (swiping up, and swiping away open programs) as well as limiting notifications.  As of now, there is no indication that Samsung intends to update this tablet to Android 12, but perhaps there will be a work around.  Be careful, as the A8 is very low in specifications, and forcing a newer OS unintended for the product might cause it to age quicker then designed.<br/><br/>Overall the A8 does meet my needs, and while not wonderful in any way, it gets the job done under $400, which is a plus.</span>

<span>I've bought many different tablets that were under $100, and they were all so slow and bleh. The Fire HD 8 Plus is so quick and speedy, I mean WOW! I play games on it with no frame drops, quickly scroll and switch between apps with no lag.. It's insane how good this tablet is for the price. I'd honestly say it's the best tablet ever, simply because of that!<br/><br/>I have just one complaint about it, and it's that the only app store available is the Amazon app store, which doesn't have some of the apps I use from the Google Play store on my phone (Like Snapchat, Google Voice, Cash App) but it does have a lot of them, and I don't really mind not having them ALL on my tablet.<br/><br/>The Amazon App store is great, there are thousands of apps in it. Just don't expect it to have every single one you use on your phone!</span>

<span>I am a fan of Amazon's tablet offerings and have been for years. I do also have iPads, which I use for music related apps. but for everyday uses the Fire HD tablets are a very smart option.<br/>What I like:<br/>1. Price - you get a lot of computer for relatively little money<br/>2. Screen &amp; Speakers - Amazon has improved the resolution and brightness of their tablet screens over the last few years that rival Apple, Samsung, etc. Movie audio is crisp and loud enough, even streaming music isn't bad on the built-in stereo speakers<br/>3. Battery - on the 8" and 10" Fire HD tablets you will get impressive battery life, especially if you take the effort to power off if you won't be using it for a few days. The 7" tablet does not have quite the same battery life however, from my experience<br/>4. Everyday uses - Amazon's browser, email, office, games, entertainment, audio books, music, etc integrated apps are well thought out and work intuitively and efficiently on these tablets.<br/>5. Entertainment and shopping - if you're a Prime member the Fire HD tablet is really a no-brainer, especially if you watch Prime or other prescription streaming video or do any amount of shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods<br/>6. Alexa and Smart devices - the Fire HD tablets easily work together with your home Smart devices, such as Ring doorbells and security detectors and are quite versatile too. You can sync them with your Echo devices, TVs, security video cameras, etc. You can even use them to communicate with other Fire tablets in your home - almost like a video intercom system<br/>7. Updates - Amazon is always improving the functionality of their devices so new features often appear with OS updates. Basically you're getting more than you paid for over time.<br/><br/>What I don't like so much:<br/>1. Fire OS - Amazon has done a great job with their operating system but still has some work to do as far as multi-tasking, efficiency and compatibility with certain file protocols. Also the internal filing system and access to the SD card for storage is a little clunky. Transferring files from one device to another can be confusing<br/>2. Camera integration - the Fire HD tablets have decent cameras (well, the front one is decent) but they don't seem to play that well with the included photo app - and the filing system apart from Amazon Cloud is again, somewhat non-intuitive. This is something that obviously can be remedied with software updates, hopefully soon.<br/>3. 3rd party applications - Amazon is pretty strict about which apps can be used with the Fire OS (you cannot download from GooglePlay) so there are likely a few apps you like that will be unavailable - unless you hack the tablet to run as a straight-up Android device, which defeats the purpose of having an Amazon device in the first place. So..<br/><br/>That pretty much covers it from my perspective. The Fire HD 8" &amp; 10" are a real bargain in the Android-ish tablet market, IMHO. I really love mine and use them daily and believe you will love yours too!</span>

<span>...but it doesn't have to be one. Yes, I know, I'm comparing a $100+ device with one that at minimum costs several times more, but that's unavoidable. iPads are, after all, the gold standard of tablets, regardless of what those who stand firmly on the Android side of the fence think. Having said all of that, not everyone needs an iPad. For what it is, the Fire HD 8 Plus is a pretty decent device that will serve your content-consuming needs quite well for the price. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find any other Android-based tablet that even comes close to its functionality at the same price point.<br/><br/>So, a bit about the specifics. This device runs Amazon's Fire OS, which is basically a reskinned version of Android, minus the Google apps that come on most Android-based devices. If this is an immediate turn-off, fear not - installing the Google apps is a relatively simple procedure that takes no more than a few minutes. Even disregarding them, this tablet offers a surprising amount of functionality for one of its price point. The Amazon App Store has a decent selection of apps available, although I've noticed that a few of them seem to not be updated as often as their counterparts through Google Play. Again, though, if this is an issue for anyone, it's easily fixed. Needless to say, app availability isn't going to be a problem for most people.<br/><br/>Moving on, we have the specific focus of the device, which is consuming content, or more specifically, letting you line Lex Luthor's pockets. Fire OS is certain to take every opportunity available to shove content recommendations down your throat, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for good stuff to read or watch. Fire OS includes a recommendations section at the top of the home screen that gives you recommendations based on your personal info and privacy that you signed away by using Amazon's ecosystem. For voracious readers, this can be a big boon, especially for those who like to discover new stuff to read. For others, it can be an annoyance, although really it's not so bad as it doesn't get in the way of anything.<br/><br/>So, let's talk about the hardware real quick. The overall design of this device is decent, especially considering the low price. The casing is all plastic, yet not overly cheap feeling. In fact, it feels surprisingly rugged yet is quite light, meaning that you won't be straining your hand or tiring your arm during long reading sessions. The 8-inch screen seems to be the perfect size for reading ebooks. In fact, I much prefer it to the 10-inch model for this very purpose, as the latter seems to be a bit too unwieldy for my tastes. The screen quality, while nothing to write home about, is quite sufficient and doesn't detract from the quality of your time spent using the device. Still though, unless you're a stickler for color content, those who prefer reading bog-standard books may prefer a Kindle or other e-ink based device. But really, that's all just a matter of personal preference.<br/><br/>The internals of this tablet are decent, again, for its price point. The key here, though, is the price point. You're not going to get an extremely powerful device for just over $100, so don't expect this tablet to expand your productivity options or to give you a riveting gaming experience. As an example of the latter, you won't be able to run Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal on this device, as the hardware just isn't up to the task. For lighter games, though, it'll work fine. Just don't expect miracles.<br/><br/>Overall, there's more I could nitpick here, such as the typical laggy experience that cheaper devices suffer from when burdened by an Android-based OS, but I think most people can live with such things when it comes to low-end hardware. For what the Fire HD 8 plus promises, you'll get a pretty decent content-consuming experience.</span>

<span>This Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus is a great complementary device for those who already have a real computer.  This is true whether that real computer is a desktop or a laptop.  Windows 10 or Mac Os, it doesn't matter.  As long as you have a "real" computer, this Fire HD 8 Plus table is a great companion device.  Perhaps the best companion device for most people.<br/><br/>I work in the IT field.  In my opinion, most people overbuy and overspend on technology devices.  Which is fine, buying that new toy can be fun.  For a while.  But know this.  A lot of you what buy, you can do without.  Let me explain.  A computing device like a desktop or a laptop gives you the most versatility.  Add a smart phone and those are all the tech needed by the majority of people.  Most do not need a writing tablet to draw on or take notes on.  Most just need a secondary device for portability and quick access.  A Fire tablet will do that.<br/><br/>I own a Windows 10 and a Macbook laptops.  I also own an iPad.  Occasionally, I would use my Kindle reader and my old Fire HDX 7.  I only need three to meet all of my needs.  One laptop, my smart phone, and a tablet.  I only use the ipad to pick fights on Twitter, make quick purchases on Amazon, and check my email.  I may go on Facebook once in a while.  Guess what.  Any Windows 10 or Macbook would do those and with more versatility.  My smart phone would do all of those, although with a lot less versatility and more aggravation.  An Amazon Fire tablet will do all of those things, with more finesse and ease than a smart phone.  And just as well as an iPad.<br/><br/>I bought this new Fire to replace a 2015 Fire HDX 7.  The HDX 7 is still in perfect shape.  The battery holds as much charge as when it was new.  But it no longer runs the Amazon shopping app.  That's the only thing wrong with it.  My Kindle is also of 2015 vintage.  That Kindle is also still in perfect condition.  But this newer model has updates that I wanted.  Like front and rear facing cameras.  The HDX 7 only has a front facing camera.  I wanted to run the Amazon shopping app, for ease of use.  I also wanted to start a relationship with the charming Alexa.  It doesn't mean I'm dumping Sirri though.<br/><br/>I can readily recommend this Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus for most people who already have a true computer, whether it's Windows or Mac.  This is a great companion device for those who already have a computer.  It is a lot less expensive than an iPad and does almost as much.  It is also a lot more durable.  Most tablets are used for media consumption and social interactions.  You can do those on this Fire.  The only thing you might miss is a browser like Safari or Edge.  Silk works fine and it has gotten better over the years, but I still prefer a traditional browser.<br/><br/>I did not order the wireless dock.  This Fire will be carried with me to work.  Charging with the USB is fine for now.  I bought the Amazon protective sleeve that was made for this device.  You want to keep your Fire in some kind of a protective sleeve so the screen does not get scratched.<br/><br/>When you buy tech toys, find the sweet spot.  Always buy something that can be upgraded.  I have added more RAM as well as upgraded the hard drive to solid state on my 5-year-old Windows 10 laptop.  It still runs great after five years.  It is a high-end Lenovo model.  Likewise, I bought the Fire HD 8 Plus because you can add additional storage easily.  You cannot really upgrade an iPad.  I am not saying buy high end, but pay more up front and keep the device for a lot longer.<br/><br/>This Fire HD 8 Plus is a fine device.  No, it will not meet the needs of the artists who wants to use a pen/stylus to draw.  It will not meet the requirements of the busy college student who wants to take precise notes by hand on a tablet.  But it will capably do email, twitter, facebook, Amazon purchases, take pictures, make videos, ebooks, audiobooks, just fine.  The Silk browser has gotten better and works well.</span>
