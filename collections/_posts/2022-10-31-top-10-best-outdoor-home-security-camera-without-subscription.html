<span>I'm not what you would call a "power user." I haven't used it at night yet and haven't connected it to the cloud. I just like to check in throughout the day on my cats while I'm at work, and this camera lets me do that. I do wish it had a little more range of motion, because sometimes my cats go underneath the camera or off to the side where the lens can't reach. I may have to put it higher up on a bookshelf. Other than that, I'm very happy with it.</span>

<span>Was cautious about this camera because of the price, but I can tell you I was surprised as to the simple set up and the operation of this camera.  The directions are straight forward and the instalation and set up of the camera qas done in about 5 minutes.  I use it to check on my pets at home.  Experimented with the motion alert and was able to adjust the sensitivity enough that it detected my cat walking across the room.  Definitely would have no issues with detecting a child or adult moving around.  Using the on screen pan and tilt controls on my android phone works great.  Slight delay but works very well to pan across the room.  The night vision is very good.  In a completely dark room, the camera is able to show great details within the room.  Over all I am impressed with this camera and all its capabilities.  I plan on ordering two more for my house.</span>

<span>I purchased 2 Q5's a couple of weeks ago for home security.<br/>Pros: I love the crisp imagery and alarms/sirens as well as the 2 way communication. I love the range, the night vision features, the portability, the preset position features but most of all the ability to control the camera remotely by my phone. The very easy setup process with a very user friendly interface.<br/>Cons:<br/>The lag in the real time live feed causes issues with motion detection.<br/>I would love to see a toggle versus a press and hold button on the mic.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">This camera is fantastic around the house! I own a property in Mexico, there I keep some of this cameras, I love that I can have a look of what is going on in there from my house in the US, it gives me so much peace of mind, this means you can place the camera anywhere and use it from any part in the world thru the app which is very friendly to use. Very easy to set up, just make sure the back of you QR code is white, I had a bit of trouble since I had my phone in night mode and the back of the code was black, the camera didn’t read it like that but once I figured this out everything went smoothly. I have alarms set up for movement inside the house, sometimes it gets triggered by the change in light at sunrise and sunset which I like to see and it reminds me to take a look at the house every day. For me this has been one of the best purchases I have made. Excellent image and sound quality, specially night vision, also the sound and speaker system work great! Totally recommend this camera!<br/><br/>Esta cámara es fantástica para usarla dentro de casa! Tengo una propiedad en México, ahí tengo  de estas cámaras, me encanta poder ver lo que está pasando allá, me da mucha tranquilidad, esto significa que puedes instalar la cámara en cualquier lugar y ver las imágenes desde cualquier lugar del mundo a través de la app. Muy fácil de instalar, solo recomiendo que el fondo del código QR sea blanco, yo batalle al principio porque tenía mi teléfono en modo nocturno y el fondo del código era negro, la cámara no lo leía, pero cuando me di cuenta de esto, la instalación fue inmediata. Puse que me enviara notificaciones cuando hubiera movimiento en la casa y a veces la alarma se activa con el cambio de la luz del amanecer y atardecer, lo cuales me gusta ver y me recuerda a echar un vistazo a la casa todos los días. Para mí ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho. Excelente imagen y sonido, especialmente la visión nocturna, también el sistema para oír y hablar a través de la app funciona muy bien. Totalmente recomendada esta cámara!</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I didn’t have high expectations when I bought these wireless cameras, and actually thought I’d probably end up returning them, if I’m honest. After receiving the kit with 2, eufy 2c cameras &amp; the Homebase 2. I was pleasantly surprised by how impressed I was, especially because they were on sale for $170 for Prime Day!<br/><br/>I have one on my shed which is about 100’ (and some brick walls) away from the Homebase, and I have the other on the front porch about 20’ from the Homebase and they both get “great” full signal, according to the app. The Homebase is wired to my router.<br/><br/>The picture quality of the 2c is really good and I chose this model on purpose because HomeKit only supports up to 1080 HD resolution, and since I mainly use HomeKit I only need 1080 cameras, not 2K. That extra bandwidth needed for larger 2K video would essentially be wasted for me. They look great at 1080 HD anyway!<br/><br/>I have also been impressed by the battery. Before I hung them up I charged them both to 100%. At first they drained kind of fast because I kept moving them and one was focused on trees. If you have a bush or a tree in the frame, or anything blowing in the wind, it will drain the battery much faster, so keep this in mind. Once I had them settled in good spots with no trees or bushes the battery life has been extremely impressive.<br/><br/>They’ve been up for 45 days and one is at 45% and the other is at 36% (because of the trees). At this rate I should get about 70ish days off the first charge, so that’s not too bad. I think being settled now I’ll get at least 100 days from the charge going forward and I may add the solar panels anyway, we’ll see.<br/><br/>The motion sensing is very good and is adjustable as far as sensitivity. Take the time to configure this properly and you’ll also save battery. The cool thing about it is even if the motion doesn’t trigger recording because it’s filtered by the AI, it will still trigger the motion sensor for automation.  Works very well.<br/><br/>As far as “detection events” when it will record on motion, the eufy app doesn’t miss a thing. I haven’t had it miss a motion yet that I’m aware of. HomeKit, on the other hand will miss a trigger every now and then. I don’t blame the eufy cams for this because I have 2 by another brand that also will notify of recording from their own app but HomeKit will miss what clearly should be recorded. Hopefully as Apple improves HomeKit more this will get better.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on Alexa or Google home integration because I have not enabled them, as my ecosystem is mainly HomeKit and I have no echo show devices of Google hubs.<br/><br/>Overall these are extremely impressive devices. As long as configured properly the advertised battery ranges seem appropriate but your mileage may vary. I would recommend them.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading. Good luck &amp; have a great day!</span>

<span>The system works perfectly, it is very easy to setup, the quality of the image is great and notification speed is just awesome no matter where you are in the world.<br/>Also you don't have to pay any monthly fees and you have multiple options to configure the alerts and monitoring.<br/>I found a couple of downsides though that are mostly software related so hopefully those will be fixed soon:<br/>1.- You cannot configure the alarm to sound on the home base and the cameras at the same time if the system is triggered by a window sensor (I would prefer this to make it way louder. This function only works if the alarm is triggered by one of the cameras, then you can have the alarm sound in all the devices.<br/>2.- The setup with Alexa is still limited and you can only voice activate the system in "Home" mode but not on "Away" or other personalized modes. This is a bit disappointing to have that limitation.</span>

<span>Originally got Blink cameras and returned those in 3 days. They were pure junk (terrible picture, worse night vision, terrible sound quality and it had this awful digital squealing over the recordings quite often. Also, only sporadic motion detection). Did a bit more research and chose this Eufy set and the 2k set. The closed system with no subscription was the original appeal but the quality of the cameras themselves is fantastic! There's obviously a few choices out there and I've edited a few of them but these by far are my favorites for picture, sound, and motion detection. There are a few caveats to them but they are minor in comparison. I'll update on the features as the need arises.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>High quality picture<br/>Clearest Sound of any other system I've tried<br/>Excellent motion detection<br/>Night vision is the best quality I've seen thus far<br/>Human detection<br/>Range of vision<br/>Color or IR for night<br/>Spotlights brighter than expected<br/>The cameras construction is exemplary. Durable and water tight.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Instalation is finicky with several moving unattached parts that can be an issue. Especially if dropped and lost.<br/><br/>***my biggest con*** up to 3 Activity zones but they are only rectangles and cannot be uniquely shaped. This is a problem for those of us that do not have perfect rectangles or squares for property or are trying to avoid / capture certain angles.<br/><br/>No continued shapshot capture. This may not be an issue for everyone but it's one preferred feature I have of the Ring. The continuous capturing of a snapshot every 15 minutes or so is not an option on the eufy cameras. That feature has assisted us in capturing and timing of events in the past by capturing things that didn't trigger motion detection or more often are outside of our activity zones but still incredibly helpful.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>Absolutely would recommended.</span>

<span>I have had a 2-camera Blink setup for about a year, and the year prior ran just one Blink camera. I had an XT and an XT2. I had the XT on my front porch until I got the XT2. Then I moved the XT to my driveway, and put the XT2 on my porch. I figured the 2-way audio made a lot more sense on my front door. This setup worked.....okay. But it left me wanting more. I came across Eufy and decided to buy it, compare the two systems, and either keep the Eufy as my camera system, or return it if it wasn't an improvement over Blink. My plan was to test them over the course of a week or so, but I only needed 24 hours of testing to come to a conclusion. So here's what I found....<br/><br/>Picture Quality<br/><br/>Advantage Eufy, but only slightly. The picture quality is slightly better with the Eufy, but more importantly, it has a much better field of view. This allowed me to mount it closer to my front door, and still see a similar coverage area. This lead to better motion detection (more on that later). Night picture quality is also slightly improved.<br/><br/>Mounting<br/><br/>Advantage Eufy again. The mounting system is better than the Blink XT by a mile, and better than the XT2 by a much slimmer margin. The Eufy has a more positive positioning, without any fear that the camera may move. Rock solid mount.<br/><br/>App<br/><br/>Big advantage for Eufy. You just have so much more control over things than with Blink. You can set each camera up uniquely based on security modes (home, away, etc). You can have a camera record but not notify, for example. It also has geofencing that will place it into away when all phones on the account leave the house, and then back to home when at least one of them returns. It also separates the recordings by camera, and by day. Much easier to sort through the videos.<br/><br/>Motion detection<br/><br/>Another huge win for Eufy, and why I made the switch. The Blink falsed to reflections of cars driving by in the window all the time. No matter how I tried to set up the motion zones, or adjust the sensitivity, it falsed to at least a half dozen cars per day (and I live on a road with very little traffic). The Eufy has AI, whcih can be set to only alert to humans. That works really well. Also, the Blink would miss stuff a lot. Just today, UPS walked up to the steps of my porch, about 20 feet form the Blink cam, and placed a box on the porch. Nothing from Blink. The Eufy cam has him walking up to the steps, placing the box, and walking away. In fatc, the Eufy is the only way I even know how the box was put there (obviously I know UPS delivered it, but I didn't know the path the driver walked to get there, Eufy showed me that). I'm convinced part of that is because I could place the Eufy about 8' closer to the door than the Blink, due to the wider field of view. But that doesn't excuse falsing to car reflections.<br/><br/>Audio<br/><br/>Small win for Eufy. Audio is louder and clearer than on the Blink.<br/><br/>Power<br/><br/>Win for Blink. I had no issues getting the advertised 2 years out of the batteries. And when they needing replacing, it was a 5 minute project to take the camera down, open it up, swap in new batteries, and put it back up. The Eufy has rechargeable batteries that take 5 hours to charge. They are supposed to last 6 months. So when they need recharging, it will be a 2-part ordeal. Take the cameras down, plug them in, then reinstall after they are charged. One of my cameras (driveway) is mounted high enough that a ladder will be required, so  bit of a pain. We'll see if they last the full 6 months...<br/><br/>Video storage<br/><br/>Big win for Eufy. Blink stores their videos in the cloud. So when motion is detected, the video is sent form the camera, to the base station, then up to the cloud. Then you are alerted to the recording. It takes a few seconds to start playback as the app retrieves the clip from the cloud. That also means that without internet, the cameras are useless. Not ideal if you lose internet frequently. You are also limited to about 7200 seconds of recording before the oldest clips get deleted. The Eufy, however, stores its clips locally it's base station. It has 16GB of storage, which Eufy says is enough for 3 months of recording. There is also an SD card slot and a USB port for memory expansion should you need it (I doubt you will).<br/><br/>Light<br/><br/>A win for Eufy, but not an important one for me. The Eufy has a built-in light, that I will likely never use. Both cameras are located in areas that are pretty well lit, and when the lights are on, the low light mode works well. I could see using the light to scare away someone who wouldn't have otherwise known there was a camera, but I likely will never need to do that.<br/><br/>Price<br/><br/>Win for Blink. You can get a 3 camera system for about the same as a 2 camera Eufy system.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>My Blink system has been annoying me for quite some time, with its non-stop false alerts and missed delivery people. Both of those seem to be resolved with the Eufy system, at the expense of less than ideal recharging twice a year. To me, though, that was a trade-off I happily made. What good is a security camera if it misses things?</span>

<span>I've had the system for more than two years now and to be honest, it's pretty good.<br/>A- Though limited in exactly how far it can see at night, (From garage to end of driveway just beyond my parked vehicles), it triggers nicely.<br/>B- I love how where in the view, you can set the motion tracking. (There's a grid you can use to tell it where to watch for motion in the image. AKA: I can filter it to NOT trigger off my neighbors headlights)<br/>C- I love being able to bring up the live view of any camera on your system. (It takes a few seconds and it will ask you after about 10-15 seconds if you want to continue, so there's that.)<br/>D- It's weird how I keep getting videos popping up from previous nights, (not last night, but several nights previous). And sometimes the replay injects weird, full daytime looking imagery in the playback.<br/>E- Love how I can upload from within the app to my YouTube (or wherever) channel.<br/>F- IT IS A REAL BATTLE swapping out batteries.<br/>F1 - Once the camera is dismounted from the base, it's super easy to unscrew and replace batteries, and closing it back up.<br/>F2 - Snapping it back into their mounts is a real (expletive)ing battle. Knowing I have to tackle that makes me dread the battery change.<br/>F3 - If I were to add a photo to this review, it would be of my grimacing painfully while trying to pop the cameras back into their base.<br/>G - Yes, the Lithium batteries do last 2 years... but it's dependent on how much you use the cameras interactively. If you use them to look at blind spots around your house, the batteries for those particular cameras will poop out faster, but that's a minor nit, though I try to use them sparingly to not have to deal with issue F!!!<br/>H - Love how I can talk to someone through the cameras and hear them very well.<br/>I - I DO NOT appreciate the fine detail when a nighttime spider rudely crawls across the lens!  Ick.<br/>J - I live in the HOT and FREEZING desert and they've held up well through the seasons so far.<br/>K - Love how I can customize exactly when the system will turn on and off.<br/>That is all I can think of for the moment.<br/>OH - I wish I could access my cameras from a desktop and not be limited to just my phone.<br/>OK.. now that is all... for now.</span>

<span>If your looking for easy and inexpensive as I was, Blink is the way to go. Adding a camera to the system is as easy as scanning a QR code. The video quality for the price is exceptional even at night. I like the way you can schedule the system to arm and disarm automatically at night in a very granular way on a 7 day plan.<br/><br/>It took me about 20 minutes to set up 5 cameras with the sync module and I did it all from my old iPad. Today I access my cameras from Android and iPhones as well as my iPad and my desktop PC. To make this work on a PC you need an Android emulator and there are many free ones to choose from. I use a popular program called BlueStacks. Looking at your videos on the big screen is often very handy.<br/><br/>I also linked it to my Alexa devices. A very handy feature when connecting them is that you can verbally arm and disarm the system. That feature alone makes it worth the effort of the setting it up. You can hands free arm and disarm the system as you come and go. Alexa can also announce movement on all the Alexa devices in the house. "Movement at the backdoor!" "Movement at the Driveway!"<br/><br/>TO be fair, it's not the most feature rich CCTV system, and sometimes you need those advanced features. However my entire family can use it with no trouble at all. From little kids to grandparents, everybody gets it.</span>

<span> FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data..  I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨<br/><br/>UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.<br/><br/>The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.<br/>👇😕<br/><br/>This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍<br/><br/>The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.<br/><br/>So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.<br/><br/>Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.<br/><br/>After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐<br/><br/>This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍<br/><br/>UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.<br/><br/>Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.<br/><br/>I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.<br/><br/>Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.<br/><br/>The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍<br/><br/>Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.<br/><br/>Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.</span>

<span>I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy.  I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly.  Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there.  The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions!  Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order.  I should have been.  Inexcusable that there were no instructions.  I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful.  But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues.  I am after all a klutz.<br/><br/>The first step in installation is to download the Blink app.  Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer.  It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone.  Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC.  I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand.  I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.<br/><br/>The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap.  One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras.  I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating.  First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate.  You need to take that plug out to access the screw.  The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw.  Simple right?  Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off.  I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed.  Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off.  (I warned you that I was a klutz.)  Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body.  That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions.  But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on.  Why?  Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers.  Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way.  The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.<br/><br/>Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps.  The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps.  But here's another setup klutz problem I came across.  To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located.  Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky.  First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to.  But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached.  So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera.  The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.<br/><br/>OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block.  Again - no guidance because no instructions.  Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected.  OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.</span>

<span>UPDATE 2: I now have to unplug and reconnect the chime daily to keep the doorbell working.  Connectivity is horrible and the unit is offline almost constantly now.  This product does not seem well designed from this aspect.<br/><br/>UPDATE 1: As of 11/16/20, the video magically started working in Alexa. I don't know if the Alexa skill has been improved, but I was able to view live video a couple of times. However, this seems to come at a cost as connectivity has become even more of an issue. The chime is plugged into the same outlet as the router, and the doorbell is within 10' of it, yet it will not stay consistently connected. This effectively makes the live stream irrelevant if I can't connect to the doorbell.<br/><br/>Bottom Line Up Front: I hate to start with the negative, but there are some fatal flaws in this design that make it almost useless for me. The first one I received was "Dead On Arrival", but Amazon shipped out a new one immediately and I had it 2 days later. As for doorbell specifics, see below:<br/><br/>1. There is no way to send the videos and recordings to a network storage center or download them all at one time.<br/>2. You cannot view the camera live feed from within Alexa/Google Home. **This started working 11/16/20**<br/>3. You have to remove the doorbell to charge it, and that takes about 6 hours, so no doorbell while charging.<br/>4. The chime ONLY works with the doorbell, and not the floodlight cameras.<br/><br/>Here is more more in depth information on what I see is wrong with this device:<br/><br/>For starters, the fact that I cannot easily get all my videos at one time for off-line review without removing the Micro-SD card from the chime is a total failure. The chime is connected to my network, I should be able to download all the videos to either my PC or my Phone without removing the storage card. Continually inserting and removing the card causes excessive wear on both the card and the chime and could be easily avoided with a simple download option.<br/><br/>Follow that with the fact that I cannot view the live stream in Alexa like you can with other Eufy security cameras (except the floodlight cam, which I will review separately) is a very poor decision and needs to be addressed. If I am in the kitchen, with my Echo Show, and my phone is upstairs when someone comes to the door, I can't just pull up the video feed on my Alexa device to see who is there. That leaves me 3 options, stop what I am doing to answer the door, stop what I am doing to go get my phone, or ignore it. None of these are an ideal solution if I am in the middle of something else. at least with live feed compatibility I could see and interact with my visitor without stopping what I am doing. My Ring doorbell was perfect for this, but the subscription was too costly to keep it.<br/><br/>Next up, why the charging port is on the back of the camera in a location that REQUIRES removal to charge is beyond me. If you are not going to use easily replaceable/rechargeable batteries, then the charging port should be accessible without removing the entire doorbell. Perhaps putting it on the side or bottom of the device? That would allow the possible option of connecting to a solar panel, or a backup power-bank, or even running a cable to an outlet to charge it without losing your doorbell for 6 hours. A simple solution could be to provide a mounting plate that allows you to move the charging port so that you don't have to remove the doorbell for 6 hours.<br/><br/>Finally, the chime is nice, and acts as a "mini homebase" but it ONLY works SPECIFICALLY with the doorbell it came with and will NOT allow me to integrate it with my Eufy floodlight cameras or any other Eufy cameras. I tried to setup my replacement doorbell with the first chime and it would NOT accept the doorbell as it is somehow tied to the one it is shipped with. I don't understand why, this makes no logical sense to me.<br/><br/>If you have stayed with me this long, then here are the good points of this doorbell cam:<br/><br/>The video quality is great, even at "only" 1080P like quality. I would say that it appears to rival my old Ring camera which was exceptional. The framerate it records at is lower though, so the videos can be a little choppy, but still very good.<br/><br/>Responsiveness is fantastic. Notifications arrive quickly and the app loads up fast when trying to view visitors. This is MUCH faster than my old Ring video doorbell.<br/><br/>Audio quality is also very good. One drawback here is that it only records one side of the conversation, but that is outweighed by the fact that it is a clear audio stream and not muffled and distorted like my Ring was.<br/><br/>Connectivity is okay. I am calling this a positive because it doesn't disconnect as much as my Ring did, but it does still suffer from some connectivity issues. I suspect that this is because of the low power wifi signal used to connect to the chime. I know this is a battery conservation mechanism, but I wish there was an option in the configuration to use a higher powered signal to help keep it connected better.<br/><br/>The chime is included. Despite my issues with the chime, the fact that it comes with the doorbell is a big bonus. I had to purchase the Ring chime separately for my old doorbell. I do wish it had more ringtone options, for example, my wife REALLY liked the "Westminster" chime of the Ring, but there is nothing close on the Eufy, and no option to "upload" chimes.<br/><br/>Will I keep this doorbell? With no fees for recording, then I have to say yes, until I find something better. The reality is that a lot of the problems with this device simply boil down to poor design decisions that could be easily rectified if Eufy chooses to do so. However, until there are solutions to the problems, I will use it while I keep looking for a better option, then it will go in the trash.<br/><br/>I will update this review if Eufy addresses any of the issues I see with this kit.</span>

<span>I have to start with the negatives first so that you understand why I only have it four stars. One would be the chime. I would have liked to assign a custom chime for both indoor and outdoor. (I was thinking on putting on a certain part of an Elton John tune.) The second would be the battery life. I'm at having this up and running for about two weeks, and batter power is now down to 25%. To be fiar, however, this could be an issue from the hot weather that is currently gripping the entire US. My last negative... I couldn't get things completely up and running until I had a MicroSD card in place, and even though the card was newz it kept asking for a format. Oh and it isn't clear on how to access recorded history.<br/><br/>Now... The positives. It is HYPER SENSITIVE. I LIKE THAT. I have kids who trespass on my property and I have been able to tell them they can't do that according to the bylaws of the development. I had FedEx show up and I was able to tell the delivery driver to hold on a minute and run some cold water out because it was over 100 degrees outside. And I was able to see that a cat was running up on my porch at 2 am. (The night vision is excellent, even though I keep a porch light on.)<br/><br/>What sold me on this was two things. One the parent company of eufy, which is Anker. They have high quality items. The other selling point was that there is no additional fees to maintain it. There's no costly cloud storage fees, nothing. And because this house wasn't wired for a doorbell, it was imperative to have a wireless one. Now this can go with me if I move because I own it.<br/><br/>It's well worth looking into, easy to set up.... Just those small negatives that shouldn't stop anyone from buying this.</span>

<span>I would highly recommended this camera. It’s efficient, easy to use and I am a single mom with 2 kids. I am telling I feel so safe knowing I have these cameras. I had an issue where one went offline and I couldn’t even figure out the issue. However I contacted the manufacturer via email. It was the most easiest process I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t understand what the kind gentleman was saying via email so I requested he call me. Not only did he send me a replacement and never asked for the defective one back but He called me immediately and assisted me to get the new camera and the defective one working again. He told me to keep all of them and he was so kind, professional and he knew exactly what he was doing. I spent 3 days attempting to fix the device he walked me through the process in less than 5 minutes both were back on line. Mr. Justin went above and beyond to ensure me and my family were safe and I couldn’t be more grateful for his actions.<br/><br/>Thanks Justin and thank you LaView it is truly appreciated.</span>

<span>These are great IF YOU GET A SUBSCRIPTION, but not as much if you don't. The reason I bought these over other brands was that they didn't require a sub and said they had SD card slots, I assumed they would record to SD cards. They do, if you have a subscription, but if you don't it just has the slots. I gave in and got the sub, I was on the fence about it anyway, the price is discouraging but the cameras are great. I gave it a 3 on motion detection because of odd behavior like recognizing a banner as a person, but overall it's better safe then sorry. Without a subscription there is only really live view, the intercom is fun too when peeking in on loved ones.</span>

<span>I got this because of the flawed Control4 system pre-installed in my house. I am generally satisfied. The positive aspects:<br/>1. Extremely sensitive motion detection (making me set the sensitivity to the lowest setting).<br/>2. Easy-to-mount.<br/>3. Decent video quality (but not as good as Control4 or Wyze, Kasa).<br/>4. Easy to check videos and operate remotely (a big plus).<br/>5. No need to get a subscription (the most significant plus).<br/>I am unimpressed with the 1-2 second delay between pressing the doorbell and the chime ringing inside the house and another 2-second delay in viewing the video. The battery is supposed to last 120 days, but I doubt it. In my case, it likely lasts about 70-80 days (see the screenshot). Overall, however, this is a good product.</span>

<span>This only lasts about 2 weeks when it's supposed to last 4 months and it doesn't go off that much. We had to get a plugged in camera upstairs for motion because the doorbell goes off so little and we put it at max sensitivity. Sometimes it goes off for someone walking on the sidewalk or driving by but not that often. Really it has to be someone walking up to my door to set it off. The picture quality could be better. Can't read a license plate of a car parked outside. People far away are blurry. I like that it doesn't have a monthly subscription fee but could be better.</span>
