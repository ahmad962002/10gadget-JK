<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this speaker for good value and some fun. I knew I was not going to get high-fidelity. I expected the lows and highs were going to be weak or non-existent, and I was not disappointed because I got what I paid for. It is lightweight for its size and thus probably had a puny magnet. I bought it anyways because I just needed something for camping and karaoke. I also bought the Pyle wireless mic kit and it worked perfectly with this speaker, except the echoing was not adjustable on the speaker or mic. Overall, I give it 3.5 stars but had to round it up to 4.</span>

<span>Since I am a Zumba instructor, I was looking for a portable system with good base and sound. I saw the reviews and decided to take a chance with the purchase. I’ve used it for four classes so far and it works great. My class is on the lower level of a university’s recreation center and the sound and sound quality is excellent. I can hear the music even when I’m on the second floor before class starts. The lights only work with the music turned up to a very high volume. But that’s not a deal breaker for me. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the device does not have a pull out handle; which makes it very awkward to roll inside because I have to walk slightly bent for the entire walk. Also, the device is somewhat heavier than I anticipated. However, I like that it also has handles on the side; this makes it less awkward to carry. Overall, so far so good.</span>

<span>Good evening,<br/><br/>As a long time JBL user (I have the JBL Clip 3 and JBL 650BTNC wireless over-the-ear headphones), I decided to get this Sony Bluetooth speaker because:<br/><br/>1. I wanted to try something different.<br/>2. It was cheaper than than the Clip 4 at the time I was looking for a new speaker.<br/>3. Sony has better quality in sounds and audio devices.<br/><br/>Review after having it for two weeks:<br/>It definitely is better in terms of higher pitches. The sound quality is clearer and I haven't needed to charge it yet after two weeks (uses it about every day or other day for 3 hours on average). The build is not the rugged type like my JBL Clip 3, so I bought a silicone cover ($12). I like to have that extra protection just in case. The shape of the device is not bad, I like that it can stand on its own and I can hang it because of the strap. I like the removeable strap, and how it comes with the same color as the speaker. It is a little wider than a regular plastic bottle so, if you have a water bottle pocket on your backpack it fits there perfectly, or simply use the strap. Overall, a great speaker and worth your money.</span>

<span>I take these wherever I go around the house and they effortlessly deliver cleverly rich wireless stereo sound (when you buy a second one and link the two together).  For me, it was totally worthwhile to get two.<br/><br/>These tiny speakers sound like they are much bigger than they actually are.  They actually have decent sound quality in the midrange frequencies and don't distort at higher volumes, a feat most tiny speakers fail to pull off.  The active subwoofers really pump out the bass too.<br/><br/>For this sound quality, I feel that these speakers are an excellent value for the money.  I am simply delighted with this purchase.</span>

<span> It is not as loud as jbl speakers in its price range but it is loud enough to be heard several feet away outside. I work outside in urban community gardens and there is a lot of noises competing on being the loudest.<br/><br/>My usual work day is shoveling stuff and so sound of several shovels scraping can be pretty loud. I keep the xb33 at 100% and the music is not drowned out by outdoor sounds. The speaker last about 8-10 hours at full volume on live mode or extra bass mode. Stamina mode can last 24 hours but it feels pointless to drop that much on a speaker and not use it's full potential.<br/><br/>One of my coworkers has a jbl charge 5 but everyone prefers my xb33 despite it not being as loud. The xb33 makes up for its lack of loudness by having a much better balanced sound stage. You can hear every instrument and detail clearly and it doesn't get lost when you turn up the volume. The jbl speakers aeem to only focua on vocals,, mids, highs, and booming bass. The same songs can sound noticeably different on each speaker.<br/><br/>Regarding music, this speaker is versatile. I use it to play trip hop, hip hop, drum &amp; bass, jpop, rock, metal, soul, funk, dub, Latin jazz, orchestral, house and pop music and it all sounds great on it. The speaker doesn't have bias for any genre or elements but with the equalizer app you can get some customization. I have a video showing off the different songs I have playing on it.<br/><br/>The range is fantastic and lives up to marketing. I had coworkers pair to my speaker and the walk offsite to do something else. Their phone would still be playing music through the speaker after they left but once they left the 66 feet range then it would disconnect.<br/><br/>It lives up to being waterproof I used it in the rain and it worked perfectly fine. I spilt soda on it and ran water on it and it wasn't damaged at all either. I never worry about getting the speaker dirty because I know I can rinse the dirt off.<br/><br/>I bought mine used for $60 and was surprised by how new it looks and perform. Don't be afraid of buying these used if you wanna save some money.</span>

<span>This is the BEST Bluetooth speaker FOR small groups and back patio gatherings. It is pretty loud in a bedroom or bathroom.<br/>Bought it for golfing and swimming pool gatherings of 6 people or less. I use it when I play golf. It has rubber bottoms and sits against the windshield of the golfcart perfectly. The sound is balanced, with heavy bass. This is my second Sony speaker of this size. My first sony speaker was stolen! I loved it so much that I bought it again. It has excellent sound balance &amp; terrific sound quality!! The bass on this is the best I have heard ever for this size speaker! I keep my iPhone in my pocket when golfing and control the volume/songs playing through the speaker from the putting green. So the Bluetooth range is reliable. Great speaker for GOLFING!!</span>

<span>I dont' have a picture, but this product was the perfect gift for my husband.  He loves his music and carries this speaker everywhere he goes around the house, outside, on the porch, to the garage, etc.  I just might have to get he a couple more so he doesnt' have to carry it around.</span>

<span>The Sony SRS-XB33 lives up to the hype and then some. In fact I can’t find a thing to criticize. As a matter of  fact I’m about to purchase another right now. And I’d be lying if I said I’m going to gift it. Nope. It’s for me, me, me. A number of similar Sony BT portables have the ability to pair with another for stereophonic listening bliss. This is a pleasure I’m certain you’ll want to experience for yourselves. Treat yourself!</span>

<span>After purchasing this speaker in 2020, I have now purchased a second.  A full charge lasts for hours of play time including the flame light on low setting.  Everyone who sees and hears this speaker, inquires where to purchase it.  I've tried many others and this by far is the best!</span>

<span>Bought one, then a few days later order the second one. Much better having stereo. At least on my patio.<br/><br/>The sound is little tinny and needs more base. Then I’d give the sound a solid 5.<br/>Hopefully they’ll do that one day. Good for background music.  But for the money and look, it’s a good value.  Great conversation piece with the optional light. Plus being wireless makes it nice.<br/><br/>O yeah, the Bluetooth is a bit weak from my iPhone 11, playing pandora. But not annoying enough to worry about.<br/><br/>I’ll get my $350 worth out of them. Taking them where ever I go, day or night!!😊</span>

<span>Works as advertised but sound quality is poor.  The cheap sounding speaker has severely rolled off highs and absolutely no low end.  After hearing this speaker at home, I shopped around and ordered the Soundcast VG5.  I didn't want to spent that much but the difference in sound quality is huge.  I returned the AR Santa Cruz.</span>
