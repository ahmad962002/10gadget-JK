<span>If you are looking for a great ANR headset, look no further! Most people I know use the Bose A20, and it is indeed a great and very proven headset, however I have this natural bend to always search for something that is different than what everyone else always gravitates toward. As a Motorsports enthusiast this headset really caught my eye, I have always appreciated the look of bare carbon fiber. In person these things look really pro, and have a nice gold metallic logo that is integrated underneath the clear coating (so no worrying about the emblem gradually getting worn away over time). These things are super light! I wore them during a three hour cross country flight the other night and you almost forget they are on your head. I have seen that some complain about wearing them with sunglasses underneath the ear cups/ that the clamping pressure is a little too much. In my experience, I have had no such issue. Audio quality is excellent and the ANR functionality is truly quite effective, though it still allows you to hear enough tone in the engine to know if something were not sounding right. Only slight qualm, and i really do mean slight, the cord length is a little on the short side. For us general aviation flyers, really not an issue, and if anything, and aircraft depending, it may prove to be an advantage with having less cord to get tangled or looped around something. Though, I can see how one may desire a bit more cord length if their aircraft's cabin so demanded. But again for most users this is negligible!<br/><br/> Summary: Light, Comfortable, Excellent Audio Quality, Effective ANR,Competitive Pricing, Looks Way Cooler Than The A20's (The Pagani Zonda of Aviation Headsets for those of you who are super car fans ;) )</span>

<span>I purchased this set in 2018.  It worked great.  Good noise canceling and battery life.  The older models like I bought have an auto shutoff that was problematic. They are replacing that set with one that doesn't automatically shut down.<br/><br/>The head tension is adjustable.  I wear a 7 1/4 hat and they don't hurt me at all.<br/><br/>I have since  bought a David Clark 1X which has great  noise reduction and a FIVE YEAR WARRANTY.  Not sure yet how it compared to the G3 in noise cancelling but I believe the 1X is better.  It gets really quiet.</span>

<span>Very light weight and the features are great, but the headset is really tight on my head.  At first I didn't think it would bother me, but after doing just .8 in the pattern I couldn't wait to get them off my head.  For reference I wear a size 7 1/8 cap.<br/><br/>The sound is strange...almost metallic? It's not the aircraft.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but it made listening to AWOS and traffic a little tricky.  These would work well for a passenger so long as they don't mind the headset tension.<br/><br/>On the up side, the bluetooth paired quickly and easily, the sound priority switch is pretty clever, not sure if other brands have the same feature.<br/><br/>I returned the product for the discomfort and sound reproduction from the avionics.  Again, these would work for a passenger as long as the tension didn't bother them and they had no need to make radio calls.</span>

<span>Overall good value.  Bought as a backup set beside my David Clark.  The DC set is leaps and bounds better quality, but if you’re on a budget these are fine.  I find I have to immediately make adjustments for the mic pickup, where the DC’s are more forgiving and usually on point with no adjustment.  I’d buy these for passengers all day, and maybe as a student pilot.  They might get annoying as you’re only set if you’re the PIC.</span>

<span>I’m a student pilot currently taking three lessons a week. My flight instructor has this same headset and he let me try his one time during a flight. I was sold. Well worth the money. Very comfortable and durable. The noise cancellation is fantastic, yet you can still hear the engine / prop at a comfortable, background like level.

<span>I am going to give you all of my thoughts on this $850 headset. For some background, I am a CFI with roughly 1500 hours, flying C172s and PA-44s.  Virtually all of those 1500 hours were flown with my first, inexpensive headset: a Pilot USA 1171T with passive noise reduction. A few of my comments on the Lightspeed will be in comparison to my old Pilot USA, which should be similar in quality to the basic David Clarks. So here's my review of the Lightspeed Zulu 3 aviation headset:<br/><br/>Build Quality:<br/>This headset has a solid build quality but it is not necessarily something that is going to blow you away. Yes, there is a fare amount of metal but there is also plenty of plastic. However, this is expected as an ALL metal headset would undoubtedly add to the weight. Compared to my old headset, the weight is similar which is a plus given this headset's added capabilities (such as active noise cancelling). Adjustments are done by simply pulling the earcups down and settling into pre-set notches. This is a little less desirable compared to my old headset which used a tightening knob and sliding rail (no preset notches which allowed perfect precision of your setting).<br/><br/>Fit &amp; Comfort:<br/>I find this headset very comfortable. The earcups are soft and form nicely around your ears. They create a fairly good seal and maintain a decent seal even with thin framed sunglasses on. Given it's light weight, I've worn this for hours on end without fatigue. I am a bit skeptical on the longevity of the ear cups and head cushion as they feel as though they are thinly covered with a fabric like material. I think Lightspeed states they view these as wearable aspects of the headset and recommend replacement every year or so. I certainly hope they last longer than a year. In my opinion, anything less than 3+ years is unacceptable. My previous headset's earcups and head cushion are in mint condition after 7+ years and 1500 hours...and those were also very comfortable and good quality. Time will tell.<br/><br/>Audio &amp; Microphone<br/>The quality of the microphone and audio is...average at best. This is one of the most surprising parts of this headset. When I say this I am referring to my own audible voice as detected by the microphone (and heard in my ears) and the audio quality of others in the cockpit/over the radios (again, as heard in my ears). To me, this headset does not produce better sounding audio than my $125 old Pilot USA headset. To clarify, the ambient nose is greatly reduced in this headset compared to my older, passive headset. That is because this headset utilizes Active Noise Reduction (ANR). However, ambient noise aside, the actual quality of the sound produced by the earcups is just OK. It's more than good enough for what it's needed for, but I was disappointed that it was no better (and perhaps slightly worse) than my cheap headset. Perhaps this is not so much an insult to Lightspeed but a massive compliment to Pilot USA. I don't know. Also, concerning ANR, you should know this headset is terrible the moment ANR is disengaged (via the inline control module). The ambient noise is terrible and the audio quality sounds significantly worse. My old headset was ONLY passive and did excellent in this area. The Zulu 3 is terrible as a passive headset. Of course, this is probably due to the fact the headset was designed to utilize active noise cancelation, so I suppose the amount of passive sound deadening could be significantly less in this headset than in my old. Nonetheless, it's still surprised me that my $125 headset could wipe the floor with this headset the moment the ANR was turned off.<br/><br/>Microphone Boom:<br/>This is actually my single biggest complaint about this headset. As other reviews have noted, the microphone boom is a flexible arm that has no extending ability. It is as long as it is and will not get longer. This makes it difficult for the mic to reach all the way around your head/cheek and be positioned in front of your mouth. The best I seem to achieve is to reach in front of the left third of my mouth. If I'm ok with the mic being pressed firmly to my lips I can just barely make it reach the middle of my mouth, but that is far too uncomfortable and makes for poor audio pickup. Make no mistake, I do not have a big head...at 5' 7" and 150lb, my head is average. But I find myself fiddling with the mic constantly, searching for a sweet spot. My previous headset (and MANY headsets) have a microphone boom that can extend to various lengths. I am still slowly becoming accustomed to this headset, so perhaps I will find the sweet spot. I have also adjusted the mic gain (under the foam mic piece there is a plastic cap covering the gain adjustment) which seems to help the situation.<br/><br/>The Inline Control Module:<br/>I feel that the control module is large, larger than it needs to be. Not only can this be cumbersome in the cockpit, it can be difficult when it comes time to store the headset away after a flight (more on that below with the case). Practically speaking, there is no reason the module cannot be designed to be roughly 25% smaller. The volume adjustment bars also move extremely easily, making accidental volume adjustments very possible. The module does include additional settings but these are made in the battery compartment with tiny "dip" switches. This isn't as big a deal as these setting are not ones you'll be adjusting all the time. Be sure to check them though, as by default one of mine was set to mono audio, when the audio panels in the aircraft I fly are stereo.<br/><br/>The Case:<br/>The included case is simply too small to properly this the headset. This, or the control module and the cable protruding from the earcup need to be redesigned. Check the attached pictures and you'll see fitting the module is awkward, as any place you put it places stress on the cables on one end or the other. Similar stress is placed on the cable protruding from the left earcup. With pressure on these points, a failure is much more likely. The case is very sturdy and otherwise great.<br/><br/>So those are my thoughts. Despite its shortcomings, I am keeping the headset. I got a good deal on it. However, if I had the money I would most certainly spring for the Bose. But with time I suspect I will become fully accustomed to this headset. Overall it's a good headset....I just feel the price should be something closer to $600.</span>

<span>I have had my pilots license for several years and have about 150hrs of flying time. I have wanted a quality headset for years but never justified the expense. I finally decided to pull the trigger and purchase this Zulu3 headset and I am so glad that I did. I researched and compared this headset with the Bose and decided on this headset simply because of the cheaper price and raving reviews. It has not disappointed. It's comfortable, has Bluetooth and has amazing audio quality. If you are debating whether to get this or a cheaper headset, don't. The quality of this headset will last you years and it's worth the investment if you will be flying for a long time.</span>

<span>Sadly, the Zulu3 has turned out to be a big disappointment for me.  When they work, they are awesome, everything everyone says, comfortable, excellent sound, etc., is accurate.  Unfortunately however they have not held up for me, requiring warranty service two times now, in 3.5 years.<br/><br/>I'm a professional pilot flying 80+ hrs a month.  They worked flawlessly for 2.5 years, but one day popping and clicking began in my ears any time I moved my jaw, basically talking, it was extremely annoying and made it difficult to communicate &amp; concentrate.<br/><br/>Contacted Lightspeed to return for Warranty service.<br/>Cost of shipment to them is on you and they return the way you shipped, IOW, if you send Ground, they return Ground, use 2-day, they use 2-day, overnight, well you get the idea.  They promptly fixed them and as a courtesy replace the ear seals, head pad and mic muff, unfortunately, something I had just done a month prior, so that purchase was wasted!<br/><br/>When they came back, the repair order (RO) indicated they replaced the mic boom and a speaker and something about internal wiring.<br/><br/>Well, 9 months after getting them back, my left ear started popping and clicking the other day.  Remembering the RO notes, I started gently pressing the mic boom on the headset cup and issue would come and go and actually get worse where the left ear completely cut out, which indirectly was a blessing as it stopped the annoying pop/click!<br/><br/>Contacted Lightspeed during one of my stops and they setup a quick turn RO again, the issue for me is, I don't really care about warranty, I care about working!  Last time I sent them ground and used a cheapo backup headset for my 8 day flying cycle, not doing that again.  As I only have 6 days off between cycles, to get them back in time, this time I paid to overnight them, which cost $130, so not digging Lightspeed right now!<br/><br/>Bottomline, I regret not considering where the manufacturer of the product is.  I live in NH, Lightspeed is in Oregon.  Ground shipping across country takes a week, return another, even if they repair promptly, you're without a headset for at least half the month, nevermind the hassle of packaging and running to a shipper too.<br/><br/>Warranty is great and all, but a design that is robust and doesn't require warranty service is far more important to me.  Seems there's a weak link in the design of the Lightspeed mic boom.  I consider myself to be one who is easy on my equipment.  I wear it, I take it off and place it in the cuby next to my seat during stops, nothing unduly harsh.<br/><br/>All this said, I have a new headset on backorder from a local to me manufacturer (not over hyped, over priced Bose) so in the least if I do require warranty service, it's going the next state over, not across the country!</span>

<span>I fly for a regional airline about 900 hours a year. I need light weight non clamping, comfortable for a 12 hr  day,  and enough quiet to protect my hearing from the air going by at 500+ mph. These do the trick without the higher cost of Clarity Aloft, or waiting on the always out of stock Quiet Technologies HALO.  It takes a bit of trial and error to get the bend in the headband just right, its stiff,  but once I did it stays where I want it. For cockpits that aren't that loud I can just shove the foam plugs in when in a hurry to close the door and have plenty of protection and clarity in flight. When you read the instructions and put them in right, it is much quieter. The piece over the ears in the picture is smooth all the way , mine are a little different (I think older, Amazon warehouse. Used -Like New) with a tip that slides over the end of the wire. That tip can scratch a little if not adjusted just right. A piece of heat shrink should take care of it.<br/>There is a little hiss from the hot mike setup that we have on the E175, there is no mic gain adjustment on the headset to tune this down. Adjustment has to be made by adjusting the squelch which while easy to adjust on the front of a GA radio, is located in a avionics bay out of reach for me. Its not bad, no worse than a set of DC head clamps, just turn off your mic when not needed.<br/>So far about 25 hours with the headset. Much more comfortable than a over the head traditional set. Much quieter than my Telex 5x5 Pro with dual custom ear molds that I have used for 7+ years. NOT TSO if your airline enforces that. So far happy with my purchase.<br/>Customer support has been great. Numerous emails with questions about adjustments, ear tips, mic gain etc. have been responded to quickly, most of the time within a hour or two unless late then next day first thing. They want you to be happy with the product.</span>

<span>I had such high hopes for this headset. I've used in ear headsets on the job( as ATC, and at NASA) and loved them. But those were single ear and in a quiet control room setting. This headset is comfortable in general. I had no major issues with the mic as I know it takes time to get it in the right place. My problem was with the ear pieces and the PNR. I tried all three sizes and could not get them to seal where the noise reduction was as good as an over the ear PNR headset. I'm unfortunately going to return this headset. I did fly about 10 to 15 hours total, trying the different ear pieces.</span>

<span>I fly A320s and MQ-9 Reapers professionally.  My bose/DC/Clearcoms sound a lot better than these earbuds.  However, it does dampen the sound out and they are comfortable.  The wires seem thin and I have used them on one airline trip.  I bought them when I am flying in my buds F1 Rocket to fit under the canopy cause I am 6'2" and barely fit.  They sound ok in my 170 but I plugged some tunes into the mp3 input and it just doesn't sound as good as my earbuds.  Best of luck.</span>

<span>The idea of an in ear headset intrigued me and the Faro headset looked like a good option. At first, I was mildly satisfied with the headset. The mic seemed to need constant adjustment and it was a bit noisier than I expected. Both points were an easy fix and I can give this headset a strong recommendation.<br/><br/>First, the ear pieces are mostly straight with a mild curve. I added a bit more curve to them to give more of a hook and that fixed the mic movement issue. It is anchored now securely with this 5 second fix. While I was at it, I spread the ear pieces out just a bit for more comfort. I fully agree with comments about comfort with this style of headset. Talk about light weight and easy of movement, nothing like it.<br/><br/>As for the noise level, I was not getting the left ear plug properly seated. I discovered that it took just a bit more care to properly seat the  left ear plug, problem solved.  With both plugs properly seated the volume control has gone from 4 to a 1.5-2 (5 marks on the volume control.) The headset is very quiet now. The microphone seems to perform very well too.<br/><br/>And as everyone says, the headset is light, does not give a problem with caps, hats, or ifr hoods. I have flown with the Faro headset for about 10 hours and honestly feel that I am less fatigued after flying. It looks like my Lightspeed Sierra has now become a loaner.<br/><br/>I am a CFI and fly Cessna 172's and 182's.</span>

<span>I can’t say enough great things about this headset.  I was up in the air (lol) between getting passive and anr and actually used the David Clark’s for a few flights.  The clamping down on my head started to annoy me so I decided I would give these a shot.  I’m never going back.  Not only are these the most comfortable of all the headsets I’ve worn, the sound quality is superb.  Radio calls are clear and easy to hear.  The sound component when it comes to music justifies the price by itself.  I haven’t personally tried the A20’s but I can’t imagine they are worth the $500 more.  When it comes down to it, spend a little more money and get these over DC’s or any other passive headset.  $650 can be daunting for new pilots, but if flying is something you love doing, might as well get a headset that will be comfortable over longer flights, and has great overall sound quality.</span>

<span>Likes: Better in some ways than my older Lightspeed 3G headset. More comfortable on a 1 hour SoCal test flight with another pilot, though I've done many 3+ hour flights just fine with the 3G. Clearer sound for me with ATC and comm than with the 3G in flight, though again the 3G was fine.<br/><br/>Dislikes: Loud low frequency somewhat painful oscillation feedback when noise canceling turned on, and after adjusting position to make it stop any head movement gets it going again though after a few minutes of wearing it seemed to improve (maybe it has heat-sensitive foam earpads that would be better in warm weather?). Bluetooth phone only works with headset plugged in and cuts out with *any* noise on radio plus is garbled on many calls so not really usable (left myself an answering machine message in flight, and it was nearly unintelligible though I could passably understand my home machine's outgoing message) - old 3G worked fine with wired phone connection (wired connection on this one doesn't work for phone, but music only and interrupts with any radio sound). [edit: I've since used the Bluetooth to successfully make a call in flight, but though intelligible the recording was muffled. 3G was quite clear, and I couldn't even tell the call had been made from an aircraft in flight.]<br/><br/>Didn't try talking to ATC with it, but comm testing with the pilot sitting next to me was clear and intelligible. But the garbled Bluetooth phone test makes me wonder if ATC might sometimes have trouble understanding me. Constant white noise static, but not objectionable after a minute (interestingly, after using this Sierra, when I switched back there was white noise on the 3G I'd never noticed before).<br/><br/>Paying this much for a headset, I'd like the quality to be better. Unusable phone and loud feedback are deal breakers for me. That said, I can understand why some reviewers like it. I'm going to return it and go back to the 3G while waiting for the prices of newer and hopefully better headsets to come down.</span>

<span> is 16.5 oz. There was not much difference in weight for me since my upgrade from the David Clark's only meant a difference of 0.5 oz. The Sierra headset allowed my head to breathe beyond my wildest expectations. After an hour-and-a-half-long flight, my ears and head weren't the slightest bit uncomfortable, so the breathability and lack of clamping were fantastic.<br/><br/>One of my favorite features of the Sierra is the Bluetooth/aux input capability. The Sierra user guide says that it cannot stream music wirelessly, but I was able to stream music from my iPhone 6 Plus over Bluetooth without any hiccups. The music quality isn't super stellar, but when you're flying an airplane and talking with controllers and passengers, music quality isn't really a primary concern. This is an ANR aviation headset, not a pair of ANR headphones, so it (and its music quality) should be treated as such.<br/><br/>The clarity of the ATC transmissions was great. On my first flight with Sierra, I didn't have to ask a single controller to repeat him or herself a single time. I have yet to try out the FlightLink app, but I will update this review if I can once I have tried it.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend the Sierra to anyone looking for an ANR headset. At its price point, the Sierra really packs in a lot of features like ANR, Bluetooth, ComPriority, and FlightLink, all for under $700. I've been converted and will definitely continue buying from Lightspeed.</span>

<span>After finishing up my VFR I am starting my IFR I decided that it was time to buy my own headset. I spent hours online in hours in aviation stores trying on all of the various headsets ranging from basic no noise cancelling headsets all the way up two Zulus and the Bose headsets. The first thing I want to say is that active noise-cancellation headsets for Aviation are incredible. When you're talking with someone over the intercom it sounds like you are in a quiet room. When it comes down to the choice between Lightspeed and Bose, the price point of the light speed really sold me. When comparing the Sierras and the Zulus I did not see enough of a difference to justify the higher price point. The construction on these, domain of plastic, feels strong and reliable. With the warranty I had no worry about purchasing these and now that I've been using them I have no regret.</span>

Passive Noise Reduction is achieved by placing sound absorbing material between your ears and the outside environment. Active Noise Reduction is achieved by placing a microphone inside the ear cup to 'read' incoming noise and generating an 'anti‐noise' signal through the speakers. The anti‐noise and the ambient noise will cancel each other before they reach the ear. Through this technology, low frequency ambient noise is significantly reduced and important communication can be heard in a clear, crisp manner. The best part is that the G2 headset will continue to operate as a standard aviation headset should the ANR become inactive for any reason such as low or no battery power.  Additional Information:Uses two AA batteries – Battery will last up to 30 hours depending on environment. Supports mono and stereo intercoms. Headset will operate as normal PNR headset with low or no battery power. Connection Type: Standard Dual Plug for GA. 3-Year Full Coverage Warranty – Satisfaction Guaranteed. If anything happens to your headset, simply ship it back to Faro Aviation and receive a replacement within 3 years of purchase. Faro Aviation Headsets are made of highest quality and durable material. Faro Aviation customers are also eligible for lifetime wear and tear protection. Each unit is carefully inspected for defects prior to shipment to ensure full customer satisfaction.

<span>I've had a good experience with the G2. Is it a light speed Zulu? No, it's a 200 dollar headset with added noise cancelling. But in reality, because this is built on a passive headset, it's actually a lot better in a loud GA aircraft than it has any right to be. Because the over ear passive design, I actually find it a bit quieter (and less perceived "pressure" from the noise cancelling) than the Bose A20 in louder aircraft, especially if you're not wearing sunglasses or a hat that will interfere with the seal of the headset. For the money these are great. The sound quality is a little "tinny" but when trying to hear radio calls in a loud airplane that's not a problem.<br/><br/>I put about 180 hours on my pair over maybe 100 flights, and the ANR began to fail. I was pretty disappointed, but I emailed Faro, and when I returned my headset to be repaired, they sent me a brand new one immediately. My headset was gone only a few days, and now we're back in action.<br/><br/>These are not perfect, but for the price theyre close.  If you fly a prop for a living, buy a Lightspeed. If you fly a jet for a living, buy a Bose. If you're like the rest of us, the Faro G2 ANR works great and is workhorse headset that checks the right boxes at the right price.</span>

<span>My first headset and I love it. As a student pilot I wanted to choose a headset that helps me to listen to every single instructions from the instructor and the info from ATC. I didn't want to be bothered by noise from outside that will interrupt my focus. This headset gave me the choice to on or off the ANR. This gives me the chance to compare headset performance with and without ANR - and I can say I made the right choice to choose a) a headset that has ANR and  , b) FARO brand for quality. My only complain if any is that when the product arrived, the box I got looked worn out as if it was not brand new. And the FARO yellow bag for the headset, though nice, had couple of black stains that looked like grease. Bizarre presentation. For a new pilot student who had invested lots of money to buy his first headset, receiving the headset in this condition was disappointing. The product performance however, is good though.</span>

<span>As a student pilot, this headset is great! The noise cancellation is good but I don't recommend listening to music through them as the noise cancelling does reduce the dynamic range somewhat. For communication they're great and very sturdy and comfortable to wear on long flights and I have a larger than average cranium. Good product.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Let me just start by saying I am a beginning pilot and have not tried the more expensive headsets available out there. That having been said, I can't imagine needing more then this headset provides. It is comfortable and quiet and even allows one to plug in one's favorite MP3 player and listen to music while flying.<br/><br/>Two things I want to point out about this headset; 1. It came out of the box a bit tight for my head. After a bit of careful bending it fit quite well. I recommend storing it stretched over it's own box, it really helps keep it from becoming too tight. 2. Don't expect great sound quality from your MP3 player with this headset. The resistance of aviation headsets is different enough that your music will be a bit 'tinny' and rather quiet. The good news is that you wont have trouble hearing important radio traffic and since the headset does such a good job keeping out cockpit noise, the diminished sound is still audible, if just as a 'background music' level. I plugged in my Itouch 4 and turned up the volume to maximum. The music sound is a bit lower then I would like, but tolerable. I am not sure if they made it this way by design or not, but you are in no danger of missing any important radio traffic due to listening to music.<br/><br/>The noise cancelling mic seems to work well, but I have to turn up the squelch more then the old set I was using in order to keep my conversation from getting 'clipped' at the beginning.<br/><br/>Radio traffic and intercom traffic is very clear in these headphones. Highly recommended.</span>

<span>I have been flying with ANR &amp; PNR headsets for more than 30 years.  The Faro G2 is totally aceptable to me.  Good construction. Good noise reduction.  Controllers never ask me to repeat something - it must sound OK to them. The sound/voice is a little tinnie to me - higher frequency.  But I like that.  My ears respond to/hear the higher frequencies better.  Words seem to be less distorted.  Headsets have come a long way. I believe most headsets are very good.  I have used Bose headsets for many years.  G2 is 90% as good as Bose and cost $1000 less.</span>

<span>I've been flying for 35 years and have used a lot of headsets, both passive and ANR.  My current need was for a passive headset and this one does the job.  It is well built with actual metal in the headband, not plastic.  The noise protection is very good, among the best I've ever used in a passive headset.  The earcups are comfortable.  The MP3 jack is convenient as is the individual volume control for each earcup.  This is a high value for the money headset.  I think it is a better value by far than the green cup headsets.  On edit:  Now that I've actually used this headset for a while, I'm still pleased with it, but it does have some quirks with the mic.  The mic seems to be overly finicky.  It can work from either side, but lets in way too much noise from the opposite side in a noisy airplane (like an RV-8).  I've put two layers of aluminum tape over the side of the mic facing away from me and that helped.  It's also fairly picky about placement for the best sound quality in relation to your mouth.  Once you figure out just where that is, you can consistently place it there, but if a pax is using it you'll have to tell them how to place it.  I'd still buy it again, though, at the price I paid.</span>

<span>They came in a nice bag with a drawstring so when I'm not using them there clean and safe. Clear mic and sounds good. I haven't tried the MP3 function yet as focus is important. But definitely recommended for everyone. No batteries but all the features. Also its not hot on my head and I'm learning in a desert so points for that.</span>
