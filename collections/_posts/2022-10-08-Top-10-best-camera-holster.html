<span>I wanted a bigger bike bag for tools, water, snacks, etc. I found that holster type bags work great since they have that tear drop shape. They are not bulky, but roomy. This one for the price, cant be beat. Good padding along with velcro style divider. Plenty of zipper compartments on the outside.  Dimensions are 11" long, 7" wide at main opening, and 6" high. These are outside measurements. Comes with shoulder strap, but I wont be using that part. Bottom portion is molded. This help keeps the shape, and water proof if you set your item down damp/water areas. There are belt loops if your going to attach it to your waist.  Not sure of the long term durability, but seems it will hold up well.</span>

<span>I didn’t pay close attention to the dimensions and this was much to big. I wanted something smaller for travel with camera body and one small lens.<br/>This would be better for a longer lens and added battery packs, flashes, etc.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The holster bag is a nice size.  Fits my Fuji xt4 and 50-300 lens.  Quality is excellent.  Great value</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Nearly all camera bags/holsters are built around the standard sizes for a 35mm (D)SLR, which is what most folks want and need.  But I always shoot with a battery grip (motor drive).  With that attached the camera fits my large hands better but, more importantly, I shoot the vast majority of what I shoot portrait rather than landscape.  A batter grip makes this much easier.  But few bags/holsters are designed to accommodate the larger size of the body with one attached.  This one does accommodate it quite nicely.  Not perfectly, perhaps, but better than any other I've found so far.<br/>( Photo is a Nikon D600 camera with battery grip in the holster.)</span>

<span>I have larger cases to fit more lenses and stuff, but sometimes I just want something compact and light weight for a day-excursion. This is why I chose Case Logic DCB-306. This case will fit my full frame camera with prime lens mounted to it. It fits my compact cropped-sensor camera with enough room for a spare prime lens.  It has two side-pockets with zippers—great for extra batteries etc. The access lid is secured with a single zipper and has a pocket on the inside lid. The case is perfect for a simple kit with no (maybe one) lens changes.<br/>That was the good. Now here is the not so good:<br/><br/>The access flap zipper is frustratingly difficult to open and close quickly with one hand, as the lid warps and the zipper snags, and the zipper length is too long for just one zipper. A solution might be to add another zipper to shorten the distance, and to cut back the material from the zipper-teeth. As it is, one zipper needs to navigate from one side of the case to the other while getting snagged along the way. I would be willing to pay a bit more for a dual-zipper setup and a secondary Velcro latch.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> HOLSTER CAMERA CASE: Securely holds a camera with a short range lens attached. Apart from the main compartment, it has an exterior pocket with a built-in divider and an additional zippered web pocket. The interior includes three removable dividers to fit your camera perfectly. The camera case offers multiple carrying options with a removable shoulder strap, belt loop, and compact handle  </span></li>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> AIR BLOWER: The rubber bulb air blower removes dust and debris from a lens element using the gentlest form of pressure to dislodge dust. It can help clean in cracks where a cloth cannot reach.

It cleans the surfaces from smudges, fingerprints, and grime that are not removed by the air blower. This cleaner spray does not harm coated lens elements  </span></li>

The Battery Holster from OP/TECH USA is an ideal accessory for keeping an extra battery handy when shooting in the field. The soft, durable neoprene pouch slides onto your camera strap and is held conveniently and securely in place with a touch fastener. No need to fumble around in a camera case or backpack! The full-flap closure holds the battery or other small accessory securely in place yet opens easily for quick, easy access. The closed-cell construction of the neoprene keeps out moisture and dust while providing cushioning protection against impact. The added "bumper guard" created by the Lycra binding adds even more protection along the edges. Keeping an extra battery ready at a moment's notice is easy with the Battery Holster—you won't ever miss another shot because of a weak battery. It conveniently holds standard SLR batteries, AA batteries and others so you have the versatility to use it for all kinds of equipment. Proudly made in the USA, the Battery Holster is the perfect companion for OP/TECH USA's weight reduction straps and Soft Pouch - Digital-D Series protective camera cases.

<span>The holster is compact, functional and easily and securily fits on to the camera strap. It holds the battery securely but a little too securely. As a suggestion, it could be a little larger to make the removal and inserting of a battery even smoother. Also, it would be helpful if the holder were a little larger for an additional reason: to allow the option of storeing a battery in the holder with its protective plastic case on the bottom of battery for additional protection. This would provide the user with the option of storing a battery in the holder with or without the plastic case. If the holder is a little larger for theses reasons there should be no concern with the battery falling out of the holder as there is a secure flap on the end of the holder. Overall the holder is pretty good for the price.</span>

<span>The holster easily holds the Nikon EN-EL23 battery (Coolpix P900) with room to spare.  It also fits the Nikon EN-EL3e battery which is much thicker.  I like the fact that the holster flap attaches via Velcro and that it folds to the back.  The camera strap passes over the flip for extra security in keeping the flap closed.  It seems extremely unlikely that a battery would ever fall out of its pouch.  Holster is made of Neoprene and it should offer sufficient protection from any rain that I’d be willing to risk my camera in.  For extra security, the strap loop does not open; the strap must threaded through the loop.  The inner surface of the loop attaches via Velcro to “narrow” the loop opening.  At the moment, I have the holster on the narrow strap that came with the camera (Coolpix P900) and even with this narrow strap the holster provides a snug grip that keeps the holster where I placed it without it sliding along the strap on its own.  However, the holster still easily slides when I choose to move it.  Another well engineered product from WP/Tech!</span>

<span>Works great for mirrorless cameras where the batteries don’t last very long. You can keep a spare always keep a spare battery with your camera. That way if you don’t carry your big camera bag with you. However, it’s a bit on the small size. So if you have a larger camera battery, it might be a tight fit.  It worked fine for my battery on EM-10mII, but it was a tight fit for EM-1mII.</span>

<span>Pouch works well for me and fits a newer smaller Nikon DSLR EN-EL14a battery as used on the D3300 just like a glove even with a plastic cap, along with room for one SDHC card. Some people complain about the flap being next to the camera strap rather than facing outside. I am sure the design is intentional to avoid snags on clothing or other objects. I would rather take the extra 2 second to access the inward facing flap than risk losing a $40 battery.  Seems a bit pricey for a mere pouch but it is made in USA so it supports jobs here. I have also owned 2 OP/TECH media pouches for 2 years for a point and shoot without incident or wear.  This pouch would never have worked with my much larger older D40 camera.</span>

<span>Bag looks and feels really high quality. Small is a great size for a mirrorless camera plus medium sized zoom lens. I’m using it with a Fuji XT4 and the 16-80 zoom and there’s about 1.5 inches of room to spare. Only con is that there should really be two zippers to make it easier to open and close.

<span>I got this to take my Nikon D3300 DSLR on hikes.  I am concerned about protection, comfort, and accessibility.  This Ape Case exceeded my expectations.  First, with the original AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm lens installed, the camera fits snuggly in the case, well protected, and no shifting around (the D3300 with lens is 5 1/2" from lens cap to camera back; 5" wide; and 3 7/8" high; it rides in the case with lens down and has 5/8" clearance between the inside of the lid and the camera -- I eat that space up with spare batteries).<br/><br/>I use the shoulder strap over my left shoulder (for comfort ensure the shoulder pad is installed with the concave side of the pad toward your neck).  Then I put my backpack overtop of the strap and clip the backpack chest strap over the camera strap.  Initially I tried hooking the belt loop onto my backpack waist belt, but decided it was unnecessary.  The case and camera ride comfortably on my right front side providing quick accessibility.  It is comfortable and I do not notice it or have any signs of skin irritation after a 7 hour hike.<br/><br/>Accessibility.  The camera, riding in this position, is very easy to access.  The case lid has two pulls on the zipper.  I let the camera strap hang out of the top of the Ape Case and against my body.  To access, I simply unzip each zipper, pull on the strap, wrap the strap around my wrist or toss it over my head, remove the lens cap, turn the camera on, and activate the lens.  The entire process takes me eleven seconds.  Stowing is equally easy.<br/><br/>The rain cover is also easy to access and install, though I will probably always -- as I do with my iPhone and Nikon point and shoot -- put the D3300 in a plastic zip lock bag and stow it back in the Ape Case if it is raining.<br/><br/>Storage.  You have minimum storage in this case.  I carry two spare batteries, though it could hold four -- two in the lid and two in the front zip pouch.  The D3300, EN-EL14a batteries are 1.5" X 2" X .5".  You could also carry extra SD cards in lieu of a battery.  I carry two batteries and lens cloth.  Anything else (like another lens or lens brush) goes in the backpack, not the Ape Case.<br/><br/>Rugged.  This is a very sturdy case.  I have had it on four hikes so far.  The only week link might be the belt loop.  Though it is double stitched and snuggly fits on my backpack waist belt, it is not of the same ruggedness as the shoulder strap.  The shoulder strap snaps onto a belt that is double stitched around the sides and bottom of the case.  It is not going anywhere.  So I trust the shoulder strap more than the belt loop.<br/><br/>Love it!  And I can enjoy my DSLR on all my hikes!<br/>UPDATE: 6 STARS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!  3.18.2016.  The zipper on the main compartment broke.  I contacted Ape Case customer service.  They asked for a picture.  I complied.  They sent me a new case.  The new case zipper pulls smoother than the original case ever did.  I hadn't realized that the original case probably had a bad zipper to begin with because it was always hard to pull from one side. I commend the Ape Case people for sticking to their guarantee, for a fast response, and for a very good product.</span>

<span>I was looking for a simple case to carry a Nikon D3100 attached to an 18-140mm Nikkor lens.  This product holds the combo complete with UV filter, lens cap, and neck strap.  The built in 'suspenders' don't really support the camera in my case because of the lens length but they do stabilize the camera from side to side motion.  Part of the reason I gravitated to this product was the belt loop.  As it turns out, trying to wear it on a belt is uncomfortable for me.  Had I realized that in advance I may have looked more closely at some of the well featured but no belt loop Case Logic cases, but I don't think they would be any better overall.  I like the concealed rain shield concept but when it rains, I'm likely to head for cover along with the camera.<br/><br/>Bear in mind, that this is not a bag you want to carry multiple lenses.  It holds an extra battery, a couple of memory cards and I'm OK with that.  I'm a minimalist when it comes to toting equipment around.  In fact, when I ordered this case I also ordered the Ape Case ACLC8 case for my 18-55mm kit lens to keep the lens safe and dust free while it resides on a shelf at home.  When we've been traveling the past few years, I've been happy carrying a long-zoom pocket type camera in a small bag on my belt.  But having been an SLR fan from way back, I wanted to get back to a DSLR with a larger sensor and still not have to drag multiple lenses and other paraphernalia around.  This camera/lens/case combo allows me to do that.  I have to give up carrying it on my belt but the size and weight makes it relatively unobtrusive using the shoulder strap.<br/><br/>With the exception of using the belt loop, it performs just as advertised and I recommend it for purposes like mine.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the the zipper tends to bind around the curves when closing the cover and I would have preferred metal hardware on the shoulder strap rather than the plastic that was provided.<br/>***************edit 04/30/19*****************<br/>New camera, new bag:  I just bought the 'small' version of the Ape bag (ACPRO600).  I wanted to review it separately but the Amazon site wouldn't let me because I already reviewed the larger (ACPRO625) version.  I bought this one for a Sony a6000 with the Sony 18-135 lens attached.  Never bought the 16-50 kit lens since toting and changing extra lenses is no longer my thing.  All I wanted was a basic bag to carry the camera with lens attached along with a couple of extra batteries and memory cards.  I wrap the neck strap around the lens and reverse the lens hood before inserting the camera lens first into the bag.  Perfect fit.  The two batteries fit in the small front zippered compartment and the cards in the inside of the case's lid.  I really wanted to carry the case on my belt and while I can, but like the compact version, turns out it is more comfortable to use the shoulder strap.  A bonus is the built in weather cover that can be expanded to fit over the bag.  Normally I don't hang out in the rain but we'll be taking a trip to Norway soon so that cover will likely get tested.  Both bags are high quality and after some experience, I upgraded my overall rating to 5 stars.</span>

<span>I use this bag to carry a Canon 60D and my favorite lens for it is an 18-200mm.<br/><br/>Function: the bag functions excellently. It is designed to hold the camera in a pointed-down position; the inner straps holding the camera body with lens dangling freely and it does so. I use this bag for day trips and quick outings where I want my camera and a specific lens, but don't need extra lenses, flashes, etc. This bag does a great job at holding the minimum stuff I need.<br/><br/>The strap is comfortable and adjusts for over-the-shoulder or across-the-body positions. The strap padding prevents it from digging into your shoulder as the hours pass and the rubber gripping helps keep the strap on the shoulder. I have not tried using the belt loop - it looks sturdy and well-designed, but I am a small person and I have yet to need a camera on my back. I will be shooting a live sporting event soon, and I may use it for just this purpose. It seems ideal for keeping a spare body with alternate lens in a handy but out-of-the-way position.<br/><br/>The zippers are heavy duty but slide smoothly in those moments when you need to get the camera out of the bag RIGHT NOW or you'll miss the shot. The inner straps hold the camera steadily above the floor of the bag in spite of shaking and other abuse. I have noted that my favorite telephoto lens has a tendency to "fall" to its maximum position in the bag. The interior of the bag is about 8.5" top to bottom - subtract the thickness of your camera body to see how much lens you can fit in with or without hitting the bottom. I do keep the camera lowered enough in the bag so that my camera strap (when I'm using one) coils up on top. You could keep the strap coiled up in the bottom, but that would require two hands, full attention and some care each time.<br/><br/>The built-in rain protector is a nice feature. The bag itself seems water-resistant; I've set the bag down in snow (by accident) and not had leakage. That said, it's good to know the rain guard is there. The inner pouches are great for holding spare cards &amp; lens wipes. You won't get anything else in those flat little pouches, but you can get in and out of them with just two fingers while your eyes are focused elsewhere. The external zippered pouch is a good size for a spare battery pack and lens filters. The opening being vertical, it takes time and attention to use that pouch, but it works.<br/><br/>Durability: The bag is well-padded all over, the stitching is secure and all of the stress points are reinforced. I wouldn't recommend dropping this bag on hard floors or concrete, but I have done both with no damage to camera or lens. Or bag, for that matter. My bag has been in the rain, snow, and cold plus the mentioned abuse. If you look closely, you might see a bit of scuffing on the bottom corners. To date, I am very happy with the durability of the bag.<br/><br/>Concerns<br/><br/>Battery Grip: The bag is an odd thickness (height in camera measurement). I don't normally use a battery grip, but do intend to rent for tournaments and recitals. I've measured and I *think* the camera will go in the bag with grip on, but it will be tight. Seems like the bag could come in two thicknesses - one for a regular camera so it isn't "sloshing around" in the bag and one for camera plus battery grip for those who use them.<br/><br/>Hot Shoe Flash: Mine won't fit in the external pouch, with or without anything else in there. I'll look for something smaller over time, but don't expect to carry a standard-sized flash with this case.<br/><br/>Overall, I've been very happy with the bag. I have another, larger, camera case which holds all my gadgets for the 60D; this bag I had thought to be a spare for lightweight days. After several months, though, I find that the 60D most often can be found in this case. It holds enough to be useful for day to day events and has become my regular bag.</span>

<span>I've now taken this case on 2 backpacking trips and multiple hiking trips. I use carabiners and a paracord bracelet or two to hook it to the front of my backpack straps for even weight distribution, and it rests snugly against my stomach. It's the perfect size for my Olympus EM-5 Mk III with 12-45 mm F4.0 lens and can even fit it with my lens hood on. I also appreciate that there is a rain cover built into the bag.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it feels like the zipper is on the wrong side of the bag. I like to have the zipper opening facing away from me with this setup so that I can easily unzip/zip it and pull my camera out. Unfortunately that means that the front accessory compartment and rain cover then are on the wrong sides of the bag. However, this is a minor gripe for an otherwise perfect and affordable bag. I would give it 4.5 stars, so I rounded up to 5.</span>

miggo Agua 25 Stormproof Holster Photographers who enjoy traveling light and shooting in all types of weather will appreciate the black-blue Agua Stormproof Holster for Cameras from miggo. This holster helps protect the camera from dirt, dust, moderate impact, and boasts an IPX3 rainproof rating. The Agua 25 features dual zipper pulls, an interior, slip-in, stretchable lens cap pocket, and quick-release, locking strap buckles. The bottom of the holster has a thermo-formed rigid exterior with a soft interior for protecting your lens from impact and scratches. To use the holster, simply attach the camera connecting cords to your camera strap lugs. On the opposite end of each cord is a quick-release buckle for attaching the padded shoulder strap. For speed and safety during storage and use, the holster remains attached to the camera connecting cords. To adjust the length of the strap, simply pull on the D-rings located one at each side. The holster may be easily carried without the shoulder strap by connecting the camera lug cord's quick-release buckles together to form a handle. For strength and durability your Agua 25 holster is made of neoprene, tarpaulin, Lycra and plastic.

<span>I got this for my brother who has a Canon camera. He loved it. The semplicity of just being able to carry his camera with no worries of getting damaged while carrying it. He never leaves home without it. The lens is protected by a hard durable cover on the outside and the straps are adjustable to height. My brother is 6ft 2inch so if can use it anyone at his height can too</span>

<span>Another Update: Four years in.<br/>This bag has been so great and lasted so long! But at 4 years in I think it's finally time to retire. The blue heat-seal strip is starting to come up and has stains on top of stains. But seriously, four years of almost daily use and abuse. I wish my tennis shoes would last as long. I will be replacing it with the exact same brand.<br/>Update: Two years later...<br/>This bag has saved my bacon sooooooo many times. The fact that the camera clips to the bag means if the camera comes out of my hand (which happens more frequently than it should) it won't hit the ground. That's just the best feature of any bag I've seen out there.<br/>I still wish for a little more room but I got this...<br/>https://smile.amazon.com/JJC-18-135mm-55-250mm-18-200mm-100-300mm/dp/B07314QX6G/ref=sr_1_23?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533656460&amp;sr=1-23&amp;keywords=lens+pouch<br/>...and attached it to the strap. Not quite as handy, but it works fine when I need another lens close by but dont wan't to drag all the other stuff<br/>Anyhow, I've been thinking about getting the Miggo 65, so we'll see.<br/><br/>LOOOVE this bag. It's perfect when you don't want to carry all the extra crap and the waterproof part gives me peace of mind.<br/>I do wish it would fit my 70-300 lens but it's by no means a deal-breaker. Highly recommend.</span>

<span>The overall design is very well done.  I'm big on a camera being on a strap at all times, to avoid the consequences of my clumsiness.  With the Agua 45, if the strap is on the bag, the camera can be clipped to a short leash in the bag.  If I want to use the camera, I can quickly connect the strap to the camera &amp; not use the bag.<br/>It is a bit clumsy opening &amp; particularly, closing the zipper.  On the other hand, the case appears to be very protective, with neoprene padded interior.</span>

<span>Upgraded from a Miggo Strap and Wrap to this case option for a trip to New Zealand and Australia. Touring rain forests, beaches, mountainous and remote areas was a concern for camera care while still being relatively quick to get a picture. This 'bag' worked out great.<br/><br/>I found once I got accustomed to the camera being tethered to the case, it was not a problem to get most any photo I wanted. A little practice and experimenting was what it took to get comfortable with the set up. You can even totally remove the camera from the bag and use the strap as a conventional camera strap if you want.<br/><br/>The internal padded pocket for the camera is velcroed in to the weather proof outer shell in such a way that I was able to store additional batteries and memory cards behind it by moving the padded liner.<br/><br/>This really is a great bag.</span>

This case is the perfect case for your DSLR and more.The ACPRO820W DSLR Holster case is made of a durable nylon padded exterior.

Enhanced zippers and pulls make this bag easy to zipper open and closed with one hand. The large front zippered sleeve is great for storing memory cards and small accessories.The main compartment expands from 7.5” to 12.25” in height when you utilize the additional top storage; which you can access through a zipper at the top of the expandable section. Or, you can keep the two compartments separate. Simply zipper the internal divider into place and using the zipper at the back of the bag. This will allow you to store your DSLR in the bottom half and keep accessories separate but accessible in the top portion.When the top half is not in use, you can take advantage of the clips on both sides to fold the top over.Included is a water bottle holder and a removable Any-Weather cover to keep your bag and gear safe in undesirable weather conditions. When not in use, the Any-Weather cover packs neatly into its small 4” x 5” pouch with clip.

<span>WOW!!!  I LOVE THIS BAG!  1st, however, allow me to update the product info...the ACPRO840W does not have the 'internal memory card storage pockets' like the ACPRO650...it does have them, but they are part of a nylon divider wall in the front pocket...that being said, they are way too small to be of any use (I cannot find a single thing that can fit in them except a memory card, but believe me you would never want to put one in them as you would have a heck of a time getting it back out), but that really doesn't seem to matter much as the pocket with the divider is plenty roomy enough.  Also, it has mesh pockets on both sides but I haven't seen that mentioned anywhere.  I bought this as we are about to go to the American Southwest for vacation and I knew I would need a bag like this to take my camera and gear with me on the many, many hikes we are sure to take, so I will be sure to update this review after our return to rate it's practical use while out in the field, so to speak.  I packed the bag with what I feel I will need and this is what I've found so far...In the main compartment I can hold my Nikon D5200 w/18-55mm lens attached with enough room below to store the lens hood, and both the wired and wireless remotes...in the front pocket I store a 6-pack of various ND lens covers along with two extra batteries and a few clothes AND a two extra batteries for my GoPro...in the top compartment (I keep them divided) I store my 55-200mm lens along with its hood, GoPro camera on headband mount, my cell phone, keys and even wallet with room to spare!!!  ALL THAT AND I can still access my camera in a second!!!  BTW, I also store the rain cover in one side pocket and a camera rain sleeve in the other.  Again, I will update this review upon our return.</span>

<span>This was on sale when I got it ($12) so it was worth a try to see if it fits the Nex-6 + 18-105G. I had to expand it to make it close, and the tight fit meant I can't use the outer pocket or top space. I tried pulling the camera through the top but it was difficult. I had to flip the side clips and pull the camera out from the original slot. While the neck strap can be tucked in the top it's better to use a wrist strap.<br/><br/>The one thing I couldn't figure out from the information out there is the dimensions. It's so wrong. It's 3.5"W x 4.5"H x 2.5"D inside and expandable to 8.5"H.<br/><br/>Having the strap on the back makes moving the zippers easier than if it was on the sides. Too bad it's not crossed-stitched. The shoulder pad is very grippy and thick.<br/><br/>My main reason for getting this was to have the smallest holster I can use, which it is. I'm only giving this 4 stars though because it didn't include the bottle holder lol.<br/><br/>This holster and the A6xxx + 18-135 will make a great combo though, otherwise it's better to get the Compact Plus version (ACPRO820W).</span>

<span>So I'll answer the question I had previously asked, but had received no reply from users.  Ape did reply, which is greatly appreciated.  The Large size is required for Sony Rx10 mark iv.  The dimensions are totally wrong in the product information.  I purchased this since price was so low that I almost couldn't go wrong.  Once I received it, I took it to my local shoe repair shop for modifications.  I disliked the thin strap supplied so had the strap cut off and D-rings installed so I can attach my own padded strap and can wear it either way, as neck strap or attach my sling strap.<br/><br/>Next, I had my shoe repair shop attach two web straps to the back so attach this bag to belt.  This allows me to distribute the weight of my camera between both shoulder strap and waist belt.  Not only is weight distributed better, but with two points of attachment, I'm not at risk of losing my camera to slash-and-grab pickpockets in Europe.  Typically I kept my sling camera strap over my shoulder, camera inside bag, with bag attached with belt loops.  I could easily pull camera out of top of bag, take my shots, then drop the camera back into the bag for protection while walking around.  The only concern, I had to remember to zip the top pouch closed so stuff didn't fall out.  Easy sacrifice to make for such easy, convenient bag.<br/><br/>I used this bag on trip from Amsterdam to Switzerland.  I loved having the expandable pouch on top.  Sometimes I would leave it empty and smaller.  Other times, I could add compressed rain jacket or water bottle along with misc personel items.  While it does include a rain cover, I added additional rainproofing with silicon spray.<br/><br/>Ape Bag folks, sorry but I love to customize my bags.  Please consider making simple changes to your bag:  Add D-rings so strap can be used as shoulder or sling bag and belt loops add to versitility.  BTW, I love the "hammock" straps inside the bag that suspend the camera in the bag, preventing any weight on my attached lens hood.  All in all, a great, compact bag.  Minor changes can convert it from excellent to utterly awesome!</span>
