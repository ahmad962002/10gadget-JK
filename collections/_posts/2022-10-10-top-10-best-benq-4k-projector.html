<span>I bought this based off this listing and the throw diagram. Its not correct.<br/>It does NOT throw a 115" projection at around 8 feet, its not that short. I need to put it 13' away to fill my 115" screen.<br/>If you need a short throw get the STI<br/>However, the zoom gives you a large range of distances to mount it so it worked out ok.<br/>Technically, the projector cant be beat for the money. Very bright, no problem watching during the day and its smaller than most.<br/>you CANNOT rotate the screen via software which is a shame, I saw a review that said you could, that would be very helpful.<br/>All you can do is keystone, you cant even shift it laterally and vertically with software.<br/>Maybe I newer firmware would help.<br/>Overall happy though</span>

<span>I needed a replacement for my Optomo 4k projector after only 2 years due to it getting a pattern of white dots showing on the screen that kept growing in number. I had had a BenQ before that and had loved it and it had lasted for five years and was still going strong when I replaced it. So back I went and I’ve been happy since I got it! Great picture and it also came with a Steaming stick built in that was impressive and easy to use!</span>

<span>TLDR version: Heaven for PC gaming and movies alike. Long version below.<br/><br/>I use this projector for PC gaming (I run an RTX 3080) and as a home theater for steaming movies and shows (right now, primarily the latter, but that more because of my schedule, and I hope to change this soon).<br/><br/>The picture quality (to include brightness and HDR) on this thing is top notch, so let’s get that out of the way. Frame rates at resolutions that are pretty competitive with high end PC gaming monitors give you a lot to love about this monitor for gamers... oh and at 100 inches. The price for performance on how this thing functions as a gaming monitor is pretty incredible at this size. Also, for the picture quality at the size you can easily get out of this thing, it beats the snot out of paying 5k + for an 80ish inch OLED TV. This thing compares favorably in terms of brightness, resolution and color with all but the highest end OLED TVs for a FRACTION of the price. Picture-wise, this thing is nothing short of amazing. I do not have this set up in a completely blacked out room, and I would say that the issues I have with natural lighting while using the projector during the day are different but equal to the issues I have watching a TV in a similarly lit room (light dilution vs glare, etc.). That’s a solvable problem; consider a window blackout solution if that’s a concern. Also, if you’re going to go in for this beast, I highly recommend a dedicated screen. Don’t debase the amazing picture quality of this beautiful machine by projecting onto a painted wall, that’s just silly.<br/><br/>The Meh: Sometimes the projector seems to get confused with input devices; when I want to use the projector as a computer monitor, sometimes I need to power cycle one or the other. Not sure what this is about, but it’s barely a minor inconvenience, and the couple of times it’s happened it has been when I am deliberately messing around with display settings pretty hard. It may very well be entirely on my PC. The remote that comes with the projector is… mixed. The Android TV dongle that comes with the projector and the way the remote controls both projector AND the “smart TV” ish functionality is pretty great, the remote just isn’t the most responsive. Slow, spaced-out and very “deliberate” button pressing seems to be the key. This is not a big deal in itself; the finicky remote is particularly annoying when adjusting projector settings and the volume on the onboard speaker (which functions but isn’t going to win any awards). So, while the android TV dongle and it’s seamless integration with the remote is a really, really nice touch, it isn’t perfect. Beyond some of the remote clunkiness, there isn't an organic solution for Netflix, and in general, I found that a 4K fire stick it more responsive as a streaming device… the great news is that you can pop a fire stick into the same HDMI slot AND power source on the monitor that is intended for the android TV dongle. Right now, that’s what I’m doing, and the biggest downside seems to be that I have another remote in the mix (but I like the Amazon one better anyway). When I’m feeling brave I’ll see if I can figure out how to power on the projector through the Amazon remote, but it hasn’t bothered me enough to try yet. Anyway, to me this is more of an option than a real complaint, and the fact that the projector comes equipped with what is essentially an organic smart TV functionality should be seen as a bonus… especially at this price point.<br/><br/>EDIT: I definitely recommend a sound system that matches the quality of the picture on this projector to do the experience justice. Finding a sound bar that worked with this set up was a BIT of a challenge. At the end of the day, something that has eARC/HDMI functionality is the key, but I also recommend something with a wide variety of input format compatibility. My initial review was pretty heated because I fought a Klipsch Cinema 600 for 2 weeks with missed results - after all that it turned out it was the soundbar (I’m fairly tech savvy, but the problems and solutions to them when they worked were way bizarre, and the soundbar was theoretically compatible). I went with a Samsung HW-Q800, and that was easy to set up, and HDMI ARC worked with the normal amount of setting fiddling, and it sounds great. I edited my review to hopefully save someone the headache, and to correct my mistake in thinking the issue with connectivity was on the projector - it was not.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: this projector is…. Amazing. The price per performance on a projector that delivers most of the functionality you’d expect out of a high end gaming monitor (for a similar price on a WAY smaller screen) at up to 120 inches is just. Plain. Dumb. In the best way possible. If you have a stereotypical “man cave” game room and you want to add a screen that is just stupidly big and beautiful for both a quality gaming and home theater experience, look no further. As a point of comparison: Next to a top of the line OLED TV (my original option for down here) that could perform in gaming at the same level, you might say that the OLED looked better- but for 83 inches you’re going to pay something like 4 times the price of this projector (my reason for taking the plunge and buying a projector for the first time). To me, this projector offered 85% of the experience I wanted from an OLED TV at 25% of the price- that math was easy. I personally feel that by almost any other metric, this projector matches or wins in all categories against any remotely comparable TV.</span>

<span>I've had this since mid-December 2021 and I love it! This is my second projection TV, and while I loved the old one, this one is so much better. When combined with an ALR screen, this truly replaces your standard TV. I can have all of the light in the room on their brightest and the blinds fully open, and this is screen is just as sharp and bright as any standard TV. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that it's brighter. The color and clarity are just phenomenal, and everyone who comes over is blown away. I've read another review where someone seems to think that you can't reliably connect anything but the android dongle that comes with this, that this "blanks out". That's simply not true. I think, perhaps, that they were confused by the fact that different sources can have different resolution limits, so when you first connect to something that is, say *not* 4k, the projector will adjust the picture mode automatically to accommodate that and will blank out for about 2 seconds to do that. I've had no issues connecting my PS4, PS5, Sony Blu-Ray player, and Amazon Fire Cube to this projector.<br/><br/>Words fail when trying to convey that quality of this picture; it really must be seen to be believed. Like I stated in my title: this is everything I expected it would be. And more.</span>

<span>Picture and brightness are AMAZING. Very very happy with the picture for movies, sports, casual TV watching. 4K HDR is very vibrant. Film Maker Mode is very good for the deeper blacks and true color tones for your high quality cinema viewing. 60hz ref is meh. Would have loved 120hz, but for the price and quality, this projector delivers. Auto close top is a nice touch, adds some dust protection when not viewing. The projector is fairly large, so plan out what kind of shelf/stand you will be using. It needs to be sturdy, and the appropriate height/width.<br/><br/>Don't take lightly the measurements required to set this projector up at the right height, distance from the wall, and distance from your projector screen.<br/><br/>The BenQ Roku Dongle is okay... I don't like that they force your hand in using this streaming device, as there are only 2 HDMI ports, 1 is your ARC, the other is "required" for the "BenQ Roku Dongle". So you will need to get a multi function receiver if you want set up your sound through the HDMI ARC + include your various FireTV/AppleTV/Xbox/etc.<br/><br/>The settings menu isn't anything great, but it works. You're going to want to play around with the settings for a while. You get 2 remotes. One massive one for the projector, one smaller one for the BenQ Roku. I don't use their roku system hardly at all. But I plugged my Apple TV in to the HDMI that "requires" the BenQ, and my Apple TV would glitch out frequently. Very annoying. It appears that HDMI port truly is set for their Benq Dongle only.<br/><br/>This projector does put out a good amount of heat. After a 3 hour viewing of Avengers, the theatre room was significantly warmer. Very noticeable. The fan is pretty quiet for the most part. The front speaker is not great, you will want a sound bar at minimum.<br/><br/>I haven't been able to get my picture EXACTLY perfect. As there is some rounding happening along the top edge. And the bottom corners don't align perfectly. But this is where making sure your measurements are exact comes in, I assume. I plan to keep tinkering with it. Overall, I am HAPPY. Not perfect, but awesome for the price and the quality.</span>

<span>My review of Ben V7050i short throw projector. Let me describe myself first. I am approaching this review as a film lover lens only. I am not a gamer.  I am a huge fan of Ben Q. I have purchase 3 projectors from them. The colors are amazing and product is high quality. This is my second 4K ( First one was HT3550). This projector is simple amazing. If I compare it to HT3550( my first review ***.5) to V7050i, this projector blows it away with brightness, detail, and presentation. Yet, it should for the price. This is a short throw projector. I have a small room so my 92 inches screen stand estimate 7-8  inches from screen. I did have little issues installing it. This was because I underestimated the room size and frankly I am in the basement so the floor is not totally flat. That can throw off alot when you install. If you have ideal room, this should not take you no longer than 10 minutes. All the installation issues were my own fault. Use the Ben Q calculator on their site to help with installation. You get two remotes, a machine and one big box. I received it in perfect condition. I purchase it through Amazon because no interest 12 month plan.Yea, another loan ( sarcasm) . Yet, I have no regrets. I will also recommend you if you want more reviews to check out Youtube ( Chris Mejestic, sparechange ,and  projector screen). Now back to review. This machine is a dream for 1st timers or people with limited space.  The instructions I thought were little confusing, yet this could be my inexperience with short throw . But When everything was done, the picture is simple perfect. I love the film making mode. Remember, everyone is different. You might like another mode or you can manually change settings. Right off the bat, the colors are vibrant and detail is astounding. I thought I had it good with the HT3550 4k , but this machine spoils me. It should, it cost twice as much. The brightness is very good. My basement does have ambient light, yet this does a great job with presentation. But when the room is totally dark, this is where it excels. From previous reviews, gamers might be disappointed with lag time. But for me, this is about movies and it does not disappoint. The colors pop out at you. The 3D is fantastic. The black levels are ok. Frankly I would not have notice unless I read reviews about it. They are mostly noticeable in Black and white films. Again, I would not have notice unless I did not read or watch reviews on product. The sound is ok. But guys, if you are going to buy this, get yourself a half way decent sound bar. The streaming devices are fine, but I have it connected with my Rocku. It is a laser projector so you have 20,000 hours of life. I like that it has a protector cover over the Lens when you turn it on and off. Everything about this machine is quality made. Compared to other projectors, this is little above average on size and weight. But not quality and presentation. This machine is an investment for movie watchers. It is a luxury item and you get what you pay for. If you want more for your buck for Ben Q , then you get HT3550. If you want the finest presentation and best movie experience, you get the Ben Q V7050i. Finally, I want to say that I am so happy with this projector. I have been enjoying my 4k films so much lately. The streaming looks fantastic too. Do your research on what you want. For me, This machine was the one for me. 5 stars: strengths: color,  clearity, menu,, brightness, set up, great for small rooms or apartments, remotes, overall prevention of the machine, 3D,  and a huge plus it does not project too much heat and minimum amount of sound. Weakness: price ( you get what you pay for),gaming time ( based on other reviewers ), sound (its ok, it's not Bose), black levels<br/>with black in whites ( yet good enough for me and I am a stickler on film presentation) . I hope this review helps you and have a good day.<br/>One year later: The projector works fine. I still love the presentation .. Yet, I will update  a few things. With this projector, you will not be able to connect a atmos soundbar or system. This projector does not support it. I wish this projector had a 3rd HDMI connector. It would make my life easier. Still, I don't regret getting it.</span>

<span>I have just over two years of experience with short-throw laser projectors and I am extremely impressed with the BenQ V7050i. In short, not only is the image quality better than the 4K Ultra Short Throw projector I was using before but there are features on the V7050i I will never be able to live without.<br/><br/>The build quality of the V7050i is fantastic. It feels stable and sturdy. Being that it lives on a shelf my kids can reach, I am not afraid of it getting damaged. The closing cover that protects from dust and my kids fingerprints is enough of a reason to purchase this projector over all others on the market. BenQ must have really listened to customer complaints about other projectors on the market. The simplicity of the alignment rulers that pop out to make it easier to square up to the wall is a perfect example of putting the user first and thinking through their experience. I have lost count of how many times I have had to realign my projector because one of my kids bumped it.<br/><br/>The image quality is unmatched. You only realize there is something better out there when you get to see it for yourself and the V7050i has detail and sharpness that my kids were able to detect over our previous projector.<br/><br/>The audio quality out of the internal speaker is ok and pretty impressive for being an all-in-one unit. I have external speakers so I only tested the internal speaker for a few moments just to see how it compared to my old projector. It's on par with a small soundbar.<br/><br/>The user experience of these projectors always worries me because there never seems to be much attention to detail but this is not the case with the V7050i. The menu was simple to get through and the apps seemed to load quickly. I use an Apple TV 4K, so I don't spend much time in the system UI, but it was a much better experience than my previous projector provided.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic projector for the price. The options seem to be increasing daily, so it takes a lot for a new product to stick out. Having never experienced a BenQ projector as an owner, I was very impressed. The V7050i feels like a premium product just like some of BenQ's higher-end computer monitors I have used in the past.<br/><br/>I have recommended projectors to many people over the years both who have visited my home and to many online. Right now, you can't get anything better than the V7050i for the money. I highly recommend it.</span>

<span>This will be a long review, as I'm trying to provide a good bit of detail to help others make a decision, but hopefully it will be worth the read. If you already know what you're looking for in a projector and just want to know the pros and cons of this one, skip to the bullets toward the end. Otherwise, read on for some guidance in figuring out how to pick a projector based on what I learned in my research. A couple things to make clear upfront: I'm not a videophile, and so I can't comment on things like picture quality, etc with anything more than my layman perceptions, which I will provide, and this is my first foray into projectors, which I spent a fair amount of time reading up on in preparation--and was, and still am, confused on much regarding the area--and wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.<br/><br/>My reasoning for going with a projector instead of a big screen TV, like I was originally planning on doing, was three-fold: I wanted a very large screen (my previous TV was 70" and I wanted to go at least that big, and ideally bigger), I wanted to keep the price down since I was limited to what I could afford at the time, and I wanted something easy to move, since my current residence is temporary. A projector was the obvious choice, providing a very large screen (80-120+ inches) for anywhere from half what a midrange TV at the low end of that scale would cost to twice, or more, what a high-end 80" TV would cost, and obviously being very portable, especially comapred to a big TV.<br/><br/>The next issue was figuring out what I needed in a projector. My requirements were that it had to be useable in fairly bright light, good picture quality without issues like rainbow effect (I don't know if I'm sensitive to it, but it seems like the type of thing that would bother me, and I didn't want to take the risk), and reliable.<br/><br/>I spent a fair amount of time debating 1080p/HD vs 4K, and came to the conclusion that there's not enough difference in quality to justify the extra cost of 4K projectors if you don't *need* 4K. Since I use mostly 1080p content with some 720p, and most advice was that a 1080p toward the top of the HD price range is going to be as good as or better than a 4K projector that costs more, I decided to go for an HD one. I was concerned because of the anticipated screen size and viewing distance, but sitting 10' away from an ~95" screen it looks great, and even 720p looks fine. But again, I'm not a videophile. More about the picture in the bullets below.<br/><br/>Another thing I spent quite a bit of time debating was brightness/lumens. Some things I learned were that the brighter projectors often achieve their brightness (and indeed this is the case for the brighter version of the same projector models) by using a clear window in the color wheel, to let more light through since white light is getting through instead of light filtered to a certain color. The downside to this is that it tends to wash out colors, and most reviews I read indicated that once you adjusted the colors to make them look right, these projectors were the same, if not worse, brightness compared to the "normal" models. So they're only really useful if you absolutely *need* that extra brightness and don't mind things being washed out as a result. And even if you plan on needing it in a few years, you're probably going to do better buying a cheaper HD projector now and buying a 4K projector then, when they're better and cheaper.<br/><br/>Another thing, and this should come as no surprise, is that the stated lumens is often exaggerated and can't be used to compare, and it's best to pick some projectors you're interested in then check reviews to see what their output really is after calibration, not to mention just outright deception. A really good site for this, and one I used a lot, is projectorcentral dot com.<br/><br/>The other thing I spent a LOT of time on was trying to figure out which way to go to achieve a good screen size with limited placement options. I originally was planning on going with UST because that seemed to be the easiest option, allowing placement right by the wall with very large screen sizes. I ultimately decided against it for three reasons: the options are limited, and I couldn't find one that would give me a good range of around 60-100+ inches (they're typically smaller ranges, e.g. 80-100"), they tend to cost more, and it's highly recommended to use a special screen with them, which are very, very expensive. I looked at short throw projectors, trying to find one that would provide the range of screen sizes I was looking for either with placement a couple feet away or 10' away but, again, there were very few choices. It seems most are designed to be placed 15' or more from the screen. This limitation was the main reason I chose the BenQ, as it was really this one and one other that would ultimately achieve the desired screen sizes at the distance I needed to mount it, and I went with this one, IIRC, because the review of it showed it as being slightly better in brightness and/or color, but they were otherwise very similar. For figuring out your throw/mounting distance and screen size(s), a couple very useful sites are screen-size dot info and projectorscreen dot com.<br/><br/>Some quick thoughts about a few other brands: ViewSonic appears to be pretty good, especially considering they tend to be some of the cheapest options, though I decided against them, IIRC, mainly because the warranty seems questionable; Epsons are typically high-regarded, especially for lack of DLP rainbow effect due to their use of 3LCD, but numerous different models had a trend in their reviews of the power supplies failing after a few to several months, so Epson apparently cheaps out on that (very important) component, which turned me away from them (if not for that, I almost certainly woul have gone with them); and JVC &gt; Sony are very well-regarded, especially for their picture quality and contrast/blackness levels, but they are very expensive and, especially with JVC, have expensive replacement bulbs. If money isn't really an issue, those are almost certainly going to be your best best.<br/><br/>On the topic of the rainbow effect, one thing you want to look for is a high-speed color wheel. This projector has a 6x wheel, which means it spins much faster than a standard wheel, therefore drastically reducing rainbow effects, often to the point they become imperceptible to most, if not all, people.<br/><br/>One of the big issues, which is mentioned below but I wanted to expand on it, has to do with the vertical lens shift. I read about the limitations with it beforehand, but didn't really understand it and the implications. Essentially, the bottom of the picture is level with, or straight across from, the lens with no lens shift. If you turn the knob to add lens shit, it raises the image so the bottom of it is several inches above where it was. This allows you to move the image higher without having to raise the projector higher, which I suppose could possibly be useful but, frankly, it seems to me that it would be much more useful for most people to be able to *lower* the image, and it certainly would have been for me. Think about it. This is a short-throw projector, which is typically going to be placed 10-15' (*maybe* 20') from the screen, either on a shelf or mounted to the ceiling or high up on a wall. If it's on a shelf, which would have to be higher than your couch/chair, the bottom of the screen is going to already be a good 42-48" high, and the screen will probably be large enough you won't have room to raise it any before it hits the ceiling. And if it's mounted high by the ceiling, it will be mounted upside-down, meaning the lens shift will actually *lower* the screen. So that's the problem I have: mine is mounted on the wall as close to the ceiling as I could possibly get it (I built my own mount), and the top of the screen (which is the "bottom" in the context of lens shift in this case, since the projector is inverted) is about 8" from the ceiling, and I can't get it any closer. This limits the size I can make the screen, since I can only make the bottom go so low. If the lens shift allowed for adjustment the other way, I could have an ~110" screen or larger instead of being limited to 95". To me, it seems like a very big oversight and poor engineering.<br/><br/>And now to list more briefly the various pros &amp; cons I've found so far:<br/><br/>+ Bright - It's not the brightest projector, but based on reviews, it's better than some that claim more lumens, and it has an RGBRGB color wheel instead of RGBW (or whatever it is), meaning the color accuracy is good, and once the "brighter" projectors are calibrated to have a similar color accuracy their brightness is actually similar to this one. It's not very good in real bright light, but with modest diffusing of sunlight with blinds/curtains it's watchable even in the middle of a bright day, and in even a moderately dim environment it does great (and, as mentioned below, that's in eco mode; I rarely have to switch to normal mode). It's not going to look as bright and good as a TV, but I find the extreme large size more than makes up for that, especially considering the price. I love watching movies on it, and even TV is brought to a whole new level.<br/>+ Good picture quality (again from a layman's point of view). Everything is very sharp, colors looks good (I didn't even do any calibration out of the box), and looks great even cast onto a white(ish) wall, which also makes for a very clean look.<br/>+ Cost - It's cheap for what it offers, and bulb replacements are reasonable.<br/>+ Quality - After looking at lots of reviews for lots of projectors of different brands, BenQ seems to have a good combination of relatively low serious complaints (unlike Epson) with a good warranty (unlike, possibly, ViewSonic and Epson).<br/>+ No rainbow effect that I've noticed after much viewing of different material.<br/>+ No perceptible input lag. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I haven't noticed any issues with any of the games I've played.<br/>+ Backlit remote<br/>+ SmartEco mode, according to a professional review, operates as a sort of dynamic contrast/iris, which in theory sounds like it would be great. And it might be, but I keep it in eco mode 99% of the time to make the bulb last longer.<br/><br/>- Noise - It's not loud, but it's not quiet. It sits about 4' above my head, and it's definitely noticeable *all* the time, sometimes worse than others.<br/>- Gray border (~1-2") around screen. Apparently this is common but is going away with newer projectors. It's only minimally bothersome on its own, and I rarely notice it, but the bigger problem comes into play when trying to use keystone. Granted, it's always recommended not to use it, but I tried using it to get the screen closer to the ceiling, so I could make it bigger, but when it modifies the image by bending it into a trapezoid so it's rectangular on the wall, the border is trapezoidal and looks really, really bad, making keystone effectively useless.<br/>- No power zoom/focus. I realize this is a feature only found in much more expensive projectors, and I obviously knew it didn't have it when I bought it, but it would be nice if this became a more common feature. It doesn't seem like it should cost much to implement, and it would be *extremely* handy. I would have happily paid an extra $100 for the same projector with this feature, and possibly more.<br/>- No sleep mode. I find this one very frustrating and unforgivable. On a device where you want to do everything you can to minimize the amount of time the lamp is used, you'd think it would have this very basic feature that has existed in almost every TV for the past, oh I don't know, couple decades or so at least. The omission of this is just absurd, and one of many *stupid* decisions by the software/firmware team, who should be ashamed quite frankly.<br/>- Eco Blank mode blanks the screen to save lamp life when taking a break from viewing without necessitating powering the projector completely off, which is great, in theory, but it projects a message at the bottom of the screen showing that it's in Eco Blank mode. I'm sure this is so you don't forget it's still on, but it makes me wonder how effective it actually is, since the lamp is clearly still on in order to project that message. It should just show it for maybe 15 or 30 seconds every 5 minutes. Besides, as mentioned before, the projector isn't exactly quiet, so it's unlikely you'll forget it's on unless it's positioned at least 10' away.<br/>- You can't change the lamp mode (normal/eco/SmartEco) for a few minutes or so after powering the projector on. And I didn't see any mention of this in the manual (it should be mentioned in the menu, so you can see what's going on when you go try to change it). At first I thought it was malfunctioning.<br/>- There's no button on the remote to directly change the lamp mode, so you have to go through the menu each time, discouraging the use of the different modes.<br/>- Once the projector starts shutting down, you have to wait for it to completely finish, going through its cooldown where the fans run for a minute or so after it powers off, before you can turn it back on. It should be able to just power right back on at any point in the shutdown process.<br/><br/>Many of the cons are nitpicks, but they're really quite ridiculous things that I just can't fathom why they are the way they are, and they could probably be fixed through an update. If not for these stupid design decisions and the lens shift limitation, this would easily be a 4-star projector. With those improvements and a reduction in noise of 2-3dB, it would be 5-stars. And if it had all that and power zoom/focus, even at an extra $150, give or take, it would be 5-stars. As it is, it's a good projector with some annoying oversights at a fair price, but I suspect you could probably do better if you're not looking for something in this specific throw category, i.e. if you can use a longer or shorter throw projector.<br/><br/>I really love watching things with this projector, but I don't necessarily love the projector due to these various issues. BenQ can do better, and while they should be proud of the hardware design for the most part, they should really have spent a bit more time on the fans and thinking through the lens shift, and the software/firmware team should just be fired (I know, that sounds harsh, but seriously, no sleep function!?!?...).</span>

<span>So I have a outdoor blow up screen. I have other projectors and those pictures are nice. But this blew it out of the water.  The brightness and clear picture is amazing.<br/><br/>The speaker is nice. it work well if your behind the projector. For being a speaker on the projector I would give it a 8.2 score. I use  secondary speaker system that I connect using the 3mm jack on projected.<br/><br/>The remote is very easy to use.<br/><br/>Now this is a big projector. I am looking for a case that will hold and protect it. If you know of a good one let me know.<br/><br/>Overall at this price point and all the projectors I read up on and YouTubes I watched. this was the best one at this price point.<br/><br/>More score for this is a 9.5. And the reason I say this is there is always room for improvement. But not much.</span>

<span>Hi<br/><br/>Would like to be short. I'll try:<br/>This is the PJ to buy if you don't want to spend $3000 or more for a great Picture. Let's get it out of the gates: Cinematic Experience requires a large picture... It begins IMO at 100 inch diagonal. For that , at this point in time you need a Front PJ .. This PJ can light up a 10 feet wide neutral (1.0) gain screen with ease.. any gain and it would go 15 feet IME . You need a good screen... a decent one. There are bargains out there.. a subject for a different review. I have't tested 3D...<br/>So ...<br/><br/>Perhaps this is the best PJ under $1000. It rivals the color quality of many well -reviewed projectors that cost 4 times (or more) as much. Out of the box, the colors are spectacular. The picture is bright, very bright. 10 feet wide screen is lit easily .. No issue.. The image remains BRIGHT. Color accuracy is spot-on. There are weaknesses when out of the box ..  I don't know if they can be alleviated through ISF. Lack of uniformity. if you project a white field it is not uniformly white ... I have not measured it but it is there and so far doesn't bother me much om most movies (maybe on all movies i have watched frore the 3 weeks I've acquired it ...) .. Contrast could be better .... Shadows details is clearly lacking ..perhaps can be improved with calibration... The issue is that most people that would acquire a $700 PJ would not bother to have it calibrated for $700 .. So unless you can calibrate it yourself ... I can but haven't :D... What else? is a con? I don't know yet .. still not glaring. There are PJ that do beter of course. They cost a lot ore and for most people ... including videophiles ., they may not even notice ;)<br/><br/>A few issues: Once you go front PJ, the room must be dark, very dark. IOW please control the lighting.. No light is better ....else get a big flat screen! No PJ works well with ambient lighting present .<br/>Room color better be neutral.. grat yo blackish.. Else Contrast is lost . On this PJ contrast can be lost easily<br/>Get yourself a good mount. They don't cost much these days.. I got this one: v" Suptek White Universal Projector Ceiling Mount Bracket" for $18 at Amazon and it is good. Screws are over specs... Huge screws for a relatively light PJ but better be safe than sorry with PJ falling .. over people with dire consequences ...<br/>Get a HT system or a good sound bar .. The sound system in this or any PJ is a joke...<br/>This PJ needs to be closer to the screen than most . Can be an advantage .... or not.<br/>Installation must be carefully planned: POwer source on the ceiling, Long HDMI cable...IR repeater system, etc. Don't expect the electronic keystone correction to work for you .  Vertical lens alignment is not that great either so ...Align the PJ with the screen and ... prepare to get your jaw off the floor :D<br/><br/>10 years ago that kind of performance was only attainable by PJ costing $10,000 or more .. Some of those old time greats may have had better lenses or better white-field uniformity , even better contrast .. Choose the area of superiority that suits you most but not overall better than this $700 machine  ... not a slam-dunk ...  rather subtleties that may be lost on many...<br/>Enthusiastic recommendation!!</span>

<span>I was thinking for a while about what would happen if my one LG 4k 3D 65" TV finally went out. You cannot buy new 3D TV's anymore. And I have lots of 3D blurays. So, I finally decided to replace my Panasonic PT-AE2000U projector in dedicated theater room with this BenQ.<br/><br/>I did not have high hopes for this projector, given the price. BTW, the Panasonic projector is still a great 1080p non-3D projector, and I highly recommend it if full HD is sufficient for you. I needed the 3D functionality, and the 4k was a bonus. Please note this is not native 4k, but 4k pixel shifting. But the picture still looks amazing!<br/><br/>I also hesitated buying a projector that used DLP active shutter glasses, as the LG TV uses passive 3D glasses. I remember in their early days the active shutter had a lot of strobing. Seems like that's all been fixed now. And you get a lot more color coming through with the DLP active shutter glasses, which I did not realize. I bought a 4-pack of the Boblov glasses, which are fabulous, and very reasonably priced. You can find them here:<br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C9SWQKM?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/><br/>I did not give this a full 5 stars because it's missing some legacy inputs and regular sound output jack, I would have liked to have, as well as the horizontal lens shift mentioned in a minute.<br/><br/> Currently the Android apps, such as YouTube, only use the projector speakers. Which, to be fair, sound quite good. I had just already wired a sound output cable above the ceiling for the old projector. Perhaps there is some converter i can buy.<br/><br/>And there is no horizontal lens shift, which would have made mounting this pj a WHOLE lot easier. The Panasonic had both vertical and horizontal lens shift, with the pj lense in the middle. This one only has vertical shift with the pj lense near to one end.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the mount I have installed in the ceiling has super adjustable mounting arms, so I was able to shift the whole pj to the left on the ceiling mount. Adjusting everything took a few hours, though.<br/><br/>My biggest concerns before receiving this projector was ability to use the already installed ceiling mount and possible issues with the video source, a Zappiti mini 4k HDR player. The player worked perfectly with this projector.<br/><br/>So, overall I very highly recommend this projector, it's super bright and has an awesome 4k picture. The 3d looks very good. Some complained about the included app dongle but I had no issues. Netflix is not available with this dongle (maybe a licensing issue?), but there are 2 HDMI ports, if you wish to use a Roku stick or similar instead.</span>

<span>This is my first time purchasing a projector, but I have experience with buying other high-res TVs and computer monitors in the past. I think for the price point ($1499.99 at the time of writing this review), this projector is well worth the money.<br/><br/>For the past week, I have been testing out the capabilities of the projector on 4k movies and games (native and streamed). I thought that the colors on the unit out of the box were superb, similar to what you would find on an IPS computer monitor that has been properly calibrated. BenQ even includes a color calibration report in the box. The sound coming from the 2 5W speakers on the projector is respectable for what they are. They won't get very loud but the quality is definitely good enough for a small outdoor venue or room. I would recommend separate speakers to pair with this projector overall, though. In comparison to the ViewSonic PX-747 4K projector ($899 at the time of writing this), which I initially purchased along with this projector to see which I preferred, you will definitely benefit a lot from sticking with the BenQ. While the sharpness of the two projectors for 1080p and 4K content does not differ vastly, the contrast on the BenQ makes a world of difference. When watching darker scenes in Stranger Things and playing darker levels in Gears of War 4 on Xbox One S it was very hard to make out the finer details and certain objects in frame on the ViewSonic. I tried to adjust the brightness and contrast to fix this but colors ended up just looking too washed out. On the BenQ, however, I immediately noticed an improvement in contrast and HDR quality and had no issues with these darker scenarios. Moreover, the BenQ was much faster when powering on or switching inputs, which doesn't sound like a huge factor but definitely helps if you use it a lot. The $600 jump between projectors, if you have the money for it, is definitely worth it if you want to have a projector that you'll be happy with for long term.<br/><br/>I will say that if you are expecting this projector to be "movie theater quality" then you may be slightly disappointed, however. The overall dynamic range is still not as good as a 4K TV at a similar price point, the projector is not bright enough for a well lit room, and the sharpness could be a little better. For something with improvements to those qualities, you'll have to upgrade even further to a better BenQ, Epson, Sony, etc projector that has native 4K. I think for most people you'd be better off spending that money on a good projector screen, projector ceiling mount, speakers, AV receiver, HDMI 2.0 HDCP 2.2 cables, 4K Bluray movies, etc to accompany this projector. You'll get rapidly diminishing returns upgrading to more expensive projectors, while this projector definitely hits the sweet spot in value (at it's very portable weighing only 9 lbs). I'd definitely recommend it!</span>

<span>O.k initial thoughts on this projector:<br/>1. Out of the box performance : Good - I still made some manual adjustment and got a better picture - so that is possible.  Look for some calibration hints in the comments and questions section.<br/>2.  Kind of noisy - Noisier than my BENQ 2050A but I didn't notice this after the film started - you might.<br/>3.  4k performance - excellent for this price level of product.  I got this for the same price as the BENQ 3550 so slight savings against regular price.<br/>4.  Sure, black levels could be better/blacker but after some manipulation of the settings I was able to achieve a nice balance and the dynamic iris on this model worked very well.  The only problem the iris had was when a super-bright light source was presented right next to a dark area in the same frame - which rarely happened.<br/>5.  Haven't tried the 3d function yet - but NOTHING compares to my 2016 passive 3D LG OLED tv!<br/>Now for my thoughts on this or any other 4k projector:<br/>If you must have one I'm sure you can find one in this or lesser price range that will satisfy your need - but my recommendation is to not buy one (at least not buy one yet).  Reason?  Because 4k media is not yet to the quality level or level of availability to really justify this expense.  My reason for saying this is that I watched 2 movies immediately after my initial setup. (For reference I have a 1:1 gain 100" projector screen)<br/>The first was "Pacific Rim".  The color and picture was just impeccable!  I wasn't going to watch the full movie but I got pulled in so I sat back and marveled at my cinema level (almost) experience. I then decided to try another disc and I pulled out my new 4k "X-MEN" (first movie in the series).  This time not so great.  I had seen part of this disc on my 4k LG 55 inch OLED and it looked pretty good so I assumed I was in for the same experience as with "Pacific Rim".  No such luck. The picture quality left much to be desired and so I was a bit disappointed through-out this presentation.  But it did give me a reference point - opposite "Pacific Rim"  - and helped solidify my feelings on buying a 4k projector.<br/>If you MUST have a 4k projector then by all means go for it, this BENQ TK850 is a very nice one - but my feeling is don't go crazy and buy a super-expensive projector unless you are a "collector".  4k discs at this point in time are too "hit or miss" in picture and sound quality. I have about an equal amount of great and poor quality 4k discs.  For sure there are some great looking discs out there - but some of them are unwatchable due to the fact they are just lousy movies.  Who collects 4k movies JUST because they look good??  There are some strange people out there that do this but I have no idea what motivates them.<br/>Final thought:<br/>Find yourself a nice less expensive 1080p projector - there are some very nice ones available and they are VERY affordable.  I also own the BENQ 2050A which I use for gaming due to its low input lag.  Unfortunately, BENQ seems to have stopped making this model and it looks at though the places you can get it used and new have recognized its value as a great gaming projector (and movies as well) and raised the price from its original cost of $749.  But, there are others out there that are great quality and low expense compared to some of the these 4k projectors.  Blu-Rays are  a WAY better value than 4k discs and you can still experience great home theater quality with blu rays and a 1080p projector.  Save your money for some other worthwhile expense.</span>

<span>(Jump to the bottom for suggested calibration settings)<br/><br/> The BenQ HT3550 has proven to be a worthy upgrade over the 1080p version.<br/><br/>Picture quality is great with one major exception, chromatic aberration. It’s the purple, blue, or green that outlines dark images next to bright images like text on a white background for example. It is quite severe on this model. If you sit far enough from the screen, greater than 1 1/2 times the width of your screen, then you won’t notice it. For those of you who sit closer you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>Other minor issues with the image is a tendency toward red, you’ll notice this in very dark scenes, and the inability to get a rich vibrant green (tends more sour green than a punchy green) and yellow (more orange-gold than a sunny yellow). Most won’t notice and the calibration settings at the bottom help.<br/><br/>Aside from that you will likely be happy with picture quality, HDR10 actually improves the image unlike other projectors (the Optoma 4K projectors are noticeably worse on HDR10 despite costing more).<br/><br/>The fan noise is noticeable when sitting close. It’s 40 decibels at four feet so you’ll want to sit as far away as possible. During regular viewing it isn’t distracting, only when audio is low or a scene is quiet. Use silent mode if you find it distracting.<br/><br/>This is a great projector for the money, you should give it a chance before considering the next step up which will cost $1,000 more for the less popular HT5550 and is likely only incrementally better.<br/><br/>Calibration settings:<br/><br/>These adjustments provided the best contrast with deepest blacks, and strong but natural colors and most importantly realistic skin tones.<br/><br/>BenQ Adjusts the D-Cinema settings for color but they were surprisingly flat and the darkest blacks were crushed requiring Gamma to be changed to 1.8, and contrast dialed way down. Therefore, use HDR10 whenever available for best image and if your equipment (streaming device, receiver, etc.,  doesn’t support it then use the same settings below under Cinema mode. If you sit close to the projector then Silent mode is also acceptable.<br/><br/>HDR10 / Cinema / Silent<br/>Brightness, Contrast, Color, Tint: 50<br/>Sharpness: 5<br/>HDR Brightness: +1<br/>Color Temp: Warm<br/>Red, Green, Blue Gain: 100<br/>Red Offset: 256<br/>Green Offset: 261<br/>Blue Offset: 260<br/><br/>Color Management Hue/Saturation/Gain:<br/>Red: 233/215/219<br/>Green: 187/228/164<br/>Blue: 217/201/180<br/>Cyan: 229/171/210<br/>Magenta: 146/177/248<br/>Yellow: 212/232/216<br/><br/>Cinema Master:<br/>Color Enhancer &amp; Flesh Tone: 0<br/>Pixel Enhancer 4K: 2<br/>Motion Enhancer 4K: Off<br/><br/>Dynamic Iris: Low<br/>Brilliant Color: On<br/>Wide Color Gamut: Off<br/>Light Mode: Normal</span>

<span>TH685 is an ok projector for the price. I had an Epson 2250 before benq which I think is a much better projector overall. Refresh rate and picture quality are a bit disappointing. I was expecting more.  NO horizontal lens shift is a pain and makes it extremely difficult to setup if you’re not positioning the device in the center and at a certain height. Epson is much easier to setup and is flexible at projecting from different angles. If you don’t have an audio system to connect and rely on the projector then benq has better sound quality compared to Epson. I got the 2250 at a great price during a sale so maybe comparing it to th685 isn’t fair but I think feature wise Epson is better overall.</span>

<span>Bright enough to see in the day with windows open. There are different measurements for how brightness is measured for projectors. "Ansi Lumens" are the best current measurement(2022) for how bright a projector is as it represents how much brightness we perceive straight off the screen after light has hit said screen. What you see is exactly what you get. No cut corners. 3500 Ansi is enough<br/><br/>Unfortunately: the HDMI ports do not support HDMI ARC.<br/><br/>I have an optical cord with a 5.1 surround system and had to get an hdmi audio extracter that supports 5.1 sound to make it work with the projector while it was hooked up to the Xbox Series X and surround system</span>

<span>Just bought the BenQ MW612 2019 model projector and I'm very happy with it! Here is the BenQ WXGA Projector (4000 ANSI Lumens, 20,000:1 Contrast Ratio, WXGA 1280x800 resolution) to the left side of my 7-year-old ViewSonic PJD5533W Projector (2800 ANSI lumens, 15,000:1 contrast ratio, XGA 1024x768 resolution). Both projectors were around $500 when I bought them, though the ViewSonic was purchased in 2013 and somehow this old projector is $700 now(?!).<br/><br/>As you can see, the BenQ projection is a lot brighter and the words are a lot clearer.<br/><br/>The second picture shows the BenQ all set up about 10 feet away from the wall from a high point. I have changed the vertical keystone and the end result is an image that's even bigger than the old ViewSonic projector.</span>

<span> The ultimate upgrade in any living space. 4k HDR content looks absolutely stunning for movie watching and the gaming experience is pretty great although I just purchased a console for our bedroom and coming from the best gaming PC setup money can buy to this it feels pretty bad but I think that's more of the consoles lack of power rather then the projectors capabilities since on paper this projector is as capable as the most high end TV's for gaming. Either way for the money I could recommend then projector nto anybody. Remember good picture only makes up half of the experience so budget yourself for a surround sound and if you are like me and find sound to be more important for the experience I highly recommend the Samsung HW-Q950A. It's a 11.1.4 Dolby Atmos wireless surround sound system that really helps put you right in the middle of the scene or battle and completly changed this bedroom entertainment experience since I had only a 3.1 channel Soundbar at time of purchasing this projector. The sound bar also has 2 HDMI inputs to expand on the connectivity.</span>

<span>This is a great projector. The picture quality is amazing and my family loves it. I just wish I would have gotten the non Android TV version. This the Android TV version does support HTMI arc but only at 5.1 surround sound. Because of this, I had to get an Nvidia shield to be able to use my Dolby Atmos setup. Now I have two Android TV devices connected to the projector and the projector always defaults to the built-in Android TV which gets very confusing and requires three remotes to control it. And you cannot simply unplug the built-in Android TV.</span>

<span>23 April 2018 -- I am downgrading my rating due to poor experience both with the projector and customer service. They continue to release new FW for the projector and the only way to take advantage of the new FW (that fixes big bugs) is to swap the unit out through BenQ. My 3rd replacement showed up and it was FW 1.0.0, two revisions behind the one it was supposed to replace. Tried calling customer service and was on hold for too long before I had to hang up and resort to email. I was initially thrilled with this projector but the bugs and issues I've had lately have diminished my enthusiasm significantly.<br/><br/>There are still way too many of the original FW models out there and they are still being shipped to customers.<br/><br/>March 25, 2018 update:<br/>I received a replacement unit the Monday following my original review and I can now fairly say, more than pleased with this product. I have been running it on a nightly basis for about 3 weeks, between gaming, movies and streaming i figure I've logged over 150 hours, no issues. I have a 4K TV and when i compare the image quality of this projector to my TV, it remarkable how close they really are. I'm not an A/V pro or a 4K elitist, but now that I've been able to log some time against this projector I am happy with my purchase. Also, for those considering this projector, get the 3 year replacement plan, its worth it compared to what other retailers are offering. 4K was made for large screen formats and this projector crushes the comp! Bottom line up front: It rocks, I'm more than pleased, money well spent, and I wish I had a bigger wall! upgraded to 5 stars<br/><br/>I spent copious amounts of time researching this projector. I've been following it since last fall waited for a good month and a half before purchasing so that I could see what customers were saying...those risk takers that run out and buy on day one! Well, from what I was seeing on youtube and reading in Amazon reviews, I felt it was safe enough to go ahead and pull the trigger...boy was I wrong, so far. My projector arrived Friday evening. Upon opening the amazon shipping box, it looked as though I was getting a factory referb. The BenQ box seemed poorly packed, like it had been opened and then resealed, but not carefully. I figured it was just how BenQ packed their products so I didn't dwell on it. I had everything in place for an easy install and all went well. The projector fired up, I ran through the setup and soon I had a beautiful 100" picture. I watched a few Xbox One X 4K previews, ran the Xbox One X game/app called Insects, played some 4K games, all for a total of about 2-3 hours. Suddenly there was some freaking out flashing on my screen and the pic was gone and the amber LED was flashing on the projector and it shut down after a few minutes. I turned the projector back on and it was as if the projector reset, I had to run through the setup steps again. Following the second setup, picture came back but the same malfunction repeated. After the third attempt to figure out what was happening, I noticed the fans were not working and then the system went dark and I got a lamp malfunction LED. After repeated attempts to get the projector to turn on, it would not. The lamp is spent. I have requested a replacement through Amazon and I will update my review based on projector #2.<br/>Bottom line for those looking at buying this projector...WAIT...wait as long as you can. The demand is so high for this projector and in my humble opinion, quality control has taken a back seat to production. By this summer I suspect that the bugs will be worked out.<br/>I barely had any time to give good Pros/Cons but here is what I have so far.<br/>Pros: Amazing picture, easy setup, price.<br/>Cons: Early models are buggy; Quality control is lacking; buttons on remote are sticky; no Game mode<br/>A couple of last thoughts, the one thing that seems to drive everyone, or nearly everyone, crazy is the "light border". Well from my short time with the projector...it was a non-issue for me...didn't even notice it. I have a 100" screen with a 2" black border and the walls are dark navy blue. I was so focused on the picture and things happening on screen that I never even gave it a thought. Additionally, others have complained about fan noise. When the fans were working, again I didn't notice, or it didn't bother me. My projector is ceiling mounted above my seating area...it could be that these fans were quieter than my old projector, but no matter, it was a non-issue for me.<br/>Lastly, for those looking at viewing on 100” screen, I will point out that focusing is very, very tight and difficult to dial in. I noticed when I made the size larger, the focus adjustment was much smoother and easier to dial in. Just a thought to keep in mind.<br/>I will update this review after I’ve have much more time with a working model.</span>

<span>There is a lot of positives about this unit... Price, cant beat it and the color accuracy is fantastic. I have owned a couple epsons in the past and always had problems such as reds that looked pink or input lag that messes up the sound from syncing. Odd things that are distracing enough to have to mess with settings until i give up on getting it right or if i fix one color, and it messes up the others. This unit out of the box looks perfect. I still havn't messed with anything. I set the projector up about 14 ft from the 120 inch screen and it fits perfect. It takes 2 people to dial in the focus (its that detailed and crisp). It does exactly what i was hoping it would do.<br/><br/>With all the positive, there are a few negatives. The picture looks great, and there is about a 6 inch light border around the image which really isnt all that bad considering how amazing the image looks. The biggest downside is there is a high pitched whine coming from my unit. It took a couple days to notice it... but now its all I hear during dark scenes. Im hoping maybe its just going to go away once the machine breaks in... wishful thinking. If it keeps up... its bad enough i might consider returning the unit.<br/><br/>I would have given it 5 stars if it wasnt for this issue.</span>

<span>After reading reviews and looking at product specs for 2 weeks we finally decided on purchasing the BenQ HT2550. This projector is replacing an Epson Home Cinema 3020 which is about 5 years old. This is our 3rd projector since 2001. Each one was better and less expensive than the previous one.<br/><br/>After reading everything we could find we were going to get the BenQ TK800. Then we found out the main differences between the two were the lumens and the DLP color wheel. The BenQ 2550 has a RGBRGB color wheel and 2200 lumens while the BenQ TK800 uses a RGBW color wheel and 3000 lumens.<br/>The lumens were not an issue since our old projector had 2300 lumens and it had plenty of brightness.<br/><br/>The color wheel was more of a deciding factor since we have owned 2 DLP tvs in the past and "rainbows" were a concern. The RGBRGB color wheel is supposed to lessen the rainbow effect. While setting up a Roku Ultra we did see some rainbows while in some extremely contrasted setup  screens. The first movie we watched was the 4k version of Deadpool 2 and we did not see any rainbows. We then checked out several scenes from Black Panther and Passengers and the picture looked awesome. Blu-ray dvds also look better . We decided to get the BenQ HT2550 over the BenQ TK800 because of the color wheel and the lumens were not an issue because our home theater is totally dark and 2200 lumens is enough.<br/><br/>We watched Deadpool 2 before making any adjustments to the projector and it looked great.<br/><br/>This projector is quieter than the one it replaced. You don't hear it while watching movies. you can hear the fan while the room is quiet but it's not that loud.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an affordable 4K projector you can't go wrong with the BenQ HTR2550.<br/>It also came with a $100 Amazon gift card which brought the price down to $1399.</span>

<span>I had an older BenQ 720P projector.  It worked well, but it was time to step into newer technology and maybe get a 4K if possible for my budget.  The HT2550 has met my needs perfectly.  I did my homework, looked at several models from several manufacturers and for a cost-feature-performance package, the HT2550 looked ideal.  It has turned out to be just that.  I suggest you follow installation guidelines -&gt; before you purchase to make sure what you are buying will work in the space you've chosen.  In my case, with an existing home theater, I just had to do careful measurements and make sure my mounting spot would work and fill my screen.<br/><br/>I'm very pleased with the purchase.  I use this projector in a dedicated home theater room which has windows with darkening drapes.  The picture is vibrant and the resolution is great.  My existing HDMI cable worked fine, even though it was 15+ years old.  I got an updated receiver that handles 4K switching and it all has come together perfectly.<br/><br/>I had one occasion to ask BenQ a question prior to installation and was able to quickly speak to a person who was knowledgeable and helpful.  No indefinite hold times and no language barrier.  If the time comes for another update down the road, BenQ will be first on my list to check for products.</span>

<span>First time using a projector for games like Fortnite and it's terrific. The responsiveness is great, the picture and sound are excellent, and the projector has all the streaming apps so you can use it for movies as well. Really pleased so far. We used a generic ceiling mount with no problem. The wall we used just has plain white paint and it looks amazing. No need to get a screen or apply digital paint.</span>

<span>I ended up buying this projector "like new" since it didn't drop in price during the duration of my price watching. When I saw it for "like new" at a cheaper price, I jumped on it and bought the extended warranty for a great deal. I have used it in my backyard for movies/shows and in my garage as well, and it is fantastic. HDR content is great as well. The brightness doesn't disappoint as it is plenty bright.<br/><br/>Even though it's a 1080p projector, it provides an incredible picture. I would bet that most people would think it was 4k.<br/><br/>As an avid PC gamer (I play with a 144 hz G-Sync monitor with 1 ms response time), the response time is fantastic. I knew if I didn't get a projector that had gaming capability, I would be disappointed and my kids would be too. Projectors have a known history of poor input lag, but this one absolutely delivers. Currently, I have only tried my Steam Deck and PS4 Pro...still need to connect my gaming PC to it).<br/><br/> I purchased this projector primarily for outdoor movie night with my family, friends, and neighbors. I did end up purchasing a 120" elite screen with a standing frame, and I'm glad I did because it is portable and the picture looks great on it (assembly is easy).<br/><br/>Another reason why I purchased this projector is because it included HDMI ARC. A lot of cheaper projectors did not have this feature. I wanted to be able to run my Dolby Atmos soundbar to it with my ROKU. My kids tell me it's like being in the theater and now want to watch everything on it.<br/><br/>The built-in speaker is actually quite good; however, you'll want a soundbar or external speakers for a larger space.<br/><br/>I will be sending it back for BenQ to provide the much needed firmware update for it. BenQ told me, prior to using it, that the firmware update resolves HDR issues and some HDMI handshaking issues. I can confirm that I do have random issues with my soundbar running through the HDMI ARC port on the projector with my ROKU connected to the soundbar (sometimes I don't get a signal). BenQ is providing free shipping since the product is still under warranty (good on them). I did not have this problem if I connected my ROKU to the non-HDMI ARC port and relied on the projector speaker.<br/><br/>As a side note, when I received the projector, it only had approximately 30 hrs of viewing time on it, and I got it for a 25% discount.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't a gamer and want a good projector, this one is for you.</span>
