<span>I bought this speaker for good value and some fun. I knew I was not going to get high-fidelity. I expected the lows and highs were going to be weak or non-existent, and I was not disappointed because I got what I paid for. It is lightweight for its size and thus probably had a puny magnet. I bought it anyways because I just needed something for camping and karaoke. I also bought the Pyle wireless mic kit and it worked perfectly with this speaker, except the echoing was not adjustable on the speaker or mic. Overall, I give it 3.5 stars but had to round it up to 4.</span>

<span>Hello All. Remember this is a review, my experience dont have to be yours. So I order this item for myself to try out to see if i would alao buy one for my son. But when it came I opened it to the top cracked in real bad. I contacted the company and they were apologetic and offered a replacement. I agreed and offered to send the broken item back, they declined and said to not worry about it. I appreciate the fast response from this sender and I appreciate taking the time to review and correct my situation. The second arrived in no time with the only issue I would say is batter life. Even if charged for more then a day, i take it off and it lasts twenty minutes or so and then it dies. So unfortunate because I bought this to travel with. But so far thats the only issue. I took it outside and that day the 20min charge was enough so it didnt bother me much that day. Other works great.</span>

<span>This thing completely exceeded my expectations for the price. For $350 it’s amazing, quality and functions seem excellent and the volume is incredibly loud compared to other speakers I’ve had. I can’t speak for the durability yet but the sound is amazing for this price point.<br/>The speaker stand seems like a bit of an after thought, not particularly well made and seems it would be easy to tip over. This takes nothing away from the speaker itself which is excellent</span>

<span>I initially bought ALP-L2200PK for my movie projector sound. It had bluetooth, it was affordable, it promised quite a bit of power. It turned out that for the movies I never had to to go beyond a third of its volume. During the summer I took this speaker to pool parties. Oh my, can it keep the sound flowing. The quality is crisp in both highs and lows. At the pool parties I went as high as 2/3rds, so I still have not heard a full power of this little beast.  There was only one thing missing. A spacial stereo effect that can only be generated by 2 speakers. By the time I realized it, ALP-L2200PK was out of stock on Amazon and at other places the markup made it not affordable. After a bit of searching I found GSP-L2200PK. Which looks like a twin of ALP-L2200PK. Same description. Same features. And a BT-LINK feature that would provide stereo. I could find no information on whether these 2 are compatible or not. I decided I'd make it work if they are not and ordered GSP-L2200PK. They linked up via BT-LINK effortlessly. The sound is very clean. The stereo effect is super immersive. Music became spacious. A tiny side-effect of BT-LINK is a slight lag of the sound from the source. Which is a deal breaker for the movies, because movies now show a dialog a second before you actually hear it. I ended up disconnecting the BT-LINK feature for the movies and paired each speaker to my computer individually. This gave me exactly what I wanted. Perfect immersive stereo movie experience. I am very happy with both of these speakers.</span>

<span> Ok. So its a decent speaker for the money. It gets pretty loud. Sounds good. Weighs less than nothing. Easily portable. BUT. Its advertised as having a subwoofer. It does not have a subwoofer. It has a big speaker, but its not a sub. No more bass than a standard speaker. Subs also have magnets which makes them heavy. This thing definitely does not have a magnet and is definitely not a sub. Battery life leaves a little to be desired. I bought this with the intention of leaving it plugged in. Can't do that. It does not play while on the charger. Which is a charger. Not a "power supply". It takes 8-10 hours to charge and you get 2-3 hours of music. The lights are cool though. Anyway, its ok. Its just not what I was led to believe I was buying.</span>

<span>I ordered this for a party to play background music. It first arrived without the micro USB charger or instructions so I notified Amazon and they resent me a new one in exchange. The new one also did not have the micro USB or instructions and that was the day of the party, so I found a matching charger (pretty standard these days) and charged it up knowing that I could probably figure out how to work it by pressing the 5 labeled rubber buttons (which, by the way, was "detached" from the first speaker I received—but just sticks right back on).<br/><br/>That worked. The sound was great! It had a balanced mix of highs and lows. I had to turn it down because it plays pretty loud (great for dance parties) and we just wanted it for background music. If it weren't for having to return one and getting another without the same missing items, I would give this five stars easily. It has a good heft to it but it's not too large. It can sit on a table in the corner and the sound will fill the backyard (ours is about 3,500 sq ft). The flashing lights (or steady color) is a nice touch at night, if you like that feature. I didn't try the phone answering microphone, so I can't comment on that feature.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend it and would consider buying again for a gift or for another speaker elsewhere in the house. Just cross your fingers if you really want the micro USB and instructions that are supposed to come with it. (Note: I discovered the users manual is available on the product listing as a PDF)</span>

<span>I got this because the sound system in my truck needs a complete overhaul thanks to a digital factory amp..... And I love it! I'm actually gonna end up hard wiring it in. My wife is also demanding one for the house. So you'll be seeing me again real soon. Hahaha!</span>

<span>I have bought 2 of these active speakers.  The first one was just so perfect I loved it so much, I bought it in 2017 and it's 2022 and still going strong, my friend loved it so much I gave it to her and decided to buy a second one.  HUGE disappointment!  Definitely not the same sound.  Zero base whatsoever!  I know how to use it because I had previously owned one so I definitely know it's just the inconsistency in sound.  I wish I could return it! It has made me hate it so much...I wish I could just push a button and make it sound amazing, but this is just a manufacturing problem.  I am sad and will not buy a third one.  No magic button can fix it to sound as amazing as the first one.  Definitely a luck thing.  If you decide to make this purchase, good luck with getting the good quality one!</span>
