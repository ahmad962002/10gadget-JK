I. have used the wireless webcam mode and I hate that I can't adjust the white balance without connecting to my phone first, adjusting it, breaking the connection then reconnecting it to my computer. I change my lighting a lot depending on the shoot.<br/><br/>However, this was a life saver when I was multi streaming an event. I just needed something with decent quality as a constant feed and it worked spectacularly in wireless webcam mode back to my computer.<br/><br/>Understand, this is a decent "webcam" not the best but decent. It is not a replacement if you use DSLR's but for what it was created for which is event streaming or multi cam "set studio" (not changing often it is a great camera especially in use with a couple other MEVO SMART cams.<br/><br/>One note, I would like to see them upgraded to be more computable with other softwares and platforms. If you don't want to use their native app for streaming with them, you are going to have to get creative because they are not friendly to any other software but theirs. Thus I used wireless webcam mode to bypass this short coming.</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>Aside from the flaw (which I will get to), the camera is pretty awesome.  I think the most impressive part of it for me is the battery life. I wish there were a 4K option, but it's a small sacrifice given the price point.  Now, the flaw...<br/><br/>You cannot change the aspect ratio of the camera.  It is always 16:9 which means that streaming on popular platforms like TikTok and Instagram shouldn't be a thing since these apps work best using 9:16 ratio. Now, if you're ok with simply recording versus livestreaming, you can lay the camera over to achieve 9:16.  Then, during the editing process, rotate the image.  Aside from that issue, the Mevo Start is a flawless budget camera.</span>

<span>Update: the video quality is so much better than the original Mevo.  Some helpful hints if you have a large auditorium and you want to zoom in this is not the camera for you.  We stream to FB and YouTube live.  We only have 22 YouTube subscribers for our channel.  So in order to go live on multiple platforms you need another software to do that.  We use Vimeo.  To go live on YouTube you must use the RTMP button on Mevo.  Set up your stream on YouTube Studio and get your URL and streaming key to paste into Mevo.  Great thing is the Mevo will save it and YouTube doesn’t change it for a new stream when you reuse your settings.  Once everything is programmed into the Mevo it gets much easier to go live.  Again the video quality with the Mevo Start is so much better than the Mevo Plus.  We spent about $800 for the original and this was only $399.  You get your monies worth if you can leverage all its features.  Also if you are being asked for constant firmware updates which Mevo are you using and is your app updated.<br/><br/>Our church has been using the first generation Mevo for over three years.  We didn’t realize how outdated our Mevo camera was.  The video streaming began to get worse and we kept losing signal and the audio was terrible.  I went looking for another camera but Mevo still came up in the top.  I looked at the specs of the Mevo Start and realized how outdated our original Mevo was.  Today we streamed our service for the first time using Mevo Start and people complemented our video on how clear it was.  We had no audio issues or dropped internet.  We also didn’t have to plug it in since we stream for about 2 hours.  We always liked Mevo and they have made streaming affordable for our church.  This Mevo Start addressed most of our issues with the first Mevo we had.  Also the price has gone down from what we paid for the original Mevo.  It is worth the price.  It does so much more than just record video.  I love the app also.</span>

<span>This is my first Camcorder, and I absolutely love it. I love to take pictures of birds, but they are too easily spooked before you get the picture taken. So, I purchased this camcorder with a 50X optical zoom lens. Wonderful! I can be 200 yards away, and still get a decent picture, and they don't fly away. I have set the maximal zoom to 90X, and I still get very good pictures! I have taken a lot of footage of Mule Deer, and I can get as close as I want - in most cases.<br/><br/>I took a picture across the mighty Columbia River and on top of a mountain on the other side in the State of Washington, at least a mile or two away, and I showed the object to my wife. It took her a few minutes to find it, but she was amazed that I could take a picture that far away. In other words, she could clearly make out the object that I took a picture of, and find its location. Most camcorders come with a 20X Optical Zoom, but this has a 50X Optical Zoom! It rocks! This is an awesome wildlife camcorder!<br/><br/>I'm still learning to pan smoothly by hand, but I now have a video head that pans perfectly. It almost cost as much as the camera, but it was worth it. Hoping to get into some action video at a zoo, races, or windsurfing. Having fun, and you will too!</span>

<span>This is a great product for what it is designed to do and it seems that many of the negative reviews are by people that didn’t research their purchase properly.  I understand that frustration, but if you know what it can and can’t do before purchasing then you will not be disappointed!  Let me give some of the pros and cons to explain what I mean.  At the end I have a small explanation of what you can expect for picture quality.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>  - Zoom: The zoom is amazing!  I shoot most of my videos on a 1.6x crop frame Canon DSLR and there is no lens in the world that will get you 59x optical zoom.  That is something like 1650mm equivalent which gives you a tight headshot at 200ft.  There are several “Intelligent” or digital zoom options, just disable that from the first day and forget about it.<br/>  - Battery/Charging: The battery lasts forever.  I’ve done long recordings and I really haven’t hit 50% battery.  It is also easy to power off USB (in two different ways: the included barrel plug or micro USB) which means that a cheap battery bank will keep it at 100% power for days.<br/>  - Price: At just under $200 this is $50 cheaper that most of the competition (for example the Vixia HF R800).  Even for the same price I prefer the Panasonic to the Canon, and I’m an avid Canon DSLR fan!<br/>  - Microphone: No, this doesn’t have a broadcast quality microphone.  However, it is noticeably better than the mic on my Canon DSLR, especially in the wind.  I do wish that it accepted an external mic input, and I’ve listed that as a con.  So the quality isn’t great, but since it’s better than a DSLR I have to put it as a pro.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>  - Microphone Input: I really wish this accepted an external mic input as most of it’s competitors do.  I get that most people buying a cheap camcorder aren’t going to use an external mic, but I would!<br/>  - No Carrying Case: Even a simple cloth bag would have been better than nothing, I bought a $10 case that’s a bit too big for it.  I wish I had something better.<br/>  - Menu Interface: This isn’t a strong point for most camcorders, but this one is particularly finicky with the menus.  The low quality touch screen and small icons mean it often takes two tries to hit the right button and the menus are designed someone who has never actually used a camera.<br/>  - Live-Video Output: I haven’t even tried this, it uses a mini-HDMI, which is a stupid standard, but at least they include a mini-HDMI to HDMI cord with the camera.  There are a lot of other reviews that talk about this… I haven’t tried and I don’t care, but others have issues, so consider that if you care.<br/><br/>A note about video quality:<br/>I’ll start by saying that this is about on par with a good smartphone for video quality and maybe underperforms a flagship phone in low light.  In a daylight scene it can be hard to tell the difference between this camcorder footage and a $1,000 DSLR with a good lens!  However, as soon as you go indoors the quality of the camcorder footage deteriorates to a barely usable level.  It says it is F2.08 @ 108mm and while I don’t think they are lying, the quality of the footage would not lead a person to believe that number…<br/><br/>So why would you buy this!?  Why have I given it 5 stars!?<br/>Because a good new DSLR+lens cost 3 or 5 times as much, and this camcorder keeps pace with good lighting conditions.<br/>Because a smartphone is lucky if it can get to 2x zoom without the quality collapsing and this camcorder does 59x and looks great.<br/>Because it is $200 and can get great footage that would be hard to get other ways!<br/><br/>If you want to record indoors/low-light, or need the absolute best in video quality then spend the extra money to get something with a much larger sensor (not really available on any "camcorder").  Otherwise, you’ll love this!</span>

<span>I use this camera to record two to three high school football games a week and do highlights for the team. I love the zoom and the picture quality is fantastic (day or night). The still photos are great when you are in photo mode, but I was disappointed nothing or low quality, small size, out of focus and fuzzy if you take any photos on video mode. I was hoping to be able to get action shots while filming. But I think the photos will be great when I zoom in on far off mountains etc when I get back up to the hills.<br/>I love the fact that you can film in 1080p 60fps MP4 format. This way I don't have to convert MTS files before posting online. But these files are 28Mbps, so they are rather large compared to my old camera. You can record in 720p or 360p I prefer better quality. You can also record in near 4K with MTS files.<br/>10 or 15 years ago you could get a camcorder with a viewfinder and maybe a my hookup and flash in this price range. But not anymore.</span>

<span>The video quality on this camera is great in the day and it's decent in low light. The camera (picture) quality is not good but its it's not the worst by far. Still have to remember it's a camcorder so it's not expected to be the best in picture mode. It's pretty small, at least for my hands, which is good for carrying in pockets but it sometimes would feel strange trying to hold with the strap around my hand. Took me a few hours to realize how to switch from seeing pictures and videos, which I'm sure they explained in the manual that I did not read. The zoom is awesome though and for the most part it's very steady, of course, until you reach past 60x and enter digital zoom. The touch screen could be a lot better and is kind of tricky if you have medium to large hands but it is still manageable. Overall I will give this 4 stars because I got it for my wedding and I know the church has low light and the videos were very nice but not professional so dont think it's going to be crystal clear. But I enjoyed it and watch it often. There is no mount in case anyone is wondering. There is no flash either. I'm only mentioning that for the ones wondering about it. I like this Panasonic camcorder though and is deciding if I want a camera from them, Nikon, or Sony around $500 so if anyone reading this have a suggestion, including Panasonic, which would tell me why I should choose them, let me know what you think. HAVE A NICE DAY</span>

<span>First off, the camera produces beautiful image quality in both 4K and FHD. The compact size and features makes it perfect for on-the-go setups where you need to grab a camera and shoot with little setup time. I think with the increase in online streaming for especially house of worship this camera will fit into many single camera setups. I bought it for the compact size, the SDI output and the hope that the low light capability will work in the environment I shoot most of the time (inside a building with not so great lighting).<br/><br/>I give the camera 4 stars because it is compact and packed with features. It fit the bill for two of my setup needs but the part that did not work so well is the low light capability part... the low light capability is really bad. If you will use in a place where you cannot control lighting and lighting is not ideal then you may end up with dark images or grainy if you increase gain to compensate.<br/><br/>Otherwise if you are shooting in really bright settings like outdoors or a controlled environment where you can control lighting then this will fit in perfectly. Consider what is important to you and your setup and where you need to compromise before buying. Unfortunately I returned and went with Sony PXW-Z90V. For a few dollars more you get amazing low light capability with all the same features.</span>

<span>I'm pretty happy with this camcorder. We bought two of them and they, like most consumer cameras, are a little clunky out of the box. Features like auto light on/off, auto horizon level, and demo mode, can make it finicky to get your shot the way you want it, but a quick few minutes in the menu, got this camera in good working order. It has a great zoom lens with optics that allow the image to be sharp even at the tele end of the lens. I have noticed that the edges of the picture aren't super sharp when the camera is zoomed all the way out wide. For our application this isn't an issue as we'll be using this as a close up camera 99% of the time. This camera cannot record in 4K and output video via HDMI at the same time (HDMI will go out when you start recording), it can output and record to 1080P at the same time, however. The 4K is a little soft, as you would expect with a consumer camcorder, however the footage looks fantastic when scaled down to 1080p. The built in microphone is hands down the best quality I've ever heard from a built in camcorder mic. It sounds as if I'm using an external recorder. I'm also glad it has a built in video light and nightvision, however as I mentioned earlier, the built in light turns on and off constantly in auto mode, so I recommend disabling auto and switching it on/off manually when needed.</span>

<span>Overall, I think this is a great camcorder, great size, easy to use and the video quality has been awesome (thus the 5-stars in the separate categories).  I am definitely not a pro and really just use it for recreation, so please make sure you read other reviews which will give you a better assessment on the video quality.<br/><br/>The main reason I am writing this review is to "give someone a heads up" on a couple of things which is the reason why I only gave it 4-stars.<br/><br/>I mainly use this camcorder to record my daughter's soccer games.  Again, the video quality looks great.  The issue that I am dealing with has to do with my current setup which may or may not apply to you.  I decided to purchase a Hague Camera Support Aerial Mast System that has a "manual pan &amp; tilt head" and extends about 20' in height.  This will help get a better angle &amp; coverage of the soccer field but requires you to use either wireless camcorder which this is or a field monitor with physical remote or LANC jack.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this camcorder doesn't come or have the ability of using a physical remote.  Nor does it have a LANC Jack.  Thus, you have to use the wireless link to your cell phone for you to use it remotely, which is extremely lagging and the delay from the camera to the phone makes this camcorder useless to record sports.<br/><br/>I thought I could use field monitors like the Atomos Ninja and Atomos Shinobi, some of which can cost just as much as the camcorder itself but it still doesn't solve the issue.  That brings up another issue but it sounds like this maybe an issue with most camcorders that shoot 4k.  If you plan on using an external field monitor, this camcorder will not record/output 4k and will only allow you to record/output HD or 1080p.<br/><br/>Last issue....Panasonic hasn't updated the firmware since it's release and that's truly unfortunate.<br/><br/>As I stated, this camcorder is only an issue when I record soccer games using the aerial mast.  It's great for all other things and truly think it's a great value.  However, if I knew about this before; I would have gone with another camcorder that comes with either a physical remote or LANC jack.  I would also make sure this is a product that gets it firmware updated as well.<br/><br/>Hope that helps,<br/><br/>Glenn</span>

<span>This camera generally pretty good but may not be for everyone. The most impressive feature is the quality of the video/picture when playing on your big screen TV at home. Second is its zoom quality.  If you are filming things like kids sports you’ll need a tripod to keep the picture steady. The feel of the camera is kinda like a plastic toy not a high end camera if that matters to you. You’ll want to buy an additional battery because the filming time with multiple pause and recordings is approximately 45 minutes on the battery it comes with.  The worst feature is the touch screen. It’s very frustrating scrolling through your clips.</span>

<span>This is unbelievable. At first, I was a little annoyed that you have to pay so much for a camera that lets you set manual iris/focus/sound etc. But I finally but the bullet and paid 4x as much as a regular fully auto HD cam. I'm so glad I did. I just tested all of the fancy bells and whistles that I was skeptical about. Holy crap, they all work! I got this camera for recording my own concerts. The audio is on par with some of the field recorders out there. The 4k resolution means that I can leave this at a wide angle from across the venue and later in editing, zoom into my bandmates it as if it were a second and third camera. On top off all that, I don;t have to run out into the audience to press record right before the show and then run out after the show. I can control it from my phone (this is what I was sure wouldn't work properly but it did)! The wifi range isn't long enough for a large venue or festival, but you can tap into a wifi router which I already have on stage for our sound gear.<br/><br/>I only got this camera because of it's manual control. Don't try shooting concerts with an automatic camera. The cameras don't understand stage lighting and it will look horrible unless it's a well lit outdoor show (of if the stage lights never change). Plus, they alway automatically focus on the stupid little toys and signs and beach balls that pop up from the audience. Manual settings solve all of that. You can get that with several different Cannon and sony cams for around the same price. But this camera absolutely CRUSHES it with the extra stuff. I am amazed.<br/><br/>Tip: don't bother buying the expensive larger battery. Get a usb backup charger. The kind that you can use to power a phone or tablet. I have a heavy duty one that will outlast any camera battery. If you're using a tripod, you just rig up a place to put it and you're gold.</span>

<span>I needed a secondary camera for my church's live streaming. Last year - I purchased the Vixia HF G21. That has since been discontinued, so this was the most comparable to that, just 4K instead of 1080P.<br/><br/>I have both cameras side by side in the back of the sanctuary. One is a wide shot for worship and this one, the G50, is a tight shot for the teaching/sermon time.<br/><br/>This has enabled us to improve our live streams by making it feel more like they are in the room with us to have a close up.<br/><br/>The only downfall, and I think this is more with any camera in the setup I have, I had to set it to manual focus because if there was any lighting change, it would throw a fit on the auto focus, but its a good 50+ feet away from where I have it zoomed into, so there is a lot of room for change, but I set the manual focus and have no issues with it.</span>

<span>I don't want to completely dis this camera as it does some things very well.  My main issues were two.  The first could be addressed with a simple replacement.  The delete function did not work properly.  When you chose just one file to delete the camera deleted every file on the SD card!  Terrifying.  And no software solution for that.  But I didn't ask for a replacement because the stabilization is not adequate at all.  When you walk with the camera in 4K it jogs left and right greatly.  With 1080 it does that slightly less but still way too much.  And at full telephoto it does not hold still.  Another issue is start-up time.  Most cameras turn on quickly when you open the display.  Not this one.  You have to open, slide a switch and wait maybe five seconds.  You can easily miss the moment.  And why?  So easy to design an instant turn on.  All other aspects of the camera are excellent although it is a bit unwieldly.  The low light performance is stunning with the 1" sensor.  So, in the end, close but no cigar. (my old Sony 760V is far more stabile but it shows artifacts at full zoom that I want to improve on.)</span>

<span> I chose the Canon XA11, because it features the best auto-video-stabilization in the mid-range camcorder game. If you'll be shooting on the move, this is the camera for you.<br/><br/>This Canon XA11 captures incredibly high-definition video in time-lapse (7 speeds), slow-motion (2 speeds) and multiple cinematographic recording options (make captivating content).<br/><br/>You can even take color-rich, wildly detailed still-photos with the Canon XA11. Check out the Blubonnet photo and you'll see how the camera's auto-focus perfectly captures the detail of the flowers at the forefront, then progressively slightly blurs the background to make the model really shine.<br/><br/>If you want to make compelling, interesting video (check out the time-lapse video attached to this review), get this Canon XA11. This is money very well invested.<br/><br/>Additional info I hope you find useful (see photo for what I connect to the camera):<br/>• Comica CVM-VP2 Super-Cardioid Condenser Shotgun Microphone ($189 - great sound)<br/>• Regetek 70" Monopod-Tripod Adjustable Stand ($49 - trust me, don't go cheaper)<br/>• Altura Photo 160 LED Video Light ($36 - definitely get attachable light for this camera)<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: I chose to buy from this seller, because it is the USA version under warranty. Sure, this camera is found cheaper on Amazon or in giant bundles (with awful external mics and so-cheap-its-worthless add-ons); but those are international versions of the camera.</span>

<span>I had done research before purchasing 2 of these. We were looking for a good camera without breaking the budget for our church’s livestream. These cameras set bar REALLY HIGH. Our stream quality has improved 100% with these. The clarity you get even on a tight zoom is mind blowing. The way the color adjust to the lighting is awesome as well. If you are looking for a decent camera without forking out a lot of dough, look no further.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera in September of 2020 from Bestbuy and was very impressed with the quality, workmanship and overall camera performance!<br/><br/>I decided to purchase this exact same camera again to add to my equipment....except this time, I purchased the camera from Amazon!<br/><br/>The camera quality is clearly NOT the same.  Parts of the camera feel like poorly recycled plastic and do not have the smooth finish of the 1st camera I purchased from Bestbuy!<br/><br/>In fact, the camera reminds me of one of those non-operational plastic prototype models!  The camera performance so far has been on par, however I just did not expect the build quality to be so poor and obviously recycled plastic/refurbished product.</span>

<span>I bought this used and the company had a great review so I took a chance! It was well worth it. I used to do TV shows with my students and I have lots of older Hi8 and MiniDV cameras. I miss those camera days and the reviews on this cam on YouTube are great! Checkout MarkusPix reviews of it. He obviously is a camera expert. This cam is so light at first it seems like a toy, but don’t be fooled. It is so light weight it’s great for travel. It has a Carl Zeiss lens and optical zoom 30X. Sure it has the mini micro cards and no sound input but it has great sound and you can buy inexpensive recorders and lavaliers you can carry in your pocket. I bought a Zoom H1n recorder ($70) and a JJC Wired Remote Shooting Grip ($40) so I can hold it steadier. It zooms in and remotely works controls. This cam came out in 2015 and you can still get it new for $228! If you do, buy the insurance. The whole setup is so small you can fit it in your purse or small bag. Even though I use my iPhone on a gimbal I love the 30X zoom and how smooth the zoom is. Plus I’m not eating up my phone’s memory. This is a great addition to a travel kit!</span>

Great for cramming everything on one card. Not super great in low light. Otherwise, excellent imaging. Love the tiny size of this. Light as dust bunny. Nice to have a Zeiss. My general opinion is that for the money, you can't find anything better. I understand some uninspired people lacking the intuitive power, or patience to understand how to operate it.

<span>If you have the money to invest in this webcam, I highly suggest making the purchase. Logitech has a great reputation when it comes to the webcam sector. I have several webcams and this is now my favorite. Hopefully, this review helps with any decision you are trying to make.<br/><br/>This is one of the few webcams that supports 4K Ultra HD 2160p/30fps. I just upgraded to a 4k monitor, so maybe most people are not looking for a 4K webcam.  At full HD 1080p/30 or 60 fps, this webcam also supports HD 720p/30, 60, or 90fps, it is still by far the best webcam I have right now. It is impressive! Even with makeup, you will probably notice a few flaws in your skin. It is that amazing!<br/>It does come with a privacy shutter that you can attach if you want a physical block of the camera. Not only that, but it snaps on easily. There is also a black drawstring travel bag to prevent scratches and dust when not in use or if you need to travel with it. It does not come with a tripod, but it does have a tripod thread mount.<br/><br/>There is a detachable mounting clip. I tested it on an older, bulky laptop. It is wide, and it worked great. I purchased a tripod because I will primarily use this for my desktop. I didn't like the idea of it hanging on my monitor, as it doesn't have a plastic outside edge. My monitor screen runs to the very edge. If you have a similar monitor, I would highly suggest purchasing a tripod. Another consideration that might make you want a tripod, this webcam can’t be tilted up or down or turned left or right, so it’s basically stuck in a fixed position. With the tripod I bought, the top half has a ball with the plate of the screw that attaches to the bottom of the webcam. This setup on the tripod allows me to adjust it to where I need it.<br/><br/>This webcam is compatible with video conferencing platforms like Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, Cisco, Cisco Webex, Cisco Jabber, Microsoft Cortana, Windows Hello, Skype, Google Hangouts, and other VC applications, XSplit, OBS, Twitch, BlueJeans, Zoom, Fuze, GoToMeetings, and Ring Central. I use several of these platforms and compared to my older 920 Logitech webcam, I can see a huge difference in quality. I share videos with colleagues, and they have also noticed a difference. As for the platforms, many have a maximum of 720p or 1080p. You probably won't notice a difference when joining a meeting.<br/><br/>Once you start using the webcam, you will see the autofocus and the auto light correction with high dynamic range (HRD). It tracks movements and quickly makes the right adjustments. There are also three fields of view, so you are not limited to a single default. The three views are 65-degree, 78-degree, and 90-degree. If you are not familiar with what each would offer, the 65-degree view is a close-up view of your face, the 78-degree is more balanced with your face and some of the background, and the 90-degree view shows more of the background with you in the center.<br/><br/>You also have omnidirectional microphones with noise-canceling to reduce background sounds to make the voice clear. It does not take away a cat meowing in the background, but I do notice less noise from my chair if I slightly spin.  I have not had any results where my voice is distorted, echoing, or that hollow sound. I think it helps to have two microphones built into this webcam. I want to mention, that the USB cable with this webcam is of high quality. It also is slightly over 7 feet in length.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Great sound quality, crystal-clear video, autofocus, auto light correction, 3 adjustable fields of view, high dynamic range (HDR), the image quality of the camera is impressive, and offers a good range of resolutions with still image and video capture.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The quality of the construction of accessories isn’t consistent with the camera. It feels like I got cheap accessories. Some might consider the price as a con, but I particularly do not. I feel the price matches the quality of this webcam and the features it does have.<br/><br/>Tech:<br/>Supported resolution: 4K/30fps; 1080p/30 or 60 fps; 720p/30, 60, or 90 fps<br/>Diagonal field of view: 65 degrees, 78 degrees, 90 degrees<br/>Focus type: Autofocus<br/>Lens type: Glass<br/>Built-in mic: Stereo-dual Omnidirectional, with 2 microphones<br/>Dimensions: 1.06 inches high x 4.02 inches wide x 1.06 inches deep<br/>Weight: 2.22 ounces<br/>Cable Length: 7.2 feet</span>

<span>I have had a lot of logitech products over the years; everything from their flagship gaming keyboards to travel mice and webcams. I really like the compact nature of this camera. Looking at the pictures of the camera I would have expected it to be a bit bigger on top of my monitor. One of the best features and the reason that I went with this camera is that the USB-C cable is detachable from the camera and can be replaces with a longer one if necessary. I was not too concerned with the length as I have it plugged into the USB hub on my monitor, but that hub sits behind a trim panel that needs to be removed everytime I need to unplug it when my computer has issues. These issues are not with the camera as my computer seems to have issues with every webcam that I have used, so being able to unplug it and plug it back in at the camera is a huge time savings for me!<br/><br/>The quality is great! I have everything on default settings as I typically just use my webcam a couple days a week for maybe an hour at a time. If I were doing something like streaming or creating content with it I would likely take the time to tune all of the settings that are available with the software mentioned within the instructions. I also do not have any studio lights so my lighting depends on the weather outside and a single lamp that I have off to the side, so auto settings work best for now.<br/><br/>The camera does come with a mount for the top of your monitor as well as a privacy cover for when you are not using it. I personally think it adds some unnecesary bulk to the camera so I have opted not to use it personally. You can also remove the montiro mount and use it with a tri-pod or ring light if you would like. I might look into this option down the road.<br/><br/>The camera also supports Windows Hello which allows you to log into your computer just by looking at the camera. When I am not having issues with my computer this works great! I typically have to log in and unplug the camera and plug it back in for my computer to recognize everything, but once that has happened it is flawless for the remainder of the time I am at the comptuer.<br/><br/>I recomended this camera to family who had previously purchased it and when I finally got fed up with taking the back panel off of my monitor I decided to pick one up for myself. Great camera that I have no problem recmoending 100% to anyone that is looking for a webcam with better quality than their laptop camera or the cheap webcams that are all over the maret these days. I have had logitec webcams for many years and have not been more happy with one of them than I am with the BRIO. If you are on the fence I would say just go ahead and spend the money to get one. You will not be disapointed.</span>

<span>Look for what this costs and all the acessories you get it`s just right for an action camera. The picture quality is not high res but good enough for the casual vidieos. Camera use is easy and functional. More accesories than I can use and should work for anybody in any situation. If you want better buy a Go Pro for 8 times the cost then buy 300 dollars worth of accesories to go with it.............not! I think the people that are complaining about it not being perfect are jerks and are just whinners. Yes some units come not working but it`s from china what do you exspect, return it and get another, has a 2 year warrenty for you pepole that drop and break it. I would throw it away and buy another if this fails out of warrenty. Cheap cheap cheap but works works works.</span>

<span>I was looking for a new underwater camera to use for a recent vacation to Playa del Carmen, and after looking to possibly buy a newer Gopro, I decided to look for another option given the questionable reviews and price of the new ones.  Decided to give this one a try, but was a bit concerned because it was so inexpensive.  Should not have been concerned, since it worked perfectly for me in wet situation, and while I was scuba diving.  Easy to use, and good pictures.  Not perfect on image stabilization (which might be expected as I was trying to dive at the same time), but amazing value for the money.</span>

<span>It really is very good, considering the price. I didn't want to spend $350 for a GoPro (at least not yet). The gizmo comes attached to a plastic base that's glued to the box. Their instructions for getting it off the box didn't work. Neither did the YouTube videos. I eventually used the wrench (included) and unscrewed the mount. Next, you have to download the manual. Dreaded that but the camera is very easy to set up and use (took maybe 2 minutes). It comes with more accessories than I could possibly ever use. The case is very well designed and made. Also included a wrist remote control that lets you take pictures or videos even with a gloved hand. Picture not quite up to GoPro standards but I think would be more than adequate for most people. There are YouTube videos that split screen the difference and there's actually not much difference considering GoPro is 5X the price.</span>

<span>I am completely shocked at the high quality video this thing takes.  it's really 4k. i'd put this up against a real go pro all day long.  I took this on a cruise and used it in the water, under water, and in fast paced adventures (like ziplines and roller coasters). ALL videos came out great.  it's white balance  did get confused for 1-2  seconds when going from underwater to above water  and  you could tell the white wasn't right for a moment (while inside the waterproof housing), but  that is nit picking more than a real issue. i'm very happy with this camera, it is the 2nd one i've bought and i'm happy with both. be careful with the memory cards, that class rating IS important.  Also, it doesn't like  some 128 GB cards, so i'd suggest you stick with 64GB cards.</span>
