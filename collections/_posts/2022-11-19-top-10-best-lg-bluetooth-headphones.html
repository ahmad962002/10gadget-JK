<span>I got these earbuds to use with all the Zooms in my life--work meetings, teaching, book clubs, HOA meetings, everything!<br/><br/>I like classical music, and was using my B&amp;W headphones and a wireless mic.  The B&amp;Ws have great sound, which is why they cost $400, but the whole setup is bulky.  My wife said I looked like a nerd with the mic and 'phones.<br/><br/>I bought the most expensive Samsung earbuds, and they wouldn't stay in, so I went back to looking like a nerd.  I think the biggest problem was that the only other person in the book club who wears 'phones is a real nerd, so this put me right in there with him, in my wife's eyes.<br/><br/>Then I saw these.  I have a lot of respect for LG.  We have an 83" TV from them that's spectacular, as well as a couple of smaller sets.  And my computer is an LG Gram, that's fast as blazes, has a huge screen, and weighs just 3 pounds, so carrying it around won't wear me out when I travel.  When I'm working at home it drives 4 displays without a problem.<br/><br/>The earbuds arrived yesterday.  I charged them, and I'm using them now.  They connected to Bluetooth right away  I put them into my ears--they are smaller than the Samsung earbuds.  Apparently the neck piece allows LG to move some electronics out of the earbuds.  They fit really well and are comfortable.  I also know that even if they do fall out, the cords on them will prevent them from going far.  No problem with losing a small, expensive device.<br/><br/>But the best part is the sound.  I'm listening to violin sonatas right now, and the sound is wonderful.  Is it 100% as good as the B&amp;W 'phones?  No.  But is it good enough for listening to classical music for a few hours while I work?  Yes, it is.  In fact, I have to call the sound very good.  I'm enjoying it.<br/><br/>I think the folks at LG have made yet another great product!</span>

<span>This is my fourth headset (I owned other brands before) and so far, I love it. I am a pretty heavy user of this product but the battery life is long, the noise cancelling is good (unless it is very windy outside), the design is slick. It can connect up to 2 devices (your phone and tablet, for example) and re-connect automatically. I was concerned about the thickness of the retractable earbuds but they've been holding up so far (after 6 months of use). The vibration notification feature is awesome (for calls and text messages) and the incoming text messages read-out loud feature is useful especially when driving but it could be annoying when it is read over the audio that is is progress (I have not figured it out how to snooze it). I will post an update on the device longevity after a year of use.</span>

<span>Bought these to replace a broken, much older model LG retractable earbud set.  The LG Tone NP3 is a great headset for the price.  I use it all day, everyday with my iPad and iPhone.  The battery life is what initially attracted me to this particular model.  While I agree with what others have said in regards to the volume being a little limiting, it’s not that big of a deal and would not deter me from buying a second pair.</span>

<span>I don't like the full time in the ear buds.  I like this hangs on my neck, I don't need a case to store them in to charge.<br/>Average talk time for me is 3 to 4 days.<br/>My one ask for these would be to tell me what the battery level is when I first turn them on.</span>

<span>These were mainly intended to be just for phone conversations, I rarely listen to music with them. The times that I do use them for music, the sound is less than ideal and leaves a lot to be desired. When it comes to phone conversations, the person I'm speaking with is sometimes hard to hear and they often state they can hear everything I'm doing in the background. If you're looking for a headset for just the basic purpose of conversations or if you don't really want good quality sound for music, give these a try, but I can't recommend them for anything more than just to get by. There are far better options out there. I would return them if I could.</span>

<span>I picked these up after watching a review of the FP9s and almost buying those. I went with the FP5 instead because I didn't think the extra price was worth the extra features I didn't need and because I only planned on using these rarely around the house and sometimes when I'm out of the house. After getting them paired up with my iPhone (extremely quick and easy) I was shocked with how good they sounded immediately without any EQing. I installed the TONE app on iOS and changed the EQ settings to Immersive (Natural also sounds great) and I'm just blown away with how well they sound. I immediately paired them with my Android device and Windows PC and started using them as my daily drivers. I regret not getting the FP8 or FP9 headphones because those could only be better than these and were only about $50-$70 more when I was looking.<br/><br/>They pair easily with all devices although I did have an issue with my Android phone where I had to pair and then put both earbuds back in the case to reset them because they kept reconnecting every 2-3 minutes, but after resetting them that issue stopped.<br/><br/>Both the iOS and Android apps work great although updating the firmware on the earbuds with iOS was slow and mostly didn't work. I spent about 30 minutes trying to update the firmware on iOS and after it finally "worked" I thought I was good. After pairing with my Android phone the same firmware update was available so I had the Android app update both earbuds and it took less than 5 minutes. I'll be using Android to update the firmware going forward because of this one issue. I didn't notice any change after the firmware update so if I didn't have an Android device I wouldn't have missed out on anything so I didn't want to knock off a star for that reason.<br/><br/>The comfort level is top notch, but they do not feel very secure with the included tips. I did test them and no matter how much I shook my head or moved around they were not going anywhere, they are definitely secured in place, they just don't feel like it with other earbuds I've used. They really feel like they're just floating in my ears which just adds to the comfort level for me.<br/><br/>I had purchased some Etymotic Research ER3XR IEMs earlier this year for about the same price as the FP5 but the ER3XR were discounted from their $200 MSRP so I was told they were amazing, and they were great, the best pair I've owned in a long time, but the FP5 just sounds way better in terms of music. The ER3XR feel more comfortable and I can use them to monitor my microphone on my PC so I still use them, but the FP5 sound better and the wireless convenience has me using them more frequently than I had expected. I was also gifted a Audeze Mobius headset a while back which retailed for either $399 or $499 and, while it did sound really good for over the ear headphones, it didn't compare to the FP5's sound quality, comfort, and ease of use.<br/><br/>The carrying case is great also, a lot smaller than I expected which was a great relief because I would rather keep it in my pocket than in a backpack. The biggest downside to both the earbuds and the case itself is that it collects lint, dust, and other particles very easily so I find myself cleaning them both every time I go to use them even if I cleaned them all off before I put them away. Not a huge deal, but a bit annoying.<br/><br/>So to sum this review up: I really really like the FP5 earbuds, but I secretly wish I had a reason to upgrade to the FP9 model. After going through at least a dozen Bluetooth headsets, some I really liked but didn't last long, LG made me a fan for life with this product!</span>

<span>Let's start with the negatives:<br/><br/>- Noise cancelation seems mostly passive.  I can tell the slightest pressure, but only the frequency of a breeze through leaves is actually filtered out. The Low "comfort" level seems to do nothing, with the "High" making you think it might be so strong as its uncomfortable.  It actually is barely there on High, and not anywhere near the pressure feel of expensive noise cancellation that actively filters all frequencies. In a room with air conditioner, no filter.  Traffic? No filter. Someone talking, slightly filtered.  They seem to trick you with this false sense of noise cancellation because they default to Ambient. That's because what actually happens when you turn the "ambient" on is that it amplifies sounds, so you might think that's normal.  No, it amplifies sounds louder than if you weren't wearing them. So, when you first turn on Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), it gets really quiet. But then, when you select "Off" you barely notice a change.  It's a slide of hand, because it's really just between what should be called "Amplify the outside" and "Passive". But going from "Off" to "ANC" just filters out this tiny band.  You're not sleeping on an airplane with this.  I could hear the road, engine, and traffic in a car.  I could hear a cat making noises in the other room.  Sure, if I turn up the music loud I can't, but that's not noise cancellation.  Plus, unless you have a perfect seal, you can't even tell, at all.  So, does it cancel anything?  Only if you get a perfect seal and only for a tiny band of sound that honestly doesn't matter.<br/><br/>* I believe I've actually figured out who these are for, and when ANC/Ambient actually matter: When you are listening to music.  Then, you can actually tell the difference between ANC/Off/Ambient.  You can actually hear someone trying to talk to you when you have the music loud, though you will have to turn down a little bit to have a conversation, but you don't necessarily have to stop the music.  Under ANC, the music sounds a bit "cleaner" by taking out that little bit of outside noise, but only if you have a great seal, and usually at the cost of battery.  Honestly, I'd bounce between High and Off, and would tap things around me, make a constant blowing sound with my mouth, and even with a great seal, did absolutely nothing.  But, what does make a difference is Ambient.  So, this is for people who have to hear voices or traffic (cyclists, runners, office).<br/>** Ambient is the point, ANC is not. Turn on Ambient while walking or biking near people, traffic, bus, subway, train for announcements.<br/>** Turn Off if you don't want to hear those people, while shopping, listening to a book, in a phone call, etc. Leave it "Off" when listening to music to save battery. Because I promise you, you will hear every keyboard tap, every cat purr, and every truck going by outside with the ANC on or off.<br/>** When to use ANC? Only use ANC if you have no other option and an air vent or a gentle breeze through the leaves in a quiet park is the only thing you need to cancel. Sad, but, there you go.  Reverse your thinking with these, and 99% of the time, it's Off or Ambient, not ANC or Off.<br/><br/>- The gel tips hurt as the edges press into your ears. Because the noise cancellation does almost nothing that I can hear, I went to my normal large to get a full seal per their instructions (and common sense).  Pulling them out of my ears catches and flips the gels inside out, and are painful and are nowhere near the noise cancellation of my Sony MX4 over-the-ear headphones.  I didn't expect them to be, as I spent hundreds on the MX4s, and these are under $70.  But I was led by reviews from several on Youtube that these were world-class.  If this is world-class for in-ear, then I think I'm done with in-ear noise cancellation, because it was a complete waste of money here. And I use large all the time.  All my Pixel Buds and Jabra were large.  Unlike those, this is a stem design, and it hurts. With the large, and even after switching back to the medium, the gel tips somehow grab my ears, and flip inside out, digging into my ears, and pulling out with the gels completely inside out.<br/><br/>- Light.  Not light as in "how did they make these quality earbuds so light" but as in "they feel like cheap plastic toys out of a quarter machine."<br/><br/>- The LG App is absolute hot garbage.  In the Apple App Store, it has 1.4 stars, and for good reason. After playing with it for about an hour, it locked up, and never started again.  Can't change settings, can't change EQ, just absolute junk as you'll see from every Apple App Store review.  Mine just sits on the logo screen until I take out my earbuds, put them in the case, close the case, wait, then open the case, then open the app, and it starts working again. And the update even on a FIOS connection for a firmware is pretty slow. Not sure if this is the download or upload, but never seen earbuds or headphones take quite this long, almost 20 minutes.<br/><br/>- Weak magnets on the case lid.  The earbuds stick inside fairly strong, but if you compare this lid to say a lid from Pixel Buds, this lid is maybe 30% of that strength.<br/><br/>- Arrived with no charge in earbuds or case.  I've never had that happen before.  I had to find an old USB-A adapter to plug them in as I didn't have my own USB-C charger on me, and they only provide an A to C and NO brick.<br/><br/>- Works on iOS, but doesn't allow for Mic modes. The voice is clear, and whisper mode is interesting if you really need it, but my voice in recordings, in calls, in Teams, and in Zoom sounds decent but with no lows. You get mids and highs, and you sound like you are a bit too far away from the mic, as though the mic were on your desk, and you pushed your chair back a foot too far away from it.  Not the worst, but not at the level of a boom mic single ear Plantronics either.<br/><br/>Ok, the positives:<br/><br/>- The sound quality is better than most earbuds not only at this price but at triple this price. And not just better, it's excellent! These earbuds have a nice full range, full and punchy lows, solid mids, and lightly muted (but acceptable) highs (and I set an EQ to soften them more). The EQ is customizable and has great selections to start with (when the app works).  I do like the Immersive and 3D Sound Stage and usually leave it on 3D Sound Stage (as this also helps compensate for relatively no noise cancellation). However, this makes audiobooks and podcasts sound like they're in a barrel or in front of a reverb plate. Good for rock, bad for voice, but easy change (when app works).<br/><br/>- It charges really fast for not being a fast charge device. The case and the buds arrived dead (above), but they charged very fast and I was ready to go with enough charge in the case and earbuds after 10 minutes to use them for quite a while. I don't know about battery life, this is my first 4 hours with them.<br/><br/>- It's a great price if you just want good/acceptable voice quality sometimes and to mostly listen. Honestly, if you just use them to listen. This price range usually offers only basic connectivity, and this does go above the minimum by quite a lot.  The low rating is due to Noise Cancellation, the one thing I really wanted in these as I only use ANC in headphones, but don't want to walk around with headphones on when out and about.<br/><br/>- The touch works as expected and is minimally customizable, making these like the Pixel Bud A's, mostly.  And, like those, you can't slide to volume up or down, but by default have to tap on the left and right ears, which is not very useful, since the small volume increments will have you tapping on your ears like a drummer to get significant volume change.  I recommend changing these to something like, 1 tap on left, voice assistant.  1 tap on right, play/pause. 2 taps on either for next. 3 taps on either for previous.  For some odd reason, they put volume on 2 taps on both, and next track on 3 taps on both.  If you are like every other human on earth, you will skip tracks far more than change volume (or change to previous track as I recommend), so make that two taps.  Luckily, they do make this customizable, which is surprising at this price point.<br/>** One small negative on touch.  Every technology in the world does long press for voice assistant (think power buttons on  Android or iPhone), but in these, long press is hardwired to only turn from ANC to Ambient, and back again.  As I said, I think Ambient might be useful, but not ANC.  I'd like to long press one side for assistant, long press the other side to switch between Off and Ambient (and not ANC), but they don't offer this at all.  I'm used to the Sony MX4 where either I can start talking and it switches to ambient, or I hold my right hand up to my ear to temporarily allow ambient. I will say, I wish my MX4 headphones had louder ambient like these, but the ANC on those is infinitely more impressive.<br/><br/>Additional Notes: If you find a silicon case for this, beware of claims of "waterproof".  The recommended case cover claims that it is waterproof, and is absolutely not.  So, check out all extras you look for with these and read the reviews carefully.<br/><br/>Summary: I thought $70 was too good to be true for what YouTubers were calling best in class Active Noise Cancelation, audio quality, great battery, Ambient Voice mode, don't fall out, and comfort.  I was right, it was too good to be true.  Active Noise Cancelation was barely noticeable, they aren't comfortable if you use gels tips large enough to actually seal. However, they are reasonably priced if you want clean Audio Quality, quick charge, what seems great battery, a niche usable Ambient mode, don't fall out under intense shaking, and comfort if you go with a smaller gel tip that doesn't exactly seal.<br/><br/>Honestly, that's worth $70. Adding in the UV light and audio cable for the FP9 now seems very overpriced, and the wireless charger for the FP8 might be a more usable feature considering you don't get a brick or a full USB-C to USB-C cable anyways.  Still, $70 for the features that work well along with my own USB-C cable, is a good buy.<br/><br/>When to pass? When you actually need active noise cancellation. These are not the earbuds you're looking for. And, as I bought these for exactly that reason, already owning 2 pairs of Pixel Buds, Pixel Bud As, and a pair of Jabra sports, for me, it was a complete waste of money to get mostly what I already had, and had already paid more for.  If I didn't have any? I might consider these again, especially on a budget, possibly if they had some kind of foam or alternative gel tip. Whatever they included is just painful  The next comparable quality in those other brands is around the $150 price range. On the other hand, the cheapest skull candy never hurt my ears like this regardless of tip size</span>

<span>So I am writing this while still listening to these (have about 5 hours in them so far) and let me just say I am really impressed. I'm kind of a headphone junkie (not an audiophile, there is a difference). I have the Airpods Pro, Galaxy Buds Pro, Surface Earbuds, Powerbeats Pro, Studio Buds, Sony Linkbuds, had WF-1000xm3 (returned them because the mics were HORRIBLE and I have to have good mics on all my buds because I use them for calling constantly). But for these FP9s the $137 I paid is just incredible and there is so much to like but with a few kind of big issues. Let's break it down:<br/>PROs:<br/>- Comfort: Love the fit!! I use the large eartips and they are just great. Lightweight, low profile, and even the case is just a wonderful feel in the hand. Nice seal in the ear as well.<br/>- ANC: This one shocked me. For $137 the ANC is fantastic. Coming from someone who owns Bose 700s, WH-10000XM5s, XM4s, and Surface Headphones for over-ears, these do a GREAT job of isolation and cancelation for in-ears and in my opinion punch quite a bit above their price class!<br/>- Color: Obviously this is subjective but gold is tough to pull off without looking tacky and honestly if they hadn't done it so well, I would not have bought these, but wanted gold in my collection so here I am.<br/>- Features: the analog dongle for the case and UV sanitation are just so cool. I mean come on, it may be a bit gimmicky but it worked, I love those features and the corded option is actually super useful. This next week I'm gonna try it with TEAMs and see if it makes for a good virtual calling solution ovr BT.<br/>- Audio/Call Quality: This is a mixed bag and gonna be in the Pros and Cons so hang in there. 95% of the audio is great. Mids, highs, clarity are great. Trade blows with good headphones! There are better but there are also MUCH MUCH wworse.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Updating: Let me get the star killer out of the way first!!! This is the thing that MADE me HAVE to give 4 stars when literally EVERYTHING else deserves 5. UPDATES ARE ATROCIOUS!!!!!!!! Out of the box mine needed an update. It took 9 TRIES TO COMPLETE. It kept failing! In my ears, on the table, in the case, close to the phone, on top of the phone, app on top, app minimized, ANC on/off. I even left my house since it has a TON of wireless interference with my wifi and all my smart devices. Still failed. SO WHAT DID IT!!!? The last thing I could think of, I had to disconnect my Galaxy Watch 4 from my S22 Ultra's Bluetooth. Then it passed first time.... Come on LG, seriously this kind of buggy crap is ridiculous in 2022! I started thinking "I knew it, I shouldn't have given LG a chance!" But lucky for you LG I wanted to like these SOO bad due to the innovative features, I fought through it. At one point I even had to reset the headphones to factory because one earbud was completely unresponsive and couldn't be found by the case. This lost the star which hurts but for anyone else experiencing this they would have  probably done worse. Very disappointing but let's move on.<br/>- No "Speak to Talk": This 2nd one is another big one for me! Having been daily driving the Galaxy Buds Pro and WH-1000XM5 lately (got XM5s launch day and spent 6-10 hours in them daily since) I was disappointed to see these don't have a "speak to talk" mode. What I mean is you can't start talking and have "Transparency" mode kick in automagically, you have to toggle it with touch gesture or in app. This was a feature I just assumed these had given how innovative they are, and one I use/rely on daily. It's nice to have ANC on, then walk up to someone and speak, it flip to Transparency, then 10 seconds later auto enable ANC again. But nope. Sad Day.<br/>- Sound: Here is the CON counterpart to sound. Even with "Bass Boost" these don't have fantastic bass, it can sound a smidge "tinny". I know these are small earbuds but my Galaxy Buds Pro blow these away on base so I was a tad underwhelmed and I'm not a bass heavy guy.<br/>- Ear Tips: lastly (and this is gonna be nit picky so skip if you just want the conclusion) the eartips are sticky which make for a great seal, but the problem is they are so thin they turn inside out every time I take them out of my ears and I have to correct them before they go back in the case. Just a little thicker at the fold point and problem solved. Not big, just an annoyance.<br/><br/>That's it folks. I love these earbuds! So portable, light, affordable, and just full of innovation and surprises. I think LG is on their way to some great earbuds if they keep improving.<br/><br/>Quick Tip: Another suggestion LG is please make your EQ levels viewable and an option to edit 1 part and save as a "Custom" EQ. Sony has this and I use the crap out of it.<br/><br/>Back to the conclusion, if you are looking for a great pair of unique headphones from a company I never expected to get it right, buy these. They far exceeded my expectations (and yet nailed others with that poor update issue). I would not spend $200 for these. At that prive get the Galaxy Buds Pro as those are my favs all around up until now (Can be had for $149 if you are patient); but if you can still get these for $137, snag them!! They are a great "Bang for Buck" earbud. Happy listening.</span>

<span>These are great headphones, however they could be better. The LG app for iPhone does not work and will not recognize these so that's a big minus for me, I've noticed some feedback in the right ear bud after a few days of usage. over all the battery life and quality are perfect however i can go a full day's worth of taking work calls with out having to charge them and they are very comfortable as well.</span>

However, I tried several times to download only to see a popup that said no network connection.  I called Apple support.  Since they do not support LG products, they were not able to help.  I then called LG customer service, only to be told it is for Android phones, that I cannot use it on iPhone.  A big disappointment.  So if you have Apple devices, look for another brand.</span>

<span>TL;dr - if they were $50-$75 cheaper, they'd give Jabra 65t or 75t a run for their money.<br/>But at their price point, Sony is better on pure sound, and AirPods Pro are better, more comfortable, and more advanced in-ear headphones.<br/><br/>First, the good.<br/>1. Sound (inbound) of calls is great - better than AirPods.<br/>2. Music is generally clear with decent range. It got louder when I shoved them in my ears, but this results in touch control tug-o-war.<br/>2. Connection is as quick and seamless to phone(s) - Android and iPhone - as AirPods (when it works).<br/>3. The single, double, triple-click and cupping ears (ANC/ambient) is a novel idea. For volume, I set right single to decrease, and double-tap to increase. That worked well.<br/>4. They're lightweight - feel lighter than AirPods. But I can still FEEL them, unlike AirPods Pro.<br/>5. Firmware updates are fast - maybe take 5-10 minutes total. Much better than Sony (horrible) and Bose (okay), but worse than Apple (almost instant and seamless/behind-the-scenes).<br/><br/>Now the bad (starting with worst) - ongoing first, one-time issues below.<br/>1. There is ZERO noise cancellation on (outbound) microphones. A business colleague was nearly in pain and I had to disconnect in a very moderate (not loud) restaurant. Unacceptable.<br/>2. It oftentimes disconnects or refuses to connect at inconvenient times. When I answer a phone call from the phone, the headphones NEVER are connected. I have to answer from the headphones.<br/>3. The touch controls are annoying, and overly sensitive. I like flipping from ambient &gt; ANC by cupping my ears, but that's about it.<br/>4. I can't get the maximum sound value out of these (not unlike Sony WF-1000XM3). They're uncomfortable in my ears - I've tried both small and medium tips, and both (simultaneously - one in each ear) hurt. And moving around to get a better fit flips between ambient/ANC (like cupping ears). Or it presses another arbitrary function button.<br/>5. The EQ settings are redundant. Over the past few years, I've moved away from EQ settings and let the phone or music dictate. Same can be said here.<br/>6. The much-hyped UV case is flimsy/cheaply made and small (that can be good, but also means small battery).<br/><br/>One-time or niggles/nuisances<br/>1. The app setup is broken, as others have reported (see: iTunes App Store reviews of ~1.3-1.5). If you first pair via (standard) Bluetooth (obvious) and then change the name, you can't use the app. Dumb.<br/>2. Like other Android-first headsets, it has TWO Bluetooth connections - the main and -LE version. Both show up, and both are active, which is annoying - and both consume Bluetooth "slots". It shouldn't need this after initial pairing - or ever.<br/>3. I honestly CANNOT tell the ANC is working. It's either (a) very mild, or (b) doesn't work. Outside, walking around, I hear EVERYTHING. I thought AirPods Pro were weak - these take the cake.<br/>4. The LG App is kind of crap. Screen dims and brightens for a whole host of reasons. Changing settings. Scrolling up/down (!!). Hiding the manual - and why this is the first "option" clogging up 60% of my iPhone 12 Pro Max screen is unnecessary.</span>

<span>The pairing process was easy and seamless. I opened the case and the phone offered a pair within about 5 seconds. Then, it checked for updates and asked if I'd like to update. It didn't take too long (about 2 minutes) to update the earbuds, 1 by 1.<br/><br/>Out of the box, the battery level for the case was at 81% and the earbuds were at 95%. The case quickly went to 100% in about 1-2 minutes after being plugged in. The earbuds went to 100% about 10 minutes after being plugged in.<br/><br/>Default EQ mode was bass boost and anc/ambience modes off.<br/><br/>These have a feature I didn't know about which reads notifications. The buds seem to have good customization in the app.<br/><br/>The case seems to be of very high quality and it's slim and small. Nicely crafted and minimalistic.<br/><br/>ANC seems superior to the Sony WF-SP800N I recently tried. It produces less noise and cancels better. Since owning an update to the software has applied which changes the amount of noise reduction. Even in a noisy "Chucky-Cheese-like" restaurant it didn't seem to make a real difference. I'm not sure under which scenario I can really notice the difference. I ended up leaving it on high during the time I spent there (waiting for car to get detailed) just in-case and to see how well the battery lasted.<br/><br/>The bass boost profile isn't anything like Sony's but of course it's more natural and sounds great. It makes sense because bassier songs have more bass. It doesn't seem to bother the mids and highs. Natural sounds the same as bass boost, but without the bass boost. Great job on the bass boost, in that case. Immersive widens the sound stage and pronounces mids a bit. Treble boost does what it says and I find it a bit sharp.<br/><br/>I'd say bass boost and natural sound the best. Overall I've ended up settling on bass boost.<br/><br/>One downside is the EQ must be adjusted in entirety then saved before it takes effect. First, though, you have to switch to custom and let it automatically apply flat EQ. When I click custom, having it at flat is expected but it should immediately go to the EQ to let me adjust it how I'd like. I shouldn't have to save it to test my changes. It should change on-the-fly.<br/><br/>It's a bit annoying since it's an 8-band rather than a 3-band. It's a lot of things to adjust if you want to manually adjust it, considering the amount of back and fourth you must experience to test different settings.<br/><br/>The EQ also lacks anything to modify things like sound stage, unlike the custom presets. I don't think I will ever really want to use the EQ since it's so complicated to adjust and bass boost sounds so good anyways. But it's a feature so it has to be criticized if necessary.<br/><br/>Default 2 tap on an ear bud says it's "volume control" but it just pauses the song. Not sure what's going on with that. The other controls functioned as described in the app.<br/><br/>Pause and resume for  removal from the ear and re-insertion is adequately quick.<br/><br/>Range is better on the Sony earbuds. I only got to the kitchen doorway before they cut out. The Sony's I had mentioned got all the way to the fridge. That's another 6+ feet and it's technically closer (straight-line distance) but probably more obstructed by things like cabinets and the fridge. While cleaning my car in my driveway, if I leave the phone in the garage the ear buds cut out when I go behind the car. I wish these had more range. I really bought them for gym use but I've ended up using them more for cleaning my car or listening to music in bed when it's late.<br/><br/>These don't work on bluetooth with my laptop. At first, it had audio in both sides and it randomly switched to not playing audio.  It causes massive lag when navigating playback and recording device menus. Can only get sound in the left side after it went off. Eventually I couldn't get sound at all. Basically, this means it doesn't work with Windows. Never even got to test the mic on PC because of this.<br/><br/>I did test the mic recording audio on the S21 Ultra, and it wasn't great. It sounds very shallow, like it's on an old phone or something.<br/><br/>Had a random issue as well where a call went to the left only. Repaired earbuds and put the right side in and it had a buzzing noise.  Repaired again and it started working again.<br/><br/>When using 1 earbud you only get the audio from that channel. It doesn't downmix to mono.<br/><br/>The text read-outs I mentioned earlier weren't working, initially. Once they started to work I noticed it didn't read them out very loudly so I could barely make out the words during music which was at 50% volume.<br/><br/>After a week of not using them and leaving them in their charging case, I took them out and they were only 79% charged. After 1 hour 15 minutes of use (high volume) they went down to 62% with ANC on (prior to having the two modes of ANC).<br/><br/>Regarding the charge level when I hadn't used them I think it was the USB cable I was using. I swapped it for the one that came with it and the problem seems to have gone away.<br/><br/>One annoying thing that occurred is that when I have them on the counter in the kitchen they randomly start connecting to the phone. This is VERY ANNOYING when I INTENTIONALLY disconnected it.<br/><br/>I lost connection in the left ear while washing the car once. When it resumed it wasn't sending audio synchronized in each channel. Pausing and playing didn't resolve the issue.<br/><br/>They lose seal while washing car with stock tips. The larger tips seem better but I'm not too sure. It seems like they are too large as well. I wish there were something in between stock and large.</span>

<span>Firstly I just have to say that I'm kind of a DIY person. If it doesn't fit me to a T, I'll generally try to find a work around instead of DEMANDING that the earbuds somehow fit everyone including me. Sometimes it just doesn't and I get that.<br/><br/>Regarding the sound, the system is great, there's a decent amount of customization depending on the type of music or podcasts you're listening to, but not too much to overwhelm you. I found a profile that works and stuck to it<br/><br/>The noise cancelling works well but just like many other earbuds in constant and intense noise, it will sound like the system's cancellation strength ebbs and flows in waves. Again, not a problem if you're in a mildly chatty coffee shop.<br/><br/>This next part is what causes hesitation. About 4 months in I was fumbling around with my earbuds to get them quickly in my ears at a stoplight when driving. I dropped the left one on the carpet, and when I picked it up I could hear a loud, high pitched sound coming from the earbud as if there was some sort of feedback loop happening. Since then the Earbud has stopped working. Honestly, I've had stuff like this happen before and it wouldn't be much of a problem, but the sound cancelling doesn't work in the right earbud now. It doesn't matter if I wear the left one or block my ears. This really great sound system is essentially shot after losing the left earbud's sound.<br/><br/>So I'm caught in a loop here. Do I go with another company that maybe makes their products able to last longer? Or go with one of those cheap company's with worse sound, noise cancelling, but lasts longer? Or is this company just one of the bad ones?</span>

<span>I've had these headphones for about 2 years now, and the right ear bud has stopped working over the past few days. Over all, they are great, I use them while laying in bed or at work, and they are great to use while at the gym.</span>

<span>They are light and sound great. They fit good for a while but tend to slide out of my ears after a while, especially if I am sweating while working out or running.

<span>These headphones were awesome when they worked. Unfortunately one year later they kind of broke. They become loose with use and still worked but only if you pinch the tops back on and hold them tightly. I tried supergluing them and that worked for a while, but they came loose again.<br/><br/>I'm hoping it's simply a design flaw and the manufacturer is aware of it.</span>
