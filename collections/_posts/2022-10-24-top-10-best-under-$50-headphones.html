<span>These headphones are smaller than you expect them to be. However, they are adjustable and do expand in size.  I’m a adult man with a roughly 7 3/8 hat size. These fit my head, though I do worry one day they’ll snap in half as I put them on.  Sound quality?  Eh, it’s not good.  Kind of tinny.  But I bought them to quietly watch a tv show or movie on my laptop, and for the price they have gotten a fair amount of use.  Despite the drawbacks, it’s tough to complain much.</span>

<span>Sound quality is great for audio books, can't beat the price and I like that the cord is only on one side, rather than both sides.  I sleep with headphones on and the kind that have the cord on both sides always get so tangled up, it drives me nuts! Not a problem with these!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they're too tight, like they're made for kids or something, so I always wake up at some point in the night because my ears really hurt from the pressure.  So for that reason alone, these are just my backups for whenever my dog gets ahold of the other, more comfortable brand I regularly use. (another reason I like the price of these, I will inevitably forget to put them away one day and my dog will be sure to bring them to me to put away... in the trash can, after he ruins them!)</span>

<span>However don't expect a 10 dollar pair of headphones to be at $100 performance. These are currently selling for around 10 dollars on amazon. It may go up or come down slightly after I made this review but either way at $9.99 plus tax it's very hard to be overly critical on these headphones. I've seen recent youtube video of some guy criticizing them and I don't know why. They are literally dirt cheap headphones and you get what you pay for. I went with the white model just because black headphones seem so common these days and the wires on these feel very cheap so you are going to want to try to take care of them as best as you can. Try not tangling them up and try not stressing the cable out because over time this may cause the headphones to go bad but again these are 10 dollar headphones so hard to complain. The sound quality is pretty good. I wouldn't call it great but we're not spending hundreds of dollars on headphones. These are only 10 dollars currently and even at 15 dollars I would say these aren't bad. I do think that the headphones feel more like they're designed for children with smaller heads and smaller ears but even then I don't think it's bad even for Adults to get these for themselves. I am currently typing this review with my headphones on and while laying on my pillow they do slide a little. That's just a minor complaint. I will not give dirt cheap good sounding headphones less than 5 stars mainly because I don't want to be harsh on something that doesn't cost a lot of money. If you want something better then be prepared to spend more money. Sony makes pretty good products so this is a trustworthy brand and even if they end up eventually dying which has happened to me with even more expensive headphones then it's not expensive to replace or buy from some other company. When I was a kid I had an expensive Boise Headphones my dad bought me and they died on me and we never had them replaced. I remember the sound on those sounding pretty great but they apparently weren't durable at all. This was probably a decade ago. Don't know if Boise has improved on their headphones or not but because of the bad experience I stray away from more expensive headphones.</span>

<span>If you've ever had to walk in a single file line with your class to your local computer lab in elementary/middle school then you already have an idea as to what these headphones' sound quality is like. They are comparable to the cheap headphones every school bought for the students.<br/><br/>If you need a quick pair of headphones for some odd reason then these are perfect, but if you're going to use these for gaming/discord calls it is NOT worth using. (They work fine, but there are better headphones out there for such things)<br/><br/>Very good if your old pair of headphones broke and you need a cheap pair to hold you over until you can afford a new pair. I would NOT suggest these long term and you should go for a better quality headphones that has better sound quality.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect pair of headphones but gets the job done. In these rare circumstances like what I'm going through, these are a lifesaver.</span>

<span>I like the fact that this Sony ZX series wired over ear headphone is comfortable on my head and over my ears. These Sony ZX Headphone are not totally outside noise canceling, which I prefer.  I have hearing issues, especially when my husband has his new big TV sound louder than my TV in the next room.  When he is watching sports on his TV he gets emotionally involved with the game and loudly commenting on how they are playing that sport, as if they can hear him.  I can hear through the headphone, when he shouts but it is very faint and does not bother me at all.  Depending on my concentration while wearing the Sony ZX headphones I noticed that I can't hear the doorbell or someone knocking on my front door and sometimes I can not even hear the phone ring.  I also, noticed that the sound quality is very good for this Sony ZX Headphone that do not have a control for volume on the set itself.  This Sony ZX series headphone is not wireless, which I am finding out that the newer TV's do not have a connecting plug to connect to a wired headphone.  Do not forget to get a connecting wire or cable from the back of your TV to were you sit to view your TV, unless you are less than 3 ft from you TV, in which case you will probably not need to be buy any headsets to hear your TV.  I have a connecting cable (20 feet plus) from the back of my TV plug to my sitting area, which is approximately 10 to 12 feet away from my TV.  I have been using this Sony ZX Series Headphones for over 20 years and I am very satisfied with the performance and quality of this product. Hope this helps!</span>

<span>I bought this headphone with mic used at 50% off for only one reason - to find out if amirm's proclamation, in the Audio Science Review, that this headphone transforms itself from ugly duckling to audiophile-grade hi-fi wonder with just a bit of EQ?<br/><br/>Paint me surprised, but I have to admit - a qualified, YES!<br/><br/>The BIG qualifiers here are that you should pair the headphone with a good dac and headphone amp combined with a parametric eq system to realize this transformation at moderate listening volumes. This means using Windows with the free Equalizer APO installed (no free equivalent for Mac), a decent USB dac/headphone amp combo like the Hidizs S9 PRO (or the more expensive Cayin RU6 for a more organic/analog R2R sound), and the EQ config below. The total comes under USD 150/275 (given above dac/amp choices) not counting a windows laptop/source. I tried this with both the built in sound card in the PC (Realtek) and a Creative Sound Blaster Play! 4 and the transformation wasn't sufficiently hi-fi enough for my tastes, but you can still give it a shot as a first step and decide if you want to step up the dac/amp.<br/><br/>My "reference" headphone system is a Denafrips Ares II DAC (USD 850 retail) paired with a xDuoo TA-26 headphone amp (USD 320 retail) and Beyerdynamic DT 880 600 Ohm headphones (USD 200 retail), something together that I was able to get for roughly USD 1,200, though the Ares II DAC is primarily servicing my hi-fi speaker system and so is not something I would spent that much on just for headphones. Even that requires EQ (most headphones do since it is challenging for a single driver to do the entire frequency range perfectly). This reference system does have a touch more "magic" going on for it, but all things considered, costs significantly more and not portable. So what do you get for all that extra money? Better soundstage and imaging, better headroom, real or imaginary magic to the sound, far better durability and out-of-the-box experience without eq., and more bragging rights. The Sony has one configuration that gives you a peek into hi-fi quality; deviate from that and the "budgetness" shows.<br/><br/>To test this headphone, I used the Denafrip Ares II dac with xDuoo MT-602 for a headphone amp since the impedance on this headphone is 33 ohm which the xDuoo TA-26 cannot handle. I also tried this with the Topping L30 instead of the MT-602 and was just as good. Distortion becomes readily apparent at higher listening volumes or with bass heavy tracks. While Amir's EQ recommendations were good, the one I like the most was from Maiky76 and pasted below. Install Equalizer APO on windows, update the config with these EQ values, plug in the headphones through a decent dac/amp, and you will find a very pleasing and full listening experience whether you want to call the sound hi-fi or not.<br/><br/>Preamp: -7.9 dB<br/>Filter 1: ON PK Fc 40 Hz Gain 8 dB Q 0.38<br/>Filter 2: ON PK Fc 157 Hz Gain -3.6 dB Q 1.34<br/>Filter 3: ON PK Fc 1010 Hz Gain 4.7 dB Q 3.4<br/>Filter 4: ON PK Fc 2467 Hz Gain 4.27 dB Q 2.49<br/>Filter 5: ON PK Fc 8818 Hz Gain 5 dB Q 0.48<br/>Filter 6: ON PK Fc 8580 Hz Gain -3 dB Q 6</span>

My ears were ringing when I took it off and even now it still rings from time to time, like when I'm in a conversation with someone or if I'm just walking down the quiet hallways on campus. Please don't buy it. I couldn't return it because I didn't have much free time but the least I can do is let others avoid the same case I have now.<br/>Edit: I’m trying to sleep and my ears still buzz a bit. Since I’m a light sleeper this is starting to tick me off, I think I’ll get it checked out soon.</span>

<span>I am not going to lie, I have had a toxic relationship with these headphones for years. I absolutely love them when they’re working, and I use them every day since I’m a huge fan of audiobooks. I have very small ears and can’t stand the majority of earbud-style headphones, since most fall out. These stay put and have pretty decent sound, even in noisy environments. I’m an old fashioned kind of girl, so I appreciate that they connect to my phone, even if it means I can’t conventionally charge my phone and listen at the same time. The only real problem is that they consistently stop working after a few months of use. But I can’t bring myself to actually find new headphones with a longer shelf life, so I just keep 4 or 5 pairs in rotation around my house. Just can’t seem to quit them. If I could keep them alive for more than a few months, they’d absolutely be 5 stars.</span>

<span>Stereo headphones have come a long way over several decades, and there have been so many advances, it's often hard to keep up with the latest technologies.  In the beginning, there was basically only ONE type, that of being, the completely over the ear, studio-type and others.  As things progressed, "earbuds" of many types began to be offered and an expensive type of these have emerged, with the advent of the I-Pod and various other portable CD and MP3 players.  I've never really liked these, as no matter how much one spends, they still have to snugly and comfortably fit the individual's ears, which is no small task, as all human ears are not created equal.  Fortunately, various forms of the original concept of over-ear, noise-canceling headphones have kept pace with the earbud variety.  Some of these are more completely over the ear than others, some are more or less outside noise-canceling types, and then there are the cheapest non-earbud types, which can vary greatly in concept and overall quality.<br/><br/>For the best experience in private listening, one needs to spend at least $50 these days, if not upwards of $100 or more.  However, these type of stereo headphones are usually very large and are not really suited to portable, on the go listening.  Still, they do not suffer from the earache of buds, and usually produce the best overall, robust sound.  In between most earbud types and most larger "monitor" types, there are so many varieties nowadays, that the general, plug-in stereo-headphones shopper is usually left quite confused when trying to pick out a suitable, high-quality model, at a reasonable price.  For almost all purposes, this is a really good buy, and I give them high marks in just about every headphone category one can think of or desire.  And the asking price is a bargain.<br/><br/>One little caveat however.  The Amazon "product description" and even mentioned in a review or two, state that the cord length is nearly 10 feet.  I think this must be referring to some earlier model or just a mistake, because the cord length of these is only about 6 feet total.  While this does not interfere with my personal use or intentions of use before I even bought a pair, sound unheard, I think this should be pointed out.  The difference between a 10-foot cord length and a 6 foot one is rather substantial.  Therefore, these are in no way suitable for "roaming the room" or dancing "to your heart's content," as the Amazon product description states.  Amazon should correct this product description.  If one desires more than a six-foot cord length however, a cheap extension can always be purchased for a few bucks at Radio Shack and the like.  It's a 6 foot cord though, not 10.<br/><br/>Outside of this however, these are really great headphones for the price, and offer terrific sound and value.  While they are "fold-able" in a way, this only applies somewhat, as they are not completely so, and attempts at making the set truly small for carrying purposes might only break them.  While they are "over-the-ear," they are not entirely of the more expensive, truly "noise-canceling" variety, though they do a fair job at this, again, for the price.  The earphones are padded and the set is nicely adjustable for nearly all head sizes, unless you have the head size of a mouse or Eraserhead.  Extended use is no problem, once you easily adjust them to comfortably fit personally.  That is, wearing these for hours will not cause any real head/ear strains or pains, either during use or afterwards, volume levels and adjustments aside.<br/><br/>These tend to lean heavily towards the bass frequencies and are enhanced to do so, although the mid-range and upper-ranges come through very good as well.  Still, since there is no equalizer function, it helps that whatever source you will be listening to with these, can be adjusted itself.  That is, if you are using these to listen to a CD or MP3 player, it helps that you are able to use an equalizer at the source, since again, the bass response here is emphasized.  I use these mainly for the computer, and my CD/MP3 player on that is fully adjustable as far as regulating highs, mids, and lows, so the extra bass is no problem.  Still, even if one is not able to adjust low and mid and high end frequencies on your player source, the overall sound is excellent on generally all forms of music and sounds, and the stereo separation between left and right is, well, right on.<br/><br/>I have always had a generally good experience with Panasonic products, and that includes higher-end, higher priced headphones from them.  While these are rather cheaply made and fragile, if you take care of them and don't ask them to do what they are clearly not intended to do, you will be pleasantly surprised.  A definite bonus is the small volume control on the cord.  This comes in real handy at times, since not all music is recorded and produced at the same volume level, and this control allows one to raise or lower the volume without touching the source player.  And again, while these headphones are not really suited for any long life with heavy abuse, and might seem too "cheaply" made for some, taking care during use negates any such negatives and I would guess these will last and perform well just about as long as you want them to.<br/><br/>I bought two pair of these, which got me free shipping, and I really can't complain.  They are great for plugging into one's computer, or using with any CD/MP3 player with an equalizer, but generally, they perform well for just about any purpose as far as headphones go.  They also fit nicely and comfortably as a "necklace" during breaks in listening.  One can easily buy much better headphones, but for the price, these offer remarkable sound at an easily affordable price, and I recommend them highly.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have had the Aeropex headphones for just under a month, and what follows is my standalone and comparison views between these and the older Aftershokz Titanium set.<br/><br/>The Aeropex are a bone-conducting headphones set, which is an interesting concept, for headphones to both play music and allow you to follow a conversation around you, virtually with no loss from either sources. Amazon asked me to rate "noise cancellation" as a feature, and honestly, I rate it at a "1" because that's not what these headphones are meant for. They excel at allowing you to enjoy music while not compromising your ability to react to the world around you. If noise cancellation is your thing, Amazon probably has a lot of recommendations on this page to get your fix.<br/><br/>They sit comfortably above your ears and sit directly on the space under your temples, in front of your ears. The Titanium set, sits the same way, but were noticeably heavier. Granted, this is a minor to insignificant distinction in my eyes, I don't find the weight of either to be intrusive in any way, and I have never had a issue with either slipping from their place, or digging in to my ears.<br/><br/>A quick word on the old Titanium set, since I will be using it heavily to contrast features. What ultimately did them in was a crack that formed in the plastic, on the right side, ultimately breaking. They lasted me nearly two years of near-daily service, 6-8 hours a day. So, needless to say, the Aeropex have large shoes to fill. Both fit nearly the same profiles, but the Aeropex are noticeably thinner, and the buttons are in the same place.<br/><br/>One thing that struck me right away upon receiving the new Aeropex was their slimmer profile. They are much more 'stringy' than the titanium. But as I noted above, the ultimate downfall of the Titanium was a crack in a rigid plastic section, something that the Aeropex does not have. The frame is now much more flexible, resistance to said cracking, the old rigid parts are the ones that contain, for lack of a better term, the speakers, and the parts that contain the batteries and electronics. Thus, I believe the Aeropex would not be likely to suffer this same fatal flaw.<br/><br/>The buttons have my opinion a bit mixed. On the old Titanium set the volume buttons were on the right side, behind the charging port, behind your right ear. They are the same way on the Aeropex, but the with the charging port set behind the buttons instead of in front. It made things a little awkward for me as I adapted to the change. The multi-purpose button is still on the left side speaker, but is now much smaller. I have been finding that, due to the smaller, rounder shape of the left speaker, that it is slightly awkward to double-tap the button in order to skip to the next song; I find my finger slipping and ending up only pausing the music instead. If I could redesign it, I'd likely move this button towards the back of the left speaker, where the force I put on it goes more into the bone; or simply making the speaker pods flat on the outside, like the titanium were.<br/><br/>One other minor detail, tangentially related to the buttons, is the pairing mode. Most devices have it set up where you hold the power button for some odd seconds after the device powers up to enable it, as these do too. But I found it slightly more cumbersome, and there's no tone (on the Titanium the voice said "pairing") which leaves visual confirmation as the only way to tell. Sometimes, my bluetooth connection drops out, and the easiest way to repair it is to delete the relationship on the phone, and repair. On the old set, I could turn them off, and listen for the "pairing" when it started up to tell when I could let go of the button; a minor complaint, but worth noting for hands-free resolution.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that the slight vibration that Titanium sometimes had at max volume is no longer an issue here. I won't dawdle on the sound quality of both the headphones, mainly because I'm not that much of an audiophile. But as far as I can tell, it's small improvement with the Aeropex. The Aeropex apparently has different sound profiles you can swap through, but it's not that much of a draw for me. They have noted that the Aeropex are supposed to be louder, but I honestly think they are the slightest bit quieter. When I was buying the headphones, others were having issues with the loud system beeps the headphones make, but honestly I haven't found them obtrusive. If anything, I'd say some things, like the voice cut-in to tell you when the battery is running low, are almost too quiet, and my only indication that they'd happen is that my music will suddenly take a volume dip for a second.<br/><br/>The major issue I've had with the Aeropex, is the battery life.<br/><br/>First, the charge port is different on this model. On the Titanium they were a USB micro; on the new one they are a proprietary contact type. I like this change, because, while it isn't as universal as a USB-c connection every other one of my devices uses, it is an improvement over the last. USB micro, I've found has problems with longevity, becoming worn over time. With the new contact type charger, the only thing that is going to affect charge-ability is going to be dirt over the contacts, which would be easy to clean. I imagine that this type of connection is also much easier to waterproof.<br/><br/>This was a factor I liked about the new Aeropex. While the old Titanium are no strangers to moisture, and will generally handle sweat and light rain, it is nice to know that a prompt afternoon shower will not end the life my Aeropex. This makes all of the electronic devices I use good for use in the rain.<br/><br/>The model I got came with the sport belt, and while I don't have much use for that, I do love the packing I got the Aeropex in, a very professional, sturdy, quality box that reminds me of the kind of case you get for a $1000 smartphone. And unlike so many other companies they INCLUDE 2 CHARGING CABLES. Seriously, I wish Amazon would let me highlight that part. The inclusion of an extra charging cable is such a Quality of Life feature, because it allows me to keep one at home, and toss the other into my bag to grab whenever I'm running out the door; for headphones made for people constantly on the go, this is an amazing thing.<br/><br/>But, the battery life. This is one of the reasons I've waited a month to review, because my work day is highly variable. Right now, for this last month I've been restricted to 4 hour work days, whereas I normally work for 8 or more hours at a time. The old titanium set was rated for 6 hours of continuous playback, which I was happy to see completely exceeded for all but a few days of their life. They were absolute tanks, and only really had problems reliably when I went over 9 hours, and had a long day of listening at max volume.<br/><br/>The Aeropex have had problems keeping up with my 4 hour workday. I can't get them hold that charge for longer. My listening habits haven't changed since I've swapped, but these have a hard time keeping up. I often listen at max volume, or a few bumps below it, especially as my workplace cranks up the fans to keep up with the summer heat. Granted, that's at max volume, but in my workplace I can't even hear them below 50%. Understandably, I know the battery life is supposed to be reduced when use high volumes, but it's worth noting that this set is supposed to be rated for 8 hours, where the old ones were rated for 6, and I blasted music on the old Titaniums too. What worries me, though it is a non-issue in the short-term, is when I go back to working 8+ hour shifts.<br/><br/>I did test them a couple of days ago, after having them on full power for a about 2.5 hours, the headphones were asking to be charged. I turned down the volume, which had seemed to help before, and lasted until about the 3-1/4 mark.<br/><br/>Which, to be frank is disappointing, to the point where they may have an actual manufactured issue, I might suspect.</span>

<span>THE GOOD:<br/>+ Discreet, insofar that no one will be able to truthfully make those "turn the volume down, I can hear your music all the way over here" comments. Get rekt, Mom.<br/>+ Safe. Even when listening to music at full tilt, you can still hear when you're about to be run over by a forklift or assaulted by a vicious kitten, or when your significant other is talking to you.<br/>+ Socially acceptable (or at least moreso than devices that cover/fill your earholes). In my experience thus far, people seem far less put off by this device when exchanging pleasantries or engaging in customer service duties (please refer to your employee handbook regarding this device's compatibility with your supervisor's personality) compared to traditional headphones, earbuds, or AirPods. In some cases, it can even serve as a nice icebreaker.<br/>+ Intimate. It puts music in your bones, man. Can't get much closer than that. Audio is crystal clear and overall of high quality (or at least as high quality as the file itself). It is a delicious experience, for lack of better terms.<br/>+ Stellar battery life. On the first day of use (I did charge them overnight), I wore these non-stop from 0800 to around 1800. There was approximately an hour and half of call time, and the rest of the time was just music. Volume was at roughly 67% throughout the day, and by the time I took them off, the Bluetooth menu on my phone was reporting that my Aeropex were still above 50% battery life remaining. Granted, overall battery life will degrade over time - as it does with all rechargable devices - but this is a phenomenal starting point. Doubly so when considering how lightweight and small this device is.<br/>+ Solid mic quality. Of all the headphones and headsets and earbuds I have owned over the years - and I have owned many - the Aeropex has one of the best built-in mics I have had the pleasure of using in a long while. People can actually understand what it is that I am saying during phone calls and on voicechat platforms like Discord. Maybe my excitement over this is tempered by the fact that I had absolutely no expectations for it, given that the last half a dozen devices I've owned had mics suited only for collecting dust, but still.<br/>+ Thoughtful. Well, AfterShokz, I mean. They provide not one, but TWO of their fancy magnetic charge cables. No brick, but to be fair it's a safe bet that the average person has at least one standard USB receptacle somewhere in their life.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>- Yes, bone-conduction as a means of audio delivery does lose out a bit on the lower frequencies. Bass drops will not be as phat, the double-kickdrum sprees may sound less intense, and certain bassy, sexy voices may not sound quite as buttery. This is the caveat in the "overall of high quality" remark in THE GOOD section, but for me it is a tolerable caveat.<br/>- There is a voice that announces things, like general battery level, connection status, and the "POWER ON" and "POWER OFF" announcements. It is not the worst robovoice I've ever heard, but I would have much preferred a variety of beeps or other, non-vocal status indicators. For volume change or pausing audio, it does play back a simple beep, which I deeply appreciate. Some folks report that this beep is inordinately loud, but that has not been my experience.<br/>- It comes with a silicon pouch... tote... thing... which smells about as good as the milk you found on the floor this morning, which your cat regurgitated either last night or the night before. Cold, sour, slightly rancid; 10/10 do not recommend. Mine also came with a so-called Sport Belt. While it doesn't smell absolutely vile, I have approximately zero uses for it. Not necessarily a bad thing, I suppose, but it is a "waist" of materials. (I'll see myself out.) In all seriousness, go get a hardcase, or use a small cardboard box, or really anything other than the silicon odor abomination it comes with. I recommend a case from Hermitshell, which are tailoired specifically to AfterShokz products.<br/><br/>THE UGLY<br/>× Fit may vary. I was comfortable all day (roughly 10 hours straight, for those of you not paying attention), but my coworker had to attach tiny cushions to the bits just behind the ears on his set because they were, as he put it, "a little clampy."<br/>× Sometimes they would catch on my hood when I'd be looking around, and so were shifted a bit out of place, which was mildly irritating. I've trained myself to adjust the way I look around as a result.<br/>× Amazon keeps bringing up noise cancellation, for whatever reason. Bone-conduction headphones, such as AfterShokz's Aeropex device, are open-ear devices. That is to say, they do not offer noise cancellation. In fact, the lack of noise cancellation is actually a selling point. They do ship with a pair of foam earplugs, which are quite effective in blocking out sound, but I am not about to rate the Aeropex on the noise cancellation properties of foam earplugs. Good grief, Amazon.<br/>× COVID-related mask experience may vary. With the ear straps of the mask in place first, my Aeropex sit nicely over my ears with no issue and no audio interference. With my Aeropex on first and the mask's ear straps on second, I am still comfortable and neither item is at risk of slipping or falling or otherwise vacating their place atop my ears. I exclusively use a cloth mask with a 3D-printed frame (which is basically a cup for your face), so I cannot speak to the experience one might have with, say, an M95 mask, or a rebreather, or an exclusion zone gas mask.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 4.7/5.0<br/>This thing is magic, as far as I'm concerned. Delicious, intimate, beautiful magic. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.</span>

<span>First things first, I hardly EVER write reviews. Way too busy, and I don't typically care enough. Here's a short and sweet summary: if you can fit the extra $160 into this month's budget (maybe no fast food, pizza, or coffee...whatever), don't hesitate - you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Next, here's some helpful info from the included manual:<br/><br/>Wireless range: 10 meters (honestly, I get better range than that...I've used them from downstairs in the opposite corner of my house from my phone)<br/>Continuous play battery life: 8 hours (they must mean streaming to two devices simultaneously and nonstop, or maybe talking on the phone for 8 hours, because I wear and use it all day from 6am until around 9pm and have only charged it at night - it has never died).<br/><br/>...now on to why I love these things. I am a previous owner of the Trekz Titanium. I tried the Trekz Air but didn't buy them. I was waiting for a unit that handled dual Bluetooth devices and was waterproof - Aeropex was what I was waiting for.<br/><br/>Cons: You already know this, bone conduction headphones can't replicate the amazing bass of an expensive pair of earbuds or cans. THAT SAID, when you're under water (these are waterproof) or wearing earplugs these things easily sound at least as good as a "decent" pair of headphones (like $20-40 range...more than adequate unless you are an audiophile). WITHOUT earplugs in, with open ears that are alert to your surroundings, I'd say these are the same quality "ish" of stock Apple iPhone earbuds. Maybe a bit less.<br/><br/>PROs:<br/>1. These have the best battery life of any wireless headphones I've used.<br/>2. I now have a headset that simultaneously connects to my work laptop for Skype meetings and my iPhone for personal stuff. Amazing. No more multiple headsets. Mic is great. Clarity is better than my Plantronics.<br/>3. Sound quality is great. Better than Trekz Titanium, can't speak for Air. The feeling that there is music playing that everyone else hears BUT THEY DONT is pretty amazing. I get to work or exercise to the music that keeps me going, but I don't have to worry about not being alert. No, these don't have great bass (without earplugs in). But as someone who enjoys dubstep, I can at least say I enjoy my music, still. The benefits far outweigh this minor drawback, trust me.<br/>4. Vibration (the tickle common to bone conduction) is dramatically improved, as is sound leakage. People don't hear these things unless they are cranked.<br/>5. Touching on something mentioned in my one and only "Con" - if you want noise cancelling headphones, it would be tough to find a better pair. Since you can wear the highest grade earplugs with these things - THEREBY *ENHANCING* THE SOUND - they effectively replace any other noise cancelling headphones. AMAZING.<br/>6. I love, love, love the charging port. The magnetic charger just snaps into place and works - I now wish every device had a charger like this. BONUS: they give you two in the box, so you have one for home and one for work.<br/>7. Since this is a relatively "new" technology, it's a great conversation starter, and everybody loves it. When you tell them to plug their ears (and suddenly they hear it BETTER) the facial response is like magic.<br/><br/>...so there you have it. I will likely not review another product for like ten or more years. But you, dear reader, I hope this pushes over the edge, if you're on the fence. These things are great. I have worn them all day, every day, since purchase (manufacturer warranty of two years btw) and they are comfortable and so convenient.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!</span>

<span>I work from home and am on the phone a majority of the day for work. I get a lot of ear infections due to seborrheic dermatitis and dry skin in my ears. I wanted a headset I could use that didn't go around or in my ear and found these. They have been a Godsend. Although I have read some reviews that say that the microphone is not great for phone calls. I have had better luck with these then I have with many other in-ear headsets I've used. I've never had a complaint from a caller stating they can't understand what I'm saying and I have a pretty loud Portable Air Conditioner in the room that I work in that keeps it pretty loud in there.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about these and why I gave it 4 starts and not 5 is that when a phone call does come in, it feels like it blows out my eardrum. I wish it would dumb down the sound of the phone call coming in as many in-ear headsets do this. Sometimes after a few rings it will dumb down the sound but not the initial moment a call comes in. To alleviate this I usually keep them off and have my ringer on so I can hear a phone call come in, then put them on and answer the call but it would be nice to be able to wear them constantly for work and not have to take them off and put them on for every call.<br/><br/>Other than that, I also use them for Jogging and they are the most amazing feeling earphones I have worn. They are indeed sweatproof and I can still hear what is going on around me.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend them and would buy them again for myself or family.</span>

<span>I have bought other Skullcandy products before, and I have to say the sound quality of the earphones is no where near the headset sound quality.<br/><br/>I rate the product 4 stars out of 5.<br/><br/>I have used this set of earphones for 2 things:. Audiobook and Spotify.  I dont normally answer calls on this earphones so I cannot atest for the mic quality.<br/><br/>When listeninging to music:<br/>The sound is clear, but it leans more towards the trebles and mids, with very little bass.  Granted this isn't a $30 JBL earphones, I was expecting the quality of headsets I had in the past. Maybe I was just used to Skullcandy's headsets which had very nice bass and makes you feel immersed in the song/sound.  But these are in-ear earphones, which of course would have much smaller components.  So if you're searching for earphones for music, these will the job, but they won't perform the best.  I find I use my JBL Tune wireless earphones more if I intend to listen to music for concentration, but those don't last all day.  This skullcandy earphones comes at a great 2nd.  These being wired means I don't have to listen to the beeps in my ear warning me of low battery, which is great for my eardrums.<br/>Don't be deferred though, just because I like a more bassy sound in all things audio.  Whether that be podcasts, instruments, or cars, for me more bass feels more present.  But these also sound very crisp, clean and clear.  I find songs with piano seems to sound the best, with vocals very present.<br/><br/>For Audiobooks:<br/>These earphones are perfect for audiobooks.  Even when I listen to Midnight Sun's male voice actor for Edward Cullen, the shallow base does not deter you from being IN the story.  The balanced, clear and crisp vocals that comes out of these earphones lets me listen to my audiobooks from the time I clock-in at 8:30 and even after I clock out at 5pm or 8pm for that matter.  They are wired earphones so I never, NEVER have to worry about the earphones running out of juice. Except of course when it's my phone that dies.<br/><br/>Over all, these are a great pair of earphones.  Only reason why I put 4 stars out of 5 is because I have heard better, deeper sound quality from Skullcandy that I just didnt hear on this pair.  But even then, I only paid $14 dollars for this so I probably shouldn't expect so much.<br/><br/>Skullcandy is still my go-to for In-Ear Earphones because their earbuds do not hurt my ears like the gels you get from Samsung earphones.  I prefer the earphones like Apple's which is why I also got the JBL Tunes, but being wireless means I had to constantly take them off, wait until they charge and such.  But Skullcandy's gel are not intrusive in my sensitive ears.  Not to mention these do not fall off like other in-ear earphones either.<br/><br/>Great product altogether for an affordable price!</span>

These earbuds are AMAZING.<br/><br/>If you're a gamer, here is what you'll want to know:<br/><br/>These earbuds have pretty good noise cancelation.<br/>You can hear footsteps very easily, even some of my friends with $50+ headphones cant hear sometimes.<br/>You might have a little trouble hearing enemies above or below you, but once you know where they are, it's hard to lose track.<br/>They are very comfortable and light, sometimes you might even forget that you have them in.</span>

The JVC HAS160 FLATS are stylish, compact headphones with a slim headband and sleek, soft ear pads that rest on the ear.

A 30mm Neodymium driver in each earpiece allows the headphones to deliver clear, crisp sound. And the soft ear pads further enhance sound quality by providing a seal against ambient sound. The JVC HAS160 Flats come in six iPod matching colors: black, silver, red, purple, blue and pink. The headphones come with a four-foot (1.2m) cord and an iPhone -compatible plug. Frequency Response - 12-24,000Hz.

<span>Bought this because Dad needed an over-the-ears headphone set that wouldn't interfere with hearing aids. He likes to walk and listen to music. He says it does the job but is "tinny", which sounds to me like it doesn't replicate the bass and is probably letting in too much outside noise. However I knew when I bought it that it was not a perfect solution, it was a low-cost option. He will probably replace it at some point but he's still using it so it can't be all bad.</span>
