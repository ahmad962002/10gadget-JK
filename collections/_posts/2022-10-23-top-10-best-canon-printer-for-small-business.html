<span>This printer has a few big flaws that might make you want to reconsider it. The reviews were great. Not sure why. I really wish I could return it, and we're looking around for a replacement but not sure if any other all-in-one printer out there is much better.<br/><br/>The scanner/copier has a major flaw - it cuts off the top (or bottom - depends on orientation) of the original. It seems to be a hardware issue. And the text being cut off isn't at the far edge of the page. The printer claims end-to-end, but it looks like the scanner/copier portion has about a 1/2-inch (a little over 1 cm) margin around the edge that it just can't pick up. Or maybe the printer part always cuts it off. There's no real workaround, so we scan with a dedicated scanner and send to the canon printer at reduced size (say, 90%). It's not good when the workaround requires another device, is it?<br/><br/>The printer, though we bought it in the USA, seems to default everything to euro/asian sizes (A4/A5, not letter/legal). That means the printer settings and the driver settings when bringing up dialogs. I think I've reset everything to letter size, but why should I have to do that when US printing is almost always letter/legal size?<br/><br/>Connectivity is unreliable. We have it on our very reliable wifi network, but it still drops off every few days. You try to print one day and it can't find the printer. So you turn the printer off and it usually finds it.  Sometimes the computer needs to be rebooted but usually it's just printer on/off (but restarting the printer takes a long time b/c it cleans the heads and warms up again).<br/><br/>The manual is basically useless and doesn't cover most actual issues you're likely to encounter.<br/><br/>Touch screen is pretty good though a bit hard to get used to and it sometimes reacts strangely to button presses. Menu-based click buttons on our last printer may have required more presses but it was way more reliable.<br/><br/>The print quality is good when it does actually print what you want.<br/><br/>The ink tanks seem like a good deal - I think we're paying less overall for our ink usage.</span>

<span>Good, solid, but not spectacular color inkjet printer. In its defense, we knew we were making a compromise when we selected it. We wanted a great photo printer, but what we really needed was a printer that could print photos well plus handle home office chores, like fax, multiple copies, and multi-document printing, which is what we do 90% of the time. The need for native faxing was the key that eliminated some other choices which would probably have been better if pictures were the number 1 priority. It is very fast with black and white and prints good quality pictures quickly as well. I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers that complained about speed were expecting. It will wake on demand, but if it has been 'sleeping' it does take @ 20 seconds or so to warm up. I really don't think that is a long wait time. I also have it wired directly to the network. I have NOT tried Wi-Fi. However, the Wi-Fi setup looks pretty simple for even a casual user, so as long as you have good signal from your router, I don't see where there would be an issue. All of our PCs, phones, and tablets are able to find it on the network and print from it w/o issue.<br/><br/>Pros: good quality text and color presentation output; very sharp black and white printing; fast; easy scan, fax, and duplex capability; good, but not spectacular, photo printing; great paper capacity and size options.<br/><br/>Cons: Paper trays stick out and are a potential collision hazard if you happen to walk past it. The output 'catcher' has to be manually extended and goes even further than the trays. If you forget to do that, your prints go to the floor. There are a few too many settings to remember on either the touch screen or the setting application. We've had more than one instance where we've gotten an 'paper size in tray doesn't match print setting' errors or had spreadsheets go to the wrong tray and come out on photo paper. I also haven't yet figured out borderless photo printing. Based on the manual, it should be an option in settings, but I have yet to discover why it isn't present. For now, I'll attribute most of the setting issues to a learning curve as we haven't had the printer that long. (Counter point - why is there a learning curve? It's just a printer.) So far these are minor annoyances, not critical flaws.<br/><br/>Overall a great replacement for the MP780 we had to retire after many years of excellent service. If this one lasts half as long, we'll be very happy.</span>

<span>I had an earlier version of this printer and I liked everything about it except the price of ink. But I think that’s true of any good printer. Everything looks like a quality print job. I haven’t called tech support so I can’t really rate that honestly. The only drawback so far is that it goes to sleep and has to be manually turned on before you can send a print job. This may be something that can be adjusted but I haven’t taken the time to look into it. For example, I will try to print from my phone at the other end of the house. My old printer would wake up and print. This printer has to be turned on again before printer from any device. Especially annoying when the computer is already on and has to be turned off so that when it turns back on, it can find the printer. Like I said, this is probably an easy fix, at least I hope so.</span>

<span>I switched from an HP multifunction color laser printer, which was pretty high maintenance. I was initially nervous about this model being an inkjet, but it's been working wonderfully well so far.<br/><br/>First, the inkjet technology these days apparently isn't at all like what I was used to in the late 1990s...and everything comes out crisp, vivid, and smudge-free.  I don't miss my laser printer at all!!!  Second, I have a feeling it might print a second or so slower per page than HP laser, but the setup time is far shorter, so this printer actually gets the job done more quickly.  My HP laser also used to require a few minutes of breaks every 10~20 pages or so, and it was also slow to startup.  This one, by contrast, starts up instantaneously, and it's ready to print in a heartbeat.  There are no annoying long pauses between pages like my HP laser printer, either.<br/><br/>The scanning function works very well, too, compared to HP.  I have had several HP multifunction units, but none was able to scan completely straight using the feeder.  But, with this Canon, everything has been coming out perfectly aligned!!!  This is making my life SO MUCH easier, as I don't need to re-align docs constantly, like I did with my HP.<br/><br/>The only negative is that, after printing about 200 pages, I had to clean the ink head because the letters/images began to come out fuzzy.  Canon support was wonderful, and I learned that this is a normal part of using inkjet printers.  Sure enough, once I cleaned the ink head (black), everything was back to normal.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and I am definitely going to recommend this to my colleagues.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>So I purchased the Canon Maxify MB5120 for a few reasons.<br/>Backstory:<br/>My previous printer from canon, the Canon Pixma MX892 had lasted me about 5 and a half years, and treated me very well, showing how well these printers last. I had to replace it since it stopped working through the USB cable and since I am away at college, I can't connect this printer over the WiFi like I could back at home. As a result, I was in the market for another printer, that wouldn't be too expensive, and had all the capabilities like a Duplex ADF Scanner, print quickly like my old printer, and connect through USB and Ethernet and more. Since I needed a printer desperately, I needed to get it local, and I was too lazy to do some research. I found the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3733, that fit all the things I wanted it to do, and It seemed like a great printer. Then I realized how small the ink cartridges were and how short they would last. I had printed only 50 something pages and black ink was half gone. All of the things I printed were text documents, so I didn't understand what the whole deal was. Looking online for refillable ink cartridge solutions, I came across inkowl.com that sells everything regarding ink refilling, including the cartridges, had ones for the WF-3733. But the problem was that Epson had this proprietary thing, where once an ink cartridge ran out, you couldn't reuse it. So inkowl had a solution to that, and that was replacing the chipset on the cartridges, but those alone costed 40 odd dollars, and that would be each time the cartridge ran out. I didn't want the big expense so I returned that printer and purchased this wonderful beast.<br/><br/>Deciding:<br/>I was torn between the less frequent-to-fill with paper MB2720 and the duplex scanner of the MB5120, and ended up chosing the MB5120. I chose the MB5120 because it truly could replace my old printer, with Faxing Capabilities, and duplex printing, to duplex scanning and Ethernet connectivity. (Duplex means 2-sided. Just wanted to make that clear for those who don't always talk printers with others heh.) I liked that the ink cartridges are much larger than that of the Epson, and they last longer than other starter ink cartridges. To add on, I could get the ink cartridges from inkowl and save a lot of money down the future when it comes towards that. That said, lets talk about the printer.<br/><br/>The Printer itself:<br/>The printer itself is heavy for sure, but It's like a tank. The printer prints out pages very quickly when you're in a rush. (As any normal college student is in a rush.) The starter ink is beefy and will definitely last you a while. I say this, because I share this printer with my friends and with my roommate and we print a lot for a Pharmacy school. So it's very nice to see that we can trust this printer so far. I have had this for about a week or so, and we've printed a lot of pages, erring on the side of 200-300 pages already, and I haven't come across any of the problems people have mentioned previously. This printer feels and seems like an updated Tank. I hope this printer lasts a good while, and I feel like it will do great.<br/><br/>I'll update if anything changes between now and the end of the life of the printer. But I truly love this printer.</span>

<span>way better than HP because with Canon, i opened the box, plugged it in, let it do its initial set up and , and , and ... this is the big part... IT WORKED!!!!  i didn't have to go on their website, get drivers to make it work, be hassled to give my personal info just to use the printer, annoying ads, or coaxing to sign up for other things.<br/><br/>second big part: CANON HAD A HUMAN ANSWER THE PHONE.  Canon's human knows what uuhhmm and kinda sorta means......  HP computers algorithm can't understand most questions. if the  algorithm doesn't understand your question or not one of the pre-programmed choices, it hangs up. so you go back to a 40 minute wait in the  algorithm wait line.<br/><br/>not a really really bad thing but kinda bad ,, if you do get a human with HP, that human is not from America. that person learned British English to use in an America market place... , it sounds cute but not effective. in normal general conversation like is used when ordering things on line, the English used is broken, kinda bad, not conjugated properly. and to humans from America they still understand what you are trying to say because when they are not at work, they speak like this also.<br/><br/>HP human doesn't have a clue when you go off script using your normal American bad social way to communicate.  then the order is screwed up and returned, why ? because they didn't understand what i meant because they don't have similar culture experiences.... this is effective communication 101..<br/><br/>EVERYTHING Canon needed to operate was already programmed into the printer. didn't need to go on line to download drivers or anything else.  what a revolutionary business model and concept. i gave you my money up front in full. you didn't have to ask my bank for other permissions and systems and codes and drivers to get my money.  i don't want to have to get the product i paid full price for up front and then have to add on to the operating system to make it work.<br/><br/>HP, if you need help, i have friends that will program your printers to work out-of-the-box,,, they will do this for you  for free.<br/><br/>the Canon guy knew my concerns, HP computer algorithm can't do that. he answered  my concerns, i felt more confident about the machine and purchase. i then bought a Canon that cost twice as much as the HP with similar features. there is nothing more precious than the warm fuzzy feeling you get when you chat with a human and not a computer algorithm.<br/><br/>HP is like, sending me a device that requires batteries but they didn't include batteries in the box. and now i have to get dressed to drive a half an hour to get 2 batteries that cost $1.00 one dollar... HP, there is an easier way to get all our personal info than to have us click on several pages of your website, and easier ways to tempt us to buy your products. holding customers hostage from using your printer until we log on to your website to download drivers is not the savvy way.<br/><br/>it's like buying a car and now i have to go to the dealership to make the transmission work while being up-sold on car accessories...<br/><br/>with Canon, turn it on, get on with life. thank you....  CANON CORP, you can use this sentence (with Canon, turn it on, get on with life. thank you)  in your next marketing advertising campaign. no charge of property rights from me. you are welcome..</span>

<span>I've had my Canon MAXIFY MB5120 all-in-one inkjet printer for about 5 months as of this writing. I generally like it, although it does have some annoying quirks.<br/><br/>It prints nicely on regular paper and photographic paper. Text, line art and photos are sharp and color reproduction is fine. Photographs are about the same quality as what you'd expect if you ordered prints from Shutterfly, SnapFish or the like. (However, if you print a lot of photos, they will cost less if you order them from Shutterfly, SnapFish or the like instead of printing them with this printer. That's typical of inket printing, though, not something specific to this model.)<br/><br/>Recently, my printer has developed an issue with color reproduction on index card stock and envelopes, but I can't reproduce the problem in routine tests. I haven't spent much time trying to troubleshoot it, because I don't print enough of either of those things for it to matter much to me. I'm guessing I'll have to fix it next time I want to print up a bunch of discount coupons, which is one of the things I do with index card stock, as that's the only time this really matters.<br/><br/>Scanning and copying both work well and are easy to master. The printer is capable of scanning to a number of popular formats, including PDF, JPG and TIFF. It comes with software for OCR scanning as well, but I do very little of that in general, and haven't tried it with this printer. I also do very little faxing, and haven't tried that with this printer, either. The two printers I owned before my Epson printer were Canons, and neither of those were capable of automatically generating fax cover pages. (Most other brands of all-in-one printers generate fax cover pages for you on the fly.) I don't know yet if Canon has solved that problem with this model or not.<br/><br/>Print speed is quite good, although not as fast as my previous printer, an Epson WorkForce WF-3640. I haven't timed it, but I'm going to guess the Canon MAXIFY MB5120 can churn out 15-20 single-sided pages per minute. Turn on the automatic double-sided (duplex) printing, though, and speed drops to maybe 10-15 pages per minute. This is typical for an inkjet printer, which has to pause for about 5 second per page to let the ink on the first side of the page dry, then roll the page back in and flip it over to print on the other side.<br/><br/>It's strictly middle-of-the-pack when it comes to scanning and copying speed. My guess is it scans about 10 pages per minute using the automatic document feeder. (Again, I was spoiled by my Epson WF-3640, which was a significantly faster scanner.) It does duplex scanning and copying (and faxing) as well; these slow down those features because the printer only has one optical pickup, and thus has to flip the pages over to scan the other side. It does most of the big copier tricks, such as copying two-sided documents to single-sided, reducing/enlarging, and copying multi-page documents so that 2 or 4 pages are printed on each side of the output paper.<br/><br/>The Canon MAXIFY MB5120 covers most, but not all, of the remote printing bases. If you set it up as a network printer, it does Google Cloud Print and AirPrint, and a Canon app from the Play Store enables Android phones and tablets to print to it. However, there is no email-to-print function, like Epson and HP offer on their printers.<br/><br/>Ink costs are lower than is typical for HP, but higher than what's typical for printers that use ink tanks (i.e., ink cartridges that don't have built-in ink nozzles, like HP's ink cartridges have). I normally buy OEM ink until a printer's warranty period is over, but I made an exception for my Canon MAXIFY MB5120, because a full set of extra capacity Canon ink tanks for it costs about $75, while a set of compatible ink tanks costs about $15. I estimate that I use 4 sets of ink tanks per year, and at that rate of consumption, even if the compatible ink were to shorten the life of my printer, I'm saving enough money that I could replace the whole printer every year and still come out ahead. Changing ink cartridges on this printer is a little fiddly, but not difficult after you've done it once or twice.<br/><br/>The one place where I'd say the Canon MAXIFY MB5120 really disappoints is paper handling. As long as all you're going to do with it is load the paper tray with up to half a ream of one size of paper, there's no problem. The paper tray adjusts to letter, legal, and most other standard paper sizes, although the markings for setting the paper guides could stand to be clearer. The main issue is that there is only one paper tray, and no single-sheet or override feeder. To change paper types and sizes, you must empty the paper tray, adjust it for the new size, reload it, insert it and then change the paper type and size settings on the control panel. This is a nuisance if you have to do it frequently.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 3/31/2020<br/><br/>After about about 5 months of use, the printer began printing incorrect colors on certain types of paper, notably envelopes and index cards. At around the 7 month mark, it became apparent that the printer wasn't spraying magenta ink at all, and not enough yellow, on any kind of paper, and I could no longer print photographs. Printing a nozzle test confirmed that the cyan nozzles were spraying intermittently, some of the yellow nozzles were clogged, magenta nozzles were not spraying at all. After running several cleaning cycles, I looked up some service information online, and decided it would be more expedient to remove the print head from the printer and clean it out myself rather than contact Canon tech support and try to convince them to fix or exchange the printer. My cleaning operation was a success, and my printer is printing normally again. However, since this happened after only 7 months of use, despite the fact that I print at least a dozen full-color pages weekly, and often many more, I am docking this printer another star. No inkjet print head should be clogging after only 7 months of regular use.<br/><br/>You don't need to be a printer technician to remove the print head for cleaning, but it's not a job for a beginner, either. Canon could have made it easier by providing a means of removing ink tanks before they're empty; on this model, you must start a printer test, cut the power, and manually move the print head in front of the cartridge release mechanism. Once the cartridges are out, you remove a plastic shield that's held in place by plastic spring clips, and then take out two screws with a magnetized screwdriver (because if you don't lose the screws in the printer when you remove them with an unmagnetized screwdriver, you will certainly lose them when you try to put them back in). Still, it could be worse. On some printers, you can't remove the print head without major printer disassembly.</span>

<span>I am very impressed by this machine and believe that Canon made a marketing error calling it a "business printer". I am an artist who uses photo reference, so I need a lot of good, detailed prints for my work. Previously, I was using the Pro9000 II. It made very nice photos, but I could not support its unquenchable thirst for ink. With 8 small cartridges, I was constantly ordering refills. The cost was terrible, but it was also extremely inconvenient--I never knew when I was going to be stuck in the middle of a project with no ink. I tried an off-brand refill system but it leaked all over the place. So, apprehensively, I decided to try one of the printers with fewer cartridges--at least with only 4 inks (I believe the pigment black is only for text) I could cut the problem in half. I decided that I could live with diminished print quality in exchange for the cost and convenience. Well, so far I am delighted with the prints from this model. With a little tweaking, I was able to get a near-perfect match to my monitor (I reset the printer with a bit less magenta and a tad brighter). I was never able to do this with the Pro9000 II, which was inconsistent from print to print. There is no visible deficit from having half the number of inks--transitions are just as smooth or better, colors are vivid, contrast is excellent. It's difficult to be certain, but details and textures might be ever-so-slightly sharper with the Pro9000 II, and the ink dots might be a tad more visible with the iX6820, but that's under very close scrutiny. So far I've printed about 12 8 1/2 X 11 prints and the ink levels are all above half--and that is using the smaller cartridges that came with the machine. That's already better than the Pro9000 II, which would have been demanding a fix by now.<br/>I have only been using it for about a week, so I can't attest to its durability--I hope it will continue to work this well. I also can't comment on the wireless capability. I just connected it to the USB cable I had from my last machine. It works fine with a cable but quite a few people have complained about wireless problems.<br/>UPDATE: Many months later, this printer continues to make excellent prints. I notice that when I don't make a print for a long time--maybe a few weeks--there will be a slight bit of banding in the first print that comes out, but that seems to work itself out quickly by the next print. This is excellent performance compared to the Pro9000, which had a lot of banding issues and needed to be cleaned and fussed with regularly. I have had 2 small problems that should be noted. The paper feed is somewhat unreliable--there have been a few times when I had to fiddle with the paper for 5 minutes or so to get the machine to grab onto it. Also, the ink sensor function is extremely premature, to the point of being useless. I was able to continue to make excellent prints for a very long time after the notification that inks needed to be replaced. Interestingly, when the ink finally does run out, the difference in prints is abrupt...you know right away. These are annoying defects, but the quality of the prints is still such an astonishing bargain that I am keeping the 5 star rating.</span>

<span>I specifically purchased this wifi printer because some people reviewed this as being compatible with Chromebook. After hours of effort, I realized that perhaps *some* chromebooks can connect to it, depending on the type of processor (ARM or other) your Chromebook has, but mine does not. There is no driver for Chromebooks available. I tried setting up a generic printer using the generic drivers, but none of them communicate with the Pixma series. I found a thread that gave discussion for how to modify one of the MAC drivers, however, I don't have a MAC or the editor they described as being required for editing the driver file. Apparently NONE of the Pixma series are supported. Before buying a printer for your Chromebook, go into the setup for adding a new printer, and see what models are available in the dropdown. Some Canon printers are there, but not all. Otherwise, this connected fine to my Windows laptop, and it prints great. Unfortunately, the Canon software contains a ton of bloatware, and their dashboard icon is HUGE and non-intuitive. I considered returning it, but, I needed a new printer, and this one prints. So, 4 stars.<br/><br/>*** Update 7/2022: if you do not use this printer every day, one day, your print heads will clog up. Do yourself a favor, and buy a print head cleaner kit when you buy this. The cleaning kit is about $10 on Amazon, and it's well worth it. Yesterday, I changed the large black ink cartridge, and suddenly, no black. Which was a nuisance, since I was trying to print my resume. After some research, I found the most common issue is print heads getting clogged from just sitting around, not being used.<br/><br/>NOTE: don't try to clean the print heads with alcohol. It won't work. You need the solution that injects into the print head, and dissolves the dried ink inside. Once I applied two treatments, and let it sit for 30 minutes, I now have black ink again.</span>

<span>Once we got this set up and connected (a total of about 36 hours) the printer is better than my expectations. I purchased this to print cards on 100 lb card stock.  It is fantastic!<br/>One of the drawbacks is that the setup directions are only illustrations.  You have to go to the online manual to get good instructions.  Also, the software installation  was last updated in 2013!!!  A very frustrating experience.</span>

<span>Ok this replaced my DEAD R2000 but I needed a 19 inch printer and did not have the money to invest in 800 dollar printer again. My Epson R2000 was 8 years old...and I did like that printer..but with lots of love hate relationships too. Ok this newbie arrived in good shape...happy to start learning the learning curves...a lot of differences between the two printers. It came with OEM ink I thought it wouldn't..but it did. That allowed me to get going instantly. I had ordered more ink however choose a non oem ink with good reviews. All went great to begin with. Printer was doing a great job with photos. I was doing a large 53 book project with 12 full half page photos per book. Also a large standup accordian photo display with about 20 photos. And four special photo albums with over 40 photos half page size. So lots of photos and asking a lot of a brand new never used printer to do. Now for the one star off. It sensed the low ink tank and warned me..it also stopped dead in mid job of printing if it ran out of said ink. I then replaced empty cartridge for new. It stepped up and printed just fine no flaws in the mid stop photo it was printing. This went on until all but the large black text cartridge had run out. Then the trouble begins. Printer did not always give me warnings that the tanks were low and it would print right through not stopping. OK...not good I had to make little to spare photo paper stretch for the project without changing to another type. This paper has great cardstock qualities for this kind of work. Ok so this happened once...twice....three times. By then I was checking  all the cartridges and if the back tanks were empty I replaced at the same time I had a warning for any other. So the question arises is this a bad cartridge problem from a Non Oem Ink product or is it the printer that isn't keeping good track. I have ordered new OEM cartridges to see how those work and new non oem cartridges from a different vendor. But I'm afraid that the printer is not counting the non oem cartridges properly. Now having nothing at all to do with that was the star off. When I changed a cartridge no matter if it was OEM or not the machine recognized that it was now full. BUT about half the time it did not print. It may or may not print when I switched out the new cartridge with a second new one and it printed fine..or problem still happened. The way this ink cartridge works would suggest air locks should not be a big problem. However that is what it appears to be. So I found a way to out smart the printer. I first check with a small color block page I made just for this purpose as it's a lot less wasteful and harmful to the printer than running head cleanings etc. If the color is not printing I close my program on computer. I turn off the printer then unplug the printer. This often is what is suggested to erase all previous connumications with printer. I wait about 20 minutes then turn printer back on and open program and resume printing but first of course running another color block check to be sure it is printing. It has worked every time this happened. It happened a lot. I went through a total of 25 cartridges todate during this project. And sure enough the very last cartridge it accepted but then did not print was a black and it was a new OEM ink cartridge...so that falls squarely on the printer itself.  There is some debate if the non oem cartridges are short in ink or if the printer is just not operating it's count. I can work around that. I am upset however that when I put in a new cartridge or two or three at a time the printer shows it's full thus accepting them but then not printing as if it's an air lock or ????? Makes no sense. This of course is all on a brandnew printer...my first experirence with it. I feel there is still a bit of a learning curve and shock it up to the fact I was spoiled rotten by the R2000 but it had it's elements of dishing out misery too and that major one was airlocking which started with it's own OEM ink. In fact I had never heard of off market inks until a year into the R2000 it began having airlocking fits. Using it's only cartridges. I had it under extended warranty and both them and the Epson help was working with me when suddenly the warranty folk accused me of using non-oem inks. I asked what is that? I got my education quickly. Turned out I ordered a batch and was thrilled with it and the printer for years worked fine actually better than it had with the OEM's and no air locking. Until one day a year ago troubles began again. So that led to worse problems and no amount of things that had worked previously helped. And finally one day it literally just died. WHich may explain why nothing was working because it had some internal programing problems or what have you and it was 8 years old. So for less than 140 dollars I decided to give this printer a try and needed one immediately. No complaints and why it's 4 stars overall with the exception of the refusal to print always after changing that color..but I explained how I get around this quirk. I can live with quirks within reason as long as I understand I need to do that. If I were a business however this wouldn't be acceptable..as a home office fun for the most part machine...I'm fine. By the way I didn't have one issue with any of the inks leaking. I took all review warnings about such to heart and handled all the cartridges carefully but no problem. I am concerned with the inside of the printer it looks like ink was thrown all over and splashes up on the cover and the bar above the rollers. I am not sure I need to clean that off periodically or just ignore. I'll double check with the customer service folks on that. For the price I'm more than happy with ink. Photos did not smudge and dried well using three different kinds of high gloss photo paper. They could be handled pretty quickly after printing though I usually gave them a few minutes to dry before cutting and glued some back to back for the books.</span>

<span>While I'm grateful I only paid $99 for this printer, had I known it's as frustrating as it is, I'd have refused to pay more than $59 for it.<br/><br/>While the print quality itself is adequate (it's certainly nothing special, as my Brother MFC9840CDW Color Laser Printer does a better job at printing in photo quality at 600x1200 optimised resolution than this thing does at 9600 x 2400 resolution), nothing else about this printer truly stands out as "remarkable."  The only reason I really purchased this printer is for a couple of things: the scanner/copier on the aforementioned 9840CDW has a permanent, "Scanner Jam" message that cannot be cleared/reset (it'll cost more to have serviced than a new printer would cost), and I wanted to have the ability to print on CDs/DVDs.<br/><br/>First of all, the printer itself is incredibly noisy.  Even when put on Quiet Mode (go into the system settings on the touch screen to access this feature), it's still loud enough to startle my cats every time it starts printing.  For the size of this thing, it makes enough noise to think it should be twice the size and have twice the capabilities as it actually is.  I again reference my color laser MFC9840CDW.  The Canon PIXMA MX922 sits on the far end of my very large desk against a far wall in my home office that measures 15' x 15', and it's loud enough to be heard clear in the hallway outside the office when it's printing - again, even in "Quiet Mode."<br/><br/>Second, once this printer goes to sleep, you can absolutely forget about a quick print job.  Many, many times I want to print something from online, or maybe an email that has a few sentences in it that I need to take with me for something, whatever - and I just want to get it printed and get out the door.  That's not going to happen within a minute, or most times even THREE minutes, with this printer once it goes to sleep.  When the printer wakes up after having a print job sent to the queue, it has to go through this self-cleaning, alignment process - each and every time - for some reason, which can take in excess of 5 full minutes before it will agree to release the printed document you requested.  This is nightmarishly frustrating.  I have a portable Canon PIXMA IP90X printer I take with me on work sites that prints much, much faster than this thing does (and much more quietly!).<br/><br/>Next, it would have been really nice to have a second multipurpose tray that's 8 1/2" by 11", the way most printers do, or even just a slot - that a person can utilize when they want to print on envelopes, specialized papers, etc., without having to take out all the paper from the single 8 1/2" x 11" tray it *does* have, put in the media you want to print on, send the job, put the regular paper back in, etc.  And forget about putting the special paper on top of the regular paper in the main print tray - it LOVES to try to feed multiple pages of it at once through the printer and jams way more often than not.  Printing envelopes with this printer is also just a total pain.  There *is* a second tray for paper, but it's only able to be used for things like 4" x 6" photo paper - nothing else.<br/><br/>Even the slot-loading tray you're supposed to use to print CDs/DVDs is very, very poorly designed.  You have this totally separate, removable plastic tray that has a nipple on it that you're supposed to clip the digital disc to, then you have to figure out, based on extremely poor documentation and illustration - both in the manual and on the front of the printer behind the drop-down door and yet another drop-down flap - how to insert said tray into a slot you'd never guess in a million years is for what it's for.  It took me literally 45 minutes to figure out how to get this maddening little printer to actually print on digital discs.  And when you don't intend to print on any digital discs for awhile, what are you supposed to do with the plastic tray you use to insert them into the printer?  That's right - the tray clips to the BOTTOM of the weird multipurpose tray that only holds 4" x 6" photo paper on the printer!  How strange is that?  Why couldn't it just be stored IN the CD/DVD print slot where you actually insert the confounded thing to be printed??<br/><br/>My next point of contention with this printer is that the tiny little ink tanks that go into it don't print a significant amount before they claim to be empty and needing replaced.  While the individual ink tanks for this printer are far cheaper than each color toner cartridge my MFC9840CDW uses, if I'm going to be replacing them after every couple hundred pages that get printed (standard text pages with a little color interdispersed - I've only printed a few 8 1/2" x 11" photos with this printer so far), the cost benefit analysis will quickly indicate which printer is the better value for the consumables and time spent ordering and waiting for supplies!<br/><br/>A few things I *do* like about this printer: the smallish footprint isn't objectionable.  While it takes up more room than my Canon IP90X mobile printer, that printer also doesn't have a scanner and such built into it; so I expect this one to take up more room.  It's still significantly smaller than my color laser printer, which I cannot keep on my desk because of the size.  I also like the fact that the WiFi on this printer was super simple to set up - simply go into the Wireless Menu, tell it you want to use the push-button connection method (for those of us with wireless routers capable of such a task), go push the button on the router, and bing, bang, boom: connected.  I have yet to have this printer lose connection to my wireless home network, either.  For those of you with wireless routers that don't have the push-button connection feature, entering the wireless network parameters into this printer, while not really a joy to do, can still be done fairly easily.  And again, once you've done it, you don't have to do it again since the connection is incredibly stable.  If you unplug the printer, however, those settings will be lost and you'll have to do it all over again.  It bears mentioning that power failures do NOT cause the printer to forget your wireless network settings.  I've had a breaker trip several times, and as soon as the breaker is reset, the printer comes back online and connects to the network without any intervention on my part.<br/><br/>The templates for printing various types of "daily use" paper, like notepaper, graph paper, weekly or monthly calendars, etc., is a feature I definitely could have lived without.  I have yet to print a single template that's stored on the printer's memory, let alone downloaded any additional ones which supposedly can be done through the touch screen.  I'd rather have seen a more useful feature put in its' stead.<br/><br/>I also haven't tried to use the Web feature built into this printer, as I simply don't have a use for it.  If I need to access the Internet, I'll do it from my tablet, smart phone, iMac or MacBook Air - not something that has a slightly larger than 2 1/2" screen.<br/><br/>The software for scanning and manipulating documents and images on your computer has a bit of a learning curve to it, but once you learn the basics of it, which took me about 30 minutes to really become comfortable with, I can accomplish the basic necessities I purchased this printer for.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I sill far prefer to use my color laser printer for my daily printing needs, *especially* ones I need fairly quickly and nicer print quality.  The Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer leaves quite a bit to be desired in my home office and will never substitute any other printer.</span>

<span>That said, I don't try different brands so I can compare them, so I may be biased. My camera equipment is Canon (for many years) and so my last printer was a Canon IP6000, purchased in 2006, for printing 4x6 photos (and documents). It worked great until recently when it suddenly slowed way down, which is what prompted me to go shopping. Naturally I read the reviews for Canon printers (and some other brands) and it appeared that this one was the newest technology and already had favorable reviews, including from people with home businesses.<br/><br/>Now, let's switch gears. My printing needs have diminished over the years as I have become increasingly more digital in document storage, online financial transactions, etc. Basically, if I can do it digitally, then that is the route I take. This includes my photo collection which is stored on my iPad for showing off.  :-)  I also bought a CanoScan 8600F (flatbed scanner) in 2006, which is still in use.<br/><br/>So, imagine my very pleasant surprise when I discovered the awesome speed and stream-lined functionality of the multi-sheet scanning feature! If one sets up a directory (in the accompanying software utilities) ahead of time, then it's as simple as loading your documents, hitting either start button (black or color) and very quickly a pdf file shows up in the pre-set directory. Did I mention it has an ethernet port and is quickly (and painlessly) recognized on the network once the drivers are installed? I don't like Wi-Fi for home networking, I prefer ethernet (gigabit speed) when ever I can get it, so this port was a big plus for me. All of my computers see and work with the Fax driver, Printer driver and Scanning driver.<br/><br/>Now, let's mention some little things that make this machine great. I never turn it off as it has a low-power state (automatic after a few minutes of inactivity) where everything powers down with only one small, blue light glowing. If I send something to the printer it immediately comes to life, takes a few moments to warm up and (this is cool) the paper output tray *automatically* opens and the extension support flips out! It's the little things that make me smile. :-) Also, if I place one or more documents in the scanner slot (while in low power mode) then it instantly springs to life and takes a few moments to warm up.<br/><br/>Having stated that I print less and less these days, I must say I was impressed with the ink cartridges. They all have small, red LED lights that confirm they are plugged in correctly and in working order! Another smile. :-)  Now I don't FAX much these days, but it's nice to know that it is hooked into the "clone" line through my PhonePower VOIP adapter (2 ports) and therefore is available upon demand. Oh, btw, the top lifts up like a flatbed scanner also, so I guess I will be donating the CanoScan 8600F soon.<br/><br/>Final analysis: This machine's capabilities pleasantly exceeded my expectations, even after reading the specs and reviews. It has proven to be fairly equal in functionality to the Xerox multi-function machine at work, but at a fraction of the cost. The only thing it can't do is print 11x17, but that isn't an issue at this time. I will try to get back in a year to report on it's longevity prospects.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have knocked the rating down to 4 stars because there is no secondary sheet feeder. (My rating for this is actually 4.5 but that choice isn't available). Occasionally I have need to print on 8.5 x 14 (legal). With this unit one must remove the regular paper from the lower (main) paper tray, extend it out (at least they did build that into the unit) and load the 8.5 x 14 paper. I suppose I have been spoiled by top (secondary) sheet feeders on previous printers, so this is a small let-down. I guess I assumed the scanning feeder could be used as a secondary sheet feeder (for printing) but due to the design of the machine it cannot.<br/><br/>UPDATE, 11-24-13: I had occasion to send my sister a letter today (she hates email) so I typed one up and hit the print button. I have not printed anything for several months, and the print cartridges are now 7 months old. My letterhead includes a small photo of a sunset over a local river at the bottom. After hitting the print button the machine woke up, flipped out the print tray, spent a minute doing a self-diagnostics, then printed out my one page in about 7 seconds. Apart from a slight smudge at the top (probably due to inactivity for several months) the letter printed out flawlessly, including the photo. I reprinted the letter and there were no smudges or flaws. Since I have not needed "legal" size paper anymore, I am changing my rating to 5 stars since this machine is doing everything I need it to do.<br/><br/>UPDATE, 05-25-14: I lost my mother on Feb. 1 and inherited her estate. I was forced to move temporarily from WA to KY to liquidate the estate. My first priority was to set up my office so I could deal with the legal, financial and medical accounts and issues. I am also Trustee so there were many Will disbursements to deal with. I did not bring my MX922 from WA, instead I bought a new one once here. After 4 months of scanning, copying, and printing, I can now say I have given this machine a workout, including the printing function. It has performed most excellent. I also needed to buy more ink cartridges and discovered an alternate source (here on Amazon) for cartridges that are: (a) a fraction of the cost of Canon cartridges, (b) still have the same red LED's on them that communicate with the printer and (c) are relatively CLEAR, so one can see how much ink is left. I still cannot comment on photo printing as I am all digital these days when it comes to photography. But I can give this unit 5 stars for being a workhorse in all other areas! I can also say that if one schedules their need for printing envelopes in batches, this unit does that professionally as well.<br/><br/>UPDATE, 08-24-15: Earlier in the year I decided to start creating my own greeting cards (using CorelDraw) and printing out 5x7 photos for b-day gifts to relatives and friends (from PhotoShop). Both machines are still working great, and they produce exceptional photos. There are settings within the Canon print drivers that one can play with to improve the photo quality as well. I can also endorse the much cheaper ink cartridges that I buy from Blake Printing Supply on Amazon. I have gone through 2 sets (10 cartridges in a set) and they work great as well. For those wanting to find them, do a search on Amazon for "MX922 compatible ink cartridges" and look for Blake Printing Supply.</span>

<span>Honestly, I've not been a Canon Printer fan, and I've always used HP OfficeJets in the past....until now. When my HP OfficeJet 4622 suddenly bit the dust, and without warning, I looked into getting another. However, this time, I wanted something a bit more. I was going to be printing on some DVDs (custom labels) for a photo gallery of my grandparents' old photos, for my family as gifts. This unit caught my eye, because it had the built-in CD printing tray. Looking around town, I couldn't find a better deal than what Amazon was listing, so I bit the bullet and bought this one. Within 2 days (Prime Member) it was sitting on my doorstep.<br/><br/>First of all, the printer is BIG. Yeah, much bigger than the HP 4622 I had, and did I say heavy? Anyhow...after getting all the protective tape and stabilizers out of the way, this big-boy was a breeze to set up via the instructions. Download of the software was fairly quick (cable modem), and instructions were fairly easy. Connection via my router for WiFi use was simple as well, and locked in within seconds. Printed off the test/alignment document, and done!<br/><br/>Software: If you're simply out to print some standard documents, then it's a breeze -- just hit "PRINT" and you're done. However, if you're wanting to do photo printing, scanning, etc., then there's some more features to try out. This thing comes with "My Image Garden" which will allow the user to preview scans, look up photos, and do some adjusting. I don't really have much use for it since I use Photoshop and other preview programs (Picasa 3). The better place to start is with the Cannon Quick Menu. It shows a very clear and concise array of options for the Pixma, and allows users to modify some (not all) of the way the printer behaves/prints/saves in certain features.<br/><br/>Scans: I periodically have to scan both documents and photos. Once the printer has been set up, the process is a breeze. Documents are placed in the top feed (if desired), and fairly quickly are whisked through to scan. I've set my documents to default as a PDF file, and a specific folder. Photos are laid flat on the scanning bed, and depending on the resolution, scan pretty quickly -- default set to JPG file as well. Now, as part of the customization, you can go into the Cannon Quick Menu, and set the way you want your documents/photos saved, and which programs you want them to preview in. The only thing I don't like is that there is no way to set the brightness/contrast on a document that you're scanning in -- at least nothing that I've seen. All of my documents that are saved in PDF format are scanned in and then my Adobe Acrobat opens up for the preview. Then, I can decide whether the scan is acceptable, and simply save it under the file name that I want to. Same thing goes for photos, but in my case, they open up in Photoshop automatically, and then I can work on them, save them, or both.<br/><br/>There are some other features that come with the unit, such as: Card Printer, Collage Print, Photo Layout, Video Layout, as well as others. There is a fax feature, but in the age of technology, I don't have a LAN line, and do all my faxing via Nextiva Fax online. Of course, this makes things a breeze...at least for me.<br/><br/>CD/DVD printer: What I've found is that there's TWO WAYS to deal with this, and both are a pain in the butt. While the default software will allow you to print to an inkjet printable disc, it will only allow you to work from the templates that are given,,,and there's no customization at all. No, you cannot have created a picture, and drag it into the template for printing. You basically MUST use the given templates, themes, and backgrounds. The only thing you can change is the TYPE and FONT STYLE, making it absolutely worthless. The other (and better) option is to get the program (CD LABEL PRINT ver 1.4.2) available on Cannon's website. The program looks like something that was developed for Windows 3.11, but it works, and works well. Now, getting the disc to print is a whole other issue, and setup is nothing short of a pain. The disc holder is found on the underbelly of the photo paper tray, and has to be removed at each use in order to use. Printing to the disc is a real process, and requires a bit of patience. No, it's not hard, but they just don't make it very simple either. Either way, the resulting print to the blank disc is absolutely stunning. The project that I was working on came out FLAWLESS, and everyone was happy with the results!<br/><br/>PROS: Lots of paper space (holds plenty), and a separate tray for photo paper. Scanner is fairly quick, and scans are very good quality at high resolution. Display is simple and well-lit. Setup was about as simple as it could be. Quick Menu offers great control over features and use.<br/><br/>CONS: Very large footprint/size, and heavy. Does not allow for brightness/contrast changes on scans. Sheet feeder sometimes difficult to manage papers in (tabs too low). Printing to CD/DVD is a real pain, but doable.</span>

<span>This is my first review on any product on Amazon, this review will be on the </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Canon-PIXMA-MX922-Wireless-Color-Photo-Printer-with-Scanner-Copier-and-Fax/dp/B00AVWKUJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax</a>
<span>. After reading almost 75 reviews this will be focusing on the reviews with 1-2 stars. First to the complaints on the wireless air-print from Ios or Android, if you setup the printer using WPS your phone will never pick up the printer or will appear offline. You have to select WLAN Setup from Menu on the printer then select other setup options on the LCD screen then select standard setup and find your router then select and type in your password then connect. Also you have to make sure your phone is on the same channel, so especially if you have a dual-band router and your phone is on the 5ghz channel and the printer is on the 2.4ghz channel you will also run into problems. So every thing has to be on same channel, phone on 2.4ghz then the printer has to be on 2.4ghz channel then you will have absolutely no problems printing from your phone. Then with the complaints about noise there is a Quit mode selection in the menu when turned on it reduced all printer noise by at least 75%. Now to the ink consumption this printer is one of the best in the simple fact that if one of your cartridges runs out it will continue to print. Also the printer by default will print even all Black and White documents in the color setting because it brings a better quality this can simply be changed in your printer settings in your control panel to Black and White so most regular text documents will use the XXL cartridge which lasts for ever. With this setting changed if the page has color it stills prints in color.Compared to other printers when one cartridge runs out the printer will not continue to print until the ink cartridge is changed. The Canon PIXMA MX922 is one of the best printers I've used regarding ink, as a plus you can buy a color and XXL Black cartridge set from Amazon for a total of $60. As far as the scanner and copier go's it is one of the best I've used on a printer under $200. Have not had a chance to use the Fax so I can't reply in this review on that subject. One of the few downfalls of this printer is the size it really is a rather large printer compared to other all in one printers in it's class so take that into consideration. Photos are absolutely beautiful when used with Cannon Pro Platinum photo paper at 4x6 100 sheets for $20 on Amazon. As far as setup and install program wise it's pretty much standard  procedure. I've had the printer for about two weeks now and really I am so impressed for only $99. To those saying about break downs well with the SquareTrade 3-Year Electronics Protection Plan ($75-100) for only $14.20 how can you go wrong? There is another slight downside if you don't have a router or wireless access the printer doesn't come with the USB cable to direct connect, but one can be purchased on Amazon for $5.49 the Mediabridge USB 2.0 - A Male to B Male Cable (10 Feet) - High-Speed with Gold-Plated Connectors - Black. For those people giving this printer 1-2 stars it really is not their fault they are just ignorant to technology. Throwing off people into second guessing in purchasing this amazing piece of home all in one equipment. The auto 35 page duplex is also so time saving and conserves so much on paper consumption. I really hope this review finds people who are interested in purchasing this machine. The VERY few downsides like the USB and shear size is the only reason I didn't give this product a 5 star rating. I hope this review was helpful in letting you disregard the people giving this product 1-2 stars. Thanks for taking the time to read a real review!</span>

<span>I'm a photographer and a Canon guy these days. Back in the 80's and 90's all Nikon/Pentax, but come the digital age Canon. 3 Canon DSLR's and lots of red ring lenses. Large format Canon printer for photography and art. While I used lasers for when I was printing lots of collateral, I've had a little inkjet all-in-one for home use. So, when my junky little HP inkjet died, I figured I'd just grab a Canon and life would be good.<br/><br/>Not so fast. Ok, Canon have always been a bit challenged when it comes to UI (save their cameras), but this one is spectacularly bad. It's a constant struggle to scan a document and switch between file formats/resolutions. Yes, you can name and save these, but that part is easier said than done. Part of the issue stems from the fact it's not a touch screen, which even my sad little HP officejet was. Then, there's the inconsistencies in which buttons perform which operation as you try to navigate options and settings. Spectacularly horrific. You can expect loads of frustration as it beeps at you when you press "OK" and it refuses to do anything.<br/><br/>Setup was fairly straightforward, but I've done a lot of this sort of thing so I knew the correct steps to begin with. I'd say when it comes to this, the HP and Epson are a lot more clear to the average user, and have far better setup CD's to get your wireless devices talking to each other. I'd give this a 6/10.<br/><br/>The print quality (letters) is decent, although I've not tried photo quality so I can't comment there. What is really disconcerting however is the time to get a first page. Half the time - perhaps more - the printer seems to go into some sort of self-check when I start printing. It's just a PDF shipping label! But seriously, it can take well over 2 minutes. 1 crummy page with a box and a barcode, or a simple word doc. It can do this literally 10 minutes after printing another document. It doesn't seem to be a cleaning mode, it just whirs and clicks as the screen has a mild seizure. I simply can't imagine using this for a regular SOHO environment.<br/><br/>Copies are atrocious. Just wow bad. The HP looked pretty darned decent compared to originals, picking up the halftones and spitting out clean copies. This thing looks like an old Xerox machine by comparison. Embarrassing. You do NOT want this machine if you're handing out copies and want to look good. If you're a nonprofit looking for handouts on the other hand...<br/><br/>The scan quality is the worst I've had in years, and several rungs down from the HP. I frequently scan floorplans I've done on a grid form, and even at high settings, the grid is all but invisible. If scanning quality is remotely important, keep looking.<br/><br/>Faxing has been pretty straightforward in both receiving and sending, but this has become increasingly rare for me so I can't give you much more advice on this aspect.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- easy-ish to network<br/>- turns on and off<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- lousy setup software<br/>- horrific UI<br/>- no touch screen<br/>- terrible scans<br/>- can take minutes for 1 B&amp;W text page<br/>- goes to sleep about 5% of the time<br/>- nasty copies<br/><br/>If you're the sort who sits down with the manual, and setup every single scenerio for copying/printing/scanning you'll need, this might do it for you. I've been using printers for almost 40 years now, owned a service bureau for the better part of a decade, and have dealt with every type of analog/digital printer from every brand there is. I've never had anything quite like this.<br/><br/>I'm seriously considering dumping this when time comes for a new set of carts. I'm just looking at an additional $25-50 for a new printer. Just as an aside, my HP problems weren't just the printer dying, but bad quality cartridges that leaked. Another reason I got the Canon. HP notoriously pitches a fit if you use third party carts. 3rd party manufacturers are always playing catch up to the latest HP updates. I did try another ink brand, but the particular brand I got was awful and the cyan cart in particular. My old Brother color laser printer got the heave-ho because their toner cartridges were leaking powder everywhere!<br/><br/>Seems if these companies are going to charge extortionate prices for their consumables, they could at least be of decent build quality. In the latter case, I think it's because they recycle the carts (you're supposed to mail them in once spent). I'll probably give Epson a shot next time around, unless there's an HP on sale.<br/><br/>2 stars, barely passable for what it is. I certainly cannot recommend it.</span>

<span>I purchased this machine because of the claim (by a Canon representative in the FAQ section) that it had 2-sided copy and scan capability.  Perhaps not technically a lie, but certainly misleading - it has the capability if you want to stand there turning pages over repeatedly but not using the ADF.  I was able to get some 1-to-2 sided functionality by using the ADF to scan in 1-sided items (it doesn't scan 2 sides) to my computer and then make a 2-sided print.  This is a heck of a lot more manual work than I expected.<br/><br/>The MAXIFY support line does get answered quickly and the representative was honest about the reason I couldn't figure out how to activate functionality the machine apparently lacks.  Copy quality is fine.<br/><br/>The low value rating is because I paid much less for my previous machine that did have this functionality.  I'm now debating whether this is worth keeping and reviewing my alternatives.<br/><br/>Even if I end up keeping it, however, it will be with a lingering sense of distrust and betrayal due to the misinformation that induced my purchase.</span>

<span>I got close to boxing it up and sending it back.  But I believe I managed to get the installation done.<br/><br/>1. The manual is actually a composite for 3 different models which makes it tough to follow along.  One of the 3 models supports wireless lan but this printer does not so WHY is that crap in the manual at all?<br/><br/>2. Many people complain because the printer doesn't come with a USB cable nor an RJ45 network cable.  I  expected that by reading reviews prior to ordering but since I have an existing HP officejet (that is what the Canon is replacing) I thought I would just use that cable.  That proved to be yet one more stumbling block.  Canon, WTF!  stick a GD cable in the box!<br/><br/>Installation with printer on LAN network:  I actually bought it to be a networked printer so I first thing I connected it to my router with RJ45 cable.  I downloaded the installation software (MF230SeriesMFDriverV520WPusEN.exe) rather than trying to start with the CD in the box.  The second or third time trying the install software and it found the printer on the network.  It seems like chicken and egg problem whether the sofrware is installed before connecting the printer and turning it on, but whatever, it took about 15 minutes and I was beginning to be hopeful.  Ok, I could print to the printer from my laptop.  Seemed to easy.  Then I went and got the scanner software (winmfscanutilityv11000.exe) and installed it but it complained about not seeing the printer.  And after far too much fooling around trying to get scanner to work I decided that maybe the scanner software only works when using the USB cable.<br/><br/>Installation with printer connected by USB to my laptop:  Hours of frustration trying to get the sofrware installed.  Went to the canon forums and found postings talking about the issue "Scan Utility A Scanner Driver Supporting This Software Is Not Installed".  Long story short - at some point just before I boxed it up to send it back I thought maybe I should try a different USB cable.  It was a working cable but I dug into old boxes to see if I had another cable.  So after switching USB cables, I uninstalled all the printer software, rebooted and then ran the install.  This time it installed using plug and play (which it hadn't done before) and so the scanner software worked.  Again, Canon, I hate you for not putting a USB cable in the box.  Grrrr.<br/><br/>Other negative comments is that the paper bin has a strange cover and even just getting paper loaded the first time was unnecessarily awkward to figure out and the manual was no help at all.<br/>There are two yellow plastic things on the toner cartridge and the manual shows removing only one of them.  Both must be removed so again, the manual was misleading and not helpful.<br/><br/>By the way, I am using NAPS2 scanner utility which is simpler to use than the Canon scanner utility.<br/>It worked on they HP printer and I'm happy to find it works on the Canon.<br/><br/>There were mixed reviews regrading how noisy the printer was.  There is a button on the printer console labeled "Quiet Mode".  With quiet mode off the printer makes a sort of hi pitched whine which I think is too loud but the printer runs fastest that way.  With quiet mode on the printer is nicely quiet and honestly I didn't perceive much of a slow down.  I bet the time difference to print 100 pages would be less than one additional minute.  I can sure live with small delay to enjoy the quiet mode.<br/><br/>Print quality:  Fine for BW documents.  The scanner scans in color.  The printers gray scale conversion of color pdf files isn't to my liking yet.  I'm experimenting with the settings to darken the lightest parts but it does do a good enough job on the darker colors.</span>

<span>I bought this copier for my home office, to replace our Canon ImageCLASS D761 (2006) that died.  I specifically wanted a copier that could connect to Windows XP (we still use that) as a laser printer.<br/><br/>The price for the MF236n copier was more than reasonable... we really don't print that much stuff these days, as most documents are digital.<br/><br/>So far, my impressions are as follows:<br/><br/>1.  This machine REALLY smells when you first fire it up.  A very noxious chemical odor.  The smell has diminished with time and repeated use.<br/><br/>2.  Our previous Canon copiers were built like tanks... heavy and durable.  This one seems delicate, even a bit flimsy, by comparison.  Lots of thin and very light-weight plastic.<br/><br/>3.  This unit is much smaller than our D761, and does not copy legal size documents.  You can print onto legal size paper, but not copy anything much larger than a letter size document.<br/><br/>4.  The individual sheet feeder is funky and hard to use.  I much more prefer the tray sheet feeder that was on my old copier.<br/><br/>5.  My old D761 was simple to use... press the green button and make a copy.  Adjust contrast and enlargement/reduction with intuitive buttons.  This new copier is all digital display with touch-screen input.  Even after reading the manual, it's hard to figure out how to make it do what you want it to do.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent and very affordable, compact (two-thirds the size of the old copier) photocopier/laser printer for relatively light duty (home and home office) use.<br/><br/>[Our first desktop Canon copier, circa 1988, cost $ 2,500;  the ImageCLASS D761 (2006) cost $ 400;  so $ 190 for this copier is more than reasonable]</span>

I opted to set it up on my computer rather than with the QR Code thinking that it would synch the computer and printer during the process. I typed in the address and as it popped up there was a listing that had set up after the suggested URL. I believe I clicked on that. DON'T do that. It is a scam website pretending to be Canon. They tried to get me to pay for a tech support contract. I know that this isn't Canon's fault and it really doesn't have anything to do with the printer itself. However, I wanted to bring it to people's attention because the person I dealt with was very good at trying to convince me to pay for their service. That he was employed by Canon. While he was on the phone I checked the exact web address in the instructions and the screen was completely different.

<span>I have to buck the trend here because I love this printer.  First of all, this was not designed to be your home office all in one.  This was meant to be used in a corporate setting as a network photo printer serving a floor or small workgroup.  I have 2 other Canon printers, a TR and TS.  This ib4120 outperforms  both those printers in print quality.  It can spit out a 20 page document before either of those two finish making all those mysterious sounds when you first hit the power button.  PLUS the cartridges in this thing are HUGE.  They last at least<br/>4 times longer than those little "tanks".  I have two Pro-100's, a TR and a TS series.  i am not kidding when i say this 4120 is my favorite.  I connected it to my router with a network cable - I didnt bother with wireless, and I have had no problems whatsoever.  It is a pain that you can only change the cartridges when the printer tells you to.  But there is a way around this - you unplug the printer while its printing and then you can change cartridges.<br/>In summary, i love this printer because:<br/>500 sheet paper trays - advanced paper handling, 2 seperate trays, i put plain paper in one and my photo paper in the other<br/>it is very fast in standard mode.  as slow as other canon printers in high quality mode<br/>Cartridges last forever and 1 day<br/>Print quality is almost as good as my pro-100 which has 8 ink tanks.  Blacks are amazing - true black, not dark gray<br/><br/>The LCD is display is bad.  Seriously I can't believe how bad it is.  It's a tiny little black &amp; white 2 line LCD.  You are required to read it in order to operate the printer, but the font is so small, i have to use a magnifier to see it AND it's not backlit, so I must use a flashlight to illuminate the lcd because it is so dark I can not see it at all.<br/>The printer is not perfect, but it only costs $100, so put a flashlight next to the printer.<br/><br/>I print alot of high resolution graphics.  On plain paper this printer has the best quality output.<br/><br/>Added the following on 11/19/2020:<br/><br/>I now own three of these printers and I am going to buy a fourth to have one on hand.  All the reviews you read here are terrible - and thats just how Canon wanted it.  You see, they market this printer as a business printer.  As such, the ink is a fraction of the cost because Canon expects it to be used in a high volume office.  So if your average home user were to buy this printer, the cartridges that come with the printer would likely last a year or two.  The cartridges for this printer are about 10x bigger than the ones in those home multi-function units that canon sells,  So Canon purposely makes this printer in such a way that it is unpleasant for a home user.  For an IT professional, it is really simple.  If you know how to log into your router and do a WPS connection to this printer, it works flawlessly first time, every time.  I have 2  - Canon PRO-100 professional photo printers that get very little use now.  This $ 129  printer has better resolution prints!</span>

<span>The specifications on this printer are good; the actual usable performance is just fair. That said, the worst thing about this print-only small workgroup printer is that it was such a disappointment to me after having been a "Canon guy" for over 20 years. I've used Canon cameras and various laser and inkjet printers, both at work and at home, and this is the worst Canon branded item I have ever, ever, ever used. Ever.<br/><br/>Let's start with the installation. What I am used to in the current market is that a printer or MFC will take about 10 minutes to unpack and install. That is if I am not hurrying. This one took me almost an hour. This is because the instructions are poorly constructed and organized. The instructions consist of two large fold-out pages in multiple languages. There are blocks of instructions for wired vs. wireless vs. direct wireless installation that are repeated for various languages. There is a flow you need to follow to go through one sheet, then link to the other sheet and follow the rest of the procedure. Then, the process jumps to following instructions on the software that you have to download from the Canon website in order to finish the process. Then, that software comes in multiple parts which don't quite match the vestigial documentation.<br/><br/>What would have been more normal and better would be to have this POS just be something I can use the Mac/Apple auto-configure to load. I imagine the Windows procedure is just as messed up and that they don't allow the normal Windows printer auto-configure to just mount the printer.<br/><br/>Why the venom from me? Well, it's just a printer. It's not an MFD where one could argue that the scanning, modem and copying features require some more SW overhead or something. Why can't this thing just attach using CUPS drivers or something?<br/><br/>Then, once you get it to work (hint - don't bother with wireless configuration instructions. Use a direct connection of some sort. I used USB to configure it) the actual printing is just OK. I found that the time to first print was approximately correct for me (~6.x seconds) and that text pages printed in B&amp;W at near the quoted speed (all the printers I've tested are a bit slower than claims, including this one). When you can get it to print, the speed is OK. Full page color takes about 55 seconds on plain paper and looks decidedly average for continuous tone (photos). I am happier with the output from my HP 8620 MFD, which is cleaner and about as fast.<br/><br/>The Canon paper trays are deceiving. The real footprint of this somewhat large printer is about four inches bigger in front than you might think because the paper trays have to be physically expanded in order to use letter size paper. They come out a few inches further if you want to use legal size. This can make it look like one of the trays needs to be shoved in fully even though it is in the correct position when you have both letter and legal loaded in the two trays. It looks like a hack job and can cause someone to try to force a tray further into the unit to line it up with the other tray if they are unfamiliar with the device. And, I think it looks ugly. At a minimum, it takes up more space that you'd initially think.<br/><br/>While we are on paper, the paper does not feed from the tray you would hope for without manually messing with your print settings. The way many printers (HP, Brother, etc.) would work if you have multi trays is that they would automatically and reliably (note "reliably") figure out what size paper you are using for your print, sense what is in the two trays and then the output would come out on the right paper size. This unit seems to make random choices. I thought I had it figured out for a while, but then it dumped out on legal when it was clearly a US letter sized job. It tends to want to print on Tray 1 when it gets confused. This completely leaves out the super use case for me, which would be to have #10 envelopes in one tray and US Letter in the other tray. Physically, it can do this. The issue is that the envelopes have to go in Tray 1 due to the way the internal tray adjusters work. The problem is that you'll end up needing to switch the media out of the tray because Tray 1 is a default for printing so you can't just leave he envelopes there. You have to physically remove them to switch back and forth between letter and envelope. I only spent 5 minutes trying to figure this out, so maybe it can work, but it should need to be figured out. It's an office printer, it should just work.<br/><br/>While on the topic of things that aren't letter paper, I printed an envelope to test out the paper path. It printed but smudged ink on the corner of the envelope. Not a ton of ink, but a distracting amount on the edge. Really? The printer was only a few pages old at that point.<br/><br/>Oh, the markings for envelopes in the paper tray are correct for which side is up, but not correct for top and bottom. For the Mac using Word, they are upside down. IDK about Windows. I'd suspect the same, but you should check to make sure.<br/><br/>The LCD display on top of the printer is single line, small and NOT BACKLIGHTED EVEN THOUGH IT IS LEVEL WITH THE TOP - it is VERY HARD TO READ. HP usually has this sort of display raised at an angle and backlighted. Epson, higher res and back lighted. Brother is often backlighted. This is a higher end Canon, and it is a low res display where the bezel shadows it and it has no backlight. It's really poor. You need to be in a room with good overhead lighting or, not kidding, have a flashlight. It also needs to scroll a lot to tell you anything, so patience and working the small keypad is necessary. This display is so 90's - maybe that is being unkind to the 90's because I think they had backlights back then?<br/><br/>I am not optimistic that the big, high capacity cartridges will make you happy long term. Time will tell, but they appear to have enough electronic content that after market suppliers will have a tough time helping lower the prices. Expect to buy Canon cartridges if you can find them.<br/><br/>Final summary: It works after fussing with it. It prints with decent speed and for that you get OK prints, but nothing outstanding - competent. I think there are a lot better choices and that I'll be getting rid of this soon to save space. I'm going back to my HP 8620 (you can get other 86xx series now) because it prints as well or better and you get scanning. Also, since the dual tray SW/FW on the Canon is horrible, it has no dual tray advantage over the various MFD type units with one tray. It is at a disadvantage if you find one with a decent envelope or special material bypass.<br/><br/>Sadly, this printer shows that Canon may be a much better camera company than a printer company.</span>

<span>Only one problem, but it's a big one -- the unit simply will not connect to my wifi network, no matter what I do or what tricks I try.  Others, I see, have had the same problem.<br/><br/>In all fairness, it prints beautifully -- especially photographs -- but only in wired mode.  So if you are okay with a strictly wired setup, and your needs are purely printing-related (there are no copy or fax functions), then you might be happy with this unit.  (I am -- I bought 2 of them, and use them both, mostly for printing photographs.)<br/><br/>But if you really need the wireless capability, and you need the copy and fax functions, look elsewhere.  My suggestion (no financial interest) would be the Brother MFC-J995DW, which also prints beautifully, has the multiple functionality, and practically installed itself on my wifi network.</span>

<span>This is a pretty large all-in-on that takes a lot of real estate. For the first month, it has performed very well. Here is some of the pros and cons:<br/>Pros:<br/>1. Printing is very fast.<br/>2. So far, one easy fix jam.<br/>3. Have done a fair amount of printing on the original cartridges.<br/>4. The touch screen functions are intuitive (but not always correct-see below).<br/>5. Copy functions work as they should.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. Pretty noisy.<br/>2. Printer shakes if not on a solid surface. It was initially set up on a light duty side table. The table shook violently.<br/>3. Though the printer is very fast, it spits the copies over the tray stop and onto the floor after the first couple of copies.<br/>4. As bulky as the main body of the printer is, the paper trays stick out 2.75" past the face of the printer. The printed copy tray sticks out 6" past that for a total of 8.75". With the cables connected at the rear and the printer as far back against the wall as it will go without damaging the cables, It takes a full 26" front to back. It is 18" wide. Most home office desks are approximately 24" deep.<br/>5. Installing  the ink cartridges was a challenge. Replacing them will be a bigger pain. Not sure, but you may not be able to replace or remove ink cartridges until they are empty. Some reviewers have complained that the ink cartridges tend to dry out, some leak.<br/>6. This is not a high quality photo copier. It is basic on color prints.<br/>7. Setup was a pain. The printer was initially set up as wireless. But when the notebook was hardwired, the Canon lost the settings, never to be found again.<br/>8. Screen may indicate another print is in que where, in fact, the paper tray is empty.<br/>9. The Canon Maxify goes into a noisy quasi cleaning mode after each print session.<br/><br/>We have used a Brother MFC all-in-one for many years with great results and still have it. It is also bulky because it has a larger scanner bed. The paper trays are totallt enclosed in the main body. Extremely few jams, and those were the fault of the user. It is slower, but it does not spit the finished copies helter skelter. Other than the original print cartridges, we have always used after market ink with excellent results. Canon has fewer options on ink. The ink cartridges in the Brother do not travel and are easily accessible from a front panel on one end. Brother ink cartridge change is simple and quick. There is no appreciable difference  in photo quality between Brother ink or after market ink, nor in the print quality between the Brother and the Canon. The only reason we went with Canon was that color prints might be better. They are not, even with Canon ink. We have had the Brother for more than 5 years and it is still doing its job. It also has a program that came with it that has been most useful that did not come with the Canon.<br/><br/> It was a tossup. Some of the Brother MFC reviews indicated that Brother may have slipped on quality. We thought we would give Canon a try. In  hind sight, I would gamble against some of the Brother reviews and buy another Brother. Canon has always been touted for their photo print quality. Not on this one. I am being generous giving this 3 stars. It does what it is supposed to, but Canon is capable of much better.</span>

<span>I needed a printer that had many of the features this one has, and this one didn't cost too much; plus I thought Canon was a trusted brand name. When I first got it, it was a little complicated to set up, but I liked these features:<br/>-Wireless printing from our various devices, including my phone, was pretty easy to set up.<br/>-Scan to thumb drive or print off thumb drive is a good feature.<br/>-It turns on if you ask it to print from another room-- takes a while to make noises and wake up, but it prints<br/>-It does run out of ink pretty fast, but there are some good knock-off brands of ink that are cheaper and work just fine.<br/>-Double sided printing works great!<br/>-touch screen is cool<br/><br/>I didn't so much like that it<br/>-Was overly complicated for some features, requiring multiple menus to do the simplest things<br/>-Randomly hung up on some devices, requiring cancelling print and rebooting, and then sometimes it'd still print the original document after it was cancelled.<br/>-Requires thumb-drive documents to be in PDF format to print (not Word)<br/>-Wouldn't scan to my laptop; only my son's desktop<br/>-Print quality was good, but not great.<br/>-If you didn't pull out the paper-catcher, it threw printouts onto the floor (sounds obvious, but my other printers would just set them down gently.<br/><br/>However, the number one reason I won't buy this printer again and recommend no one else does is that it just randomly-- in between printing, even though we didn't ever use it for big print jobs, just work and school stuff-- just quit working. It was a software thing, not hardware. Just said it couldn't print. It had an error code that took me a few days to drill down, but finally, after almost an hour of searching, referred me to the manual, which told me to turn it off and on again, and then call the Tech Support number. After a good 10 minutes of trying things with the tech support guy, the guy said yup, it's broken. He verified that it was out of warranty, and then suggested that we try to make it work on our own, but offered a discount on a new Canon should we choose to buy one.<br/><br/>Now I'm out a $100 printer, and I don't want to deal with this one's quirks again, discount or no. If other Canon products behave the same, I'm moving to another brand.</span>

<span>I bought this printer back in 2017 so I have had it for a while and have learned to hate this printer<br/><br/>I bought this for a couple different reasons.  I liked the Inkjet option because I “thought” It would be better to be able to print things in color.  I liked the idea of having 2 paper trays so that I could have one for regular paper and the second for things like shipping labels.  And Finally I liked the idea of having the Document feeder for the scanner.<br/><br/>After I had it for a little while reality started to settle in.  1st I didn’t need to use the Printer as frequently as I thought I would.  The down side to this was that the Ink would evaporate out of the cartridges at a very rapid pace.  So every time I found myself needing to print something I also found myself needing to buy more ink.  This got very expensive.<br/><br/>The 2nd issue was that the scanner for the document feeder only scanned one side of the page.  I use the Scanner to scan Financial statements and Bills so that I can shred the paper copies.  This really sucked because they all come printed on both sides of the paper so I would have to scan the fronts of the pages and then scan the backs  and then use a pdf editor to merge the 2 docs together.  This was very time consuming &amp; Frustrating.<br/><br/>The 3rd issue I ran into was the networking issues.  I had the printer connected to my home network and had all of the software installed on my laptop and Desktop computers  For some reason whenever I wanted to scan a document the printer couldn’t locate one of the computers.  If I wanted to scan something to my laptop it was inevitable that the printer couldn’t find my laptop so I would have to go turn on my Desktop, scan to that, then send the file to my laptop.  This also was very frustrating.<br/><br/>I had a buddy who had a laser printer and never had any issues with not having ink when he needed it and 1 toner cartridge would last him for years.  I also learned that I didn’t really need to print anything in color.  So I decided to replace this printer with a laser printer,  My new printer also has a document feeder for the scanner but it's capable of scanning both sides of the page at the same time so everything gets scanned in order the 1st time.<br/><br/>Don’t buy this printer, it will only waste your time and money.</span>

<span>I really like this all in one printer by Canon. You can print, copy, fax and it has auto duplex printing. I use it for my SOHO. I would suggest one thing: if you are only going to use it casually and not every couple of days, be sure to print something anyway so the inkjets don't dry out. All inkjets have that problem.<br/><br/>If I do not print something one day, I will click on the google logo and print that. It has all the colors, and uses very little ink and avoids using the "clean printhead" option which uses much more ink.<br/>Doing this, I have had not had any problems. Way better than the Epson I had before that would clog up much quicker and impossible to fix.</span>
