<span>After customer service became abysmal from Lorex as a whole, we were elated to find these in stock for our clients. But what we got was nowhere near the quality we use to get from this company. Batteries at full charge only lasting about 10 days, in a busier area only lasting about 19 hours. Even the hard drive went bad at a clients home within a week so we had to replace the hard drive ourselves due to the importance of the camera system.<br/>I am not sure what happened to these, because we absolutely loved Lorex. But after their performance now, we are going to stop using and selling these to our clientele.</span>

<span>Product was advertised with a long unobstructed receiving range, however, with the antenna integrated with the recording unit, you cant put it outside for better reception. Pictures are clear, works great with ipad and iphone however it does have about a 10 second lag before the cameras come on line. Client 13 does not work with a PC. Tried both Windows 7 and 10, had a brief picture with 7 but nothing with 10. Never got 7 to work again. Will call support. Bought it for farm security, max range is 200 feet if antenna is outside.</span>

<span>these cameras worked well until a battery quit charging and a camera filled with water and stopped pairing. said camera was under a roof, had to be humidity. lorex wont do anything until a software upgrade is done, like that will dry anything out. this isnt a cheap system. it lasted one week over three months. this is beyond frustrating.<br/><br/>lorex finally made good on their warranty. the camera and battery in question was replaced at no charge. it took alot of phone time and a poor review i think to get things corrected, but they did make it right.</span>

<span>Have been use Arlo approximate 4 years, had 2 Arlo pro 2 and 2 Arlo essential spotlight, and 1 home base. Unlike others, Arlo cameras are ez set up! All you need is Wi-Fi and a charger, of course mounting hardwares is essential.<br/>Cons, since it is wireless camera, Arlo needs very reliable Wi-Fi, if the signal is not strong enough, or internet outages they won’t work properly, not only that, you need to recharge or replace the batteries after a period of time. For Arlo essential spotlight, I think it consumes much more power when spotlight is on! I used to have a solar charging panel with it  but it is not enough, then I decide to connect it with a AC power, now I can have it on 24/7.<br/>For camera’s sensitivity it is hard too say, personally I adjusted it all the way too Max, because sometimes it doesn’t do anything even with very close range actives, since I have it powered with AC so I don’t have to worry about recharge the batteries.<br/>For night version, it is okay, nothing surprises. And if something can reflect brighter light, then you can see anything on that thing, like a cars license plate.<br/><br/>Pros, it is very easy to install! No cables! No cables! No cables! If you decided to replace the batteries once in a while, and this is the main reason I go with Arlo.<br/>When I bought Arlo pro2, I think it come with 7 days free recoding, but they seems no longer have it for newer products. You need subscribe the service to have all videos saved, I paid $10 a month which is unlimited devices, price is acceptable for me<br/><br/>I’m conclusion, nothing is perfect if you can accept the cons above you should have it, otherwise you might want to shopping around others</span>

<span>I love the built-in light on this camera! It has been great to keep an eye on my backyard and see how the neighborhood raccoons and skunks are wreaking havoc while I’m asleep. My only wish is that the battery lasted a little bit longer.</span>

<span>I find these cameras to be increasingly frustrating, likely correlates with recent software updates.  Seems they don’t test things all that well before release?<br/>Ring has been far more solid software-wise.<br/>Starting a couple months back, they must have been attempting to fix notification issues.  Well they made it worse IMO.  Now the number of events in the badge notification seems to sum up over time.  ie, 10 motion events, go into app to view, clears..  next time you get 5 more events, the badge now says 15.  And it keeps going.  Only way to fix is to kill the app and relaunch.<br/>Then very recently, I get false notifications.  At least I think they are false.  Motion detected in back yard, view it within seconds, nothing there, no video in the cloud..  nothing that explains why I received a notification.  It keeps going notification every few minutes..  and I have to disable the camera.  Restarting the camera doesn’t resolve.  Either they are throwing false notifications (never see anything when going live) or they are failing to save the videos that I pay a monthly subscription to see..<br/><br/>—— original review ——-<br/>I had trouble deciding which camera brand to buy. I tend to go right to the bad reviews to see what people are saying. Problem with that approach is every product out there, someone has something bad to say ha ha!<br/>So what I did was purchase 1 Arlo, 1 Ring StickUp and 1 Blink Outdoor.  Figured I'll decide for myself what's what.<br/>The Blink went back pretty quickly because their audio sucks and their support wasn't great.  There was a constant interference type static noise. Arlo and Ring had great audio, could easily hear the birds in the morning.  The Blink also required a little 'base station' whereas the Arlo and Ring do not.<br/><br/>Both Ring and Arlo have decent apps and decent notifications.<br/>Arlo has a more flexible mount system straight outta the box, for the Ring I had to purchase an extra mount to get the adjustments I needed.<br/>Arlo has better images/video/field of view, that is one of the main things I like about my Arlo cameras.  (I purchased a second Arlo when I returned the Blink)<br/>Arlo also has some good recognition features.  I have gotten several notifications of an 'animal' in my driveway.. I'm skeptical, but look at the video, sure enough..  a squirrel running by or the neighbors cat late at night.<br/><br/>About here is where the positive things kinda stop with the Arlo cameras.<br/><br/>The battery life is pretty terrible for the one in front of my garage.  It probably sees a tad more motion than the one in the back yard, but the one in the back yard seems to last twice as long.  Maybe the one in front of the garage has a defective battery or something?  In any case, I've had these cameras since I moved into my house about 4 months ago.  I've charged one of the cameras 3 times already, the other one I charged twice.  Meanwhile I have yet to charge my Ring camera, and it's still sitting at 73%.  That's pretty impressive for the Ring.<br/><br/>My next area of frustration with the Arlo is the activity zones.  I have had these set up how I want them from day 1.  You can only define boxes that are square to the camera's field of view, that sucks.  On the Ring I can make diagonal lines and better define the area.<br/>I could deal with the boxes if they actually worked properly.  I think the camera has different moods.  I have a few boxes set up so that it should only notify me of motion if detected in my driveway or the front yard.  I specifically am trying to avoid notifications from vehicles driving by on the street.  I can go several days without an erroneous notification.  Then all the sudden on certain days, it's like the activity zones decide to stop working.  I'll get notification after notification, view the video, it's a car driving by in the street.  Not anywhere near my activity zone.<br/>I reached out to Arlo support early on, and they were not really helpful.  They just suggested that I set up my activity zones incorrectly. Well guess what, they are extremely easy to set up, and they work half the time.  sounds like a software issue to me.  I'm guessing the faulty activity zone motion detection contributes to the poor battery life on that camera.<br/><br/>A nice thing that Ring offers that Arlo doesn't seem too..<br/>If the notifications are going nuts one day (when the activity zones aren't working properly and cars are driving by). you either have to disable the camera or get a buzz for every one.  The app appears to have a global mute option that I could select for a certain duration.  But I'd prefer to just mute the camera that's being stupid.  Can't do that though, I have to disable it altogether..  Then remember to go enable it again later.<br/>The Ring on the other hand, I get out the mower and walk by it, I get the notification on my watch, right there convenient as can be, along with the selection to dismiss the notification is an option to snooze notifications from that camera for 30 minutes.  Just enough to finish mowing!<br/><br/>So all in all I do like the Arlo for it's better picture quality, but software-wise and battery-wise it's just not quite as solid as the Ring is.<br/>I have had a few experiences though where the Ring failed to notify me of a package being delivered to my front steps..  so who knows.  Nothing is perfect.</span>

<span>The lack of local storage and a wired option were showstoppers to me and I returned the product but took the time to use it while I had it to help inform my replacement purchase as to how things can work and what’s important or not.<br/><br/>Through the app you connect your device and the app steps through that process well, but for us after success was initially indicated the app still showed an empty device list and we started over.<br/><br/>I performed my setup and testing literally 4’ from a wireless access point with nothing else active on it and the throughput performance was slow and choppy with low video quality for the price point. IMO the interface doesn’t follow convention, and features are not intuitive to find or require multiple taps to find or activate. However the response to the light or microphone commands were snappy and at good levels.<br/><br/>You NEED some sort of storage for the alerted/recorded content; without it you won’t get full benefit of the device’s features. In order to store content you MUST either invest in the manufacturer’s base station (still not a sure thing - the documentation is unclear) or you must subscribe to its cloud storage plan. Forever. Without storage you can still get alerts, flick the light on and yell at the bad guys but you’ll retain no evidence and it’s sorta useless for nighttime monitoring unless you want to be awoken to manage everything first hand.<br/><br/>My intended use was as a gable-mounted parking pad monitor. The system can be put on a timer ie to just operate at night but if I chose not to automatically turn off the system all day it wasn’t clear how or if system could easily be paused when working in the yard, washing the car etc. Think about how you’ll use it.<br/><br/>Finally, there’s no indication from the manufacturer as to battery life. It contains a rechargeable battery and when a low battery is indicated you must remove the unit to plug it in. No indication of whether the unit would operate connected to the charging cable but even so the connection clearly isn’t weatherproof. I live in the cold north where batteries need even more frequent charges and cannot imagine climbing a ladder in winter for the process. Other products have an option to hardwire or at least weatherproof the power connection.<br/><br/>Thank you.</span>

<span>I have a number of Ring cameras installed and needed a hi-res camera to monitor one part of my property.  I purchased a 2 camera kit with an Arlo Hub.  It ships with 1 magnetic mount and 1 cheap plastic screw mount.  Neither mount feels like it provides good angle flexibility.  I am using one on a tree mount which solves that problem.  One good thing is the camera itself can flip the image 180.<br/><br/>Now to power.  This is a real problem with Arlo Ultra 2 cameras.  Using all of the good features of the camera uses a good bit of power.  If the camera is placed in an area with periodic movement, the camera can drain the battery in a matter of days.  The Arlo solar panel solutions are 2w chargers.  Tests in an area of low activity turned out okay and the battery recharged to 100% with some shade each day.  Once in a place with higher activity and little shade for the bulk of the day, the battery loses 10% to 20% each day.  This camera replaced a Ring Spotlight cam with their 4w solar panel.  It recharged every day to 100% even on rainy days.  Why Arlo doesn't make a solar panel to meet the needs of their camera under heavy use is a mystery.<br/><br/>Now, to hardwiring.  The Ultra 2 uses a proprietary magnetic connector for the power.  It is kind of a nifty gadget, but poses a problem for camera placement in remote places.  They sell a 25 foot charging cord with the plug end designed with the assumption that you have an outlet handy.  I am okay with the cord length since they are probably managing voltage drop.  Unfortunately, one size fits all doesn't always cut it.  Options for a straight plug or angle plug would be helpful in varying outside situations.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that the camera is great if you want to put it on a shelf in your den.  Use as an outside property surveillance camera is a real challenge.  Why build the best camera if you don't provide the accessories to use it to full potential.<br/><br/>PS watch out for the subscription charges.  Use of full camera capability can get pricey fast.</span>

<span>*(This was written by my husband, Chris)<br/>My Feb 2022 review of the Arlo Ultra 2 Wireless Security Camera (and comparison to Arlo 1).<br/>This diatribe is worth reading before you buy.<br/><br/>Purchased the Arlo 1 back in 2013 and now own the Arlo Ultra 2.  The 10 SECOND SUMMARY: Overall, the performance of the Arlo 1 camera is good, but not great; the Arlo Ultra 2 could be the best quality camera system currently on the market; Arlo desperately needs to correct their customer service.<br/><br/>Arlo 1:  The video quality is a little grainy and colors get washed out easily. Also noticed a lag when activating the live view (ranged from 10-30 seconds). Proximity didn’t seem to be the issue, as the camera was close enough to the router. Even so, I loved the free 7 days of cloud storage (huge value add)ed.<br/>Cameras in the system are now failing one-by-one but served a life expectancy apparently beyond their years – of five purchased, three remain functional after about 8 years.<br/><br/>Out with the old and on to the new:<br/><br/>Arlo Ultra 2:  After reviewing Blink, Nest, SimpliSafe and many others, my conclusion is that the Arlo Ultra 2 with 4k video could be the best quality camera system on the market.<br/><br/>The good:  Best resolution night and day I have seen.  New features such as spotlight, siren, package alerts, etc. set a new bar in the camera systems of tomorrow.<br/><br/>With cloud storage, emergency response, vehicle, animal, and package detection you may have found the way ahead for your family.  This comes at a cost and quite frankly if your budget supports this business model, you should buy it – again, only if you are not weak-hearted in the installation process.<br/><br/>The bad:  No ability to transfer data to a thumb drive. To be fair, it does have a mini-SD card slot that reads 2 terabytes of storage as that is what I installed; no local storage SD card provided in any sales package combo I could find.<br/><br/>The claim is the battery expectancy is up to six months depending on traffic.  So far after installation, the life of the batteries is 30 days at best, some only 30 minutes (return these).  I noticed this early in installation and opted to hard-wire the system – it is likely the great resolution that drains batteries so quickly – doesn’t matter, does not perform as indicated, hard-wire this system or return it as I almost did.<br/><br/>Their little 8 foot Arlo cable is not long enough for solar panels / electrical outlets in my home – Wasserstein (a company that produces after-market accessories specifically for Arlo products) https://wasserstein-home.com/collections/arlo-ultra was able to supply 25 foot cables and I also purchased USB extenders online, making it 35 feet should you need this – they worked for me.<br/><br/>Battery life:  Arlo chat experts have suggested the resolution be changed to save battery life – I wanted the 4K with no compromise (hard wire is the answer) - for the price, it should work as advertised with no modifications.<br/><br/>When syncing the base station to the cameras, it relates the connection is poor even when 3 feet away – doesn’t seem to matter as they did sync and are performing – again, this system is not for the weak-hearted.<br/><br/>A WIFI extender was not necessary in my case as a 2000 sf, 2 story home was easily covered despite the base station providing a false poor connection reading during the synch process.<br/><br/>Customer Service:  The new business plan for Arlo is in many ways its only downfall.  This camera system with all its abilities is not for the weak-hearted when it comes to installation and customer support and many of the upgrades require a monthly plan even if you choose local storage.<br/><br/>Arlo’s customer service is apparently so poor that other websites are now charging for answers to client questions.  An Arlo troubleshooter, in my experience, just can’t be reached by phone (oddly, there are phone numbers available for other countries).  Even when you find a number to speak with a human, it directs you to a chat where they redirect you to an “Expert” on chat.  Arlo Support: https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/, good luck!<br/><br/>After two and a half hours on a chat, their only answer was to reinstall the base station on down to the cameras.  If you need an expert in the end, return this camera system; sadly, it’s not for you.<br/><br/>Despite my ridiculous, inadequate customer support experience, I persevered (no thanks to the Arlo support team) and prevailed installing 5 cameras on my home.<br/><br/>Moving forward:  3 of my 5 original Arlo 1 cameras still function in 720p and will be used in windows as a deterrent even they eventually fail.  This camera system, along with a SimpliSafe alarm system (much easier to install), a hard-wired Ring doorbell, and locking metal storm doors on the house pretty much ensure my home is the little Ft. Knox I want it to be.<br/><br/>I failed to mention that where others will put their security company signs in the yard, I have signs that say protected by Smith &amp; Wesson since 1852.<br/>Thanks for taking the time to read this dissertation and stay safe.</span>

<span>Given the explosion of wireless cameras recently in the market, I wanted to purchase a premium product to test out.  This had my hopes up pretty high until I tested it out the last 3 months in an outdoor setting with some nighttime traffic.  Base station indoors.  Two cameras outdoors (25ft and 50ft distance to station).<br/><br/>A few positive things to note -<br/>- Easy set up<br/>- Clean user interface<br/>- Crisp daytime 4k video<br/>- Camera firmware and updates are automatic and managed seemlessly by Arlo<br/>- The AI categorization algorithm is pretty good<br/>- Probably the best wireless 4k stuff on the market today<br/><br/>Real challenges that need to be addressed that introduce a lot of maintenance and friction:<br/>- Stock battery life is pretty terrible.  I have to charge these up every 10 days, even though I only use them for nighttime purposes in a medium traffic parking area.  And you can forget any type of real distance between the camera and the base station, it kills the battery.  Arlo could have packed a bigger battery into the box for the price being paid, but really cheaped out here.  Instead they want you to buy a bigger battery separately.  That's bad product strategy.  If you want to be the best WIRELESS camera, it starts with the battery life.  It's already one of the most expensive cameras on the market... why would you cut costs here?<br/>- Charging is absurdly slow, and the battery indicator is terribly inaccurate and a guestimate at best.  It takes 8 hours or more to bring a camera up to full charge by cable... again... I ask why for such a small battery?  Cellphones with bigger batteries charge in two hours or less.  Yes, you can buy a separate charging station, take down the camera, pull the battery out and charge the battery in a station... but again why? This is wireless device... battery life and power management are foundational to product success... how did you mess this up Arlo?  The cellphone industry already figured this out for you.<br/>- These are IoT cameras that connect to Arlo's own servers through the smarthub that acts as a gateway.  They cannot be directly connected to on your local intranet.  Everything goes through Arlo's servers and cannot be operated without passing data over the internet.  The only way to access any manage the cameras is over their website.  And you MUST have a good internet connection.  Even the local storage in the smarthub must be accessed through the internet, or the SD card pulled and put directly into your computer.  Arlo claims this is for security reasons, but I'm not 100% sold on this approach.  The smarthub is just a locked down wifi router...  There should be better ways to do this without requiring data to go through Arlo servers.<br/>- Motion detection is good, but more problematic, the video often cuts short of activity actually occurring<br/>- If you are expecting to capture license plates with this... not happening unless it's pointed right at the car 10 ft away max.  I believe this is because of the 180 degree ultra-wide lens on a 4k sensor.  Effectively, expect the same clarity of video as a 2k 130 degree camera that just covers a lot more area.<br/>- The video CODEC used to record and store videos is proprietary, which is completely unnecessary given the widely available, open source, and free codecs that are well known and used throughout the industry.  You must purchase the video coded separately for Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, and it doesn't even work with Mozilla Firefox.  This also means you can't share videos with others unless they buy the codec as well.<br/>- The wireless connection is still WiFi protocol and susceptible to basic WiFi jamming and interference.  It really needs a different secure wireless method.  (To be fair, there are not a lot of alternative wireless methods in the industry yet.  Just know it's ultimately a WiFi camera.)<br/>- Subscription is pretty much a requirement for functionality to be worth anything.  Though, the price point is such that if you are forking out money for this camera, the subscription price shouldn't be your biggest concern.<br/><br/>All that said, this tech is far better than what was on the market just 3 years ago.  Given Arlo's apparent strategy, they are making it work and proving to be innovative.  I hope Arlo rethinks it's product strategy and continues to improve it's products and innovate, otherwise it's going to get killed by emerging competition with better technology and friction-less features.</span>

<span>Have only had my 2 camera Ultra 2 setup active for a little over a week. Very impressed so far by camera quality and connectivity.  Camera setup, image quality, motion detection, and connection range are all excellent.  Given the cost of this camera setup, you'd expect them to be good and they are.  I have not owned any prior Arlo cameras, so I have no way to compare these Ultra 2's to the Pro or Essential models, but compared to other brands I've tried, these are significantly better across the board.  Note that I can't comment on battery life other than to say that after a week, my most distant camera is still at 96% charge.<br/><br/>App works well, too, on mobile phone though a little clunky.  Delay between trigger and notifications is a bit longer than I'd like (~5-7 seconds), but it's not bad.  I am having a minor problem with IFTTT cross-triggering, but I am confident that can be worked out.<br/><br/>I've deducted a star for a combination of minor quibbles.<br/><br/>First, the Arlo website is flashy but not particularly helpful.  I've looked through it for an answer and real troubleshooting techniques for my triggering problem, but though there is info there, it's not complete.<br/><br/>Second, Two Factor Authorization (2FA) on PC is rather painful as EVERY time you log in on a computer you have to go through the authorization process.  This is not OS or browser specific.  If you own a PC/Mac, you are going to have to keep your mobile device handy so you can sign in on your PC.  This is a known issue and Arlo says they are working on it, but I use 2FA on every other brand that supports it and this is the worst implementation I've ever seen.  Note that the 2FA comments apply to Arlo across the board, not just the Ultra 2's.<br/><br/>Third, given the price of this kit, would it be too much to ask to include 2 sets of each mount type?  Including one magnetic mount and one threaded mount is adequate, but come on.  I'd like to also see either a battery charger or at least two charging cables.  The mounts and charge cable/brick included is enough, but these are at the very top of the Arlo range and north of $500, they could be a little more generous.<br/><br/>Fourth, there is no SmartThings integration on the Ultra/Ultra 2's (there is on some other Arlo models).  We are a Samsung house and find SmartThings works extremely well with all of our connected devices.  I hope Arlo/SmartThings can get together on this at some point.<br/><br/>Fifth is my only hardware related comment.  With 180 degrees of diagonal view, these cameras show a huge area and at 4k you can zoom in 8x with clarity and with little fish-eye even at the corners.  However, the compromise for all this clear and wide view is that only the bottom 2/3 of the camera's view detects activity.  If you planned to mount these cameras very high looking down, just be aware that the upper 1/3 of what the camera sees will not detect activity.  My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from the ground and this is not a problem at all.  In fact, on the camera facing the street I have had to lower the detection area because passing cars were being detected.  I only mention this limitation for those wanting the entire camera view to be part of the activity zone.<br/><br/>Finally, I did my homework on the plans offered by Arlo, the phasing out of the 1 year of free service offered in previous models (in favor of 3 months), and the elimination of the 7 days of free recording access, so I knew what I was buying.  I could have gone with the original Ultras and gotten the one year free but chose the 2's because of the 5ghz connectivity.  However, just because I knew and accepted what I was buying, it doesn't mean that I'm altogether happy with the choices.  My frustration with the plans isn't simply about cost.  I'm more frustrated with how confusing the choices are; which plans can you use with the Ultra 2's, how can they be mixed and matched, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, can't helped but be impressed with the quality of the Arlo Ultra 2's.  They are, so far, fantastic.  I've spent more words complaining about small issues than raving about the cameras.  The hardware is a solid 5 star rating and setup could not have been easier.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that if you are looking for high quality hardware and don't want to take a chance on something cheaper, then these are great.  Just do your homework regarding the cost/quality tradeoff and the plan offerings from Arlo.</span>

<span>Exactly one year ago from today I purchased this camera. Fantastic video quality and a very bright spotlight. Unfortunately the camera started having issues saying "Temperature low" error even though it's been 75-90f all summer. Finally tried charging it, resyncing, reseating the battery numerous times. Noticed while investigating that droplets of waters had gotten inside. We have had record breaking rains in our area and think it managed to find it's way in the camera.<br/><br/>Overall the camera is great, just not as water resistant for torrential downpours.</span>

Unless you want to archive a lot of video or make use of the other features offered, there's no need to subscribe to the cloud service.</span>

<span>I love these cameras, I have 2 of them. I noticed one was working, but I bought 2 more during the Prime sale. After I checked one of the installed cameras, it was offline, and was unable to get it back online. I deleted it and removed my subscription. Tried to add it back, the camera won’t read the barcode. I can feel it clicking and see a light. I installed the 2 new cameras. I contacted Zmodo customer support, they fixed it remotely in 5 minutes. I didn’t even have to do anything. All 4 camera’s are up, and I am happy.</span>
