<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The Adonit Photogrip looks to be well designed and sturdy. Holds an iPhone 7 plus firmly (maybe a little to firmly for some). The grip feels comfortable &amp; the shutter remote is in a convenient location to snap pictures without fishing around for the buttons on the phone or screen; makes for steady one hand shooting. Like that it has the threaded mount for attaching to a tripod although the little tripod that comes with it seems to be of limited use unless you have a table or such at just the right hight. Have not really had much opportunity to use the Photogrip yet but will put it use on an upcoming long trip. Review may change after that.</span>

<span>This unit is very comfortable and easy to install and remove as needed. This provides exceptional stability when used for video.  I especially like the built in, removable remote camera trigger.  I also found that I like to use the tri-pod attachment to hold the phone when using email and texting or reading news or articles.  I like to keep my various accessory parts all together so having the storage bag was a nice feature.  I liked this so well I bought another one for my brother-in-law as he uses his phone often for photos and videos.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>So much better than the previous version that I returned. It doesn't give out an astonishing "Clack sound" at all. It is convenient for higher quality cell phone photography. It is still fairly heavy. However, I expect that will improve as well. It may be a challenge for the new larger phones. It has a bonus in the form of a small removable push-button for such as tripod group shots. Cool as they used to say. I recommend a piece of artist's tape to secure it further on the device. It is heavy but I find that I carry the accessory attached everywhere. Great improvement and useful indeed. You can revoke my comments about the earlier version. This is very good indeed.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I shoot a lot of video for work but on my own, I like using my smartphone; less stuff, lighter carry, less risk of equipment theft. I got this grip to able to take more stable pics and overall it works fine.<br/>I have a OnePlus 7 Pro in a case, and the grip can handle it... just barely. The BT shutter works fine and the included tripod works well as a mini handle/support.<br/>I wish there was a hook or slot to use the included neckband with the grip itself. This would make an additional safety line if you accidentally dropped the grip+phone.</span>

<span>I bought this to use when I was either charging or it was too hot outside to use the Adonit qi charging grip but after a month it stopped connecting to my iPhone 11 and it would constantly disconnect.  I would have to go into Bluetooth settings to re-pair the device.</span>

<span>This is my second Adonis Photogrip. I have the all black version I used on an old phone. I liked the first one so much I got one for my new current phone in the yellow. This is literally the single best accessory you can buy if you are into mobile phone photography. It provides a much more comfortable, stable grip when taking pictures in landscape. The Bluetooth shutter button makes it feel like a real point and shoot. This little gadget transforms your smartphone into a point and shoot camera. Worth every penny!</span>

<span>I was a little concerned about a product that barely has any reviews at all. I prefer to buy something that's already been trialed but I'm happy that I went for it. The shutter button works just as described and with this it becomes such a comfortable way to take photos with your phone. The selfie stick extends a good amount, and retracts to a very small footprint.<br/><br/>The selfie stick part is nice, but the grip / bluetooth shutter design for a smartphone in this style makes it an incredibly desirable product. Held my S20 Ultra with its Otterbox Case very snuggly, never felt that it might slip off. I am absolutely recommending this one to everyone that loves taking pictures with their phones.</span>

<span>I kind of wish that the Bluetooth remote button could charge. When I got mine the battery in the Bluetooth remote was dead. I pulled the plastic tab out to allow the battery to contact the metal contact point. I held the button and nothing, pressed it and nothing. Put a new battery in it and it worked fine. Also the forward and backward swivel point is very loose. Like my phone would not stay in the spot i set it to. Other than that great product.</span>

<span>I used the Smooth 4 with my iPhone 11 Pro Max. Like others have said, the Smooth 4 will NOT balance the phone (at least one this large) with the case on. Without the case, however, it does fine.<br/><br/>I’m comparing this gimbal to the Smooth Q2 and DJI OSMO 3. The Smooth Q2 has more shooting modes, a joystick button, is super compact, and has a metal and silicone build. The OSMO 3 has more flash out of the box. It’s hardware and software is much more intuitive so you feel as though it works better. There is a learning curve to both the Q2 and Smooth 4 which can be frustrating. Downside of the OSMO 3 is cant hold as much weight (is really designed for small phones, though my phone did work okay in it) and it has an all plastic build. The Smooth 4 is a different beast altogether with more advanced features and its (obvious) larger (but still plastic) build. The controls are nice and give a more professional feel to the iPhone for video purposes. Unfortunately,  many of its buttons (even its zoom/focus wheel) only work with the Zhiyun Play app and I believe the Filmic Pro app (which costs $15). The Zhiyun app isn’t great - there’s no quick option through the app, it’s not very intuitive, and it has a lot of bugs. DJI’s app is far superior.<br/><br/>As for the Smooth 4 itself, I found that it definitely earns the title of “Smooth” it does a fantastic job stabilizing the phone while moving around. It would have been nice for them to add a joystick to assist in panning, but I didn’t miss it as much as I thought I would. This is a gimbal I would use for movement-heavy videos. If you just want to throw it on a tripod, it’d be a waste.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I went with the Smooth Q2 because of its far better build quality, more compact size, joystick, and simplified controls that more seamlessly work with native camera apps. The Smooth 4 is a great gimbal, just wasn’t what I needed.</span>

<span>This is my second one. The first I turned it on without calibrating it and it flipped out. The zoom wheel popped off and I couldn't get it back on. The second time I calibrated it first and it is fine. Regardless of me calibrating it first or not, it shouldn't have fallen apart. Anyway, this does a good job as it is. I've not used it as I bought it to take on a trip and it broke right before I left. So right now, I haven't had a reason to use it. I may update this review later. For better or worse.</span>

<span>So far first impressions are great. Easy to setup and does a good job stabilizing. I do pro video for a living with larger setups on the Ronin RS2 and Sony Alpha cameras so I did a lot of research before picking up an Osmo. Here is my verdict:<br/><br/>I use an iPhone 13 Pro and picked up a couple Moment lenses along with their 67mm filter adapter to utilize a small VND filter with the lenses. All together I’m loading the phone, case, lens, adapter, filter, and counterweights. Needless to say weight capacity was very important for me.. and that’s one of the two big reasons I picked up the OM4 SE over the OM5.<br/><br/>According to DJI, the OM4 SE is said to handle 290g while the OM5 handles 230g. My guess is the OM5 had to make some payload compromises to support the smaller deign and extender pole.<br/><br/>A second big difference is battery life between the two. The OM4 SE (in perfect conditions) is said to last up to 15 hours. The OM5 tops out at 6.5 hours. 6.5 hours is still a great length of time all things considered but if you’re like me and plan to use these mostly on the go while traveling I like having the longer battery life. I can go on all day adventures hiking or whatever where recharging options are very limited and not have to worry about the gimbal dying.<br/><br/>Obviously everyone’s setups, needs, and uses are different, but if you’re like me and plan to mount additional smartphone accessories or travel a lot with your phone gimbal then I would definitely recommend the OM4 SE over the OM5.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing: the OM4 SE is $60 cheaper 🤷🏽‍♂️ Put that extra $60 towards a cheap smartphone lens or VND filter/adapter<br/><br/>Cheers 🤙🏽</span>

<span>This is my first gimbal, so I don't have anything to compare it to. Seems good in the hand and works well with my Galaxy S22. My only complaint is the magnetic clip. I have seen others complain about this same issue. This is the version 2 clip and it's still not perfect. I am not using my phone without a case and I use an Otterbox. The opening width is not the issue, it's the shallow arms that grab the phone. It hugs the phone nicely without the case, but easily slides out with the case. As you can see in the photos, I borrowed my daughter's hair tie to go around the phone. I feel much better with this simple fix.</span>

<span>Sometimes, for my cooking channel, I need a close-up of plated food. And this little tripod is much more versatile than using a full-size tripod.</span>

<span>We purchased the UBeesize Tri because it seemed like a perfect portable tripod for us to use on our hikes, and we so far have been proven right.  Not only is is light weight and fits nicely into my back pack, but it is easy to set up.  The remote feature has been especially nice since we now are able to take selfies and group photos with out having to use a timer.</span>

<span>I love it. I used it by wrapping the legs of UBeesize around my balcony attached my iPhone and took the sunrise in time lapse. It worked very well.</span>

<span>I was surprised at how well this grips my phone, and how easy it is to mold the legs to what position you need it. I've used it a ton taking pictures of camping and hiking trips.</span>

<span>I needed a device I could use as both a tripod and a gimbal to make some product videos without help from a cameraman, and this fit the bill perfectly. It allowed me to use my Motorola phone as my camera and switch from closeup shots moving around the products to static positioned distance shots easily, which made my editing tasks much, much easier (I'm not a good editor, so getting things in one shot, one take is my general goal).<br/><br/>The drawback to using DJI is that their software is side loaded. That always introduces security concerns. It would be nice if we could get a way to get compatible working software into the Play store. It is simple to use, powerful and does just work. You can do a lot of really nice things with pan, zoom, rotate and overall control. The phone is easy to get balanced in the holder, which is designed to accommodate a super wide variety of phones.<br/><br/>Outside the software, I couldn't find any real negatives with this little device. It did exactly what I needed it to do as simply as I think it could, which kept my learning curve exceptionally flat. I think I spent 5 minutes figuring it out, if that. I don't think you could ask for a better device for making really good videos from a phone.</span>

<span>For me, this thing is hard to use. I’m still hoping I end up liking it, but it’s not intuitive for me. There are times the “up” button decides that means “down” and vice-versa. Same for left and right. It’ll decide that it doesn’t want to track as I’m filming, too. I wouldn’t buy it again, at this point.</span>

<span>Bought this for my nephew for him to take videos of the live edge tables that he builds.  He was over the moon excited. Within 10 minutes he had it all figured out and delighted us all the rest of day by taking action videos of everything we did.  I’m the best aunt ever.</span>

<span>To start I’d like to say I am a veteran videography and photographer. I’ve used large gimbals with full frame camera and small Gimbals line this. I think a lot of the bad reviews are from user error and lack of knowledge. I suggest reading the instructions and watch some tutorial videos to learn when you get new gear. There is most likely a simple fix or oversight your not seeing. Regarding this gimbal I have both the OM4 and OM5. I got the 5 because of the extension rod and I really like for low shots after a few days of use.  I will agree with others that both the OM4 and OM5 stress to carry the weight of the iPhone 12 and 13 pro max. I use tested the 11 and 12 pro and had no issues. The max I would get some vibration which is disappointing. Please realize the just little weight difference is a big deal on this little gimbal. Remove your case and any attachments on your phone. Less weight the gimbal has to work with the better. Also make sure to balance the phone on the gimbal before turning it on. Hold the motor that goes up and down and then balance the phone so it does not drop to the left or right and stays level on its own. That the only adjustment you can make on this simple gimbal and it’s very important. I believe a lot of people complaining of vibration are not doing this. It’s really easy to want just put on the back plate and stick it to the gimbal and power on but balancing is important step. I blame dji marketing a little as the promo vid shows someone just slapping it on randomly to the phone and sticking to gimbal. You can do this one you balance it once and then remember where to place the mount on your phone each time but the first time make sure to figure out where that spot is and you will prevent a lot of head ache.<br/><br/>Another point to bring up is to learn the modes and buttons. Figuring out the features and limits of each mode will help a lot. These gimbals are turn key and can get great content right out of the box but the difference between good and great content is practicing a little bit and getting to know your gimbal. Little things like proper settings, smooth body movement and shot planning can really help. Have patience and learn the tool.<br/><br/>I rarely leave reviews but wanted give my two cents on this one as I’m quite experienced with gimbals and think some users are giving bad reviews that aren’t accurate because of lack of knowledge and experience and may turn off some buyers that could really benefit from this awesome product. It’s amazing that this product is under $200 and paired with a new iPhone 13 pro it can create the quality of content that would have taken 10k + of equipment to produce 10 years ago. Amazing what we have access to these days. In one small backpack I have this gimbal, a mavic air 2 and misc filters and I shoot amazing pro quality content. Dji has made that all possible. I’m not affiliate or paid by them. I just really appreciate their gear and think they do in excellent job.<br/><br/>I’ll try to find the time to do a tutorial on it and show some of my work in the future. OM5 is an exciting release :)</span>
