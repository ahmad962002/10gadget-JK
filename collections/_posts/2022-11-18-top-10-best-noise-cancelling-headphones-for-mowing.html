<span>These headphones are comfortable and work great to listen to tunes or take a phone call while working.<br/>I use them mostly when mowing and while they don't cancel out the mower noise as much as my standard earmuffs, I just turn the music up and it ends up fine. I would recommend these headphones to anyone who will be doing a lot of work that requires hearing protection but who also wants to listen to music to not get bored.</span>

<span>I decided to wait a couple years to write my review for this product. This is the third summer that I am using these 3M work tunes Bluetooth headphones. I have had absolutely zero problems with battery life or charging. I didn't expect much for $50 when I purchased them. I am actually surprised they are still working on the 3rd summer of use. I do some mowing on the side and I use these while on the mower which is about 6 hours a week. The headphones will hold up a charge enough for me to get my 6 hours of mowing done. They're extremely comfortable and they seem pretty durable. If I had to say a couple things I didn't like, I would say one thing is the microphone is not the best. If somebody calls me I can hear them clear as day while I'm on the mower but I have to shut the mower off for them to hear me which is pretty expected. The other thing is that there's no volume control for these other than your Bluetooth device. You can turn the volume to maximum on your Bluetooth device and if it reaches the decibel rating for these headphones it will not go above that. I've noticed when I hop on the mower and turn them on the music will start very loud and then the volume will come down on its own to within acceptable limits for what the headphones are programmed at. They do seem a little quiet at first but with the noise canceling ability your ears adjust and open up so you get used to the volume level that these headphones put out. All in all I think it's absolutely worth $50 The only thing I would change is the charging port is micro HDMI and nowadays they should probably switch to USB-C if they haven't yet.</span>

<span>This is very much a "buy once, cry once" tool. I have a much older 3M work tunes that only has radio (not even aux) that has lasted since jesus wore sandals and has been beat around the block many times. My older worktunes works great, but i really wanted aux and bluetooth. so far, the new worktunes is just as bulletproof as my old one, only now i don't have to listen to 20 minutes of radio ads while i'm working.<br/><br/>as regular ear pro, they aren't the best in the world. i have remmington ear pro for shooting that are WAY better at blocking sound, but the worktunes are definitely good enough for OSHA work</span>

<span>Needed another pair of muffs for while I am running the log splitter. Usually use my Stihl, but hate having the face shield down on it unless I am cutting with the chainsaw. Having the face shield up, it kept falling forward wanting to come off. So, needed something else, and decided i want something I can listen to my music with as well.<br/><br/>I have a large head, the big Stihl earmuffs don't fit me well, they have to be rotated forward to fit. These fit amazingly! they are comfortable, they cut out most of the noise, and the speaker quality is pretty decent. Now, you won't get studio quality out of these, but it is enough to let you have something else to listen to other then some loud motor or what ever you are doing.<br/><br/>Not enough time to tell how long battery will last.<br/><br/>pros:<br/>Comfortable, fits large heads, decent sound<br/><br/>cons:<br/>Only con I have found so far, is the cushion part, while being vary comfortable, likes to collect moisture. Take it off and it just gleams with sweat. Drys off quickly, but looks like you just pulled it out of the water when you take it off.<br/><br/>worth the investment!</span>

<span>I wanted a pair of rated ear muff-style hearing protection at work that would accommodate my glasses, and I also liked the idea of bring able to listen to some (quiet!) music while I went about my business. This pair fits both desires and is 100% worth the cost.<br/><br/>Getting them paired the first time is a little tricky, so make sure to read the directions a few times. The gel ear pads fit over my glasses well and don't hurt my face right away, which is nice. There is plenty of give in the head band for even the biggest of heads. They can get a little sweaty (because, you know, gel), so you'll want to be extra diligent about cleaning them right away at the end of the day, but otherwise I haven't seen the need to do much different than I would any other ear muff. The noise reduction is excellent, as to be expected from 3M safety gear.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend getting a case to store them in; I found one on Amazon that fits perfectly and keeps the gunk in my bag or car off the ear pads, but I'm sure there are lots of options out there.</span>

<span>Hi, I'm on the Spectrum. There are times when loud noises become unbearable. I own the latest Sony and Bose noise cancelling headphones as well as AirPods Pro, and sometimes just noise cancelling isn't enough. All the neurotypical articles I read on the net said sound isolation wasn't possible, blah blah. So I combined these with a pair of Decibullz - Custom Molded Earplugs, 31dB Highest NRR which I also purchased on Amazon. It's not total silence, but far closer to quiet than just plain noise cancelling can achieve. So if you're also spectrumy and wondering if these work well - yes they do.</span>

<span>This hearing protection is a fantastic product and one that I use 5 days a week at work. As a long time user, owning multiple pairs, and comparing with other similar products, this hearing protection is is great, but far from perfect. Though the pros easily outweigh the cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- for starters, thank you 3M for the improvements to the cable gasket by the ear piece! This improvement keeps the cable from breaking (like my previous pair)<br/><br/>- The gel version is much more comfortable (tolerable) than the foam version<br/><br/>- They do block out a substantial amount of noise<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- Speakers can use an upgrade (possibly louder?)<br/>- Head strap band starts breaking apart over consistent usage. The plastic band detaches from the metal after some time<br/>- Bluetooth range is quite poor (phone in pocket disconnects<br/>- Sounds bleeds in through microphone when a phone call is coming in<br/><br/>Improvements<br/>- would be nice if port was USB C instead of the older Micro USB predecessor<br/>- would be nice if there was a microphone on/off toggle or maybe a push to talk option like the 3M Peltors have or even a detachable external microphone like gaming headphones have. Like mentioned above, external loud noise bleeds in through microphone when a phone call is coming in, and I don’t really use these with phone calls. Too much noise. In the mean time, I put tape over the microphone port to prevent noise bleed in the case a call comes in.<br/>- improve the head band support to the metal frame. Those little snaps break over time.<br/>- better water resistance would be nice.<br/>- since the is a microphone, would be nice to see a noise canceling improvement<br/><br/>Overall, these are great! But yea, like mentioned above, they can use improvements.</span>

<span>I do like these Bluetooth ear-protection headsets, but the price seems a bit high for what you get.<br/><br/>--- HEARING PROTECTION: 7/10 ---<br/>These do an excellent job at reducing external noises to a safe level. I've been around various loud machines and they very comfortably dampen the decibel levels so you can be around lawn mowers, trimmers, blowers, edgers, pressure washers, etc. That said, being ON a machine is a bit of a different story. While riding a lawn mower, it seems to amplify the low vibrating tones the mower and blades produces. It's a quite odd thing to explain, but another reviewer mentioned this as well and it's 100% spot-on. It amplifies these low-tones so much so that the Bluetooth audio can be difficult to hear at times at max volume. The best way to explain it is like plugging your ears with your fingers and humming deeply as loud as you can.<br/><br/>That said, I honestly don't know if this is a design flaw or a physics trait. As I've tried other regular hearing protection and it does the same thing. The only time this does not happen is if I use Bluetooth earbuds that plug the ears (ironically).<br/><br/>--- BLUETOOTH:  7/10 ---<br/>Battery life is excellent. From a full-charge, I've used the Bluetooth for 10 hours and it's still at medium levels. Each time you turn the Bluetooth on, it will tell you the battery level by saying "low/medium/high". That is really the only thing 3M got right. The range is somewhat lacking however. I was losing connection at only 15 feet away from my phone - when compared to cheap $15 Bluetooth ear-buds I have that has a range closer to 50-60ft.<br/><br/>--- AUDIO QUALITY: 4/10 ---<br/>My biggest complaint is the volume levels (or lack their of) and the sound quality. At max-volume it can be very difficult to hear what you're listening to - especially when cutting grass when those low-toned noises are amplified. Otherwise, in other situations the volume level is fine. The only way to turn up the volume is through the device that's transmitting the Bluetooth. There's no volume control on the headset which is really unfortunate. There's been many times where the volume is so close to being where I want it, but I want it to be just a notch or two higher and easy to control. But neither is possible, since there's not controls on the headset.<br/><br/>In addition, the sound quality is really poor. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad; but at the price 3M is charging for these, it's sad when my $15 no-name brand ear buds sound substantially better than these. There is ZERO bass in these. I mean zero! Mind you, I don't listen to music when I wear them. However, just to test them out I listened to some music with bass to test them and it sounded horrible. So if you want these for podcasts they're pretty good. But if you want them for music while working, I wouldn't recommend them.<br/><br/>--- COMFORT: 6/10 ---<br/>The ear cups are really comfortable. I have no complaints there. However, the headsets are really heavy. Which means the majority of the weight distributes itself across the top of your head. Which then translates to head pain after wearing them for more than 1 hour. This will make you move them slightly so they're sitting on a different part of your head so relieve the pain which will give you another 30 mins or so before you find yourself adjusting it again. If 3M can't solve the weight issue, I think the headband should have better engineering behind it that offers more comfort on the head. That said, they are more comfortable (and convenient) than earbuds to me.<br/><br/>--- DURABILITY: 5/10 ---<br/>The build itself feels fine and solid. However, the USB charging port, while recessed into the plastic ear cup is completely exposed. There's not cap, rubber flips, or protection of any kind on it. Thus, it's completely exposed to water, dirt, dust, etc. while you're working. In addition, the wires that come from the ears are loose and exposed until they recede back into the headband. For a company that specializes in work equipment, you'd think they would've put some sort of rubber flip-cap on the charging port and designed the wires to be completely internal through the head-band, but they did neither. Thus, it's possible for the loose wires from the ear pieces (as shown in their pictures) to get caught on something (like a low hanging branch/twig from a tree) while riding a mower and damage it.<br/><br/>--- CONTROLS: 5/10 ---<br/>The only button on the headset is an on/off button, nothing else. On the one hand, I do like the simplicity of just having one button to turn on or off the headset for quick and ease of use. In the other hand, I find myself wishing they added a volume up/down and a track left/right so you can adjust the volume on-the-fly or go to the next song/video respectively without having to take your phone out of your pocket. Both of these features are found on virtually any Bluetooth headset and even earbuds, so it seems a bit cheap these features were skimped out on.<br/><br/>You can press this single button to pause and play your song/podcast, but that's it.<br/><br/>--- OVERALL: 5/10 ---<br/>Overall, they just an average hearing protection headset that just happens to have Bluetooth audio. Nothing more and nothing less. They do neither exceptionally well, but will do both just well-enough that you probably won't complain too much.<br/><br/>They are better than wearing ear-buds while working in my opinion for the ease of taking on and off and because they offer a more sanitary working listening device; but they're an expensive purchase that may or may not justify their cost for you.</span>

<span>3M WorkTunes Connect + AM/FM<br/><br/>Updated, see notes below.  AA batteries last four months and still going using FM radio!  Excellent hearing protection with radio!  I hate proprietary lithium battery packs along with the unique charging adapters.  AA batteries are cheap, and last adequate amount of time and more so then expected.<br/><br/>Better than listening to the lawnmower!  However, I still prefer to listen to the whine of my chainsaw versus Mozart!<br/><br/>PROS<br/>1) Sound quality appears adequate, especially while using a chainsaw or lawnmower.  (See CONS notes.)<br/><br/>2) Battery life so far seems adequate.  Used 2-3 times at lengthy intervals, still going, however mostly using FM/AM reception, without bluetooth.<br/><br/>3) AM/FM tuner and reception strength appears adequate.  (See CONS notes.)<br/><br/>4) Weight seems acceptable, no apparent neck problems yet.  Albeit, they'll likely hear from my lawyer first if the weight breaks my neck while listening to heavy metal music.<br/><br/>5) I've heard of complaints here about the volume dial not allowing louder volumes.  I think these complaints are pretty much false, unless my unit has been modified after the complaints, or there's something going on with the reception and sound pressure level amplification.  Seems adequate to me.  Any louder with the music and I might as well listen to the lawnmower or chainsaw further ruin my hearing!<br/><br/>Cons<br/>1) Audio quality.  Although adequate, could likely be much better!  For somebody or a company that cares about our hearing, should also care just as much about the sound quality of the noise we want to listen to!  (While using a chainsaw, I tend to also turn my garage 1000 watt stereo/radio on alongside using the headset with chainsaw... great to sing along while using a chainsaw or splitting wood!)<br/><br/>2) Slight learning curve for operating, requires at least 15-30 minutes, reading the manual's diagram and operating the buttons, in order to learn the work flow of the  button operations.<br/><br/>3) Initially, the voice prompts were clipped short and inaudible.  After reading the manual, or learning the manual's diagram, I now understand the voice prompts.  (Likely clipped short due to memory constraints and weight requirements.)<br/><br/>4) I strongly prefer radio FM or AM reception, rather than listening to prerecorded music, unless the media is an audio book or audio lecture.  Go figure, think it's due to randomness of songs and the large database of varying songs over FM radio or AM variety.  However, I'm in a rural area, requiring better tuners to pickup the more distant strong AM/FM broadcast stations.  I would judge the tuner on this headset adequate, only able receive your strongest local ~15 mile FM stations, and ~30-60 mile AM distant stations with barely audible AM quality sound.  FM sounds pretty good, while the chainsaw or lawnmower are running.  I think, either a better tuner or more antenna would be desirable.  On the flip, most manufacturers would have provided much weaker reception.  The quality is good, but can always be better.<br/><br/>5) During the Summer or within warm areas, the rubber padding does get wet and sweaty.  I think the 3M headset with gel cushions are going to get just as wet.  The only reason the gel cushions are not as hot &amp; sweaty, due to the likely weaker seal around the eardrum, and also reflected in the ~1db less protection rating. Fact of life when wearing headgear during Summer heat, it's going to get hot &amp; sweaty.<br/><br/>6) I keep bumping the darn tuning dial on the side, and might require a stiffer more durable large rotating dial?<br/><br/>7) The Bluetooth works, however I'm not a fan of Bluetooth devices.  The sound quality has always been lacking and the ease of use is not easy after so many years of existence.  I think 3M should continue with two separate devices, one headset for over the air reception of music, another for Bluetooth/cellular service.<br/><br/>2021.10.02 WOW! Original AA batteries last a very long time, using only the FM radio and not using Bluetooth, four months so far on the original Energizer AA batteries!  Thank God I didn't purchase one having the pain in the arse proprietary lithium battery!  I wish they doubled the length of the radio antenna, and included a tie down to your belt or arse.</span>

<span>Had the prior model and liked them, but after years of use the recharge plug broke and needed to replace. As noted in other reviews, these are battery vs. rechargeable and are slightly heavier, but I thought I’d take the chance. These do a better job of muffling outside sound so I don’t need to turn them up too high to hear clearly and they have better one button control than the priors. Not High end sound but great for my purposes of listening to audio books and music while mowing and using power tools. Have used for many hours now and batteries are still fine. One issue is that the pad on the head strap could use a little more padding; as after a few hours the top of my head can get sore if I’m not wearing a cap. I wear protective glasses with flat bows designed for headphones, that avoid letting sound in through the ear pads. Love the external microphones that automatically cancel loud outside noise. This can be easily muted as environment requires.</span>

<span>The transparent mode works great! I can easily hear people around me while still muffling machinery. I don't believe the mute ability does noise canceling but I can still hear my audio easily. One of two issues I have is when turning on the earmuffs, if you hold the power button a half second longer than required it will going into pairing mode for Bluetooth. The second issue is occasionally the volume will jump down to 30-40% but is easily fixable by adjusting the volume. Those two issues aside this is a great product and is certainly worth it over the standard 3M BT earmuffs.</span>

<span>These are not meant to be noise canceling headphones, these are ear protection muffs that have an added Bluetooth feature for convenience. Noise canceling earphones work by playing the sound waves captured by the mic in reverse so the sound gets canceled.<br/><br/>These earmuffs use sound isolation to reduce noise, this is pretty much just using materials that cover the ear to block sound naturally, plugging your ears with your fingers would be considered noise isolation. Noise isolation earmuffs or ear plugs have a noise blocking rating in "dB", this is just a measurement of noise. You can find charts online that describe what sounds your dB rating could block, these have 26dB.<br/><br/>Passive sound is just a feature that lets outside sounds captured by the mic to be played through the speakers. You still get the noise reduction from the ear cups physically blocking your ears but get normal levels of ambient sound playing through the speakers as if the outside noise was low. Taking calls works the same as the passive feature but you are just listening to a call instead of surrounding sounds.<br/><br/>The sound quality on these for music is good enough but this is just and added feature, if you are working somewhere where ear protection is required then you probably wont be listening to music anyways. The build of the earmuffs is pretty decent, the thing i dont like is the plastic pieces that connect the cups to the headband, to me they look like the weak point of the earmuffs.<br/><br/>VERY IMPORTANT-One thing that you should check after getting these is that the pads make a good seal. I had to replace the first pair I received because the left pad had an air leak. When you put these on they should feel like they apply pressure on your ears, when you push them towards the ear the pressure should feel the same. With my first pair, the left side had no pressure and felt as if it was not sealed correctly. I further confirmed this because the pads are removable, after switching sides on the pads, the lack of pressure followed the defective pad. The replacement I received has a perfect seal on both sides.<br/><br/>Overall the safety earmuffs work just fine, they have useful features like calls and passive sound, the passive sound instantly mutes itself temporarily with loud outside sounds. These do require AA batteries to use the Bluetooth and pass trough functions. Just make sure that the pads make a good seal right after opening them for the best possible ear protection.</span>

The X-Series earmuffs are 3M’s latest advancement in hearing conservation. New technologies in comfort, design and protection all come together in this groundbreaking earmuff line. The X1A is a lightweight, low-profile earmuff designed for protection against low-level industrial noise and other loud sounds. It features an electrically insulated wire headband, often referred to as “dielectric”. - The wire headband offers consistent pressure over prolonged wearing periods - Earcup pivot points tilt for optimum comfort and efficiency - Replaceable ear cushions and foam liners (hygiene kit HYX1) - Noise Reduction Rating (NRR)b 22 dB. CSA Class A NOTE: The X-Series (over-the-head) headband version is electrically insulated -sometimes referred to as ”dielectric”. The metal components of the headband have been covered by non-conductive material for use in a low voltage electrical hazard (less than 440 V ac). As there are no applicable standards for testing ear muffs against electrical insulating properties, the product has been evaluated at an external laboratory against a modified test method based on EN397:1995. During assessment, the leakage current did not exceed 1.2mA when the external surface of the product made contact with an electrical source. The user must determine the overall suitability of this product for the intended application taking into account any hazards other than noise for which this product is tested. *The NRR may overestimate the hearing protection provided during typical use. 3M recommends reducing the NRR by 50% for estimating the amount of noise reduction provided. Hearing Protection Solutions Made Innovatively Easy.

But, he also told me that small splinters will travel into my heart and kill me).<br/>The oval cut-out in each earpiece fits right over my ear without pressing hard against it. There is an appropriate amount of space in there.<br/>I'm not sure about people with very large ears. It's important that your ears are completely sealed off. So if you happen to be a huge person, I might hesitate.<br/><br/>It's also important that other things and accessories don't get in the way too much. Without the seal fitting snug around your ears, the noise protection level will be compromised. And it makes a big difference in its ability to block out extra noise.<br/>You have to wear glasses that are flat on the sides, and that lay flush against your head. Otherwise, the glasses won't fit well, and it will also allow sound to leak into the earmuffs.<br/>From what i've seen, there are really thin and lightweight plastic eye protectors that seem appropriate, for those who need them.<br/><br/>I've been really excited and impressed by the excellent comfort and sturdiness (and neon yellow-green color).<br/>The design is impeccable, although I'm disappointed that I can't wear them around my neck like regular headphones. They're too big for that.<br/>Yet the earpieces are pretty slim in width, in comparison to other earmuffs, and I can deal with wearing these in public without feeling too self-conscious.<br/><br/>Today, I brought the earmuffs to my doctor's office. Since they don't fold up in any way, they took up my whole medium-sized purse. I had to substitute my regular wallet for a tiny zippered pouch.<br/>I'm wondering about maybe attaching some sort of metal clip to the headpiece, so they can be worn on my hip. Just a brief idea....we'll see.<br/>Anyway, I was sooo thankful I brought the earmuffs to the doctor's waiting room.<br/>There is a ridiculously loud big-screen tv that really bothers my sensitive hearing. I've complained about it, and even the receptionists have no idea how to adjust the volume on it. There is no volume button! It's controlled some other way.<br/>So i happily put these earmuffs on my head, congratulating myself for thinking ahead..<br/>But I immediately found that I could still hear almost every single word from the people speaking on the TV. Their voices were still too loud.<br/>In fact, in the beginning, I thought their voices were booming even louder when i put the earmuffs on. It gave the voices some tunnel effect.<br/><br/>Yesterday, there were noisy truck sounds outside my window, early in the day. I put the earmuffs on, and they did help for the most part. But not totally.<br/>After a bit, I heard a little whine from outside my bedroom door from my pomeranian son.<br/>I was a little surprised that I was able to hear it across the room, through the door. He didn't even have to bark.<br/><br/>So although I'd thought I found the perfect solution for blocking out most noise, it's not exactly awesome.<br/> If someone speaks in a low, quiet tone next to me, it sounds too muffled to make out. But other noises are still loud. I can hear bass sounds well.<br/><br/>So I'm a bit disappointed. There is no way I could go to a noisy bar with a band or DJ playing, for example. I don't trust the earmuffs enough for that purpose.<br/>These 3M earmuffs ARE made of good quality. But I'm realizing that I'll definitely have to sacrifice style in order to be able to block noise more efficiently.<br/>These neon yellow-green and black earmuffs DO look kinda fly. They do. But I wish there were more colors and options available. I wish higher, more efficient noise protecting earmuffs didn't have to be so huge. Hopefully we will head in that direction in the next few years.<br/><br/>It would drive me crazy to be anywhere near construction... even with these snug on my ears. So it's really up to you, and the level of noise protection you require.<br/>Since I have a hearing sensitivity, certain repetitive and loud noises bother and hurt me. But for you, it may just block out enough noise so that your hearing will continue to be protected.<br/><br/>Either way, there is no doubt. These 3M Peltor X-Series earmuffs, 27db, are made with a lot of care and attention to detail. Its high quality and comfort level are unmatched.<br/>If you need lots of hearing protection, get a db34 or up. I have a more efficient pair already from this company.<br/>Works well, and I look just like Princess Leia. Except with a larger bun on each side.<br/>So does that mean guys find me sexy? Like the real character?<br/>No. No it doesn't.</span>

<span>I've had the X5A ear muffs for a year and a half, but almost didn't buy them at all because the specs in the Amazon description and on 3m's website were different. The Amazon descriptions say they provide up to 31dB of attenuation, and 3m's description says it offers up to 37dB of attenuation. I don't think I have the box anymore, but I believe it confirmed 37dB of attenuation. Unfortunately without a second set of ear muffs that claim 37dB of attenuation, there's no way I could confirm. Enter the https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ASSNR1M/ ear muffs that currently cost $10 less.<br/><br/>Quality is where 3M wins by a landslide. The cups have thicker and deeper walls with a high quality finish with rubbery overmolding.  As a machinist, the quality difference between the 3M and SilentSound cups is huge. The additional quality in the 3M X5A cups costs a lot more to produce than the SilentSound ear muffs. The ear seals/pads also have a hard plastic ring that snaps into the ear cups, which again is a sign of quality manufacturing. The padded headband on the SilentSound ear muffs looks nice in pictures, but looks and feels very cheap in person. The X5A has a dense rubbery foam inside that I think is closed cell EVA, where the SilentSound has softer less dense grey open cell foam and an additional oval of stiffer white foam in the bottom of the cups. The grey foam in the SilentSound ear muffs is similar to the cubed foam in some of my cases.<br/><br/>Comfort and usability. The 3M X5A doesn't flop around as much, which makes it easier to put on than the SilentSound ear muffs that are going to require using both hands more often. The cups are much bigger though, so storing them is going to take more space. The X5A has less clamping force, which should make it more comfortable, but also means a greater chance of sound leaking past the ear pads. The reduced clamping force could also be due to their greater age. The clamping force for both ear muffs is high though, so you're never going to forget that you're wearing them, and they'll be painful if your ear gets pinched under the pads. Fortunately both of them have pads big enough to fit completely around my ears.  Both of them have thin nasty feeling ear pads. It might be possible to swap the SilentSound ear muffs, although I tried swapping in David Clark gel pads unsuccessfully because its fabric was too thick, but it should fit with some trimming.  The 3M pads can only be replaced with 3M pads due to the hard plastic ring that has to have a near perfect fit to snap into the cups. The larger size of the 3M cups may seems like a bad thing, but the larger size and rubbery overmolding is a bonus when I need to pull one side off my ear with an oily hand. The X5A is easy to adjust, but one side tends to slip and require adjustment over the course of a shift.<br/><br/>Longevity. 3M offers hygiene kits that replace the foam and ear pads, and SilentSound doesn't, so 3M is the choice if you want ear muffs that are going to last for a long time. 3M also offers replacement double layer gel pads that are supposed to offer better sealing, which could be a big deal for eyeglass and goggle wearers, but these cost almost twice as much as the ear muffs.<br/><br/>Sound attenuation. Isn't that what this is all about? It's close, damn close. Close enough that I'm comfortable confirming the 37dB NRR specification of both ear muffs. If this is the only factor that matters to you, then get whichever costs you less. Next I tried was swapping the insulation and adding some. The 3M foam in the SilentSound cups reduced the level of high hats significantly. Using gel pads on the SilentSound cups made virtually no difference to attenuation, but was subjectively more comfortable. Adding the white foam from the SilentSound ear muffs to the 3M X5A ear muffs didn't make a significant difference. Adding cubed case foam to both ear muffs improved high frequency attenuation. I really want to try putting double layer gel pads on 3M X5A, but at $45, it's a tough cost to swallow.<br/><br/>Between these two ear muffs, I'd call the 3M X5A the winner, but both ear muffs lose a star due to their pads. I'd like to see thicker pads on both ear muffs, or in the case of the X5A, I'd like to see these pads https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DHVXKVA/ even if it costs a few dollars more.</span>

<span>I do hardscaping and carpentry work, making extremely loud noise every day from cutting concrete pavers, blocks, running table saw and what not. Other earmuffs that i have before left me with continuous ringing sounds in my ear after hours of running machine, which means my hearing is being damaged permanently! That didnt happen with this earmuff! It did a fantastuc job blocking out the loudest noise i could ever produce while working but still allow conversation to be heard. Also with the extension band, it comfortably fit around my head and my head is pretty large. Great material and built. Definitely recommend this.</span>

<span>I bought these to use while mowing and using other loud equipment. I'm 6'5" tall, with a correspondingly large head. My ears are average size relative to my head, so bigger than the typical average height person's ears, but plenty of average height or short people with large ears have bigger ears than me.<br/><br/>The fit for head size is perfect, it'll easily adjust to an appropriate size for an average grade school kid all the way up to tall people with big heads like me. The ear opening is surprisingly small though. It just barely works for me.<br/><br/>If you have much larger than average ears, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a nice, comfortable choice.</span>

<span> If all you're looking for is a simple cheap pair of noise canceling headphones, then these are for you. So far I have been able to use power tools with these and it has decreased much of the sharp sounds in which I wanted it to decrease. They are adjustable and holds their adjustments once on your head. I was even able to put on eye protection, which went around my ears, and the cushion was able to still mold itself around the glasses and maintain a decent level of noise cancelation.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a very basic noise canceling headphones for short periods of time and not looking to spend a great deal of money, then these noise canceling headphones are definitely the ones to go for.  They're not fancy but they're also not expensive which not expensive which works great for me at least. Even my teenage boys were able to wear them comfortably to get some noisy work completed. In total I bought 3, and all three worked as advertised for adult sized heads.</span>

The X-Series earmuffs are 3M’s latest advancement in hearing conservation. New technologies in comfort, design and protection all come together in this groundbreaking earmuff line. The X3A earmuffs offer a NRR (28 dB) which makes them ideal for moderate to high noise situations. The X3A features a newly designed spacer to help improve attenuation without the need for a much larger cup or double cup design. This lightweight earmuff is designed for protection against high H-level industrial noise and other loud sounds. It features an electrically insulated wire headband, often referred to as “dielectric”. When correctly selected and worn, these products help reduce exposure to hazardous levels of noise. 3M PELTOR HYX3 Hygiene Kit offer replaceable ear cushions and foam liners to help keep your earmuffs clean and extend the service life. The 3M PELTOR X Series earmuffs are ideal for protection against noise arising from a wide range of applications in the workplace. Examples of typical applications include: metal processing, automotive, airports, construction, textile manufacturing, chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, cement manufacturing, printing, woodworking, heavy engineering, foundry, steelworks, and mining and quarrying. Also available in hard hat attachment model: 3M PELTOR XSeries CapMount Ear Muffs X3P3E. NOTE: The X-Series (over-the-head) headband version is electrically insulated -sometimes referred to as “dielectric”. The metal components of the headband have been covered by non-conductive material for use in a low voltage electrical hazard (less than 440 V ac). As there are no applicable standards for testing ear muffs against electrical insulating properties, the product has been evaluated at an external laboratory against a modified test method based on EN397: 1995. During assessment, the leakage current did not exceed 1. 2mA when the external surface of the product made contact with an electrical source. The user must determine the overall suitability of this product for the intended application taking into account all relevant hazards. Disclaimer: 3M industrial and occupational products are intended, labeled, and packaged for sale to trained industrial and occupational customers for workplace use. Unless specifically stated otherwise on the applicable product packaging or literature, these products are not intended, labeled, or packaged for sale to or use by consumers (e. g. , for home, personal, primary or secondary school, recreational/sporting, or other uses not described in the applicable product packaging or literature), and must be selected and used in compliance with applicable health and safety regulations and standards (e. g. , U. S. OSHA, ANSI), as well as all product literature, user instructions, warnings, and limitations. Misuse of 3M industrial and occupational products may result in injury, sickness, or death. For help with product selection and use, consult your on-site safety professional, industrial hygienist, or other subject matter expert. *3M strongly recommends fit testing of hearing protectors. Research suggests that many users will receive less noise reduction than indicated by the NRR due to variation in hearing protector fit, fitting skill, and motivation of the user. If the NRR is used, 3M recommends that it be reduced by 50% or in accordance with applicable regulations. 3M PSD products are for occupational use only.

<span>Large noise reduction but you can pretty easily still here people speak, even over low-medium levels of manufacturing equipment noise.</span>

<span>So, out of the box, a wee bit tight on my size M head, but that will ease up with use. The ear cups are very soft/comfy with the internal foam outward enough to not touch my ears.  These are super quiet, even with eye glass temples in the mix - way more so than the yellow foam plugs that 3M sells - i buy these by the hundreds and wash them a few times before tossing.  With the level of protection and availability of spare parts should things wear out, these are pretty nice. And, not made in China, if that matters</span>
