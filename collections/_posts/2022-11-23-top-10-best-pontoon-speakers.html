<span>Installed these in my '94 230 Sundancer. Already had the holes cut in the cockpit for the speakers, so install was super easy. Original speaker wires in the boat plugged right in, no trouble. The hard part is running the power for the lights and hiding the control box for the lights. The LED lights are bright and have lots of color and flash options.<br/>  The one big issue I have with the led lights is, there seems to be no way to make the lights flash with the beat of the music, a.k.a firefly them. I think that would really improve the fun factor of the speakers.</span>

<span> Installed on my 19 Road Glide Ultra. Quality of the speakers are great and sound is pretty good, better than stock. Install was time consuming due to the speakers are way bigger than the stock speakers which I knew I was going to have to do some modification. I had ordered a 1” thick cutting board to make the extra 1” depth space needed in the speaker housing for these to fit. The speaker holes did not match the mounting holes of the speaker housing which was fine since I added the spacer and just screwed the speakers to the spacer after I mounted the spacers to the speaker housing. Love that they are marine speakers so they should stand to the elements. For the power source I just spliced the power in with the cigarette port wiring in the tour pack. Overall I’m very satisfied with the purchase and quality of these speakers.</span>

<span>I really like the unit. I installed it on my 2011 Tracker 175TF. I cut holes in the seat bottoms to mount the speakers, and ran the wire under the carpet by peeling a little up along the floor and stuffing the speaker wires in. I actually removed the seat pedestals and cut the holes with a jig saw rather than try to stand on my head and cut the speaker holes. I wired the unit to a toggle switch on the console to ensure that I don't forget to turn it off when I get off the water.<br/>Really my only disappointment is that the speakers aren't particularly loud. I do not have it very loud when I am fishing, but when travelling on the water from place to place it would be nice to be able to crank it up a little so it can be heard over the engine and wind noise. Other than that, it is a great little unit, especially for the price.</span>

<span>I have eight (8) speakers this size in my motor yacht.  The speakers are powered by an Alpine 50W, four (4) channel amplifier.  Because the power from 4 channels must be shared with 8 speakers, the amp. is only pushing 25Watts to each speaker.  Since these Kenwoods 50Watt speakers, I was worried that there wouldn't be enough power to let the Kenwoods sing.  Fortunately, they are singing just fine.  I haven't even tried anything near full volume; they're that loud and clear. Not only do these Kenwoods sound excellent, but they look great.  They appear very rugged and durable.<br/><br/>The only flaw is that the face plate must be aligned with the screw holes.  This means that you cannot rotate the faceplate, independently from the screw holes.  When using existing screw holes from prior speakers, the faceplate with the Kenwood name may be crooked.  The solution is to drill new screw holes or live with a crooked faceplate.  However, even that won't work if, like in my situation, the existing speaker wires that connect to the speaker are too short to run to the bottom of the Kenwood (where the two power terminals are located).  The existing speaker wires barely made it out from the cutout.  Hence, extending them by cutting and splicing additional wire would have meant a lot of extra disassembly to get to the wire from behind the bulkhead.  As a result, I installed the speaker upside down.  A rotating faceplate would have allowed me to rotate the faceplate so the Kenwood name was properly oriented.  Nevertheless, these Kenwoods sound just as good upside down!</span>

<span>We wanted to upgrade the factory TV/stereo audio system in our travel trailer by replacing the 4” factory ceiling speakers which had a tinny quality and virtually no bass. Since the factory speakers were a marine type speaker we only looked at those types. We also went with a larger 6.5” speaker and added a 1” spacer ring when installing (the shallow ceiling depth didn’t allow installing the larger speakers fully in that space).<br/><br/>The Kenwood KFC-1653MRW was a great choice for us. Nice bass, mid &amp; high ranges. Easy install. Looks good.</span>

<span>Pardon the pun, but i couldnt resist. I replaced some inexpensive "dual" brand speakers in by 21 foot center console. I use it in the saltwater in South Texas very regularly. Those speakers began to fall apart so their sound went from meh to done. These speakers were the same size so they fit the holes, i drilled pilot holes for the new screw locations and screwed them in. Standard. They sound way better than the other academy sports sourced ones did. Better lows and highs, for now. They are exposed to a lot of weather so its tough for anything to last forever. I think ill probably be replacing them every couple years due to that. They play both Jimmy Buffett and Clutch and sound great While i'm drift fishing the laguna madre. The grilles cover the speakers better than the older ones did, i wanted good speaker cone coverage to keep most of the sunlight off the material. Most speakers have minimal protection so they can show off the LEDs that are built in. I dont care about a light-speaker, i just want sound.</span>

<span>I was very happy with my new Pyle speakers. I mounted them on the outside of my camper trailer as the original speakers had gotten weathered over 12 years of being outside.

<span>I was debating between the JBL charge 4 and a different version of the JBL and I’m so glad I went with this one! The sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely. JBL speakers on Amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop! The quality is amazing and it’s so load for how small it is. This one doesn’t come with a case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality I haven’t had any issues or scratches and I’ve just been throwing it in a tote bag! The charging port for your phone is so nice too, and chargers relatively fast. If you’re debating between this one and a pricier one I would go with the Charge 4!</span>

<span>My three cents:<br/>Just the JBL Charge 4 and the portable speaker bass and sound quality are great for the price.  You can charge it while using it so it doesn't need to be portable.</span>

<span>Sounds like a gigantic speaker.  My daughter had one of these from Amazon and I loved it on her coffee table to use with TV across the room, so I bought it and was impressed when listening to my Amazon downloaded music.  Hubby heard it and bought himself the next version up to enhance his ipad music.  Amazing sound from a small unit.  We've use it in the garage to practice our dance steps and the quality is excellent.</span>

<span>I had this model on hold for a long while as I searched for the best all around speaker for my 14 year old sons bday. This thing is awesome! Sound is crisp and clear. And no vibration or sound distortion at the highest level. From Rap to Reggaton this speaker is awesome. JBL is an old U.S. brand and still putting out a great product. Even the color design is solid without peeling. I have two more on my list for Christmas for my other son and my husband. I definitely recommend buying the case. This does come with a USB "C" type cord but no charging block to plug into the wall. This is also a charger and has an On/Off button. Volume is controlled by Bluetooth on smart phone. Instant change between songs without skipping or hesitation. Make sure you look all yhrough the box so you don't accidentally throw the cord out.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Where do you put the speakers on a pontoon boat?</h3></h3>
    

The speakers should be mounted towards the front and/or sides of the boat, facing outwards towards the passengers. This will ensure that everyone can enjoy the music while cruising around.

The higher power handling and weather-resistant construction of JL Audio speakers makes them more reliable for Mariners. With their marine-grade compliance, JL Audio speakers can handle the harsh environment on a boat while delivering quality sound.
<h3><h3>How can I make my boat speakers sound better?</h3></h3>
    

1. Experiment with the positioning of your boat speakers to find the best sound.
2. Invest in a good quality amplifier to make sure your boat speakers are getting the power they need.
3. Add a subwoofer to your system for extra bass.
4. Make sure all wiring is in good condition and that there is no corrosion.
