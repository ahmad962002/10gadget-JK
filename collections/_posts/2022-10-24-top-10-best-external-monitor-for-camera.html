<span>This monitor does its job at a good price. If you need an external monitor for focus checking, or general viewing this works. It isn't perfect, but it does the job.<br/><br/>The picture isn't always color perfect, and it has issues with super bright sunlight, but it'll be better than any screen on the back or side of a camera.<br/><br/>There are a couple design flaws that this monitor inherits from whatever it's supposed to be a copy of, the battery compartment on the back can come off the contacts, while it's still "locked" in, and in general the battery adapter on the back worries me. Additionally it's pretty plasticy feeling all around, which is compensated for by the frames it ships with, but even with the frame on it feels like it costs, which isn't too bad considering the price, but don't expect it to compete with an Atomos display or something that's fully calibrated.</span>

<span>• Package: It came very well packaged in a sturdy box that came in a bigger box with other products purchased.<br/>• Product: The unit seems to work fine. The monitor, without the battery, is very light. Very sharp display and colors seem to be spot on. The screen has a glossy finish so I guess a protective matte film would be a good addition to it. Peaking function requires a very contrasty image/scene to offer some precision, but it is definitely a nice addition. It came with a Sony F-970 battery plate, but it can be replaced for the Canon LP-E6 plate (not included, unfortunately). The little ball head that comes with it is 100% metal, so it seems to be resistant. Lets see how it resists through time. The silicon protective skin is welcome and will probably save the unit from scratches and minor impacts. Its is also the only way you can attach the shade that comes with the package.<br/>• The seller: The seller has been attentive and answered my questions with a few hours delay. Understandable sine I'm in US and the seller is in China. God thing is that the unit is fulfilled by Amazon, so although the seller is in China, the stock seems to be already in US warehouses, meaning the delivery happened in 48h (with amazon prime).<br/>• Considerations - I: last time I bought a Lilliput monitor, a few years ago, it came with a nice little hard case that had space for all the little pieces and the screen itself, this one didn't. It would be nice if they did provide that again.<br/>• Considerations - II: For now I'm using the unit with a Canon 5DMKII and a Canon 60D. No problems so far.<br/><br/>I'll keep this review updated if something worth mentioning comes up.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor because the previously recommended model was discontinued. With that leap of faith, I just hoped it would work well with the Glide Gear TMP-100 I bought simultaneously.<br/><br/>While waiting two extra days for the teleprompter to arrive I played with the monitor and my screaming streaming Legion Laptop.<br/><br/>Finding a USB port strong enough to handle the 4K capabilities of the monitor, I hooked it up and Voila, easy peasy there was my image. Although I could dink with settings galore as if I was a professional videographer who knows what he's doing, I kept all the defaults since I fear fixing something that isn't broken.<br/><br/>Whew! No Fears!<br/><br/>Setting this monitor onto the platform tray of the teleprompter and securing it down was a breeze.<br/><br/>And the bright screen is clear as day through the 70/30 glass of the Glide Gear TMP-100.<br/><br/>Oh yes, indeed, I recommend this little guy, and I may even buy his bigger sibling model, just to get 'the bigger picture' when doing Zoom meetings using my TMP-100. Gotta look my audience in the eye!</span>

<span>I purchased the monitor for my Sony A6000 since I am getting into Youtube and building online courses. I want to be able to set up my shots, frame myself, look at my lighting and do it all without needing to rely on anyone else.<br/><br/>This is definitely a great external monitor for people who are doing what I am doing. Is it top of the line quality, such as the Black Magic external monitor, or the $1000+ monitors? No, it is not, and you get what you pay for. But that is not a bad thing. After all, it does not make sense for someone with basic video needs to purchase an expensive monitor, when you probably won't utilize most of what it is capable of. Unless you are doing top of the line pro photo or video work, chances are it will work just fine (and even the pro people may find that it still solves 90% of their needs). After all, a good professional can usually work with just about any equipment and still make their results look good, as long as they know what they are doing.<br/><br/>The controls are very simple, which may be a pro or a con, depending on how much customizability you need. Since I am using it for filming myself and checking lighting/composition, it solves all my needs without needing to purchase an expensive monitor. So the simple controls are definitely a pro for me!<br/><br/>A minor gripe I have is that the red rubber part is not the most appealing color, and it only comes in red. Not a big deal since I am using it primarily for functionality and not for aesthetics, however I thought it looks kind of ugly. Turns out, it is a sleeve that you can take off, which I was unaware of. So if you don't like it, you can always remove it.<br/><br/>I was also worried when I plugged my HDMI chord into my camera and did not get feedback from the monitor, since I thought maybe the specifications of the monitor did not match my camera. It turns out, I was plugging my HDMI chord into the top HDMI jack, not the bottom one. Once I tried the bottom plug, it worked great! Just as a heads up, in case you decide to purchase it (my camera is recording on 1080P and not 4K, which could have something to do with it).<br/><br/>Overall, you are getting a fantastic monitor for a bargain price. If you only need the monitor for fairly basic stuff (like me), you will definitely NOT go wrong purchasing this one! Highly recommended!</span>

<span>So I have had this about a month now and no matter what I do I cannot get the webcam to work on Zoom.  Tried everything.  The product came with zero troubleshooting info.  The only instructions for the webcam is a little picture showing how to hook up cords.  Yeah okay, so I have spent hours (yes hours) googling possible solutions and reaching out to tech support and guess what?  The webcam just doesn't work for zoom no matter what I do.  So, lesson learned.  Nice monitor but I really need a webcam so now I have no choice but to go buy a separate webcam.</span>

<span>Another reviewer mentioned a way to increase the volume on the built in speakers (as the factory default setting is set at only 50%) and mentioned monitor "management".  For the life of me, I could not find this option in Windows 10.  I was getting ready to return the monitor but just for kicks, I decided to look at the Users Manual.  (who reads these things these days anyway, especially for a monitor?).  Lo and behold, there are actual physical buttons hidden away on the bottom right corner of the monitor that activates the "monitor management" function that is independent of the Computer Operating System.  Press the one on the far left to get into this mode (see second photo).  From here you can get into various modes one of which is to change the default volume setting.  See attached photos.  I hope this will save others who are puzzled as to why in the heck is the volume so low from the monitor speakers.</span>

I like this monitor very much. My only regret is not having a webcam, but I wanted to start small, and learn what I wanted. I can get the webcam later, or upgrade.

<span>Nice prompt delivery, well packaged.  Picture is good.  The tweaking selections are all on the back which makes it  hard to adjust since you can't see both sides at once, but if you get it figured out, finally, there are no complaints, but I wish it had a front bar or screen for that.  I think I could then really tweak it well.  Speakers are okay, again they face backwards instead of out the front where I am, and my computer speakers are better,  and there is no way to switch them or add stereo, which I could do if the setting was there for it.  But I could do headphones if I wanted that.  But for the money it's not a bad deal at all.  I got the 24 inch.  I desperately needed a bigger screen and this helped me out!  The color is good for my artwork.  I did have to call tech support for a question and they were very nice and helpful.  Not a super-perfect product but a really good one, and a great deal for the price.  Thanks!</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>I've been using this for 3 months or so and love it. The camera pops out the top of the monitor and so you can just depress it to make sure you are not being video'd.  Works great with win power savings and picture quality is excellent.</span>

<span>So far so good. I haven't tried out all the features yet but everything seems good. I only have one thing I do not like and that is the connections and buttons are under the monitor which is very hard for me to get to. I had the monitor turned over so I could plug things in. I also printed out the manual so I can figure out the color choices etc. Would be much easier for this senior to use if the little buttons to adjust color and brightness etc, was in the front bottom of the monitor instead of hidden underneath-- so 4 stars.</span>

<span>It’s a solid QHD display- colors are good. But the video conferencing components are lacking.<br/><br/>The camera is acceptable but poor compared to modern video conference cameras. I do like that it can be retracted though.<br/><br/>The speaker quality is very poor. For video conferencing it gets the job done and is loud enough, but I would not recommend using them for music.<br/><br/>The microphone quality is also basic- doesn’t cancel our background noise.<br/><br/>I’m an Apple user and a couple of little things bug me- like the fact that I have to go through a clunky menu on the display itself to control volume and brightness.<br/><br/>Overall, it works as an entry level setup, but it’s not on the same level as the Apple display.

<span>This is another solid budget monitor that’s OK for everyday use when doing nothing more than looking at spreadsheets, word documents, and browsing the internet.  One caveat I would like to point out upfront is:  although the spec sheet claims that this monitor only has a 72% sRGB coverage (keep in mind that the sRGB color gamut is the absolute minimum color reproduction standard with Adobe RGB being the second best and NTSC being the highest), I do believe that this is an egregious typo due to the fact that the LG LM238WF2-SSA1 display panel in this monitor actually has a stated 72% NTSC coverage according to the manufacturer’s spec sheet.  Furthermore, if you look at other monitors that are also sporting this exact same panel (such as the BenQ GW2480, LG 22MK430H, and Acer HA220Q) you’ll find that they all have the color gamut listed at 72% NTSC.  A 72% NTSC is an industry standard for entry level monitors so that would imply that the HP VH240a should actually have closer to 100% sRGB coverage.  And lastly, a 72% sRGB would mean that all of the colors would appear to be very washed out, but that is not the case with this monitor since vibrancy appears to be fairly normal in my unit (albeit not spectacular).<br/><br/>With that caveat out of the way, here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past two weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The ‘Sharpness’ Image Control setting offers 7 preset adjustments available so you can tweak the clarity to your liking.<br/><br/>- The overall white color temperature can be adjusted to be cooler or warmer when tweaking the color settings.<br/><br/>- The bezels are really thin (about 5 mm) which does its frameless design justice!<br/><br/>- The adjustable ergonomic stand allows you to pivot the screen 90° (to the right) so you can use the screen vertically in portrait mode.  This was the #1 reason I decided to buy this monitor.<br/><br/>- The power button is completely distinguishable from the rest of the menu control buttons (it has a different shape and is spaced further apart from the other buttons).<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- the colors are OK in my particular unit but they don’t pop nearly as much as similarly priced monitors (the cheaper Acer SB220Q bi outperforms it in this regard).  The red tones seem to have a slightly higher bias over the rest of the color range making them appear a little more vibrant while the other colors are more neutral.<br/><br/>- Although you can tweak the RGB color balance, this monitor’s built-in settings do not let you make further adjustments to things like saturation, hue, bias, blacks, gamma, or even YMC balance levels.<br/><br/>The black levels are nothing to write home about.  Although my unit didn't have much light bleeding, it still struggled to keep blacks dark when anything slightly brighter was on the screen despite adjustments.<br/><br/>- Although its spec sheet claims to have a 250 nits max brightness, the one I got seems to be noticeably darker than my other 250 nit monitors at 100% even with the contrast level also being maxed out at 100%.<br/><br/>- Noticeable ghosting (motion blur) when scrolling through webpages<br/><br/>- Overall image quality is subpar compared similarly priced and some cheaper monitors (I would highly recommend the ViewSonic VS2412-H as a much better alternative in this regard if you really need a stand that pivots)<br/><br/>- The 90° pivot can only be turned to the right side, putting the bottom bezel of the monitor between your main display when this monitor is on the right side of it.<br/><br/>- You can adjust the monitor up and down, tilt it back by 30°, and pivot it by 90° (to the right), but you can’t swivel it left or right without turning the entire base of the stand.<br/><br/>- Does not have any FreeSync (AMD) or G-Sync (Nvidia) support.  This causes lower resolution graphics and images to have noticeable jagged sharpening and screen tearing effects.<br/><br/>The HP VH240a is ok for daily use if you just need something cheap to do some web browsing, view word documents, and other non-graphics intensive tasks on.  For my particular uses, since I only bought this monitor to use vertically to view documents and social media pages and do some light coding on, it is good enough to get the job done in that regard.  I would not recommend this monitor for casual gaming, watching movies, or doing any kind of image editing since the experience would be subpar and the color reproduction would be inadequate for any professional use.  The main advantage of buying this monitor over comparably priced monitors is for the adjustable stand (although the ViewSonic VS2412-H is a much better direct alternative, in my opinion).  If you don’t need the vertical pivot then there are better monitors in this price range that deliver a more impressive image quality (another recommendation would be the Philips 246E9QDSB  which delivers a far superior image and color reproduction).</span>

<span>I have purchased 3 of these from Amazon in the past couple of years. When on sale the price dips below $90 which I think is a great value but I have only seen it happen twice in 2 years time. It's a good monitor with nice picture quality and good features.<br/><br/>That beings said though be careful if ordering more than one for a matching setup because as you can see from my pictures out of the 3 I have purchased one of them is smaller in size, shape, and has a slightly thinner frame around it than the other two even though I purchased all 3 from Amazon themselves and from the same listing that I have had saved in my shopping list for past couple of years.<br/><br/>The have the exact same model number except the slightly smaller one has a 1 at the end of the model number. I don't know if this is normal or a mistake but either way they all work great they just look different which is why I had to buy 3 total in order to get two that matched perfectly side by side for my dual monitor setup. I gave the 3rd odd ball one to my son because he needed an upgrade as well so it at all worked out in the end. Weirdly enough though the 3rd one I ordered matched the original one I ordered 2 years ago instead of the 2nd one that I had purchased a week ago so that means Amazon must of a mixture of both in their current inventory.</span>

<span>No one has said much about working with digital art on this thing, so I thought I’d write a review for that niche. I hook it up to my laptop and use it as a dual-monitor. Needless to say, I’m basically using it as my main monitor at this point cause the picture quality is great and it’s the perfect size for my eyes at the desk. I use a lot of Adobe software and everything looks incredibly clear. Color quality is great, too. The eye-saver mode is a godsend for people like me who are often up late working on projects. Just make sure you are aware of what the colors will actually look like, obviously, cause the eye-saver mode will make things look slightly yellow.

<span>I use this product daily for communications and playing card games. It is a good clear picture with decent response time. I would have given it 5  stars except that the button on the back to operate the menu and turn the screen off is clumsy and difficult to use especially if you have large fingers. I installed a 10 foot HDMI cable and discovered the screen would not turn off when I turned off my computer. Little icons rolled around the screen until it was manually turned off by the button in back, clumsily. I installed my old analog cable and the problem went away. The screen now turns off with my computer (windows 11). Would prefer an HDMI connection in case it would give a better picture. Does anyone have a similar complaint or solution.</span>
