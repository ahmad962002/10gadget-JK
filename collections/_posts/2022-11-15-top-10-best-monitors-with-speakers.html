<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is another solid budget monitor that’s OK for everyday use when doing nothing more than looking at spreadsheets, word documents, and browsing the internet.  One caveat I would like to point out upfront is:  although the spec sheet claims that this monitor only has a 72% sRGB coverage (keep in mind that the sRGB color gamut is the absolute minimum color reproduction standard with Adobe RGB being the second best and NTSC being the highest), I do believe that this is an egregious typo due to the fact that the LG LM238WF2-SSA1 display panel in this monitor actually has a stated 72% NTSC coverage according to the manufacturer’s spec sheet.  Furthermore, if you look at other monitors that are also sporting this exact same panel (such as the BenQ GW2480, LG 22MK430H, and Acer HA220Q) you’ll find that they all have the color gamut listed at 72% NTSC.  A 72% NTSC is an industry standard for entry level monitors so that would imply that the HP VH240a should actually have closer to 100% sRGB coverage.  And lastly, a 72% sRGB would mean that all of the colors would appear to be very washed out, but that is not the case with this monitor since vibrancy appears to be fairly normal in my unit (albeit not spectacular).<br/><br/>With that caveat out of the way, here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past two weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The ‘Sharpness’ Image Control setting offers 7 preset adjustments available so you can tweak the clarity to your liking.<br/><br/>- The overall white color temperature can be adjusted to be cooler or warmer when tweaking the color settings.<br/><br/>- The bezels are really thin (about 5 mm) which does its frameless design justice!<br/><br/>- The adjustable ergonomic stand allows you to pivot the screen 90° (to the right) so you can use the screen vertically in portrait mode.  This was the #1 reason I decided to buy this monitor.<br/><br/>- The power button is completely distinguishable from the rest of the menu control buttons (it has a different shape and is spaced further apart from the other buttons).<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- the colors are OK in my particular unit but they don’t pop nearly as much as similarly priced monitors (the cheaper Acer SB220Q bi outperforms it in this regard).  The red tones seem to have a slightly higher bias over the rest of the color range making them appear a little more vibrant while the other colors are more neutral.<br/><br/>- Although you can tweak the RGB color balance, this monitor’s built-in settings do not let you make further adjustments to things like saturation, hue, bias, blacks, gamma, or even YMC balance levels.<br/><br/>The black levels are nothing to write home about.  Although my unit didn't have much light bleeding, it still struggled to keep blacks dark when anything slightly brighter was on the screen despite adjustments.<br/><br/>- Although its spec sheet claims to have a 250 nits max brightness, the one I got seems to be noticeably darker than my other 250 nit monitors at 100% even with the contrast level also being maxed out at 100%.<br/><br/>- Noticeable ghosting (motion blur) when scrolling through webpages<br/><br/>- Overall image quality is subpar compared similarly priced and some cheaper monitors (I would highly recommend the ViewSonic VS2412-H as a much better alternative in this regard if you really need a stand that pivots)<br/><br/>- The 90° pivot can only be turned to the right side, putting the bottom bezel of the monitor between your main display when this monitor is on the right side of it.<br/><br/>- You can adjust the monitor up and down, tilt it back by 30°, and pivot it by 90° (to the right), but you can’t swivel it left or right without turning the entire base of the stand.<br/><br/>- Does not have any FreeSync (AMD) or G-Sync (Nvidia) support.  This causes lower resolution graphics and images to have noticeable jagged sharpening and screen tearing effects.<br/><br/>The HP VH240a is ok for daily use if you just need something cheap to do some web browsing, view word documents, and other non-graphics intensive tasks on.  For my particular uses, since I only bought this monitor to use vertically to view documents and social media pages and do some light coding on, it is good enough to get the job done in that regard.  I would not recommend this monitor for casual gaming, watching movies, or doing any kind of image editing since the experience would be subpar and the color reproduction would be inadequate for any professional use.  The main advantage of buying this monitor over comparably priced monitors is for the adjustable stand (although the ViewSonic VS2412-H is a much better direct alternative, in my opinion).  If you don’t need the vertical pivot then there are better monitors in this price range that deliver a more impressive image quality (another recommendation would be the Philips 246E9QDSB  which delivers a far superior image and color reproduction).</span>

<span>My old display died yesterday.  This display was the right price for the right features and available in one day by Amazon Prime.  I recommend getting the instructions from HP online as the one-sheet instructions with pictures only is severely lacking.  The only issue I had was with the audio.  It comes with a audio cable with phone plugs on each end.  If you use this in conjunction with HDMI, you get no sound.  I found nothing that specifically said that in the instructions, but while trying to figure out why the built-in speakers weren't working, I unplugged the audio cable and immediately the sound worked.  It seems the HDMI cables carry the sound and the audio cable is not only not required, but blocks the audio signal.<br/><br/>HP should update their instructions to make that clear.</span>

<span>I like this monitor. I love the height adjustment! It will be so much nicer than bending my neck to look down at my all-in-one. Hard to find a height adjustable monitor at this price.<br/>I did have a bit of trouble getting the operating manual. Spent way too much time looking for a manual for this model on the HP website. FINALLY noticed Get Product Support on the order details page. I soon talked with a very nice human being who sent me a cut and paste address for the manual.<br/>Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to use it much, other than to check screen quality. I ordered an HP desktop from another vendor at the same time. In my quest to get some questions answered about the computer, I found that HP had no record of the computer's serial number. After some googling, I found that is a thing with HP. They don't have a very reliable system for keeping track of their serial numbers. AND, if you have no serial number, there is no way to communicate with HP. Plus, you have no warrantee. Many people find out they have no valid serial number too late. Even the tech guy at the store where I bought the computer had had the same problem. He spent months (in vain) trying to get satisfaction from HP. I am still looking for a NON HP desktop.</span>

<span>This was by far one of the easiest monitors I've assembled.  Literally took me less than 5 min to attach stand.  Love the that height is adjustable and it has tilt as well.  Picture quality is great.  Some reviews stated poor picture quality or that screen was brighter on one side of that picture quality had to be fine tuned.  I had none of these issues.  I simply used buttons on bottom of screen to choose low blue light.  Had it up and connected to my computer in less than 10 min.  I highly recommend this monitor.</span>

<span>I use this monitor on a daily basis as a work from home employee and find that it's the "best bang for the buck".  I had bought one over a year ago and believed it to be a good enough monitor to buy a second one to replace my other aged monitor.  The picture quality is good enough for my job functions which includes reading/observing on dark and light backgrounds.  However, at times some text on webpages look fuzzy when they are at 8 point or lower.</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>My old 15 year old HP 24in screen died. This was the replacement. I use this screen to type documents &amp; program. (The other is a Wacom tablet screen for art &amp; photography and the occasional landscape document.)<br/><br/>The screen is bright and easy to use. I played around with the color settings...it's easy to adjust, but since I rarely use it for art &amp; photography, it's not urgent.<br/><br/>I'm not used to the proportions. This reminds me of legal pad size. For 8.5x11 docs, it's a little strange. But it's wonderful for the Python program I'm writing.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it! Good price, too.<br/><br/>(Note: I don't game much. The most would be MS Flight Simulator 2000. I can't tell you about how this would be for games.)</span>

<span>First “gaming” monitor i ever purchased.. i play on console so most of my gaming had been on good quality TVs up untill my most recent samsung 55 inch 4k HDR i was running my ps5 on and it was super clean on that ….BUT THIS ….wow …. The ps5 is actually running @120fps and it’s BANANAS! Sad thing is that the screen wants MORE but the playstation can’t accommodate…needless to say I could never play on just a tv again …this is a entry level monitor running wayyyyyyy past its listed price !</span>

<span>One drawback is when it comes to PC's and Monitors, you won't know for sure until you try it out for yourself. You can ask the seller questions, but sometimes the question you should have asked isn't obvious until the thing is sitting on your desk. It may boil down to something very specific to your application/environment/ergonomics that the seller, or even the manufacturer can't give you a definitive answer because of the subjective nature of sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time.<br/>  A big help for me in determining which to order is to download the user manual and quick set-up guides from the Manufacturer Website. By carefully reading the specs and going through the OSD Menu entries I am sure that what I'm ordering, at least on paper, has the right specs. This way, the monitors should have all the right comparable specs and you should end up with what you really want. Still, as was it was in my case you may have to try it out before you can finalize the purchase.<br/>  I need a widescreen curved monitor such as this 30" Scepter with PBP (split screen) so as to be able to work on documents from two different inputs, i.e. two PC's. So I am reviewing this from more of a business angle, not from a Gaming criteria.<br/>  Basically, it is a simple, single-purpose gaming PC Monitor. If used just for gaming on an Nvidia Graphics PC, it works as advertised. You've got to match video cards, max res, number and type of inputs, hdmi 1.4, 2.0? Is Displayport 1.2 enough?  I finally narrowed down to a 30-32 inch 21:9 ultrawide, curved, (gaming) monitor though I would only use it for business. I need a split screen with quick and easy transition from one input to another. To change inputs from one PC to another on this monitor requires 11 button pushes and the dual split-screens are squished horizontally as determined by the screen width and 2560hz horizontal resolution. Nothing really wrong with the monitor itself. My opinion is that this monitor should be best acknowledged as a single input Gaming monitor. It was not quite suitable for my application. Better would be a wider monitor with higher horizontal frequency.<br/>  The Wall Plate though not it's intended use can be  attaching it to a standard 4 hole Vesa mounting arm plate. It comes with a 75mm 4 hole Adapter, so it can be done. Two little bolts attach one side to the monitor, the other side can be fastened to a regular Monitor mounting plate (75mm hole pattern) on the extended arm of your vesa desktop stand mounted to your desk .  You will have to obtain an additional four M4 x 20mm bolts, with washers and nuts to bolt (fasten) Wall Mount to the Vesa plate of your stand. Easily accomplished except for  obtaining your own hardware. No wall plate screws are supplied as there are different types of wall mounts.<br/>  At this price point, as I've mentioned, this monitor is designed to work best with a PC having an Nvidia Video Card using GSync. They tell you up front how it's designed to work. With the right hardware you can get the 160 - 200 hz frequency for high-end gaming. With Displayport 1.2  I was able to get 120hz picture that was good enough for ordinary Windows 10 desktop, but I can't comment how it would work for gaming. Need Displayport 1.4, or Hdmi 2.0 to obtain 160-200hz. The Nvidia drivers must be up to date and can be downloaded from Nvidia Website. The driver page lists a long paragraph of Nvidia cards compatible with that driver. It may work well enough with other PC video cards as well, but I was using an old GT 620. No problem with the latest driver but not suitable for intensive gaming.<br/>  Using with a Mac, (I have a Macbook Pro) is a crapshoot. Older Macs are designed to work with older Mac compatible hardware. This monitor, as is the case with the majority of OEM generic monitors, is directed at the Windows PC Market. If it works with your Mac, well and good, but don't count on it, not for serious gaming for sure. My 2011 Macbook Pro has early thunderbolt - backwards compatible with mini-displayport. I used a mini-displayport cable with short mini-displayport to Displayport adapter. Macbook has a 2560x1440 spec video output. It connected with the monitor but full-screen picture was a little vertically flattened, (i.e.horizontall stretched); not acceptable. Mac System Preferences Display Icon showed 1080p. That is correct, but the Macbook is designed for 4:3 ratio. My Macbook was never intended to handle 21:9 aspect ratio; not the fault of the monitor. Works perfect though with my 21.5 inch Acer screen. Newer macs with thunderbolt 3, a.k.a. USB-C should be compatible with USB-C input monitors.<br/>  In order to avoid the hassle of a return, my advice is to ask the seller - better yet, download the manual, especially with third-party sellers as return shipping is pretty expensive. Be aware of the intended use and specs and consider that in order to get a monitor with better options, you might have to spend another $100.00 or more.  What I could determine is that used as intended and properly set up, it will do what is advertised at 160hz For business, with dual inputs, maybe not, but the manufacturer does not advertise it as anything but designed for gaming so I really can't complain. I had to try it to find out.<br/><br/>Walter O.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>I was using an old Samsung 28" pedestal TV in and old armoire. Was having problems and wanted a larger TV to fit the opening of armoire but needed a pedestal type. I saw this 32" monitor with speakers on sale Black Friday. Because of the curved screen it only takes a 28 inch opening so it fit perfectly and gives more and better viewing area. Speakers were fine, but I purchased a Vizio 20 inch sound bar system with wireless woofer also on Black Friday and the total setup is great. TV speakers were fine but my wife listens to music during the day so sound bar system was even better coming out of the audio 3.5 output. I was able to get my 4K Firestick to control the volume and put the monitor in sleep mode. Don't think turning the monitor on and off with the 4K Firestick is possible, but there is an on/off switch in the middle and under the monitor. I usually just put in sleep mode. Sound bar goes off automatically after so many minutes. I stream so my HULU, Netflix, YouTube picture quality is great. I did do a little tweaking with the manual buttons on the monitor. Where I sit is about 6 feet away and I can comfortably surf the net with my Firestick and reading and viewing seems to be easier on my eyes. Typical viewing is streaming TV with sound bar on. Put monitor in sleep mode with Firestick when I stop and sound bar goes off on its on. I do have to turn sound bar back on with its remote when I start back viewing, but I am typically playing with the bass and treble settings anyway. The sound bar can be programed to not go off but I dont see the need. The only thing the monitor does not do that I would like is show a sound level bar wit numbers on the screen, but hey, my ears can tell me where the level should be.  I would have given a five star on everything if I had been able to program the Firestick to do everything. I am glad I made the purchase and highly recommend the monitor.  The curved screen gives the illusion of so much more viewing area and my wife can see the monitor better from her customary viewing location 12 feet away on the couch.</span>

<span>I have had this monitor for over 1 year now. It is still working and going strong and is still probably the best monitor I have owned. I primarily use this to hooked up to my mac mini, it is my main computer at home. I have recently however, been using it to play my Nintendo Switch on. The resolution is still good; and I have not had any issues with the monitor at all.<br/><br/>I do wish however, that it had an ADDITIONAL HDMI input. There is only ONE HDMI input, so if you have two HDMI items, such as a switch and computer you want to hook up to the monitor, you will have to be a HDMI 2 to 1 adapter to go with your monitor. Which I had to do, and it was like $20.<br/><br/>Good Monitor for this average computer user and mild Switch Gamer.</span>

<span>As expected, this is a treasure for the cost!  Because of my health condition, I can use ONLY Sceptre displays.  They don't use strobing technology on most, if not all, displays.  This protects me from a horrible reaction to the flashing.  Other manufacturers could learn from this.<br/><br/>The description of MEMC doesn't do it any justice.  In all honesty, Sceptre's implementation of it is quite good, allowing this monitor, their 24 inch monitor, AND their 43 inch 4K TV to punch WAY above their weight classes.<br/><br/>I have a wonderful time playing 4X games and watching 60+ FPS videos on it.  This presents buttery smooth, GLORIOUS 1080p, and I would gladly pay a higher price for a 120 Hz or 144 Hz version.  I just hope that they can get better control of the sellers.  I bought this in early November for $115 and it's now selling for $220.  That's very nearly double MSRP!  Not cool, and also not on Sceptre.  Still, they're one of the few parties who are able to fix that.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a great monitor, and I hope the price comes back down so that I can buy another to match the first, and complete my setup.</span>

<span>I purchased these monitors on prime day and took a chance on them so granted I kinda knew what I was getting myself into. Prior to purchasing these I had two flat screen 20" Acer monitors that I had been using for my home office setup, they still work great but it was time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>Overall the monitors are quite nice and they already fit my vesa mounts perfectly without any issue, so set up was very easy but then I noticed...the power bricks were differently sized...I checked the monitors themselves and they are indeed the same model and came in the same packaging BUT WHY ARE THE POWER BRICKS DIFFERENT!? Not only that but the length of the cables are different as well...the right Larger brick being longer (but feeling very cheaply made) and the left being short but seemingly good quality. Can I get the same sized brick thoooo?<br/><br/>The power bricks aside...gaming quality, picture quality, and screen quality are all satisfactory for my needs and doesn't break the bank. Again setup was easy ( I already had the Vesa mounts and arms, these do not come with them just in case you were wondering) and I'm happy with my new monitors.<br/><br/>One last thing and I'm not sure who this goes to. I did make sure to snap and picture and video just in case the monitors were busted during transport. The box in the picture shows that the monitors were basically put in a larger box but no additional padding was included. When I got the box...the monitors were just shuffling around in there and I did not see any labels saying that these could be fragile.</span>
