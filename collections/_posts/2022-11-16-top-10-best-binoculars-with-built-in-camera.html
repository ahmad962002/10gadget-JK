<span>For the money it's just OK.  The cd rom that came with it unbelievably had the WRONG manual imbedded in it.  I am still trying to get a manual so that I can decipher the mediocre menus.  Image quality is about what you would expect from a cellphone.  Also you do not get an image of what you are seeing in the binocular.  It looks to me like it is about 50% or even less of the magnification that you get with the binocular view.  Technically it may be correct but from the standpoint of an average user the difference in the field of view is quite striking.<br/><br/>If you are very careful to hold still you can get an OK image.  I keep playing with it so I guess the compromises are reasonable.</span>

Too bad you can't get closer images when focus, you have to do all the cropping job in the computer later.<br/><br/>As  I said, excellent for monitoring, even when you loose a bird with your camera, you know you got it in your binoculars.<br/><br/>Get it...get closer ...Get trust..its Vivitar.</span>

<span>I literally can’t say enough good things about this product!<br/><br/>Night vision capabilities are incredible. I’m using it for watching/filming the night sky…satellites and other anomalous lights.<br/><br/>If you can afford it, buy it, and stop looking at other options.<br/><br/>Build quality is superb…this is a serious piece of hardware, not some plasticky, cheap feeling thing.<br/><br/>I highly recommend buying an external rechargeable battery brick to power it.<br/><br/>Once again, an outstanding product in all ways!</span>

<span> The stars I filmed was in my back yard and can not be seen with the naked eye. It's quite a jaw dropper when you can see what's really up there. I live in a populated area to where the lighting blocks out the beauty of the sky. I recommend a tripod for better viewing and recording which I did not have at the time. I've recorded a few flying objects that I don't have a clue what they were, so if you you're a UFO hunter these things work perfect for that as well. The range finder is slightly over 450 yards and great for sighting in your guns within that distance. Day viewing is awesome with the 36x zoom and the close up viewing is good, like really good, I was able to point these at the ground from a standing point and see the blades of grass in super clear almost microscope like view closeness. Seeing game and wildlife at night is superb. Can't brag enough about these things!</span>

<span>While the concept is good and the binoculars are lightweight, they are not what you expect. First of all, the 12x is only for the binoculars and the camera is only 4x.  The camera does not take a photo of the same thing you see in the binoculars. It does not hold a charge for long, so you have to recharge every time before you use it. The instructions are poor and using it is too much trouble and time. The typical cell phone, and especially an iPhone is easier, better quality photos, and greater zoom than this thing. So, at best, it is just another thing to have to carry around. Don't waste your time or money.</span>

<span>I got these for the kids to take camping. They're just for play really, but the kids love them. They have a breakaway cord, which is great for tree climbers prone to getting caught on branches. They're plastic, but sturdy. Now that I think of it, we may have lost the compasses already. They have a little magnification, but again really for play. For 5 bucks, they were a great treat for the trip. The kids climbed trees and birdwatched while we setup camp. They brought these and their buckets to the beach yesterday too.</span>

<span>Don't expect too much from these binoculars, they definitely give a closer view on objects distant but you can't see the feathers on the bird at the top of the tree.  My 4 and 6 year old boys are quite happy with them.  I don't believe the compass is removable as pictured, I tried to remove it with no success (all-be-it, not very hard for fear of breaking them).  The binoculars are sturdy and feel substantial in your hands, my 4 year old (who breaks everything within minutes of receiving toys) has only broken the strap that goes around his neck (lost the connector for the easy break away function).  The glass in the lens is sitll entact and the binoculars still function, trust me when I state this is close to a miracle for my little guy.<br/><br/>The binoculars served our purpose: they were part of the kids' easter basket this year (2013) along with safari outfits and a map case for the easter egg hunt map the bunny left.  These are our creative approaches to less candy!  Everything was a huge success.</span>

<span>My 4-year old son loves his new Educational Insights Geosafari binoculars and compass.  He loves to pretend to go on adventures and look through his binoculars at things far away.  Santa Claus brought him these binoculars, and he still has interest in them a week later, which for my four-year-old is pretty amazing.  He's more of the "let's-play-with-a-toy-for-five-minutes-and-then-quit" kind of kid.  As binoculars go, these aren't like most "toy" binoculars, where you can barely make out what you are looking at due to the blur.  They are actually very clear and cover a good distance.  I'm really impressed with them!  (My youngest of six got these binoculars for Christmas...and we have seen a lot of toy binoculars, so that's saying something.)</span>

<span>This pair of 12x42 binoculars is one of many 12x42 Chinese-made lookalikes on Amazon, each with different names and featuring BAK4 prisms and a few accessories, including a cell phone mount. This one adds a small but functional tripod as well. Some are nitrogen-filled (these aren’t), and they have various lens coatings to enhance clarity and/or color.<br/><br/>Last year I purchased a pair of Kylietech 12x42 binoculars, one of the many. They claim to be nitrogen-filled and cost just $30. Comparing these two “twins,” I prefer the Kylietech. The Adorrgons are slightly lighter; I prefer the added stability that comes with the Kylietechs’ extra couple ounces of mass. They’re still light. The Kylietechs have a greenish lens coating, to which I attribute their slightly brighter image. The Adorrgons appear to have a bluish coating in photos, but it doesn’t show up on my pair.<br/><br/>Compared to my old Simmons 10x50 model 1184 binoculars (which are much heavier)...well, the image size is the same. Huh. I actually looked through one scope of the 12-power nocs with my left eye while looking through one scope of the 10-power Simmons nocs with the other. I focused on the same rooftop chimney-pipe across the street, moving each scope until the images converged. Voila! Identical, overlapping images. Did the same with a pair of tiny Tasco 10x21 nocs, with the same results.<br/><br/>I like the style and light weight of these current-gen nocs, even though they may not be true 12-power, so I’ll keep the Kylietechs and return the Adorrgons.<br/><br/>I will say that my old Simmons nocs offer a noticeably brighter image than either of the lookalikes due to their 50mm objective lens (even without green BAK4 lenses). Sometimes old-school rules!</span>

<span>I was pretty skeptical about the quality of these binoculars, but they are the real deal.  Good quality, and they have all the features you need.<br/>The camera mount works very well, though it’s difficult to get a still image, but that’s not the fault of the binoculars.  You have to use the tripod to get a still image, and you won’t likely get action shots.<br/>Overall, these are a great deal at a steal of a price.<br/>Only complaint is I wish the case was large enough to hold the tripod.  Making it an inch taller would make that easy.</span>

<span>We wanted a good pair of night vision binoculars. Unfortunately, when these arrived and we read the instructions, we found them to be complicated and intimidating. We're computer-savvy and understand electronics but we know nothing about night vision binoculars. We are not comfortable with the prescribed process we needed to go through just to get the binoculars ready for use. For that reason and in light of the cost of the binoculars, we chose not to attempt to set them up and returned them immediately.  ATN Binox should include a statement in the online product description indicating that the setup requires a degree of expertise with electronic night vision equipment. The binoculars probably work well (based on the ratings of others), but it was a no-starter for us because of the complicated set-up process.</span>

Featuring improved Canon Image Stabilization (IS) technology for smooth, extended viewing without the need for a tripod, these binoculars have Canon optics and corrective technology for sharp, colorful and bright, virtually distortion-free viewing. With all-day use in mind, the 10x30 IS II are designed to be comfortable even when wearing glasses. With an improved, low reflective exterior coating that helps minimize glare from the sun, they're less conspicuous when viewing wildlife, in the stands at a stadium or anywhere else where distracting reflections might occur. Energy efficient, these can be the perfect binoculars to bring along, everywhere.   Excellent Performance, On the GoCanon's 10x30 IS II are lightweight and compact, perfect for bringing along on a wide range of activities: hiking, going to the theatre, sports events, concerts and more. But don't let their compact size deceive, as they incorporate a sophisticated Image Stabilization (IS) system, Canon optics and improved electronics for efficient, brilliant performance no matter the user, no matter the application.  Improved Technology for Stunning PerformanceTo maintain stable images at high magnification, without the need for a tripod, the 10x30 IS II feature Canon's Image Stabilization (IS) technology for performance on par with Canon's EF series of lenses. Vari-Angle prisms are placed between the front lens and the main prism. When the binoculars' gyro sensors detect movement, vertical or horizontal, they direct these prisms to compensate and correct for external shaking for smoother panning. A high performance microcomputer with advanced algorithms not only enhances IS operation, it helps provide shorter startup times and more efficient energy consumption. This means a comfortable, stable view that can be easy to maintain, whether standing on a mountain tracking a bird in flight, looking out the window of a moving vehicle or watching the pitcher wind up to throw a strike.  High Magnification, Compact SizeCanon's 10x30 IS II feature a refined optical system designed to provide a 10x angle of view with remarkably compact optics. With an objective lens effective diameter of 30mm/1.18 in., the 10x30 IS II offer a great balance between brightness and portability.  The Perfect Combination of Compact, Efficient Binocular DesignCanon's 10x30 IS II use a Porro II Prism design. Because both the front lens and the eyepiece use convex-shaped glass, the binoculars' design necessitates a prism system between the front objective lens and the eyepiece to flip the otherwise inverted image that would appear. Porro type prisms are a perfect fit for the 10x30 IS II because they deliver clear, bright images at high magnification with excellent sharpness and minimal light falloff.  A Beautiful, Wide Field of ViewThe 10x30 IS II feature doublet field-flattener lenses in the eyepieces. Doublet lenses correct curvature of field, the image quality degradation typical at the edges of the image frame. Thanks to the doublet field-flattener the 10x30 IS II can display a sharp, even view, corner to corner.  Longer Operation Without CompromiseWith advanced power-saving electronics, Canon's 10x30 IS II feature a significant energy improvement over previous models when using the Image Stabilizer (IS) function. For example, when using AA alkaline batteries, the 10x30 IS II's IS system works for up to 9 hours. The 10x30 IS II are compatible with nickel-metal hydride (NiMh) batteries as well.  More Comfortable, for Longer Periods of UseIn binoculars, the distance from the eyepoint where the image can be seen without obstruction is known as eye relief. When using binoculars, especially for extended periods of time, more eye relief can make for a more comfortable experience over a longer span of time. The 10x30 IS II have long eye relief, providing a generous field of view and making the binoculars more comfortable to look through, especially when wearing glasses.  New, Discreet DesignThe 10x30 IS II have an improved external design with a matte front cover, plus an overall anti-reflective design. This is especially helpful for watching birds and wildlife, when remaining inconspicuous is a priority. A rubberized coating on the focus adjustment ring adds improved control.  Trustworthy, Excellent OpticsAs with all of Canon's EF lenses, Canon's 10x30 IS II are manufactured with lead-free glass.

<span>I bought the Canon 10x30 is ii binoculars as potential travel binos. They are much smaller and lighter than the newer Canon 10x32 third generation binos and have improved optics relative to the first generation Canon 10x30 is model. The at-home tests so far show the is ii are lightweight and exhibit good vision across the width of the lens viewing area. Stabilization is good in terms of neutralizing hand shake vibrations. As noted by many other reviewers the stabilization feature of the is ii make the 10x binos very usable for terrestrial viewing, and is simply amazing for astronomy viewing, capturing at least  about 1-2 magnitude of dimmer stars. Airline luggage and weight restrictions are making carrying large binos in personal size luggage increasingly difficult.<br/><br/>Other reviewers mentioning the lack of objective lens caps on the Canon 10x30 is ii as sold as a disadvantage are correct. The is ii only come with individual eyepiece lens covers. A search of the Internet did not reveal any solutions to this problem. However, I found on Amazon a 39mm spring-loaded pinch-type lens caps that seem to fit well into the tapered 38mm diameter lens shroud around the objective lenses of the Canon 10x30 is ii binos. It is not an exact fit. The lens caps are sold as 39mm in width, and the Canon 10x30 is ii have about a 38mm inside diameter around the front lenses, but a little pressure seems to result in a snug seating. You can but the spring-loaded lens caps on Amazon at the following link:<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GM415EM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>As noted my other reviewers, individual lens caps for front or back binos lenses are also easy to misplace. I am trying out some lens cap tethers from ChromLives, sold in a 5-pack, that use an adhesive pad to secure the tether to the front lens cap, and elastic bands for wrapping around the eyepiece tubes. (See below link and photos). These tethers are of an ideal length, and even help secure the spring-loaded clips in place on the front of the binos. Two of the remaining three tethers could similarly be used to hold the eyepiece lens covers on the viewer side of the binos, but most users would probably prefer a single piece rain guard style eye lens cover that can be threaded on the bino neck strap to reduce parts and clutter. (The search is now on for a suitable rain guard cover.)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0731H4WND/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>The combination of the 39mm spring-loaded front lens covers and tethers is also attractive because it permits use of the carrying case that comes with the Canon 10x30 is ii binos. Typical rifle scope style front flip covers add considerable length and/or width to the point the binos no longer fit in their as-sold carrying case. These style flip covers also probably will not fit on the thin lip around the front lens of the is ii binos. The only con experienced so far is that the spring inside the lens cover is very strong to the point that it sometimes pops off a cover when jarred due to the inner taper of the front lens housing. That is when the tether comes in very handy.<br/><br/>I am attaching a few photos showing the 39mm lens covers and tethers mounted to the 10x30 is ii binos. Time will tell if this combination solves the rather apparent but minor drawback of the Canon 10x30 ii being sold without front lens covers and as sold with only individual eyepiece lens caps that can become lost easily in the field. So far these frong lens covers appear to be are making the Canon 10x30 is ii into a near ideal travel small-size stabilized bino.</span>

<span>I ended up not keeping these. I found that with how well the stabilization works, 12x didn't really provide that much of a benefit.

Product Description   A all-weather resistant pair of 15x50 binoculars with an image stabilizer   Amazon.com   Amazon.com Product Description With its wide 50mm objective lenses and high magnification,these rugged, all-weather Canon Image Stabilizer binoculars are destined to set a new and higher benchmark for image brightness, clarity and ergonomic design.  Leave your tripod at home when you use the new Canon 15x50 binoculars. Canon has once again made its world-renowned optical image stabilizer more convenient to use on this all-weather binocular. With a push of a button, bumpy images are stabilized instantly for maximum viewing. Multicoated ultralow dispersion (UD) objective elements add contrast, clarity, and color fidelity. Housed in a rugged, water-resistant, and slip-free rubber body, these binoculars can be used in rain or shine, whether in a football stadium or on the high seas. Stargazing is also possible with these versatile binoculars. The 15x50 is greatly improved over the previous model, with a larger 50mm objective lens, more convenient operation of the optical image stabilizer, and optional antifog eyepieces. Two AA batteries power the device. Also included in the package are a case, neck strap, and eyepiece covers. Image Stabilization and More With any high magnification binoculars, most users will experience frustrating image shake. Unless fixed to a tripod, image shake can render high magnification binoculars useless. Canon's IS technology is remarkably effective at eliminating this problem and is widely used by the television industry with Canon's professional broadcast quality video recording equipment. A special VAP (Vari-Angle Prism) corrective IS system sits between the objective lens group and the porro prism on each side of the binoculars. Within thousandths of a second of the binoculars being moved from their optical axis by vibrations, a detection system activates the IS mechanism. The VAP shape alters to refract or 'bend' the light path by precisely the right amount, thus fully compensating for the vibration. It is this essentially immediate response that effectively suppresses image shake. Super Spectra Coating A number of optical factors affect the brightness of an image, including the amount of incidental light that is reflected by the lens. An uncoated lens will refelect away as much as 8% of the incidentail light, significantly dimming the image. Canon's Super Spectra Coating prevents that reflection. What do the numbers mean? 15x50? 8x25? The two numbers used to describe any pair of binoculars are their magnification — 8x, 12x, 15x and so on — and the diameter of their objective lenses — 25mm, 36mm, 50mm, and so on. The larger the first number is, the larger the object will appear to be in the objective lens. For instance, if you use a 10x lens and look at an object that is 100 yards away, it appears to be the same size as an object located just 10 yards away. The second number, the size of the objective lens, is important because the larger the objective lens, the more light it can admit for brighter, more detailed images, and the better suited they will be for lowlight situations.

<span>I've had these binocs (Canon 15x50 IS) for two weeks now and am regretting my purchase . . . . regretting that I didn't buy them years ago, that is!<br/><br/> So far I have put them to work for aircraft spotting, watching hawks soar high overhead, looking at the moon, and general observation of distant terrain. These are by far the best optical instrument I've ever had the pleasure to use. The Image Stabilizer feature is truly outstanding. It allows you to really reach in on astounding views, and enjoy them with rock solid stability.<br/><br/> For example, to focus in on a Boeing 747 that is still 5 miles out on final appoach, and clearly watch it extend its landing gear in all its glory of doors opening, wheels articulating, and doors closing . . . then enjoy watching it float through the air until WHOOOOOOSH it's upon you, is awe-inspiring! And fun!<br/><br/> Another pleasant surprise. The binocs came with two years of extended warranty from Canon free -- three years in total. I wasn't expecting that, but it was in the box when it arrived. Cheers to them!<br/><br/> Prior to buying, I compared the Nikon 14x40 Stabileyes and Canon 15x50 and 18x50 IS binocs and tried them extensively, back to back to back, indoors and out. The Canon's seemed a bit brighter than the Nikon's (as they should be at 15x50 vs. 14x40), sharper, they are more compact although perhaps a bit less robust, and thanks to more heavy discounting and the rebates, they cost about $350 less. The Canons are more highly regarded in the various enthusiast sites as well (both the birders and the astroheads love 'em). The Canon 18's cost $200 more than the 15's, and seemed just a bit "jitteryier" (is that a word?). I am planning to use these for daytime aircraft spotting as well as the night sky, so the 18's just seemed a "bit much" for my needs. The 15's seemed perfect.<br/><br/> Great price from Amazon . . . . $799, before a $100 mail in Canon rebate and a free $50 Amazon gift card. Net cost of $650 is a great deal -- enough so that I justified overnight shipping!<br/><br/> Cheers to Canon for a job well done!</span>

<span>Most of the reviews I see for IS binoculars are by and for plane spotters and other non-birders, so I wanted to add the wildlife viewing perspective to the mix.<br/><br/>I have owned 2 different pairs of the 12x Cannon IS Binoculars, one pair of the 15x Cannon IS binos and I have tested the 10x42 L series (high-end, geared towards birders).  I will cross-post these comments for all three.  For any of you birders out there trying to decide which is the right choice for you, here are my observations.<br/><br/>First, general comments that apply to all three:<br/>1) Image stabilization is great!  There is nothing not to love about it.  Why all birders on earth don't use these things is a mystery to me.  For the money, I would prefer to spend an extra $200 on image stabilization vs spending an extra $1000 for a comparable improvement in optics quality.<br/>2) These binoculars are heavy and bulky.  The grip, the feel and the ease of use are different than those of "normal" high-end binoculars.  The human factors of the engineering range from acceptable (12x) to incomprehensibly bad (10x).  I suspect that experienced birders may pick them up for the first time and not like them because they "don't feel right."  Here's my thought: it is worth the 1-2 hours it takes to get used to them, because it will change the way you bird.  For example: YOU DO NOT NEED TO CARRY A SCOPE in many circumstances, which is huge.  They may be slightly heavy for binos, but they are much lighter than binos plus a scope and tripod!<br/>3) it is easy to underestimate the benefit and power of IS until you have used it for a while in the field.  For example, when you are looking for a bird that is mostly hidden in leaves, and occassionally pops into view, these guys are great.  The slight vibration in your hand means that you need to see an image longer for the brain to decipher the image.  When it is stabilized, you can see it in a flash.  You will be able to scan a flock of shorebirds at distance in a fraction of the time it takes someone with a scope.  You can see details on a bird moving 100ft above in the canopy that are utterly impossible with normal binoculars.<br/>4) THink of them as ELECTRONICS, not optics.  These will not be passed on to your grandchildren.  They will last 3-5 years depending on how hard you use them.  Don't bother trying to get them fixed because it is uneconomical outside of the warranty period.  Don't buy them if you are uncomfortable with the cost because you may need to replace them in the not-to-distant future.  That said, reliability has been okay for mine.  I have dropped them, gotten them throughly wet for hours, taken them to high altitudes, and exposed them to a wide range of temperatures without any issues.  One 12x pair developed a rattle and subsequently a hiccup in the IS.  When I openned them up (not recommended) I found that a couple of screws fell out.  I don't know where the screws came from and don't really care because now they work fine again.<br/><br/>Here is a comparison of the various models:<br/><br/>12x: the normal "rule of thumb" for birders with conventional binoculars is that 8-10x is about right in terms of image stability, weight, field of view and magnification.  With IS binoculars, the equation is a little different.  You can have image stability at any magnification, so it comes down to weight, field of view and magnification.  For me, the winner is the 12x.  You will have a little extra trouble finding a fast-moving bird, especially at close range due to the smaller field of view vs typical 10x.  However, it is strong enough to allow me to leave my scope at home for most purposes -- it is equivalent to about a 15-18x conventional scope.  The eyepieces are comfortable and the field of view is acceptable.  My primary compaint is that the close limit of focus is too far for comfortable use in close quarters like dense rainforest.  These binos seem rugged and reliable.<br/><br/>15x: optimal for pelagic birding, gulls and shorebirding, but the field of view and range of focus don't work well for normal birding.  On a boat, nobody else will be able to see the stuff you see, period. It is like having a scope when everyone else is using 8x bins.  In these circumstances the relatively limited field of view is not an issue and the extra magnification is great.  These are much larger and heavier than the 12x and you wouldn't want to carry these on a 10 mile hike (although it would beat hiking 10 miles with a scope!).  My main complaint -- and it is a big one -- is that the eyepieces are attrociously uncomfortable for my eyes.  Presumably they must be comfortable for someone, like the engineer who designed them, but not for me.  I had to replace them with eyepieces of my own because they are intollerable.<br/><br/>10x: These are fantastic.  Pros: smaller, lighter than the 12x.  Wider field of view and better close focus.  Cons: 1) very expensive; 2) eyepieces that are as bad or worse than those on the 15x, which is why I don't own a pair.  I think perhaps Cannon made these because they found in their market surveys that birders want 10x binos.  I suspect they haven't sold many at the $1,100 price point given the Human factors issues.  I personally would advise birds to not buy these unless they are willing to replace the eyepieces -- and better yet just get the 12x.  Hopefully the next version will address these issues, because the IS technology and the optics are great.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>What is the best binoculars with camera?</h3></h3>
    

The best binoculars with camera are those that offer a great combination of durability, image quality, and price. Some good options to consider include the Bushnell H2O Waterproof/Fogproof Binoculars and the Nikon COOLPIX A900 Digital Camera.
<h3><h3>Are camera binoculars worth it?</h3></h3>
    


There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on personal preference. Camera binoculars offer the advantage of being able to take pictures or videos of what you are seeing, which some people may find useful. However, others may prefer traditional binoculars which offer a wider field of view.
<h3><h3>What is the best binocular on the market?</h3></h3>
    

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on personal preferences. Some people may prefer a smaller, lighter binocular while others may prefer a larger one with more features. Generally speaking, the more expensive binoculars tend to be of better quality than the cheaper models.
