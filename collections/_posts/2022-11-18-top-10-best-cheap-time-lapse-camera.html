<span>I recently moved to a beach front property, where the sun sets within my view.<br/>I wanted to capture the gorgeous transition from the bright blue turquoise ocean to the sky-on-fire sunsets I get, to the vast amount of stars shining brightly over the ocean (sorry for the brag description, I'm still amazed by it myself).<br/>  I strapped this time lapse camera to a tree and the captured footage was even better than I had imagined, so I immediately sent it to my family while they're dealing with being in downpours and humidity.<br/>  Great product and very rugged.<br/><br/>I will update my review shortly after I compress the footage to post on here.</span>

<span>This product works very well for time lapse.  However it's battery life is terrible.  For someone like me who wants to set and forget..it's not possible with this device unless you install a solar pannel to keep it charged.  It died within 24 hours of recording.  As of right now I don't see why we are given 2 batteries when there is no current option of charging the batteries externally.  This leads me to believe that the batteries fail enough over time for them to find it necessary to provide us with 2.  The app is simple and I love that I can preview the work while it's still recording.  My only issue is the battery life.  I Connected a solar panel but it might not make it through 2 cloudy days.  What a shame.</span>

<span>Ok product but don’t expect days of time lapse filming. Expect 12 hours without being plugged in. But Positive point, you can plug it in.<br/><br/>Low light filming is not good, it was grainy when I manually switched to it but the auto focus doesn’t switch it well. So you may have to manually toggle it which could be a pain. I have a really good video of pitch black darkness from my over night test run<br/><br/>Weatherproofing case seems like it has some gaps, but not fully tested yet. Not sure if I trust it<br/><br/>App is ok, fairly intuitive. Not a huge fan of apps because of concerns on support. It demands access to ALL PHOTOS everytime I log on for no reason at all (security concerns there) I do selected photos and pick one but I don’t like the multiple request. I looked at the tutorial videos and even though the title was english the words and videos were Chinese (I think, I don’t know for sure) but there are videos on youtube released by the company<br/><br/>Anyways thats my review. Not bad, not great. Probably has a purpose. Probably would get 3 stars if the advertisements I’ve seen were more accurate and my expectations were lower. 2 stars</span>

<span>The app is difficult to navigate. Many times it sends you to an error page that is difficult to get rid of/ get out of. There is NO or extremely limited instructions. There is NO manual. It’s not intuitive. The recording shuts down with no warning or indication that has happened. Battery life is much shorter than proclaimed. Battery life stops the video LONG before the time slated to record. If the app is never updated it will render this great little camera useless. Love the camera! The app to run it’s sucks big time.</span>

<span>Love how easy the ATLI EON Time-Lapse camera is.  We’ve used it at family gatherings and outings to capture the events of the day in stop motion and video.  The flexible handheld tripod makes it so fun to set up wherever we wanted and move it around whenever we need to.  Being able to view the video and make shot adjustments using my mobile phone makes it that much easier to use.  Transferring camera footage directly to my phone was easy and allows us to make fun videos and airplay them to our TV in minutes.  The battery life is great along with the design and extras included with the kit make the aTli a great value.  We’re going to have a lot fun with this camera.</span>

And for the price, I would expect the chassis to be waterproof; it's a shame this is an afterthought, and the necessity to purchase a case required to partake in the events that I believe is the majority of consumers intent (outdoor documentation).<br/><br/>In addition to the case issue, I literally had this camera 1 minute, and the SDcard/USB-C cover broke off.  A better fixation solution should be considered here.</span>

<span>I have used multiple Brinno 720 P time lapse cameras over the years. They work well but they are not high enough resolution for my construction business. I just purchased this 1080 P TLC 2020 and used it on my first job. The clarity of the time lapse video is incredible to say the least.<br/>I am purchasing another TLC 2020 so I can do time lapse videos from multiple angles.<br/>This unit is also much easier to change the settings than the older model.<br/>I highly recommend it.</span>

<span>The camera saves as .AVI file which is a bit of a pain.  While it's set and running and in the water proof case, you really can't "monitor" it to be sure it's actually running.  This had me worried on several attempts.  Focusing is difficult . . . now imagine focusing a camera with a tiny display on top of a lander in the sun, while the wind is blowing (job sites). It's not easy to do.  The video quality is ok . .. kind of what I expected but it should be better and better formats.  It should also take the pics as images and then have software externally to compile the images in to a video. . . .  I'd prefer to have a little better control that way.<br/><br/>Lots of little things but overall it does a basic-decent job for a unique/niche task.</span>

<span>I was really excited to film a flower blooming from a cactus. It’s one of those that blooms overnight and only lasts a day. I tested it out several times the day before, and got it set up to capture the bloom from the perfect angle. When I got up the next morning, the flower was up, I grabbed the camera thrilled to see the time lapse. The screen said “Card Full”, which was weird because it hadn’t even been a full day. I put the card in my computer and it had stopped filming at around 4:30pm and had only used about 4GB; it was NOT full! It seems like it unformatted the card in the middle of filming and didn’t save the rest.  Such a disappointment, specially considering it was not cheap.<br/><br/>Other observations:<br/>- The screen size and quality are like that of my first digital camera in 2001.<br/>- The overall design of the interface, with a small screen and only 3 buttons is very outdated compared to modern technology.<br/>- Overall body and design is sturdy<br/>- Video quality isn’t great, but it was pretty neat to see the capture of the flower growing in just a period of 4 hours while I was doing the test run</span>

<span>I never had the occasion to use a time lapse anything before.  We decided to have a shop constructed on our property so I took the plunge figuring something that does HD would work.  I purchased weather cover as well.  As another poster stated, the instructions leave a bit desired.  A table depicting the various settings for what you want to do would have been handy.  I put a 32GB card in, set it to record the site from 8a-6p and just let it go.  You have to trust that it will work when you hit "record".  The unit on the daily time setting makes a single AVI file per day.  I was running about 650mb per day.  The camera was relocated inside the structure once the siding was up.  Bottom line, it performed well.  Don't confuse its ability to take time lapse with actually creating a video.  You have raw daily clips that then must be edited and stitched to get the final product.  Be aware that several video editors do not like AVI format.  I had to use a converter to make MP4 clips before iMovie worked out.</span>

From the Manufacturer         UPDATE: Brinno has released new firmware for the TLC200 Pro with additional functionality. You will now be able to select a begin and finish time for your time lapse videos, (for example, start at 8 am, finish at 5 pm). Brinno has also added support for Wi-Fi interconnectivity using the popular Eye-Fi Pro X2 SD card, enabling video to be downloaded from your TLC200 Pro via a wireless network. The firmware also allows for fast adjustment to greater variations in light. Firmware updates are downloadable from the manufacturer’s website.Capture Stunning HDR Time Lapse Video in any LightThe Brinno TLC200 Pro is the world's first HDR time lapse video camera. With a 1.3 megapixel High Dynamic Range (HDR) image sensor, the TLC200 Pro produces stunning 720p time lapse video under virtually any lighting conditions, from low light to intense backlighting.HDR SensorThe TLC200 Pro's 115 dB high dynamic range (HDR) sensor captures a greater dynamic range between the lightest and darkest areas of an image than a standard CMOS sensor. The resulting HDR video more accurately portrays the range of intensity levels found in real life, from strong backlighting to faint starlight.Image quality is primarily determined not by resolution, but by pixel size of the sensor. The TLC200 Pro’s ultra-high pixel size allows you take clear time lapse video even in a low light environment! HDR Sensor Ultra-High Dynamic Range 115dBHDR Video InstantlyThe TLC200 Pro produces ready-to-view HDR video at the push of a button with no need to spend hours on post-processing.Powerful, Yet Simple to OperateTo use, simply set your time interval on the 1.44 inch LCD preview screen, aim, and wait for the video to finish. The interval between frames is selectable between 0.3 seconds and 24 hours. The preview screen allows for accurate targeting of subjects and precise framing of scenes.

See Recommended Accessories below.DSLR Cameras vs. TLC200 Pro for Time Lapse VideoThere are two compelling advantages to using the TLC200 Pro rather than a DSLR camera for shooting time lapse video:Instant Results: With the TLC200 Pro, an AVI video file is created in the camera during recording, which results in files being downloadable in seconds, not hours, with no stitching or converting required.Shutter Life of DSLR Cameras: The average shutter life of a DSLR camera is 100,000 shots. Depending on the time interval used, you could reach this number within hours or days of shooting time lapse with your expensive DSLR camera.Multiple Viewing OptionsTo View on a Windows 98 and later PC:Transfer video via a micro USB cable, orTransfer via the included 4 GB SD card (up to 32 GB supported)To view on an OTG-equipped smart phone:Use Brinno's optional  OTG Card Reader to retrieve your video from the camera’s SD card, orUse a micro USB cable to retrieve the video file from the cameraDoubles as a Stop Action CameraYou can create stop action movies using the optional  external shutter release, sold separately.To create a stop action movie using optional external shutter release:Build the sceneAttach shutter release and position the cameraShoot, moving objects slightly between each shotView and share!

<span>Hello all, after reading the few available reviews and a few youtube videos I ordered the camera (PRO HDR) as soon as it was available. It arrived on time and well packed. The first thing I noticed was that it seamed smaller than what I expected. The package contained the camera with the 19mm kit lens, 4 regular AA batteries, a little screw and a screwdriver and the manual... read the manual, sufficiently informative.<br/><br/>Tested the cam and the true benefit was the battery life, it truly does wonders, I had it shooting a timelapse for 16hrs and the battery meter still shows fully charged. The build of the cam is nice, the only thing about the build was the kit lens is just way to wide, it seams wider than the one on my DRIFT GHOST and the GOPRO HERO3, I find it almost unusable for the timelapses I wanted to do. I wanted to order an additional lens but they are just overpriced at $400 for 18-55.<br/><br/>What bothered me the most was the manual focus with the built-in screen is just complementary useless, it is pretty much trial and error when it comes to focus. The camera has the ability to zoom in for focus purposes but the image shown on the vertically oriented screen is just as poor as it gets.<br/><br/>Another thing that I found strange was the GUI, it seams to me that it was made for people that do not use any other cameras, the settings of white balance and the other manual settings are deep in the GUI. Another thing about the GUI is, no matter what setting you change, one you hit OK you are back in the root menu, then you need to click your self back in to the are you were at to change the next thing in line or if you mistakenly changed something... I just find the keys and the GUI very fiddly at the least.<br/><br/>Honestly, I am giving this camera another go and then I will most probably send it back.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/>I bought the WATERPROOF HOUSING for $60, I expected something that will last for at least a few shoots, this is the worst type of waterproof enclosure I ever got. The plastic it was made from is the most fragile plastic on the market. The hinges are made of thin plastic with metal loops, one cracked the first day. The enclosure only fits the camera with the KIT lens. And this was for sure the worst part of my buy, basically I burned $60. I have 5 different underwater housings for different cameras/camcorders, the one from Drift GHOST I got for $35 is a TANK compared to this.<br/><br/>On another note, I went to the BRINNO website to see if there is a Firmware upgrade for this cam., no luck, then I noticed that tlc200 firmwares is still at v1.0, and it has been on the market for a while now, it seams that they are happy withthe GUI and all and there is no plan to fix or improve things up... :(</span>

<span>It's not the highest quality, it'll eat batteries or sip on them depending on the settings. But I think after testing mine out for a month I can say I'm pleased with it's performance overall. I self learned mostly how to use it as the directions are all but useless. But it's easy to control, easy to set up, and the Avi files it makes are actually in 720p quality. When set properly, it does do well in various light conditions. I also like that the lense is interchangeable (however I don't yet have any extra lenses) and that you can adjust it some 100 degrees up and down. With the addition of a simple screw in clamp mount, I've made very good use of this camera.<br/>Negatives: once I hit record, I can't bring the screen up again. None of the buttons has any effect except the power button. Not sure if that's on purpose, but I can end a recording by turning it off, waiting 5 seconds, then turning it on again. So far that does the trick and it doesn't mess up the output files.</span>

<span> First off, only 4 stars because it's only 720 HD, rather than 1080, plus the focus method is not great. While knocking a star isn't fair when I knowingly got it with only 720, I knock it a bit because the clarity of the lens isn't close to perfect. When downsizing the image to 50%, it looks almost perfect. Which means if it could just shoot higher with this lens, downsizing to 720 would rival DSLRs. Much want for a higher resolution. I'd even see myself paying upwards of $400-500 for a 4K device like this.<br/>The focus method is difficult because it digitally zooms on an area to try and focus. The positive to such a wide angle lens is if you are far away from the subject enough, it won't matter as much considering the output is still only 720.<br/>The camera's battery is very impressive. I've already shot 4 hours worth of videos and it's still going strong, even in 40 degree temperatures.<br/>Because of a lack of buttons, navigating takes a little getting used to, but it's easy once you realize the procedure.<br/>Small and mobile is a big plus. You can put it almost anywhere.<br/>I've done time lapse photography with a DSLR. The quality is unmatched because of the freedom and quality of accessories available. Two things made this device appealing. Automatically creating the video after completion and no wear and tear on my cameras. When you consider a SLR is rated for 100,000-300,000 shutter cycles, that's 900 photographs to get one video of 30 seconds (assuming 30fps). 112 of those and you already crossed 100,000 photos with your camera. It's a lot of abuse for essentially the same shot.<br/>For example, if you spend $1,000 for a DSLR (can easily pay 5+ times that), get a good lens worth $800, you have $1,800 to get 4K or better time lapse photos. Now you need to render them, which can take anywhere from a few seconds to many minutes depending on your computer. While time is a small price to pay for such great quality, it's still a factor for some who just want to get it on Facebook. Here you get something without a mechanical shutter, total silence when shooting and the video is rendered upon completion.<br/>I wish it saved to MP4, but there are numerous free tools to convert it if you need something other than AVI. The video I'm including is literally the 2nd, 3rd and 4th videos created with the unit. The first was of inside the office, which while it was just as good, it's still not my place to share people without their permission. The 4th video at the end where you can see a water tower is from a professional DSLR and Canon L-series lens. You can easily see the quality difference, but I did that to help people see what a $3,000 setup is compared to a $200 setup to help them determine if it's worth it. It required 390 images for the DSLR option, which is really 390 photos that serve no purpose to me now as I only wanted the video.<br/>Bottom line, Brinno, please make a 1080 or 4K option!!</span>

<span>****bought this in 2020. I believe it’s critical to do the firmware update when you receive it or it may not work right. I recall that it took a few attempts to get the update to work so follow instructions carefully. Following that, I bought a 128gig mini SD and mounted the cam inside the enclosure up in a tree for two constriction projects. The first build lasted almost a year. Every two weeks or so I’d climb a ladder and pull out the SD card, get the footage, and replace the batteries. I think the batteries and SD would have gone quite a bit longer but I didn’t want to lose any days. Today I finished the footage on the second build. Both times the cam worked flawlessly. Crisp time lapse footage!</span>

<span>New home construction project. Happy with the timelapses I'm getting from these, but the brackets and casings didn't last but 3-4 months in the field. This is where I'm at in terms of securing the housing to the post and reattaching the clear lens cover on one. The other is similarly bad. I'd buy 2x more of the cameras, and really like the idea of the mount, but they don't seem to be fully able to withstand a long-term outdoor application. If the vendor will replace the housings, I'd be really happy.<br/><br/>The other thing I'd add is that there is no way from the outside of the housing to tell if the camera is "on" and the battery status always reports 1%. So, for an application that is long-term in the field, you are left with a situation like mine which is "check every week and hope that the battery will last another week and retape the housing".<br/><br/>It's really an easy camera to setup, the bracket is freaking awesome in concept and the casing feels bomber... until you throw it up at 20' for a few months and realize that it's a little more work than you had hoped. I bought the long cable hoping I could xfer files, but apparently its windows only which doesn't help me</span>

<span>I'll update when I've played more, but so far, I'm pretty impressed.<br/><br/>The instructions could be a bit easier, but if your buying this camera, I suspect your a but tech savvy and should be able to figure it out.<br/>What I've learned from reading review and my 3 day experience.<br/>  1. READ and FOLLOW this instruction. Format your SD Card, and install the firmware update which is easily found on Brinnos web page.<br/>  2 . About the SD Card: As I read from another reviewer, the Brinno description is very misleading. Yes you get an SD card, but its 8gb. Enough to learn and play with, but not enough for a big project. For $600.00, I would have liked to see a 128gb card included. I was aware of this ahead of time from a review, so I bought one at the time of purchase. If I'm buying a $600 camera, $25 more isn't going to break the bank.<br/>  3. Buying an SD card for your camera: Not all SD cards are created equal. I found this out the hard way in my GoPro Days. Do yourself a huge favor, visit Brinno's web page and buy a recommended SD card. This will likely solve any corrupt file issues.<br/>  4. I haven't used the waterproof enclosure yet, but it looks pretty sturdy. I'm happy to see they included moisture absorbing pads in the kit. Nice touch.<br/>  5. Clamp mount: I just starting playing with this, but its a beast. Much heavier than I expected it to be. It looks like it will, but I hope it holds out in the weather.<br/>  6. Making a finished product: Understand that you will have to get your own video editor software to stich the files together. Not to worry, there are plenty of free versions online. I researched, downloaded and stitched my first set of files together in under an hour.</span>

Replacing batteries is a time-consuming unpleasant chore.  However, I found on Amazon an “always-on” USB charge pack (Voltaic Systems V50) that fits inside the case with a right-angle cable and that doesn’t shut down when the camera is on stand-by between timer events; this has made life far, far easier and more pleasant.  I can charge the pack while still connected to the camera so the camera doesn’t forget its settings.<br/><br/>Soon I will be switching to a POE high res camera with auto-upload to my file server, but this camera was quickly and easily deployed to get started, takes good pictures, and the 3rd party battery pack gets me about 2 weeks of 5 day daytime video.</span>

<span>This product is designed to exactly what it says to do. I’d love for the quality of picture to be better, but it serves a purpose. I was using this to shoot time lapse video of plant growth and it works well. The only drawback I see is the in ability to work well when exposed to high intensity LED lighting. There is a filter setting, but it doesn’t help much. But if you have an application that doesn’t have direct light exposure in the lens, this will work perfectly!</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Die ersten 2 Wochen war die Kamera noch gar nicht so schlecht. Ich wollte Sie für Zeitrafferaufnahmen einsetzen, um Im Frühling die Blüte von einem Baum zu filmen. Dabei wurde eine Benutzerdefinierte Einstellung eingestellt, bei der alle 5 Minuten ein Bild erstellt werden sollte. Laut der Beschreibung soll die Kamera bis zu 16 Tagen Batterielaufzeit bei diesen Einstellungen haben.<br/>Nach 24 Stunden war der Akku aber leer. Ich habe dann eine externe Powerbank angeschlossen. Dann konnte ich über 5 Tage filmen. Die Ergebnisse waren OK.<br/>Der AKKU hatte aber nun plötzlich nur noch eine Haltezeit von weniger als 12 Stunden, ohne Powerbank.<br/>Der Schriftverkehr mit Brinno, einen Ersatzakku zu bekommen zog sich dann ca. 3 Wochen hin. Das Ergbenis war. Es gibt keine Vertretung in Deutschland oder Europa. Man muss das gesamte Gerät nach Asien zurücksenden, da der Versand des Akkus alleine nach Deutschland nicht zulässig sei.. Gesagt getan. Nachdem das Gerät "repariert" wurde musste ich nochmals 50 US$ überweisen, um es zurück zu bekommen. Insgesamt 4 Wochen gewartet.<br/>Nun geht die WiFi Funktion zur Voransicht nicht mehr. Die Verbindung wird zwar aufgebaut, das TLC kann in den WLAN Einstellungen ausgewählt werden, aber die Voransicht wird nicht mehr angezeigt.<br/>Eine Nachfrage beim Hersteller blieb erfolglos.<br/>Der "neue" Akku hält genau 24 Stunden und keine 16 Tage bei den Einstellungen Zeitraffer mit Blume (5 Minuten).<br/>Für diese doch recht hohen Preis bin ich sehr enttäuscht. Zum einen von dem wirkliche schlechten Service und den sehr unbefriedigenden Lösungen und der Akku Laufzeit. Ich werde mich einmal nach einem anderen Produkt umsehen.

<span>This is an intuitively simple, well functioning camera that comes with a ton of accessories - it has a USB cord and port for charging the battery but does not send a video signal through that USB port for real time monitoring. It does that through a micro-HDMI port but DOES NOT come with a micro HDMI to standard HDMI cable so you will need one of those if you want to connect to a monitor or your confuser as you record.  Most people use an SD card and will not need the HDMI cable, but if you want to do so, be advised. I have it mounted as a rear-view camera on my race car and run it to a 7" monitor - all on batteries which works for events lasting a few hours. I have a Go-Pro Hero 8 for recording facing forward and for ease of use this is far easier and picture quality is excellent, image stable even in the wild bouncing in road racing . The Go-Pro has a lot more versatility but if you want a stable image and good quality and not interested in a lot of extras, this is your choice for a about a ton less money.</span>

<span> Bought this to time lapse record my 3D printer. It worked better than expected. The camera is very small and versatile. Dimensions L,2.375 W,1.625 D 1.25. Great picture quality.  The thing I like the most is that you can run it off a USB charger and don't have to worry about running out of battery power halfway through a print. It comes with a lot of extra stuff to mount it just about anywhere.<br/><br/>It does not come with Micro SD card and I would recommend getting a transfer device to transfer videos to phone or tablet.</span>

<span>I bought this camera to replace a 6 year old cheap action camera I use when I think I might destroy a camera.  My expectations were so low I threw the box away, that was a mistake.  The video is very fuzzy and out of focus, it's horrible.  I checked to see if they might of put two plastic scratch guards on the lens by mistake, nope.  At best it might be good for a child.<br/><br/>Update: Seller contacted me and offered to ship another camera or refund my money.  I took the refund because I already purchased another camera.  Maybe I just got a bad camera, but either way the seller was oustanding!</span>

<span>Its a cute and compact unit, with a bunch of features and more mounting accessories than you know what to do with. Longer mounting arm and perhaps suction cup mounts would have been best as not every surface is conducive or permissible to stick things to, especially when we don't own them.<br/><br/>The production description mentions Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) as a feature, and this was the chief reason I purchased this unit, however, the resulting video is more jittery than a bug, unless you have additional accessories/mounts to do the stabilization job that this gizmo does not seem to be able to do.</span>
