The PP555 is perfect for bringing your studio equipment's phono-level output to a more suitable line-level output. Compact preamp features include 9 Volt Battery Compartment, Dedicated RCA 1/4-Inch Output Connectors and power Adaptor. It'll take your audio signal, amplify its strength and prepare it for further processing by your studio equipment. Pre-amps technically provide voltage gain to your desired equipment and are key to assisting the signal source, whether it's a turntable, musical instrument or microphone. The ultra-low noise audio conditioning circuitry allows the pre-amp to boost audio to levels that are more manageable for various types of audio equipment. You'll find it easier to adjust the recording level volumes of different sources from microphones and instruments alike. You should position your preamp close to the source to reduce unwanted noise and interference. Pre-amps can sometimes come built into the stereo equipment, but if that's not the case, the PP555 is an easy install, wise choice and great addition to any musician or producer.

<span>My husband set up the old stereo system and we couldn't listen to the turntable. He said we needed a new pre amp. It was months and he still hadn't ordered one.<br/><br/>I went to Amazon, typed in turntable pre amp and this popped up. I did no research and thought for the price I couldn't go wrong. If it didn't work what's $15?<br/><br/>We'll, it came, I put in line and now I listen to the albums that I listened to in my middle and high school years while I stretch.<br/><br/>We're by no means audiophiles, so I can't speak much to the "quality" if the sound, for me it's fine.<br/><br/>I would recommend to anyone who listens to vinyl from their youth, we're talking 70's - 80's.

<span>Plugged it in right from the box and it worked. It's simple and cheap which suits my cheap/free goodwill and gift turntable setup. I know I could have gotten a better one for a little more but I'm not that invested in vinyl yet. If you want a 12 month warranty they make you write a review and post it to Amazon within a week. So I just got it. I cannot speak to its durability or longevity I can only say it works adequately.</span>

<span>First off, I am blown away by the features and sound quality of this little bugger. A nice alternative to a Schiit Mani- it certainly doesn't keep up with my Musical Fidelity MX-VYnL, but I'm kinda glad it doesn't... :-) Running a recapped Denon DP-45f with a NOS DL-160 HOMC cartridge it does exactly what I need in the system it is installed in. My only beef is that one of the main selling features is it has a separate balanced output. For better or worse this item (and several other iFi products from what I read) makes that happen by an obscure 4-ring mini 1/8" plug. Finding one of these of any quality is either a multi-week wait from China or by sheer luck finding the ONE that is sold here which doesn't come up on a search. A friend who found it sent me the link, and when I purchased it the listing said it was the last one.. I certainly don't expect iFi to include it at this price, but partnering with an AudioQuest or SOME other US outlet and providing a link to get one in a timely manner is an oversite they could and certainly should correct. If you are going to run it unbalanced they do include an uninspiring-looking RCA cable. Don't let the negativity of the balanced cable issue keep you from grabbing one of these-they are well worth the cost</span>

<span>i have an audio-technica LP120xubs- for two years now - and i'm trying not to scratch that upgrade itch to a Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo (glossy red or black).  i have a Yamaha R-N803 which i love which runs a pair of Elac uni-fi ub5 bookshelves.<br/><br/>for the past 2 years i was unhappy with the phono stage on the Yamaha - more to the point was that i was looking for something to amplify vinyl listening - i would crank it up on the vinyl to match regular levels like CD or digital music  -- it seemed kind of veiled and understated when listening to vinyl - i was thinking of getting a schiit mani and then i saw the ifi creative phono - although it is more expensive than the schiit mani i opted to go ifi instead.  i was interested in the rumble filter as well - don't believe mani has a rumble filter.<br/><br/>i got this just his past sunday and have been listening to my small collection of music consisting of mainly movie scores.  i fooled around with leaving it on +36dB (MM setting) and +48dB (High MC setting) on the stock LP120xUSB cartridge and stylus which is an MM cartridge.  Mani has 2 MM settings +42dB and +48dB.  it really depends on the cartridge if 36 or 48 is enough - the stock cartridge on the LP120 is 4mV - (4 millivolts?).  i didn't go up to the additional gain 60dB or 72dB - that's prob too much gain for an MM - blow out my gear and ears plus a prob some distortion to boot.<br/><br/>36db was good - but i found 48dB better to my ears.  i am aware that  people tend to pick louder as better sounding.  i am now able to turn my volume knob just slightly (i do  not listen at high volumes) and have greater detail.  I'm happy with it so far but i was skeptical.  I thought the Yamaha phono stage was prob good and i wouldn't notice much of a difference but i also thought this receiver strength is in the digital source so maybe they kinda threw in the phono stage which is a good thing - i wouldn't knock it plus it to have.  i didn't do a head to head or A/B comparison (due to laziness).  if i turned it up yes of course i'll hear some hissing but this is doing what i wanted it to do. which was to boost the MM cartridge signal.<br/><br/>something about listening to vinyl with this phono stage makes it better (new toy honeymoon phase?) - the instrument separation is excellent.  good sound stage (which i think is dependent on your gear and how the music is recorded and mastered (huge part)).  crystal clear - and runs very quiet.  no extraneous noise.  i didn't need the ground wire and i can't say i'm disappointed with the purchase so far.<br/><br/>one thing though - the subsonic filter - i'm not sure if it's doing anything - i don't hear a difference with my gear.<br/><br/>build quality on this is top notch for the money.  everything is solid.  some rattle with the plastic buttons in the front for on/off and subsonic filter..<br/><br/>i took a shot in the dark and it appears as though i'm on the winning end<br/><br/>thanks for reading</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Los reviews de este pre de photo son muy buenos y en realidad creo que son correctos. El pre funciona muy bien. Yo lo estoy usando con una fuente de bajo ruido de Ifi y funciona muy bien, con franqueza creo que no es fácil detectar una diferencia entre la fuente con la que biene el pre y la fuente de bajo ruido que vale 99 dólares mas, yo la uso porque ya la tenía. En cuanto a los ajustes para diferentes tipos de pastilla MM y MC creo que están bien diseñados, mi aguja es una Linn con muy bajo nivel de salida y la maneja sin problema en el ajuste MC LL el de mayor ganancia, creo que para una tornamesa de nivel medio o inferior es muy buena opción. En cuanto al nivel de ruido, un nivel de his muy muy bajo y cero hum de 60 hz. Hay que recordar que el his es un ruido tipo ruido blanco y es imperceptible cuando la música es de mayor nivel que el his lo cual es lo normal, y asi sucede con este pre de phono.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>The is an incredibly quiet phono preamp!!  I  purchased the Zen to compare to the built in preamp in my McIntosh C49 preamp and was shocked by how much quieter and better everything sounded out of the box.  After a few records everything opens up a bit and the soundstage comes into it’s own….100 hours is the recommended break in so if it continues to improve that will be icing in the cake.  This truly is an audiophile bargain at $200….I am not sure how anyone could not be blown away by the Zen’s performance after comparing it to my built in phono on the C49.</span>

<span>Ordinarily this item is intended for those with newer amplifiers/receivers with no phono input who want to add vinyl to their repertoire. I actually have an older receiver with a MM/MC phono input. Unfortunately the input jacks got damaged so one channel no longer worked. Luckily I have an extra line level input so I ordered this item and put it between my turntable and the line-level input. Works perfectly. It is solid and seems built to last. The power supply that comes with it has interchangeable plugs and will work with 110V or 220V. I like the fact that it can accept input from moving-coil or moving-magnet cartridges, so if you want to upgrade your turntable at any point you don't need to buy a new preamp. I have no idea how it would compare with those $1000+ preamps but my setup isn't that high-end (Dual CS-5000 turntable and Yahama Integrated amp) so I doubt I would hear the difference. It definitely sounds good compared to my Yahama's built-in pre-amp.</span>

<span>Dare I consider myself a novice audiophile? Well… maybe, but one that’s on a pandemic budget. Here’s what I found (compared to the AVR integrated phono preamp); increased tonal clarity, a bigger-fuller soundstage, increased dynamics (my original pressing of The Wall never sounded so good), and most noticeably -a very clean almost noise-free background. I didn’t realize how noisy the background was until now. All that said, essentially this little guy simply allows me to enjoy the tonal characteristics of the stylus through good speakers. Additionally, I was usually at 70% + volume in order to get descent sound from my AVR. Now I’m at a comfortable 60% but with more tone, dynamics, and damn near zero noise. It boasts a small yet sturdy footprint so it’s easy to hide or tuck into small places. I may upgrade the flimsy power adapter in the near future to see if it makes it even better.<br/><br/>SO, if you use an AVR integrated phono preamp and think your stereo system could sound better, but do not want to spend thousands of dollars, you may want to consider this little guy. Or if you are considering upgrading your stylus or other things and are using an entry level AVR you may want to start with your preamp, and gauge from there. I am extremely happy with this entry-level preamp and have definitely taken another step towards Hi-Fi nerd-vana.<br/><br/>My stereo set up: Pro-Ject RPM1 (Sumiko Rainier) &gt; Pro-Ject phono preamp &gt; Onkyo TX-NR696 &gt; Polk S55’s.</span>

Since many modern amplifiers no longer have a dedicated phono input, the phono box mm from Pro-Ject is the perfect addition to your turntable setup. Compatible with nearly any moving magnet cartridge, the phono box mm gives you a superb audiophile music experience at an entry-level price. The utilization of advanced circuitry keeps noise and distortion extremely low, and the metallic case and outboard DC power supply keeps the unit free from electromagnetic interference. Since it's only slightly larger than a pack of playing cards, the phono box mm can be placed nearly anywhere. The RCA input and output sockets are gold-plated to preserve sound quality and can be connected directly to any line-level input (aux, CD, Etc.) on your amplifier.

<span>I couldn't review this for a while because at the time of purchase, it didn't work with my setup. Apparently my cheap-o weak turntable already had a preamp built in.<br/><br/>I just upgraded to the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon, which requires an external preamp, and now it's put to good use. I love it.<br/><br/>Obviously it's a bit difficult to isolate what the preamp specifically brings to the table, because to use it, I introduced a higher end TT. But I will say this: with my old TT I kept the stylus clean, and cleaned my records, so even though it was chincy, I had little to no surface noise. BUT the sound felt weak, not present. Almost flat and far away. Cranking up the volume helped.<br/><br/>With my current setup: pioneer receiver, Bose pseudo-vintage pedistal speakers, the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon TT, and this Phono MM Preamp, I have no complaints. The clarity is insane, the presence, depth and warmth are all there. In buying just these two pieces (turntable and preamp), it's like I replaced my whole stereo setup.<br/><br/>For the price, I really don't think you'll find a better preamp. It's very solid, metal and has weight to it, so it's not delicate. It could sustain a drop. The sound quality is great: I get no signal noise whatsoever.<br/><br/>I love this brand, and would recommend them to anyone. And in all honesty, I almost cheaped out and bought a preamp for half the price (albeit with another brand I do like), but I'm glad I didn't. I'll be happy with my current setup for a while.</span>

<span>It’s okay/decent. I don’t say that in the derogatory way it is usually used - it’s legitimately a decent/okay product meant to sound great for decent/okay turntables.<br/><br/>Great budget option for budget turntables, would match well with something in the $100-150 range. But I wouldn’t purchase this if your turntable is of higher quality than that.<br/><br/>The sound really targets that flat phono sound you want to hear from classic rock (think CSNY, Beatles, etc.). It seems that this unit may have been designed to be used with powered bookshelf speakers, like Edifiers or similar, since it doesn’t have any kind of EQ or volume control like preamps used to. Overall, it was an improvement over the Crosley all-in-one that I had for a decade beforehand, but it wasn’t an adequate match for the Rega Planar 1 that I purchased.<br/><br/>Shortly after purchasing I decided to take a step up and purchased some older NAD stereo equipment from the 1980s. The difference in build and sound quality is so outrageous that I don’t even know how to adequately describe a comparison. And yes, I realize it isn’t really fair to compare premium level vintage audio equipment with budget level modern equipment, but oddly enough it was similarly priced and as a consumer I feel that price should be the basis of comparison. The NAD stereo preamp was actually $5 cheaper than this unit, but works almost like a receiver in that I’ve been able to connect multiple input devices to it, adjust volume, adjust EQ, etc.<br/><br/>I encourage anyone looking for a budget system to go with this. But if you’re interested in high quality sound, have a good turntable and set of speakers, consider a higher price range or consider looking into premium vintage equipment. Pro-Ject and Schiit both offer more premium quality amplification here on amazon, and there’s lots of quality vintage options. It will be the same low price, but hundreds upon hundreds of times better sounding.</span>

<span>I have a Onkyo 8020 receiver which has a preamp for phono, but I was getting a lot of hum from my table.  I tried grounding it (it lacks a ground wire) and reversing the plug and trouble-shooting the ground loop but nothing helped.  Finally I said let's try a different preamp.  Running the Pro-Ject from my table to the CD input on my receiver, the sound quality has gone up amazingly.  Bypassing the preamp has cut the background noise and hum down dramatically where I can't even hear rumble or hum or noise from the table.  The sound is very clear and the RIAA equalization curve sounds appropriately applied as the music reflected sounds rich and full of both bass and treble and seems to be essentially a 'flat' box.  No volume control, but if you are running it in place of a receiver preamp like me that doesn't matter since your receiver controls volume.</span>

<span>I recently bought a Audio Technica AT-LP60 Turntable. It had numerous issues, but the worst was that it had a horrible throbbing static when you turned on it's built-in pre-amp, and there was no ground wire connection to try to reduce EMI (electro-magnetic interference). I purchased this re-amp to try to alleviate the problem having no idea whether it would actually help or not.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this small, simple item COMPLETELY eliminated the problem. The sound on the turntable went from static-filled and distorted to so clean you could mistake it for a music CD if not for the characteristic naturalness of the sound and the deep, smooth bass.<br/><br/>The device DOES have ground wire connection, but I found I didn't even need it as the EMI was completely gone without a trace. There appears to perhaps be a very slight cut-off of range, but it's so small you'd have to have incredibly sensitive ears to notice it. The device also does not amplify as loudly as the built-in pre-amp does, but my stereo receiver can easily compensate for this by increasing the volume a tad, with no noticeable loss of clarity.<br/><br/>There is no power button/switch on this unit, but it always is cool to the touch so I don't see any fire hazard. You will hear a large thumping cackle if you move the device, so turn off your receiver or at least turn it down before moving.<br/><br/>All that said, this is an absolutely essential purchase if your receiver does not have a Line In or if you don't have any means of amplification (or if your built-in amp on your turntable is junk like mine was).<br/><br/>Excellent.</span>

<span>I did some online research, then purchased the Behringer Ultra-Compact Phono Preamp PP400, along with the Berhinger "U-Control" UCA202 digital converter, then downloaded "Audacity" (the controlling software) for free.  This equipment is cheap, so it actually makes it cheaper to convert those great old songs to MP3 vs. buying them online, if you can get everything to fit and work together with your PC.<br/><br/>I got everything hooked up with my "RCA" cables (the old red and white dual cables with the pointed ends), going from my old turntable, through these two devices, then into the USB port on my PC.  I then spent the next four hours growing increasingly frustrated because I couldn't get it to work.<br/><br/>Lots and lots of nice people have left lots of notes all over the internet for normal (non-geek, non-sound engineers) idiots like me, so we can figure out how to configure and actually use this equipment.  I was about to give up, then voila, it began to work, step by step, stage by stage.  Now I am happily copying over all my old vinyl to digital and playing it on my I-Pod.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, it takes lots of time and my skill sets came very close to falling short.  But its been alot of fun.  I would recommend this setup for anyone who would like to listen to old vinyl, particularly if you can't find it on I-tunes, or amazon, etc.  Otherwise, you might be better off just buying the tunes!  But I have not been able to find many of the older "B" material that very few people know about these days, and therefore, very few people want to buy.  In this regard,  (I just copied the entirety of Fleetwood Mac's "Mystery to Me" album - the great stuff before Nicks and Buckingham), particularly if you can't find those old tracks you love on the net, go ahead and give this equipment a try.  It will work.<br/><br/>If you can't make it work, start treating the nerds in your life alot better, and you shall be rewarded my friends.</span>

<span>Overall I have been happy with this pre-amp, the only downside I really have with it is that it can induce a bit of low level static/popping into the line, but for the price I can't really complain. I use this with my Pro-Ject turntable and it has worked out well, have never really had any issues with it other than the aforementioned static. Once the music is playing you don't notice the static really much at all. I am happy with it and would purchase it again.</span>

<span>Small but terrible (Terribly Good I mean)<br/>It doesn't take an audiophile to say or know if this really works! It just works as advertised. No ART, No DJ "Bull" or what they call their product as " preamp for phono" or with RIAA standards matches this small Behringer phono preamp. Connect it and plug it (don't forget to ground it tho) and your on your way to listen to your record collection. I returned the almost double price tag ART DJ PRE and got this one (so far my comparable) and this "more than doubles the quality of producing sound off of my vinyls" - Ok, 5x better! I have connected this to my RX-V671 and records sounded great! Sound stage - depends on your setup (IMHO) you may have to "definitely" crank some of that volume up to compare with older receivers with built-in PHONO IN (in my case when compared to my 25 y/o Sherwood stereo surround receiver)<br/>Well, imagine the circuitry (ICs and whatnot) older receivers have in their arsenal for preamp (PHONO IN) I mean it was their era for playing records, right? Too bad our "new" era of digital this and that gave us lesser option and left us to spend some more in order to hear them vinyls fill the air of "analog bliss". But, not in this case of cheap (price tag-wise) preamp from Behringer.<br/>Hey! You can always return it if it didn't fit your hearing/listening pleasure - but it sufficed mine!<br/>Some may go against me on this (I don't care) I am just voicing myself here and hoping to help others decide a little bit more easier on their search for phono preamp.</span>

<span>This Pyle PTAU23 a great little amplifier. I purchased it specifically for playing mp3s on SD cards and USB drives. Still learning the operation, but so far I am extremely satisfied. I am using two Sony 60 watt bookshelf speakers. Has  great sound quality and plenty of power for my application. I would certainly recommend the Pyle PTAU23 Mini Stereo Power Amp. Great value for the price.</span>

<span>This thing was literally plug and play. I didn’t bother with the app ( doesn’t seem to be available anymore on iOS) I just plugged right into the router through the LAN plug. Immediately became available for Apple AirPlay. Turn the volume up about 3/4 and adjust the bass to your speakers. I know it has more capabilities, but this is all I wanted. Great product, great price, great solution. Highly recommend for convenient sound solutions where Bluetooth may be too far away.</span>

<span>Application: I used this product to power two Realistic Minimus 7 speakers that I found at a thrift show--great, old, quality mini speakers. The speakers being 8 Ohms each run this amp at 2x20 Watts, in reality. They sound great through this amp, awesome tone, covers Mids and highs extremely well. I'm using the recording output to run a line output to an awesome Sylvania powered sub (that came with satellite treble and mid speakers--also great speakers) I picked up from big lots on the cheap through a lot of research (I'm not using the treble speakers at all with this setup). I mix music and do a lot of DIY studio stuff, I've got a really good ear for sound, I work operating sound equipment with bands and other applications and I'm going to be using this setup for personal uses for quite a while, I am impressed...<br/><br/>Review: The amp itself does the job, there are 3 RCA inputs, one 1/8 inch input on the front (selected by toggling to the CD input without having any signal running through the RCA input for the same channel) and a USB input plus a 1/4 inch Microphone input. I'm most likely only going to use the RCA inputs and the front jack for quick connection.<br/><br/>This amp powers the speakers I'm using without any signal degradation, the only controls I'm really using are the selection knobs and the volume pot. Both work very well, no scratches in the volume. I'm not using the bass/treble knobs because I have a GEQ in my signal line that does the job for balancing frequencies. I'm not using the mic input because it's unnecessary for my uses.<br/><br/>The recording output works very well for my uses--chaining the signal out to a sub. This output is not affected by any of the knobs except for the selector.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I really have to say about this device is that the rear panel where all of the patching happens--where all of the RCA inputs and outputs and speaker outputs are, is really weak, it feels like there are screws missing on the top of the panel so that when you push in connections, you feel like the panel is going to break into the rest of the housing.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: This device is very good. It does the job, just be careful when plugging it all in and installing it because the rear panel is very weak. If you can find some, the Minimus 7 Realistic speakers pair extremely well with this device. If you have speakers with low power necessities, this will do the job. There are numerous features on this device that have worked excellently on my device and I would recommend it. Be careful when connecting and disconnecting components on the back panel.</span>

This fully manual turntable is modeled after the AT-LP120XUSB, but adds the convenience of Bluetooth wireless connectivity to the existing analog and USB outputs. Featuring a specially designed DC servo direct-drive motor and adjustable dynamic anti-skate control, the AT-LP120XBT-USB plays 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM records and outputs the high-fidelity audio to the device of your choice. Use the included RCA output cable along with the built-in selectable phono preamp to connect to your home stereo or powered speakers. Use the USB cable to connect to your computer (and then download the free Mac- and PC-compatible Audacity recording software, or software of your choice, to start converting your records to digital audio files). Or use the Bluetooth wireless technology to pair the turntable with wireless speakers, headphones or other devices, including those that support the high-quality Qualcomm aptX audio codec. The turntable also features an S-shaped tonearm with adjustable tracking force and an AT-HS6 universal ½"-mount headshell with an AT-VM95E Dual Magnet phono cartridge. Audio-Technica has been a leader in phono cartridge design for more than 50 years, and that expertise shows in the versatile, high-performance AT-VM95E cartridge, which comes with a 0.3 x 0.7 mil elliptical stylus, but is also compatible with any VM95 Series replacement stylus, offering a wide choice of options for every budget and application. Additional professional features include a die-cast aluminum platter with felt mat; a start/stop button; selectable high-accuracy quartz-controlled pitch lock and pitch change slider control with +/-10% adjustment range; a stroboscopic platter with speed indicator; a removable plug-type stylus target light; external power supply; and a removable hinged dust cover.

<span>This model so far is well worth the price for this unit. It took a little bit to figure out how to setup the tonearm tracking force, but it has been setup.  Setting the anti-skate was a breeze. Just set it up with the same value as the tonearm track force. I upgraded to this model because the Audio Technica LP60xbt developed a problem of skipping. I thought it was a defect in the first LP, but it expanded to other Lp's. The latest one was brand new and the LP60 skipped on several tracks. So, I got this LP120, and it did not skip once. The first album I mentioned, on lp60 skipped in the same place every time I played it. So, I thought it was a defect in the album. Not so on the LP120. It played right thru the track with no problem whatsoever. I played multiple times it did not skip.  A few draw backs though. I would've liked to have seen automatic return, but the tonearm design I can see it wouldn't be possible. That's ok. I need to get up of my back end anyway. Technology. The other draw back, the blue tooth pairs with my one pair of headphones but won't pair with another. That maybe a design flaw with the second pair of phones. As for the overall performance of the LP120, it outweighs the LP60 by far because of the skipping it does not do anymore. It nice to not here the skip it did on the old turn table. I give it 4 stars</span>

<span>Only Con (minor):  I wish this table had auto-return and shut-off at the end of the album.  I did know about this shortcoming before purchase and went ahead anyway...I'm not regretting the decision.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Direct drive and won't have to worry about belts.<br/>There's a switch to let one choose from "phono" or "line" depending on your tuner needs.  My tuner does not have a preamp phono port...I'm guessing unless you buy a high-end tuner, most newer tuners won't?<br/><br/>I thought the Bluetooth would be a gimmick feature for me.  I'll see myself using this feature extensively while converting Dad's albumns to MP3...not interrupting family and I can be mobile/active in the general area.  Your range will vary depending on wall etc.  I can manage 30 feet.<br/><br/>I currently have this turntable connected to my laptop over the USB port (it just works on my Windows 10...no extra drivers or config were needed), and am using Bluetooth to listen while capturing with Audacity (free software/download...minimal learning curve with great documentation online).<br/><br/>I'm not an audiophile and didn't think spending four figures on a tuner was worth it for me.  For me it works and sounds great.  I haven't had this product for a week yet, but am very pleased with it so far.</span>

<span>My girlfriend got a Victrola turntable combo unit for her birthday, and it really sparked something in me. We had so much fun that first day listening to records that I wanted one of my own. I set off on an adventure of buying and returning crap models until I finally bit the bullet and spent a few dimes on this one.<br/>If you're reading this considering your first turntable, STOP HERE and buy this one. Don't be cheap looking for anything else to start your journey. This one is a phenomenal starter, and will likely carry you through my intermediate stage as well. There's some upgrade path here, beginning with the stylus, then progressing on to different heads... If you ever do decide you want to advance to a better table, I guarantee you're keeping this one for another room. It's just that good.<br/>I paired this with a Parasound zPhono preamp, and a set of Amplified Klipsch towers with sub, and I couldn't be happier. It's a fantastic entry into the world of vinyl before stepping into the $multi-K territory.<br/>My only complaint, is with the Bluetooth connectivity. You have to turn on the internal preamp on the turntable for it to work. I have a set of nice Bluetooth headphones that I'd like to use with this, but I have to max the volume on them to get them at a decent listening level, and I'm worried about forgetting to turn the internal preamp off, and accidentally running it through the external preamp. I can't imagine that would be good for the speakers. It works fine when I use it, but I find myself wishing for more.<br/>You get a lot of intermediate features here, with a great/easily upgradable stylus, counterweight, and anti-skate. There's also some advanced speed controls that I will likely never use.</span>

<span>Although I just got this Pyle Preamp a day ago, I am impressed with the power delivery.  I have hooked up to a cheap Boytone Multi player, which is combo Cassette, CD, TT, player via the speaker output jacks to tge Aux In jacks on the Pyle.  For $200, this Pyle seems to be a very good value.  It is relatively sturdy , with a pretty well built cabinet.  Intial reasons for falli g short of 5 stars is that the Pyle does generate "noise". It has its own integral CD player which is nice bonus, but that is bit noisey.  I have yet to test the BT or Radio functions.  Speaking of which, the controls are a bit confusing , with too many buttons.  Although I can tolerate the unit's Glitzy look with knobs and lights, it may be a little over the top for some.  And what is with all these Mic / Echo / Mic controls for Bass and Treble?  Another initial complaint is with the operating manual, which convoluted and offers little instructions.  The picture of the rear panel in the manual does NOT match my BT3000 unit.  The remote control's function description is even more confusing.  Alternately, even though I am using this Pyle Preamp to deliver stereo music from my Bookshelf speakers (now have Fluance Signature Series speakers , but may upgrade to the Elacs Debut 6.2 set), I am using a self powered  Sub Woofer.  The front panel of the Pyle has a handy sub woofer volume control knob on the front.  I like that for sure.  So far, it is doing the job to my satisfaction.  No its not a Onkyo, Yamaha, Denon , but aside from some " noise", which does not really resonant as you turn up the volume, and if it lasts, it is a very satisfactory product for my purpose.  As an aside, I also purchased a Pioneer XA10 Receiver.  But after playing it for awhile, it started to emit severe crackling spikes through the speakers.  Triple checked all the connections, plzyed against the Pyle unit, but it kept delivering a terrible distortion.  The Pioneer is being sent back needless to say.  The Pioneer was quieter than the Pyle with very little, almost indiscernable hiss (many systems will deliver a light hissing sound [checkout Youtube videos from audiophiles , many high quality systems will deliver a light hissing], but the startling sudden crackling and distortion told me there is something wrong with the unit.  Hope this helps.  After some more use, I'll try to update the review comments.  Stay Safe all.</span>

<span>Just received unit. Says reg. Within 7 days of purchase and recieve 3 months extended warranty and a free gift. I tried 6 times to do this on my phone. I don't have a computer to be able to do what they want me to. So, I call customer service,  can't hardly understand the person I talked to. Says I have to go online to get this done. So I guess no extended warranty,  or the free mic. Nevermind it's not worth the hassle.  You would think they would make it easier to do this type of stuff.  So I don't guess I'll have a warranty beings they have incompinant employees, and supposedly can't help you with a warranty problem. So much for that, I won't buy pyle products ever again no matter how good they are , just because they make it to hard to reg.</span>

Whether you’re just getting into records, rediscovering a record collection long since buried away or simply adding a turntable to complete your system, the AT-LP60X fully automatic belt-drive turntable is an excellent choice. This affordable, easy-to-use turntable plays both 33-1/3 and 45 RPM records and, with its built-in switchable phono preamp, can be connected directly to your home stereo, powered speakers, computer and other components, whether they have a dedicated phono input or not. An update of the popular AT-LP60, the ATLP60X features a redesigned tonearm base and headshell to improve tracking and reduce resonance. Noise is further reduced by the inclusion of an AC adapter that moves the AC/DC conVersion outside of the chassis where its impact on the signal chain is limited. Audio-Technica has been a leader in phono cartridge design for more than 50 years, and that expertise shows in the AT-LP60X’s Dual Magnet cartridge with replaceable stylus. The cartridge is integrated into the headshell for assured performance and ease of setup. The turntable comes with a detachable RCA output cable (3.5 mm male to dual RCA male), 45 RPM adapter, and a removable hinged dust cover. It is available in black (AT-LP60X-BK), brown/black (AT-LP60X-BW), gunmetal/black (AT-LP60X-GM), and red/black (AT-LP60X-RD).

<span>i didn’t know u needed speakers go u to hear the sound. i just thought speakers would improve the quality of the music but no, without them u can’t hear a thing. Besides that this is a really good turntable and the assembly is easy. for any turntable make sure to only put the tip on it a record is ready to play or it will scratch on the bare spiny part(idk the name). the lid doesn’t open fully but that is just the way it’s built. last tip is to have the lid open while the record is playing or static will form</span>

<span>This is the newer improved LP60 turntable from Audio Technia and it is an excellent value for the price. Set up was easy enough after watching a youtube video, and it looks and plays beautifully. I did have an issue with one record starting about 1 second in, but I think that record is faulty and not the player as all my other records have played fine. Sound quality is excellent, no issues whatsoever. You can't beat the sound of vinyl, it is truly excellent.<br/><br/>I highly recommend purchasing this turntable for those looking to start their vinyl experience like I did. It is the best starting point and will last for many years with proper care and maintenance.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3 Stars:  After a week of owning this turntable and using it for a few hours each day, I am finding that it is going out of sync way too often. The tonearm will start 1-10 seconds in to a song when pressing start on auto. Thankfully I found a somewhat useful solution on Reddit,<br/><br/>"If for some reason the automatic mechanism gets out of sync, for example if it doesn’t drop at the right position, you can re-sync the turntable by pressing the stop button, holding the tonearm with your fingers and turning the platter 10 times in a clockwise direction. This happened to me once when I transported my record player. I guess it moved a lot inside the car. But it was an easy fix."<br/><br/>I have to try this in many different ways as it isn 't totally clear but I have been able to fix the sync issue twice in the week I've owned it. That review was for the 1st generation LP60 and clearly has followed its way over to the second generation LP60X. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning the unit only to find the problem exists on the replacement unit as well. I will keep trying this sync fix method but if it gets to be too much hassle, I will look for another turntable from another brand as this is simply not acceptable.<br/><br/>UPDATE #3 - 1 STAR<br/><br/>Received a replacement turntable and the exact same issues exists on this model. Seems that thicker 180 gram vinyl has a little bit more width and this causes the pre determined auto start tonearm position to start 1-10 seconds in, depending on the record. This is extremely disappointing, Yes you can manually start and lower the tonearm into position but this defeats its major advertised purpose. The LP90X is not ready for primetime and I imagine Audio Technica is about to have tons of angry customers regarding this issue. A full recall should be offered. I will be returning mine for a refund and trying the outdated LP60.</span>

<span>Got exactly what was described. Previously loved and works perfectly. Great for a novice like me who’s just getting into vinyl and looks great in my living room.</span>

<span>I'll start with the positive. Really easy to use and hook up to almost anything. I bought it on a whim about a year ago and it helped me get into vinyl really for the first time. It has played everything I put on it without skipping.<br/>Now for negatives. For one thing, it looks and feels cheap. I know it IS cheap, but it looks and feels REALLY cheap. It weighs like a pound.<br/>The timing is all jacked up and there's no easy way to adjust it (or to adjust anything). Mine plays quite fast, up about a half step in pitch, and playing a 5 minute song in like 4:45.<br/>The stylus is a cheap piece of junk, and worst of all there is no way to replace it with a better one or upgrade the cartridge in any way.<br/>It's a serviceable entry-level turntable, but it's also a dead-end. Pay $80 more and get something 3x better out of the gate, and also something you can grow with should you get the urge (hint: Fluance).</span>
