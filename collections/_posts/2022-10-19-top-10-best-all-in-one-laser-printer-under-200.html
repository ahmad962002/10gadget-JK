<span>I got this laser printer because I was tired of the ink cartridges drying up in my ink jet printers. Although it's only B/W it works reliably and the toner doesn't cause problems if it's not used for a while. Only complaint is that it isn't WiFi.</span>

<span>Good office printer for a start up or home business. Does not duplex print, you'll have to print odd then print even pgs on the back. It has network ability so if connected to home router any device connected to the network can see and print to it. I've sent docs from an Samsung S10 to the printer on the network. Overall decent for $156 at time of purchase.</span>

<span>Printer works great but....it made me feel like I was back in the 90s. First of all, it doesn't have wireless technology. Fine though, I knew that when I bought it. But then you'd think they would sell it with a network cable. Nope. Then it says I should plug it into my computer after installing the drivers (which are on a CD....anyone bought a laptop or computer recently found any CD drives on them??) I went to their website and downloaded the drivers, easy peasy. So now I'm looking for the USB plug they've told me to use to plug the printer into my computer with....none. So not only could I not get this thing to my network, I couldn't even plug it into my computer. I don't know if maybe this printer was made in the 90s or what, but you'd think with the way technology is these days that they'd give u something to hook it up to a computer if they've made it not capable of doin wifi. That's my only issue. It prints fine, was a bit spotty but I was printing labels on sticker paper so I assume it's my paper. Looks nice. Havent tried the scanner yet.</span>

<span>I use this for home printing. It's a bit slow and frequently will automatically preform maintenance and I have to wait until the cycle completes. When the printer was first delivered, I couldn't finish the set up procedure. I called tech support and after a few attempts to get it working, was told it would need to be replaced. I was given instructions on how to go about sending it to the company for replacement.  I decided to return it to Amazon instead. The return and replacement from Amazon was fast and efficient. When the replacement arrived, I was able to complete the procedure without a problem. I did, however, have to download a software patch for a problem the printer had that the company was aware of.</span>

<span>As usual, a great HP product. I upgraded (or downgraded depending on how you see it) from a Photosmart printer that has recently seen most of its apps be rendered unusable due to HP killing them off from that generation of printers. I was tired of the random quirks I was having with ePrint since they moved to a new service they call HP Connect. I'm also doing less photo printing and more document scanning.<br/><br/>First off: Yes, this printer can do automatic 2 sided scans! I was getting tired of trying to find if it did or not considering the material only points to automatic 2 sided printing and the ability to scan multiple documents to copy as 2 sided (2+ single sided to 1+ double sided). So I honestly bought it on a risk and also due to price when I bought it, $20 less than price shown on 1/18/17. When I installed it, I started messing around with settings and at the bottom of the page options for copying was 2 -&gt; 2 sided. It isn't mentioned anywhere, but that's the setting to take a 2 sided document and copy as a 2 sided document. There was also a 2 -&gt; 1 sided which allows you to undo the dual sided and copy each side as a single page. This will be a huge time saver with all the documents I plan on saving digitally.<br/><br/>Second: For the price, this is one of their faster models. Although color still lags behind after all these years, I feel it is still respectable at 11 ppm at best quality. The product page on HP claims it can be as high as 20 ppm or so if using draft. Considering the only color prints I'd use at best quality are photos, this is blazing fast to me. Black can get as high as upper 20's in draft. I have never seen a reason to print a document in best mode, so to have speeds of upper 20's black and roughly 20 color is more than adequate for most people. Also, draft mode ensures a longer life for your cartridges. Even during my heaviest printing times, I've had cartridges last me months using draft mode. And ever since getting the Photosmart as my first dual sided capable printer, I have bought paper in years! I admit though, I over bought paper a few years ago when Staples did buy 2 get 1 free on cases.<br/><br/>Third: I have always hated tri-color cartridges. Yellow is ALWAYS the first to go since black printing uses some yellow as well for whatever reason unless you set default document settings to gray-scale. Even when I would print photos way back when, the 3 colors never finished at the same time. A tri-color cartridge guarantees that you will have to buy a new one before using all the ink. Part of the reason I took so long to change printers was that HP seemed to have gone back in time to strictly tri-color. This printer though uses a single cartridge per color! Thank goodness. This is the 21st century, tri-color cartridges should be totally obsolete, or at the very least relegated to the cheapest of models.<br/><br/>Fourth: Wi-Fi connection appears very fast. There is a caveat though, this printer takes a while to start from a cold start. I sell often on eBay and print from the app. With the Photosmart, maybe due to the change in service, I used to have to wait a while before the printer processed what it was doing. With this one, as soon as the printer states it's online, it begins within seconds any print job received from either HP Connect or HP Direct (the mobile to printer connection that uses Bluetooth I believe). I have had consistent success with HP Direct since it takes out of the equation everything except my phone and the printer. HP Connect though I always had issues with. The eBay app seems to hate printer plug-ins, so I decided to try going the HP Connect route. This involves e-mailing the printer what you need to print. Well, I e-mailed a shipping label. I decided to sit down and wait the customary forever for it to print (based on Photosmart experiences). After hitting send and touching the chair to sit, the printer had already began the printing process. Since this printer was made after the switch to HP Connect, it went super fast! I can say I am completely impressed.<br/><br/>Fifth: Paper tray. Yeah I know how cares, it's a tray. But coming from a Photosmart, being able to put what looks like a third of a ream of paper into the tray is so nice. I always felt I was reloading paper too often on the Photosmart due to the small tray. I do miss the dedicated photo paper tray though.<br/><br/>That's all I could think of with my limited use of the printer thus far. The only negative is that I feel it takes too long to be ready from a cold start. I know it is partially my fault because I kill the surge protector to save as many pennies as I can. Florida Power and Light really loves shafting us with the power bills here in Miami. But I have restarted the printer without turning off the surge protector and it still took a bit longer than the Photosmart. But with 5 positives so far vs the Photosmart, whats a bit longer boot up time?</span>

<span>I have had many HP inkjet printers over the past 20 years, and this one isn't my favorite, but it gets the job done for a small Home Office. For us, the Home Office is defined as 2-4 computers running Windows or Mac OS, 30-100 pages printed per week, 300 scans per week). Despite the printer not being the best option for heavy scanning, it makes sense for printing quickly and cheaply in color. The ink quality on documents and worksheets that contain photos or clipart is rich, and outshines some color lasers I have used.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Fantastic scanning of color-text documents. The scanning bed and auto-feed pick up great details from 75 to 1200 DPI.<br/>- The Auto Document Feeder (ADF) can actually handle quite a bit more than 35 pages! If you’re scanning hundreds of double-sided worksheets, you don’t need to babysit the ADF.<br/>- HP Easy Scan is a MUST for Mac OS users to get the most out of the scanning features. While Mac OS has great built-in scanning software, you’ll want access to Searchable Text PDF options only provided in the HP Easy Scan that uses fantastically accurate OCR software (courtesy of ReadIRIS software). I am archiving multi-language Hungarian, Japanese and English documents, and picking the more character complex language (i.e., Japanese) allows me to capture the Roman letters of Hungarian and English. Unfortunately, there is no multi-language function so it doesn’t pick up the accented Roman letters of Hungarian if I set it to OCR Japanese.<br/>- AirPrint and Bonjour functionality meant the printer was quickly and immediately discovered on our Mac systems running Mac OS 10.12 and beyond. We might've gone to Apple Support to install the latest of all HP Printer Drivers, but it was a quick fix that allowed printing within seconds.<br/>- Has USB port in easily accessible location on front of printer.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Ink cartridges were very hard to release from orange twist-caps. We were concerned we would break them.<br/>- The Auto Document Feeder (ADF) rollers have a hard time picking up ultra glossy magazine paper.<br/>- The ADF CANNOT scan “too short documents” such as A5, or most "book-sized" documents. You’ll need a dedicated scanner for archiving books, unfortunately. This also means you cannot scan photos, business cards or receipts in the ADF, you must use the flatbed.<br/>- The "Scan to Computer" function is grossly under-supported. There is no Scan to Computer functionality for Mac OS--you must activate the scanner from the Mac in either Image Capture or HP Easy Scan. I recommend HP Easy Scan because of the Searchable Text function.<br/>- The printing drivers and scanning software on Windows systems is extremely slapdash. Windows 7 and some Windows 10 computers had a hard time finding the printer on the same Wi-Fi network. Once it was found, the Windows 7 computer took some time to locate the printer using HP Easy Scan/Scan to Computer. HP appears to have retired HP Easy Scan for their new "HP Smart" app for Windows 10 computers. But the new HP Smart app is also extremely buggy and may not find the printer, even when you type in the IPv4 address of the printer directly into it. The options on where to save the scanned files is also lacking. I set up 5 Windows Machines and 3 Macs to this printer for scanning--I spent 2 minutes on each Mac and about 20-30 minutes per Windows machine--including Windows 10! I do not have confidence in others to know the nuance for HP Easy Scan and HP Smart for scanning.<br/>- Cannot scan to network folders (i.e., if you have FTP or Shared Folders set up via your home office router, this cannot connect to them via SMB protocol). We don't need it since there is a shared public folder on one Windows machine where we'll save the Scanned Documents. It's a work around, sure, but it works.</span>

<span>Spoiler alert: I just buy HP printers but my review is not biased in fact the device in question has an initial defect that can provoke lots of headaches during the setup process.<br/><br/>HP always provide great products for the price paid, and you can see that the printer is very well built, the display is very convenient and easy to read. The touch screen is very responsive, however at times I had few issues where I was trying to type 2 and was recording 1. But other than that the touchscreen is really useful especially if you do not plan to use it at all with a computer - something that can be accomplished easily and quickly.<br/><br/>If your goal is to set it up straightly as a wireless printer, do not do that immediately, there is a very big issue in the firmware shipped in the printer. You will lose WiFi connectivity and none of your computer will recognize it as connected. Good news is that it can be easily fixed. Be ready to have an ethernet cable instead and connect it to your router, then perform a network setup and turn off Wireless.<br/><br/>What you need is the included HP Web Server active, then log in into the web panel and from there trigger a software update. It will take about 5 minutes to complete, restart your printer, activate the WiFi and pair it to your WiFi Router, disconnect the ethernet cable and voila! You will be ready to use your printer everywhere in your small office or home.<br/><br/>The printer receive data very quickly and it's able to print a regular color or black white document in just seconds, and the default regular quality is really good for all purposes printouts.<br/><br/>You can obviously decide to print using photo paper and the quality of the printouts is astonishing, you won't expect such quality from a OfficeJet and I was a bit concerned but after printing a photo with both the DeskJet and the OfficeJet I can see that the difference is really really minimal, I may see that the DeskJet print a little bit sharper, but it's not something you'll notice unless you have a good eye or a magnifier in your hands.<br/><br/>Something that I am really liking is the total full-duplex feature, meaning not only you can print 2 sides easily, but you can get 2 sided copies using the upper feeder. That is a very nice addition and also you can scan double sided/multipage documents easily also using the upper feeder.<br/><br/>A difference I noticed between the OfficeJet and the DeskJet is that the software provided for this printer is bare-bone, nothing to scream about. The only mention I may have is the OCR, which is a nice addition but nothing really big. Also, the drivers and control panel design is really "office" oriented, there are not the same amount of options that you will find for a DeskJet. I know, I understand that HP meant all this to be easy-as-possible to avoid distractions to business-oriented-minds but it's also true that regular retail users and home users may buy this printer thinking about "home" usage... Maybe HP can learn and offer different drivers depending the situation, but this is not topic of this discussion.<br/><br/>It is important to underline I successfully configured this printer on a Mac, 2 Windows laptops, 1 Linux laptop, 1 ChromeBook and 2 Android devices. While it's frustrating the fact that the interfaces are all different, it's nice to know that Google Cloud Printing is fully functional and supported, and that I can print photos of my outdoor escapades from my android device and finding them already printed when I get home!<br/><br/>Inside the box you won't find an ethernet cable nor a usb cable, so if your plan is to connect to a router or directly to a computer via USB be ready to have such cables with you, also do not use the CD to install software to your computer because it's also outdated, once you got the printer connected and you are ready to install it, in your windows pc or macintosh, visit the following url [...] - Follow the simple instructions and you will get the all the required updated software. Notice: The printer itself will recommend this step from the display.<br/><br/>Another nice addition, not really useful but still an addition. This printer has sound, yes. Each action is accompanied by soft tone. In the eventuality that you don't like to listen any noise coming from the printer you can just disable sounds and activate also quiet mode, which will slow down the operations but will make the printer extremely quiet.<br/><br/>It has a FAX, I tried just once to send a fax to the office and process is really easy, straightforward. You can configure it to work on a dedicated fax line or sharing it with regular telephone line. If you select the second option, the printer I suppose will ring along with your phone but as I haven't received any fax, I cannot say how it rings. Being an HP product I suppose it will just work fine and as expected.<br/><br/>All in all, although the installation process is a bit tedious the printer is really top notch, good printout quality, easy of use (once configured) and a plethora of useful features make this a great catch, a printer you should buy for home or for your small office! Plus, it's an HP printer! Quality is assured, it uses 4 separate cartridges, which someone said it's bad while instead is a great plus and furthermore each cartridge is really affordable, HP support in my experience is awesome... so, hit the buy now button! It's the printer you need.</span>

<span>I've always bought HP printers but decided to try this Epson printer. The initial set up took longer than the HP by 3-4 times. The printer had trouble finding my wifi network but then finally seemed to be happy. I printed a few things on it and then a week or two later I needed to use the scan feature. The printer was off the network again and couldn't locate it. I finally deleted and re-added the printer and all was well for another couple of weeks. Then my power went out briefly and the printer went off the wifi yet again, and wouldn't reconnect. I re-added the printer again. My daughter tried to airprint to my printer with her phone and was unable to connect to it. I am trying again today to print with it and it wont acknowledge my wifi at all. My computer sits next to the printer, happy as can be on the wifi, with strong signal. The epson printer sits in the same spot I've always put the HP printers and they always had strong wifi signal. I'm past my return period on this printer and very frustrated. The only plus is that when it did work, it was fast and printed with quality.</span>

<span>I haven't had any issues with wifi disconnecting but I had a previous epson printer and I had changed some settings on my router that I think is why I don't have any problems. I didn't install any software, I just plugged it in, connected to internet and started using it. I have printed from my phone several times. I don't plan on installing software or doing any uppdates. I buy name brand ink anyways but I think sometimes even from Amazon, you get a fake. I think this is why my last printer turned into a brick, probably bad ink. It wasn't worth replacing all the cartridges to find out. My last printer last 8 years so was a good run.<br/>I didn't even have to wake it up.</span>

<span>Shame on me for not doing detailed research before purchase.  The 3820 ADF doesn't allow automatic 2 sided to 2 sided copy, something I do frequently.  Worse, it seems that the Epson 3820 won't even allow the ADF to be used for manual 1-2 or 2-2 sided copying. Rather, I discovered, for 1-2 or 2-2 sided input copying, documents must be placed on the scanner glass, one side at a time, following display prompt.  It's an awkward but effective work around, and surprising since the Epson 3620 I replaced did 2 sided auto ADF, and, as I recall 1 - 2 sided manual using the ADF with a prompting scheme.  That said, the printer does a credible job printing text, is fairly quiet, set up was straight forward and worked as expected. One other thing that should be pointed out, I don't think the 3820 is intended for printing photographs.</span>

<span>I've had this for a little more than a week now and have to say that it prints fast and the output is clear and crisp (for the text-only printing I do).<br/><br/>But, after getting it all set up and working fine with wifi, I was able to print for a day, came back a few days later and the wifi connection was lost.  The only way I could get it back again was to reinstall the drivers.  NOT ACCEPTABLE, since this has already happened more than once in the short time I've had it.<br/><br/>So, for me the wifi was a nice feature, but not a deal-breaker.  I decided to go the ethernet route.  That worked fine for a couple of days...even this morning...then, when I tried to print another document an hour or so later, it just said the document couldn't be printed.  Turned the printer off and on and the document printed out.  Also NOT ACCEPTABLE.<br/><br/>I will not "settle" for these workarounds every time the printer loses wifi connection or the ethernet option fails to print.  This printer will be going back and I'll probably buy a printer with a better name behind it.  Pretty hard to find here, though.  Seems like almost every printer shown in a decent price range is a Pantum.<br/><br/>Oh, and I just barely got the reply from their tech support today.  I sent them an email the same day I got the printer and had the initial wifi failure...November 3.  More than a week for a response from a tech support team is also NOT ACCEPTABLE, especially not with a brand new purchase.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah.  It also curls both ends of every page.  The internal temperature while printing is probably way too high.<br/><br/>Got flooded in so I wasn't able to return this printer yet and had a chance to try out the ADF scanning.  Kind of a joke.  It only feeds 6 or 7 pages reliably before it starts cutting off one end of the scans.  It did scan 7 pages a couple of times before it starting cutting off the ends, but I scan copies that are two pages each, so 6 in the feeder is all I could manage at a time.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I'd say skip this Pantum printer.  Probably others of theirs, too, since they're most likely made from the same overall "design" and parts.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>As I said, this one only handles about 6 or 7 sheets in the sheet feeder when scanning before it starts to misfeed and cut off part of the pages after that.  Also, doing a B&amp;W scan at 300 DPI, at 6 pages it would start to pause halfway through the page as it was probably saving to memory.  It took about 5 or so seconds until it scanned the next page, but that 5 seconds starts to add up quickly when you have a lot of pages to scan.<br/><br/>The Brother MFCL2710DW all-in-one that I bought here to replace this Pantum printer has been working flawlessly since I bought it.  Easy to set up as a network wired printer, no loss of connection problems, prints fast, nice output, and it will scan fifty B&amp;W 300 DPI letter-sized pages without interruption.<br/><br/>So, finally, SKIP THE PANTUM FAMILY OF PRINTERS ALTOGETHER.<br/><br/>EDIT #2:<br/><br/>Just wanted to say how glad I am that I returned this printer and got the Brother instead.  The Brother has been printing flawlessly.  No network/wireless disconnections at all.  Starts up every time right off the bat.</span>

I only use it via USB to my PC and set up was a breeze. So far so good. It does what you need it to do. Copy, Print &amp; Scan perfectly. Brother, Canon, HP, and Epson can go kick rocks. Printing is old technology that should be cheap and widely available to everyone. This is the best option if you just need black &amp; white prints.

<span>I've been running this printer for about a week now. Setup was fairly smooth and it connected to Wifi easily. Print quality is okay, although I wish it printed a bit darker--it's readable, but it almost looks like the toner is low, which is odd on a new machine. Figuring out how to scan was way more difficult than it needed to be. I finally got it to work over AirPrint, which is fine, but the online manual didn't have troubleshooting options when the expected result wasn't what displayed on the screen. I've also gotten several "paper tray empty" errors when the tray clearly has paper in them (solved by just opening and shutting the tray, error disappears).

<span>Needed a new printer. My old HP inkjet was going through ink too quickly, and not printing so clearly, at that. I always had HP inkjet printers; thought that I would get another. But I read a Consumer Reports article that helped to assess what type of printer bests suits one's needs. Given that I did not need photo quality printing, nor color, I determined that a laser printer was better for me. This one was recommended by Consumer Reports. Bought it. It was not too difficult to set up, and I am a 64 year-old nominal tech user. Took a little longer to understand how to make a two-sided printout from 2 single side sheets, but I got it.<br/><br/>I really like this machine. Seem very solid, durable. It is easy to use, whether printing something off my laptop, or making copies. Love the ease of printing double-sides from the laptop. Very good quality prints. I do not know how long my drum of ink will last, but I have to think it is more economical than inkjet cartridges. I have yet to use the scan function, so I cannot rate that.<br/><br/>Regarding the price. The Consumer Reports article, which was published at the beginning of 2022, said that the price was about $220.00. Perhaps because of supply chain issues, I had trouble finding this model, and many of the other recommended ones, anywhere. I found this on Amazon for $330.00 in April.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Let's cut to the chase. DO NOT BUY AN HP PRINTER. Not only is their software abyssmal, but the biggest, most egregious design is that it REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION AND HP ACCOUNT TO USE THE SCANNER, AND THEIR SERVERS ARE ATROCIOUS AND DON'T CONNECT HALF THE TIME. Either through smartphone or directly attached to a computer, it still REQUIRES you to login to SCAN. If your office environment has no internet connection or the internet has been knocked out, you are forked. And even with internet, there's no guarantee it will work. I literally spent all day yesterday trying to connect to the HP servers to SCAN something. It just kept spinning and spinning and spinning indefinitely, trying to login, but failing, and thus I could never scan anything. I'm literally better off with my phone's camera. Let me repeat. HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS PRINTER IS BROKEN IF YOU CAN'T CONNECT TO HP. It finally decided to pity me just now and actually connected and I was able to scan something, so I know it CAN work, but will it when I need it to? My cousin has the same issue with her HP printer of a different model. Have a deadline? Need to quickly scan something? You are at the mercy of the HP gods and their whims and vagaries. I'm not feeling peachy today. It's break the servers for the next 48hrs so you can't scan. Because I revel and delight in your misery.<br/><br/>Many people in the other reviews have already complained about the philosophical aspect of this. Not only is it a failiure on a reliability and depeendability standpoint (brings me back to when Microsoft wanted an always on connection for the Xbox, shudders, because fork the troops in a warzone wanting to decompress with some gaming), but the practice is extremely anti-consumer, and it's only real purpose on a PRINTER of all things, is to invade your privacy, sending metrics and data and even copies of your scans and prints to HP.<br/><br/>I've hated printers all my life. Canon, Pantum, Brother, etc. If it didn't take ten years to setup or install, the software bugging out halfway, not connecting, or failing, it would otherwise be throwing errors during print, disconnecting from networks, printing smeared text, clogging cartridges, and a million other issues. They are literally designed as machines of misery. But this is the first time I've had to deal with a printer that was also openly hostile OUTSIDE of the printer itself, a flaky and shady middleman known as HP you have to connect to, an imaginary exec at the company I am reminded of every time I use the printer, that I want to tar and feather.<br/><br/>Now that the most pressing issue has been expounded on, here is the more mundane but still useful part of the review, with plenty and plenty more negatives. The box and printer are adequately packaged, but the documentation is also an utter failure. They give you a useless CD, along with some very poorly printed instructions on how to remove the plastic seals for the toner and turn on the printer. That's it. No explanation of what any of the buttons do. How to print multiple copies. How to put on standby. How to manually scan, how to adjust print and copy settings, etc. Absolutely nothing. My other equally cheap if not cheaper all-in-one printers had these.<br/><br/>The first giant hurdle outside of connecting to the HP servers mentioned above, was even connecting to the WIRELESS printer at all. It's SO EASY. Just connect to the HP SMART app. Tap a few buttons and that's it! Modern technology is so SMART, am I right? WRONG. Searching for the printer in the app, it spins for a few seconds. NOTHING. Try it again over and over again, plugging and unplugging the printer, turning on and off your wifi, bluetooth, location, everything else, nothing. This is already a sign of a trash app. When it tells you that it needs bluetooth and location even though the app doesn't ask for these permissions in the phone, because it is lazily written as a one size fits all design that doesn't care what model you have.<br/><br/>It won't connect. Now what? There's another open to connect to it directly. It uses WIFI Direct to turn your phone into a mini hotspot to connect to the printer. Okay now it finally connects. Now what? It wants to search for available networks nearby to connect to your home wifi. Except it literally stops trying after two seconds and shows zero networks. There are at least a dozen other networks around my house from the neighbors outside. Not a single one listed. It feels like it's broken as well. Like thw WIFI is nonfunctional. Maybe because it's using this WIFI Direct method? Who the hell knows. The HP support online is utterly useless. People asking questions about setting up or changing WIFI with canned responses from HP forums. This was my biggest headache before the HP login issues started rearing it's ugly head.<br/><br/>The HP support is so useless, it will even tell you to use WIFI Direct to connect to the printer and to manually change the WIFI settings through the online interface. I would have LOVED to do this in the first place, and I've done it on my old printers, instead of using the worthless HP SMART app setup, which is so barebones and simplified it thinks it's SMARTER than you and can handle everything on it's own but utterly craps out in the end. There's a little problem with this approach. One method is to use Wifi Direct and connect directly to the printer from your phone wifi settings, completely bypassing the app. The problem is, it is labeled as SETUP instead of Wifi Direct like the instructions say, and all browser connections are refused when trying to access the online interface. Second, the techs online are too stupid to know that you are connecting via a DHCP connection, meaning the IP address they give you, 192.168.233.1, is WRONG. It actually starts at 100 and varies. Which doesn't really matter since the printer refuses the connection anyway. The other method is to use the app and to choose WIFI Direct to connect directly to your phone and print directly without a home wifi. This method can also be used to access the online interface. However, there is NO WIFI Direct option anywhere in the app, which is a literal big button in the screenshots the online instructions provide. This is presumably a different type of Wifi Direct from the SETUP version mentioned previously, and would have allowed direct access to the printer. This function literally does not exist in the app. I absolutely hate when online guides made by some manufaturer tell you about obsolete or removed functionality in their app. It's so EASY! Just follow the guide! Even though the guide looks nothing like the app and the app has none of these menus or features. Want to directly connect to your printer from your phone to print or scan because you don't have a home network available? You are also screwed because we removed that feature as well, including the ability to acces the online interface this way! Kill two birds with one stone! Literally. Both are dead.<br/><br/>How did I finally manage to setup wifi on the printer you ask? Well let's start by saying, I have a MESH NETWORK. Specifically, any router that is dual band (2.4/5Ghz) that uses an identical SSID for both will cause certain older Wifi devices to crap out and not see them. HOWEVER, this is only an issue if you cannot manually input your SSID and password, which is the case for the utterly worthless HP SMART app, which is anything but SMART. I can't believe in 2022, mesh networks being sold at Walmart and Target for years and years already, and a big company like HP still can't accomodate or detect them. I finally connected it directly via USB to my computer (thank God I have a computer!) and was able to manually input the network info through the Windows Store version of the useless HP Smart app. I also immediately removed it from my computer and all traces of HP. Why you ask? Because the thing will literally crash when trying to scan something. Here's the hierarchy of apps in general, for those who haven't figured it out yet. The best one will always be the iOS one. The second, much worse, buggy version, the one I've been fighting with, is the Android version. And then we have the runt of the litter. The Windows Store version. The app storefront that everyone shuns. The lowest, trashiest version of an app will exist here, and that's saying a lot for an already pathetic app like the HP SMART app. It's only saving grace was at least having the option to input wifi manually. That's it. Remove it immediately afterwards. You are better off with third party software that utilizes your printer and scanner on the computer, not to mention it doesn't require a dreaded failed HP login.<br/><br/>Let's reiterate. You CAN setup wifi on a mesh network or a dual-band network. Ignore what some of the reviews here have said and especially the utterly incompetent HP tech responses you see when searching google. The caveat is you need a physical computer to set it up and enter the network info manually with the Windows Store version of the HP Smart app.<br/><br/>And how about performance? The printer seems to print sharp enough. Since I mainly use my phone, and am forced to use the HP Smart app, which is rudimentary at best and full of issues like the forementioned login issue, it's about what you expect from a low quality printer app. The scanning feature will always try to auto-detect the border, and turn any document into a five star christmas topper, which adds an extra layer of work to define the borders yourself and undo the apps own worthlessness. The other "tiles" in the app are full of self-promotion and wheeling and dealing to make you buy more HP products or services. Even the order and stability of the tiles and interface keep changing and the app freezing or stuttering, as if the app couldn't get any worse. Thankfully, I only need to scan occasionally, and mostly just use the print function from pdfs, which don't require the dreaded app and only need a print service plugin.<br/><br/>The hardware itself seems very modern and advanced. It's half the size and half the weight of my old brother printer/scanner and even the scanning mechanism is much quieter as well. This would have been a great printer if not for the SOFTWARE and awful marketing and business decisions involved. I stand by my initial statement though. Do not buy this. Do not support such a crap product from a crap company. If you do, the next product will require an HP chip to be implanted into your body to authenticate printer use, and even then, it will continue to fail half the time, all the while pestering you to buy more ink toner and recommending HP health services from your biometric data. You seem anemic. Would you like another round of HP's human ink toner? It only has a 50% chance of not killing you, but it's highly rated on Amazon!</span>

<span>I've researched this purchase carefully. I don't need color, I print and copy only occasionally and don't want ink cartridges that dry out. It was a simple decision to get a "home-office, all-in-one" laser printer. The HP Laserjet MFP M140we is the sweet spot for price/performance/features/size/convenience in this category.<br/><br/>I studied the "HP Smart" registration and installation process when analyzing this selection. It is somewhat intrusive, but comprehensive (be careful of what you sign up for - there's lots of fine print). This is where some reviewers get hung up. That said;<br/><br/>The MFP M140we was installed by carefully following the instructions in the HP Smart program. I had to jump through a few hoops to install HP software on each device I wanted to print from. It takes an hour, or more, to set up completely if all goes well. But now I have a nice printer that is compct, economical and performs well.<br/><br/>Text quality is typical 600dpi (it looks great). Photos are rendered in very fine grayscale gradients. You will find a little graininess in some near-white areas (snow). But the detail is very good.<br/><br/>If this is reliable for the next few years, I'd give the printer 5 stars for price/performance. The HP registration/installation process, I rate 3 stars. Bottom line: 4 stars.<br/><br/>If you don't mind diving into a complex registration and installation process, the HP Laserjet MFP M140we is a great home printing resource.<br/><br/>Updated:<br/><br/>After a week with this printer I have some concerns.<br/><br/>When printing from an Android tablet or phone, the page layout may not be correct. Part of the first page may get appended to the bottom of the last page when printing from some muli-page emails or .PDF files.<br/><br/>When printing from an Android device, the HP M140we printer is listed four times. All but the top selection is "not available at this time".<br/><br/>When printing from a multi-page .PDF file from an Android app and selecting just one, or a few pages to print, all pages are printed instead.<br/><br/>After installing the "HP printing service" on a Windows 11 PC, I've seen the screen display of GoogleMail show page layout source code instead of the correctly formatted display.<br/><br/>Printing from MS office, Google Photos or Adobe Acrobat has been fine from both a PC and Android.<br/><br/>Whether these problems are operating system errors or it's the HP printing service, is unknown. But, the bottom line is:<br/>The HP printer interface is not robust. Cannon, Epson and Brother print systems have not performed as poorly on these devices.<br/><br/>And, reporting these problems to HP has been prohibitive.</span>

<span>I tried the M140we to replace the workhorse HP multifunction printer that got my 5 kids through high school and college, and this didn't fit the bill. Ultimately, it feels too light-duty for our usage and my wife wanted an autofeeder for scanning. I went with another HP autofeed multifunction printer model M234sdwe.<br/><br/>I was apprehensive that the documentation stated it required internet connectivity and an HP account to work, but once it was connected to wifi, I aborted the setup program and it worked fine without an account. Was able to print and scan using the built-in Windows scanning app. Maybe that setup wouldn't work in the long run. We'll find out with the M234sdwe.</span>

<span>Wow, I am impressed with this new all-in-one Brother printer.  I just retired an older version of this (MC-J825DW) due to worn out printer heads.  This one is a vast improvement, not only in print quality but also in speed of printing.  The price was so inexpensive, compared to what I paid for my older version of this all-in-one.  I got ten years of service out of my older printer (the MC-J825DW) so I hope to see that kind of longevity with this one!  The delivery was speedy...just three days from my ordering it (I do have Prime).  It's ALL GOOD!!</span>

<span>I just got and set up this little, inexpensive printer. It wasn't very hard although the wireless setup took some time to figure out. Once it worked wirelessly, i was pretty happy.<br/><br/>Ive been using a Canon for years and buying off brand ink. Works fine. But there is none available for this new Brother!<br/><br/>I realized that it's a decent printer for very low cost because Brother will make all the money on INK. Luckily i don't use a printer much.</span>

<span>Been trying to find a printer for my basic school print jobs and I got a Canon at first which didn't want to connect to either my phone or computer.  It was also purely wireless which didn't help at all.  This Brother printer however, didn't want to connect to my dorm's wifi network either BUT it does have a USB option to wire it directly to my computer which is hard to find these days.  This is ultimately what saved me from returning this printer as well.  So happy to have a personal printer :)</span>

<span>I like this printer it prints clear and has easy features like scan and wireless connection. But since i did read the reviews before i bought this printer i decided to get the printer usb cord just in case it disconnects to the wireless and i subscribed to brother ink subscription just incase i run out of ink fast also got the 4 year warranty, these 3 things i m praying make my brother printer experience good</span>

<span>When my HP 8610 died, I decided not to pay the $87 for a new print head. Afterall, for $12 more I could buy a new printer, right? Well, I bought the inexpensive HP 4100, and boy, do I miss my old printer. This new one just feels cheap. The plastic seems to be thinner. It doesn't have a paper tray but a slot, which on one hand you can see how much paper you have left, but then the paper gets dusty and has to be lined up in the slot. There's no memory card slot which was great for cameras and tablets but the instructions say it has a USB port for transferring info, not for installation. I came to the realization that I didn't need a fax machine; I don't have a land line, and who does. Scanning is just another word for printing unless you're making pdfs. So, I really didn't need a more advanced printer. This one will print my recipes and letters just fine. I have only printed one page and it was perfect. This little machine will suit me just fine. My only disappointment is that is doesn't have a sleep cycle. I left my old printer always turned on and it would cycle itself into a sleep mode. This one doesn't.  I'm anxious to see how long the ink lasts. I enrolled in the HP Smart Ink plan, six months free, and 99 cents a month for 10 pages. Would I buy this printer again? If I had the money, I'd have probably upgraded, but for the kind of printing I do, I just couldn't justify spending the extra bucks. And yes, I love HP printers because of the tech support and service. I've never owned a bad HP product.</span>

<span>Was easy to set up. I suggest you download the “HP Smart” app on every device you plan to print 🖨️ from. It makes it so much easier. I even downloaded the app to my kids devices so there is no issues. I placed the printer 🖨️ in the spare bedroom so that it’s easily accessible to all of us. That’s the best part of it being wireless. It helps if you have a decent Router with an extender which helps with the wi-if that you will need for setting up and printing🖨️.<br/>The print 🖨️ quality is nice for a desktop. Pretty close to laser (see pictures).<br/><br/>Price and product are a definite match.👍<br/>(The product is well made, exactly what is advertised and is priced as it should be in MY OPINION.)</span>

<span>This printer worked great until my 6-month free ink trial period expired and I cancelled the program.  Now it will not print, tells me the ink is incompatible.  It is the ink HP sent me while I was in the trial period.  I have totally uninstalled the printer and now it will not re-install due to incompatible ink!!!!!  I am using the printer with an Apple Imac.</span>
