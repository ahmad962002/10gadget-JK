As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

<span>I didn’t have high expectations for the visibility of this watch after my last g shock. That one had an orange light and the hands were nearly impossible to see in the dark. This is so much better - the light is white for one, so it actually illuminates the face as opposed to the orange light of the other model. Also the hands and hour markers are very visible due to the contrast of the metallic finish against the black face and dial. Setup was easy and intuitive, I didn’t even need the booklet. Digital display is also much clearer than my other model g shock. I highly recommend this watch if you’ve previously been disappointed in the visibility on other g shocks. Now it’s no indiglo by any stretch of the means, but maybe the next best from a visibility standpoint.</span>

Cristal abombado muy bonito,eso sí acrílico,no hay problema si se ralla ,se pule con alguna pasta tipo poliwatch y ya está ,el cuerpo de resina muy ligero . Y la luz no es luz, es una antorcha...puff!! como ilumina ,es bestial , perfecto para sitios poco iluminados o momentos en que haga falta alumbrar . Si quieres gastarte más por un bertucci adelante están muy chulos ,pero si te gusta este diseño no lo pienses es muy bonito .</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I am coming from a 2 year old Fitbit Ionic that isn't working well any longer.  Garmin is one of the big names in fitness tracking, so I thought I would give them a try.  So far I've tried the Fenix 6s Pro and the Venu.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about the Venu.  The screen is very bright and colorful.  I had some concerns that because it is an OLED screen, it would be difficult to see in direct sunlight.  There was no need to worry about that, however, as it is easy to see even with the sun directly overhead.  Unfortunately, Garmin is under-utilizing the screen technology pretty badly.  There are not a lot of good watch faces available.  One would expect that to change, though, as the watch becomes more popular. Though not as robust as the Fenix 6s Pro, the Venu has more fitness metrics than I know what to do with.  What it has is perfect for my fitness regimen.  Though the Fenix 6s Pro was a nice watch, it was too much for me.  The Venu fits perfectly with what I need and is so much more than my Fitbit ever was.<br/><br/>Where it falls down, at least for me, is in heart rate measurement.  It simply is not accurate.  To test this out, I spent a lot of time taking my heart rate manually and checking it against the Venu.  When sedentary, it is pretty close.  But as soon as I get up and move around, the Venu displayed a much higher heart rate than it should have.  I'd stand up and walk 10 feet and the Venu would display 101 as my heart rate.  When I took it manually, it was 77.  It was also badly inaccurate when working out with weights or pull-ups.  In those cases, it measured way too low.  One great thing is that a separate heart rate monitor can be attached to it.  I bought one and use it whenever I am doing any exercise.  Oh, and the one place where the heart rate does appear accurate is when walking or hiking.  Strange as it is to say, my old Fitbit Ionic did a better job of measuring heart rate on a consistent basis than any other device I've ever had.<br/><br/>Another complaint is just the layout of the menus and options on the watch.  None of it is particularly well thought out or easy to work through.  Different items are not where you would expect them and it took some time to figure out where different settings were located.  Fortunately, Garmin has great instruction manuals available online.  After a while, I got used to where to find everything.  And this complaint extends to the Garmin Connect app itself.  All of the settings are buried in different watch independent and dependent menus and it's a guess where anything is.  It took some time to work through that as well and I still find myself hunting around for things a month later.  The display of the fitness data, however, is great.  Everything can be found in Garmin Connect and on their website.<br/><br/>Sleep tracking on this watch is just plain poor.  Ridiculously, embarrassingly  bad.  There were nights when it recorded just a minute or two of awake time.  I am not a good sleeper and I routinely have over an hour of awake time each night.  This is one area in which Fitbit devices excelled.  After two nights, I started taking the watch off at night and putting it on the charger.  And I had to turn it off, otherwise it still recorded sleep when not being worn.<br/><br/>The other measurement that is very important to outdoor activities is GPS and I can say after using it for a while that it is very accurate.  Especially coming from an Ionic where it would routinely be a quarter of a mile off in either direction at any time.  The Venu will measure the same walking path within a couple of a hundredths of a mile each and every time.  As I stated earlier, there are two Venu watches being used in my home.  They usually show the exact same distance.  This is about as good as it gets and was a nice surprise after being on the Fitbit for so long.<br/><br/>Regarding connectivity between the device and my phone, I had no problem.  It connected immediately and stayed connected.  Notifications came through with no problem.  It is easy to set up notifications for only certain apps, all apps, or just to completely shut it off.  The one negative that I noticed is that the bluetooth does not have the range of other devices connected to my phone.  For it to be reliable, you have to keep the phone pretty close.  This isn't a big deal for many people, but it was a bit bothersome for me as I tend to keep my phone on the charger in a different room.  One thing that I did almost immediately was shut off the not connected notification because it was going off frequently when I'd walk away from my phone.  It got annoying.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Plenty of fitness metrics.<br/>Battery life on it really is great and lives up to the Garmin hype.  It does last days, even with a decent amount of GPS use.<br/>The GPS is spot on.<br/>Great, easy to read screen.  No need to worry about visibility in even the brightest of sunlight.<br/>Very light and comfortable on the wrist.  I have a more slender wrist and it still fits well.  For the size of the watch, I would have expected it to be heavier but they use some lightweight materials in the case.  In spite of that, it feels sturdy.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>At least for me, the heart rate monitoring was badly off, and an inaccurate heart rate can lead to other inaccurate metrics.  Searching the forums and the Garmin subreddit, I do see others complaining about it as well.<br/>Sleep tracking simply does not work.  I no longer use it because there just wasn't any point.<br/>The layout of the menu needs a rework.  It is not intuitive and there is a bit of a learning curve to learn where everything is located.<br/>The screen is very nice, but Garmin is not taking full advantage of it.  They could do so much more with it, but it has the same layout as all other Garmin watches of its type, including colors.  Hopefully in the future, Garmin will take more advantage of the technology that it offers.<br/>Bluetooth stays connected very well, but at a shorter range than typical bluetooth devices.  I have to stay closer to my phone for a reliable connection.<br/><br/>I still haven't decided if I am going to keep it or not.  An inaccurate heart rate is a pretty big deal for a fitness watch.  The thing is, I am not sure what else is out there that is better.  The fitbit that I'm coming from had so many problems that it was not worth it.  Keeping it connected to my phone reliably was a daily challenge.  And Fitbit devices seem to last until just after the warranty expires.  I'm also trying out a Samsung Active 2, but that isn't really as geared toward fitness as they'd like you to think.  They're more concerned with the smart watch aspect of it.  So in the end, this watch might be the best solution.<br/><br/>One other thing - make sure to get a screen protector for it.  It is one big piece of glass and according to my research the Gorilla Glass that they use on it isn't the most scratch resistant.  You will be touching the screen a lot and it will end up scratched.  Unfortunately there aren't a lot of good screen protector options out there.  I just picked up one of the cheap film protectors to cover it until something better comes along.</span>

<span>UPDATED REVIEW (after 1 month of use):<br/><br/>I received the watch on 12/16/19.  As of today, 2/5/20, I still love this watch.  It's exactly what I was hoping for; no disappointment or regrets.<br/><br/>Great Battery Life:<br/>--- Depending on how you use the watch, you can get a week's worth of use out of it before charging.<br/>--- I used to wear the watch every night to capture sleep data, but I have a pretty consistent pattern of sleep.  So after a couple weeks, I actually started turning the watch off at night while I'm sleeping to conserve battery life.<br/>--- I only use the heart rate monitor right before, during, and right after workouts.  Otherwise, I keep it off.<br/>--- If you play music straight from your watch, it drains the battery fairly quickly.  As an example, during a 45 min run outside, I had GPS on, heart rate on, and I was playing music straight from the watch.  Within that 45 min span, my battery dropped by 12%.  If I just use GPS and heart rate, the battery might only drop by about 3% during that same 45 min span.  So, if I run inside on a treadmill, I'll just play music from my phone via bluetooth.  If I run outside, I'll leave my phone at home and will use the music I downloaded to the watch.<br/>--- You can decide which notifications you want to appear.  I only turned on the notifications that I deem important (i.e. Text Messages, phone calls) and kept the rest turned off.  I'm using this watch to track my fitness, not to keep updated about Facebook or anything of that nature.<br/>--- Keep in mind that everyone's experience will be different.  I can regulary get 5 - 7 days of battery life, but someone else may only get 1 or 2 days.  It's all about how you use the watch.<br/><br/>Fitness Tracking/Virtual Coach/Garmin Dashboard:<br/>--- The Garmin Dashboard (app) is pretty sleek and it's easy to see your workout data and steps.<br/>--- I don't know any other Garmin users, but the Garmin Dashboard has a weekly step challenge that puts you in a group with other Garmin users based on your level of activity.  I started at the 30k steps per week challenge group and am now in the 70k steps per week challenge group.  It's nice having a little friendly competition with people I don't know.<br/>--- I just got started back into running again.  I'm using the virtual coach to get myself ready for a 5k in March.  Out of all the other virtual coaches I've tried to use, this has been the best experience.  After I entered some personal data, I got to pick between 3 different coaches.  Each coach had a bio and explained their approach to the training plan.  The coach I selected has me running 3 days per week.  Each workout is different.  I've done Run/Walk, Speed Repeats, Hill Repeats, the Magic Mile, Drill Workouts, etc.  After 7 weeks of a 13 week training plan, my average pace has dropped dramatically and I am on pace to reach my goal of running a 5k in 28 mins or less.  It's been so easy to follow and instructions are provided for each type of workout (job aids and/or videos).<br/>--- I like that you can only start and stop your activity by pushing the buttons on the side of the watch even though it has a touchscreen.  This just means that if I accidentally bump the watch face while running, it won't stop my run.  A previous watch I owned from a different company would only allow you to start/stop activities from the watch face.  It was a horrible experience.  I'm glad Garmin did not adopt that approach.<br/>--- The GPS is accurate from what I've seen.<br/>--- I'm sure the step count isn't perfect, but it gives you a good idea of how active you were for the day.<br/>--- You can sync your activity with Strava and Nike Plus.  After my run is over, as long as I'm near my phone, the activity will sync automatically.<br/><br/>Notifications:<br/>--- The notifications appear immediately as expected and they are easy to dismiss or remove.<br/>--- If I have my bluetooth turned on, I can answer the phone from my watch.<br/><br/>Music:<br/>--- I have an Amazon Music account, and Amazon syncs up with the Gamin Venue.  Any song that I download to my playlist on Amazon will sync over to the watch.  It's a seamless process.<br/>--- You cannot stream music from apps like Pandora.  But, if you have mp3 files of your music, you can download those to your watch.  I have an iTunes account.  I pulled the mp3 files from some of the songs I purchased and downloaded them to my watch.  Easy process.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>--- The one piece of negative feedback that I have is that you CANNOT manually pause your workout.  There is an AutoPause feature, but it doesn't work that great.  I would rather be able to pause on my own, but there's no option for it.  The top right button on the watch starts and stops your activity.  The bottom right button is your Lap button.  I'm hoping Garmin does a firmware update in the future that enables manual pausing during activities.<br/>--- This used to be a con, but was fixed by Garmin in January 2020.  There was an issue with the heart rate monitor.  If you turned it off, it wouldn't actually go off.  It kept running.  Instead, you had to restart the watch every time you wanted to turn off the heart rate monitor.  But, as mentioned before, Garmin fixed this in January 2020.  I can now turn off the heart rate monitor without restarting the watch.<br/><br/>I am glad I decided to purchase the Garmin Venue.  It looks good on my wrist, it has solid performance, and it doesn't lag like other watches I've seen.  I'm very happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>INITIAL REVIEW:<br/><br/>There's a lot to like about the Garmin Venue.  I received the watch on a Monday.  It had roughly 65% battery on it out of the box.  I didn't have to charge it until that Friday.  And it still had 20% battery when I decided to charge it.  I ran 2 days on the treadmill (40 mins on each run) using the run tracker.  I used the HR monitor every night while sleeping and sporadically during the day.  Yet, the battery didn't lose much power.  The only thing I found that really drains the battery is playing music from the watch.  I'm really loving the battery life!<br/><br/>The Venue resembles a normal watch for the most part.  This is something I was looking for in a smartwatch.  I didn't want something "boxy".  It's lightweight and looks normal on my wrist.  It's not bulky, nor is it tiny.<br/><br/>The tracking info seems to work as intended.  I don't need it to be exact; it just needs to give me a rough idea of how I'm doing each day.  Plus, it syncs easily with Strava and/or Nike Plus.<br/><br/>Bluetooth is easy to connect.  Notifications from my phone pop up immediately.  I have no complaints at all about this smartwatch.<br/><br/>If I remember, I'll stop back after a month or two of use to give an updated review.</span>

Born from a dream of "creating a watch that never breaks." It was over 30 years ago, a CASIO engineer won the battle against the laws of nature. He designed a watch that would resist centrifugal and impact forces, as well as high water pressure. Since then, the name G-SHOCK has become a byword for independence and pushing the limits. G-SHOCK watches are the most durable digital and analog-digital watches in the industry, trusted by military personnel, law enforcement, surfers and outdoor enthusiasts around the world. Along with this, G-SHOCK is highly touted in the fashion world, worn by icons in hip-hop, sports, and design. With limited edition collaborations being released often, you can always find a G-SHOCK that matches your personality and style.

For me, all the rest of the stuff (shock-resistance, water-resistance, solar power, digital display options, etc.) is a bonus: unexpected and nice to have at the price point I wanted.<br/><br/>CHARGING: There is a lot of fussy language in the documentation about exposing it to sun and keeping it charged. I don't think you need to worry about. On arrival mine had a middling charge. After only a couple hours outside, it was fully charged. The documentation says a fully charged watch can work up to 10 months without further light. So, don't drop it in a drawer and forget it--wear it once in a while and don't fret about charging.<br/><br/>SETUP:  It takes a while to set up (an hour or so) but that's expected for a multi-function digital watch. Once you figure out the buttons and how to cycle through the digital display menus, it's fairly easy.<br/><br/>CONS:  I have three small issues. One, the documentation that came with is VERY tiny print. (I assume there is a digital version that is easier to read.) Two, although the large analog display (the watch "hands") is large and easy to read, the digital display is tiny, hard to read, and parts of it are often hidden by the hands. Practically speaking, the digital display is mainly for setting the watch up, checking battery, etc., and occasional informal use of stopwatch, date, battery indicator, universal time, etc.  If you use such features a lot, you will find this watch frustrating and you should look for something else. Three, it's a little larger than I prefer, but that's not a huge issue.<br/><br/>OVERALL:  Assuming it holds up, and assuming you don't use the extra digital features a lot, it's a surprisingly good value for the price.</span>

<span>This is my second variation of this watch. It is comfortable, lightweight, robust, easy to read, and worry-free because of the solar charging. I have several watches, so these are in the rotation and don't see the light a whole lot, and the battery has never dropped below "mid" levels. It's the epitome of a set-it-and-forget-it kind of watch. I love it and would highly recommend it!</span>

Born from a dream of "creating a watch that never breaks." It was over 30 years ago, a CASIO engineer won the battle against the laws of nature. He designed a watch that would resist centrifugal and impact forces, as well as high water pressure. Since then, the name G-SHOCK has become a byword for independence and pushing the limits. G-SHOCK watches are the most durable digital and analog-digital watches in the industry, trusted by military personnel, law enforcement, surfers and outdoor enthusiasts around the world. Along with this, G-SHOCK is highly touted in the fashion world, worn by icons in hip-hop, sports, and design. With limited edition collaborations being released often, you can always find a G-SHOCK that matches your personality and style.

<span>This will be my second G Shock I have owned many casio watches over the last 30+ years. The 6900 is bit big and bulky (but I knew that when I ordered it). It's noticeably bigger than my 5600. I like the variety I will keep it. I ordered a 9052 last year and sent it back. The 6900 is more comfortable and doesn't have the annoying knobs (on the to and bottom - what it their purpose) and screws on the face of the watch commonly found on less expensive Casio watches. I would recommend the 6900 over the 9052, fits better, looks better. The two advantages I can think of over the 5600 are that the watch looks "cooler," that's subjective. There is a light button front and center. That's where the advantages end, the 5600 is lighter, fits better, and you get used to the light button on the bottom right it's easy to press. I like a little variety and the 6900 overall is a great addition to my small watch (I will only wear one at a time) collection. I'm going to try the Casio DW290-1V next. With these two classic G-Shocks I don't feel the need for another G-Shock, between the 5600 and the 6900 I'll only be wearing my other cheaper digital watches when I'm cutting the grass or performing some task where they might be damaged or scarred. Very Nice, the more I wear it (try it on) the more I like it (just got it yesterday). Another great Casio watch, the only one that can contest it as the best Casio I have ever owned is the  DW5600.</span>

  CasioWith the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

<span>Cheap, rugged, accurate, 10 year battery life, and 100m water resistance;  what's not to like?  I collect inexpensive (mostly Chinese built) watches, but all previous ones have had my preferred analog displays and few of them could begin to match the performance specs of this watch.  I treat them kindly, keep them away from water, and change their batteries every 1-2 years.  Be sure to ask for a discount at your battery replacement place.  I take in a dozen or so watches at a time and get the batteries replaced for half their normal charge.  Enter the Casio Men's W800H-1AV.  Fifteen bucks or so, accurate (I set it from and check it against my Casio Wave Ceptor), 100m water resistant, and 10 year battery life!  With those kind of specs, who needs solar or Atomic Clock updates?  I understand why it has such a long strap, but I found it a bit irritating.  A few seconds with a sharp knife cut it down to a length that doesn't wrap around my wrist and flop out on the other side.  But remember: "measure twice; cut once!"</span>

<span>I loved the look of this watch. It had the large face I was on looking for and the camo gave it a cool look I'd never had in a watch before. However, the actual dial where the time is was surprisingly small and when the light is turned on to read the watch in the dark, it shined directly at the time and made it unreadable.</span>

<span>This is an awesome looking watch! The camo design is incredible looking and gets noticed. Being retired Air Force, this watch was a must for me. It reflects pride in my service. Built tough, rugged, and I like the dual tang (two clasps in the band keeper instead of one.) It has several great features and is easy to set up, it took mere minutes. I read all the reviews before purchasing this watch, and several complained about the backlight function not lighting up the digital screen. It isn't supposed to guys! The only reason to use a backlight on a watch in the dark is to know what time it is, and the LED light on this watch lights up the hands just fine. That's all you need folks! If you MUST use a stopwatch or timer or set an alarm in darkness, then wear a different watch. This beautiful and unique timepiece is eye candy anyway, shown off during the daylight and believe me, it will get noticed. And yes, the digital screen is hard to read in lower light conditions, but again - that's not the primary function of this watch. Showing off that awesome camo pattern is!!! Plus, it's a G-Shock guys. Enough said... I love it!</span>

<span>Easy to read, nice timer, water resistance to 50m.<br/>Nice Big Watch, and easy to use.  Returned only because it was far to big for my husband.</span>

<span>My husband had been eyeing this watch for almost one year, before finally taking the plunge. I honestly like the "complete black" look- it's has a certain appeal to it. The only downside for him is the absence of a backlight, which means that if you want to read/ tell the time, you ma either 1. have to wear it in the daytime only AND/OR 2. wear it in well lit areas especially in the evening.<br/><br/>I gave it four stars for water resistance and timer function because my husband has not tested these features as yet. Still a good (bargain) buy nonetheless.</span>
