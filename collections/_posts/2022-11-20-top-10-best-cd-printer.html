CANON MX922 INKJET OFFICE ALL IN ONE PRINTER

<span>My old Canon MX922 finally gave out and after doing a great deal of research on more recent printers and finding that with supply chain issues it could be several months before a new printer arrived, I decided to look for another Canon MX922. Amazon had a seller with a new Canon and although it cost me nearly 4 times what it cost me initially, I purchased it. To me, it was worth the extra money. I really liked the features on my old Canon, especially the fact that you can use off-brand printer inks. It scans, prints, faxes, etc. I print a lot of documents and the print quality is excellent.</span>

<span>For the very first time, while dealing with Amazon third party seller,  we got a quite decent shipment and delivery handling. They said it would take up to four days to get it, but, Fedex put our printer at our  porch overnight. The box: neatly and appropriately presented. The setting up of the unit was somehow quite effortful for us - we are not that skilled on it, but, we got it. In this point, we called Canon support system but it was disheartening experience; the so-called  technician was overtly unsupportive and visibly unmotivated to help - "go to the web...look there for online  Canon manual" (!!?)<br/>Now we are using the fully operating and connected printer. It is, so far, a very good technological device in its genre, giving us what we expected from it. We hope it may  keep this outstanding features permanently; and, when we may need technical support later on, it would be good to find some better technician worthy of your corporation.</span>

<span>An update.<br/><br/>Downgraded the stars for this device.  The below review is still relevant however after only two years of excellent service I began receiving an error code eluding to the fact that my Print Head had died. I was under the impression that the print head was integrated into each ink cart rage however the tech folks at Canon tell me other wise.  After contacting tech support I was told that the machine needed a new Print Head for around $100.  It is not my policy to reward vendors who's products offer such a short MTBF (mean time between failures) however this had some other factors that made me take exception to my own policy.  Replacing the machine for less that the price of the part made since to me since I had no fewer than seven machines talking to this device.  Few printers offer the features that this printer offers in a price comparable to this one.  The fact that their tech support is outstanding and that I had a drawer full of replacement cartridges (cannot beat the Amazon price for replacement inks cartridges) pretty much made the decision a no brainer!<br/><br/>As usual the installation did not go as planned and after a cal to their tech support they had me up and running in no time.  Now all my devices find this network printer and we are going once again.<br/><br/>Note - the local Good Will does E recycling so that is where the dead printer ended up.<br/><br/>Let's hope we get more than two years out of this one!<br/><br/>2015 Review<br/><br/>For the average fellow who is not into solving puzzles or does not have a computer science degree I would offer the following sage advice.<br/><br/>Call their tech support at the toll free number listed and have him walk you through downloading the latest drivers from the internet.  If you know the necessary file names it goes fairly quickly.  You will then have the latest drivers for the printer.  The good news here is that the support is excellent, they are easy to reach, located in the US, and speak perfect English.  This type of support was a big surprise to me but highly appreciated.<br/><br/>Update 11 November<br/>Earned that last star by providing superb technical support.  I was having some issues with the photo printing tray.  The first tech support fellow walked me through the process and recommended some software application to assist me with the photo printing tray.  That software did not work and it may have caused some other issues.<br/>Called again and got a different fellow, who started me over from scratch.  This fellow really on his game!  Problems with long processing times, tray access and other things disappeared!<br/><br/>First impressions are often telling.<br/><br/>This thing is very large, be sure you have quite a bit of space.  It has amazing capabilities however the supplied documentation is very weak.  There was some papers in a package marked MP-101 however the instructions were not printed in english.  I found out later that these card stock pages were meant to be printed on during the setup phase.  Fortunately this is not mandatory for proper operation.  Much if the initial setup was handled from within the Printer showing step by step details on its LCD screen.<br/><br/>I found no issues with either of the paper trays, they are almost hidden in their location below the output port but they are easily removed and installed.  The paper tray will hold about a half a ream of paper which I believe is a very nice feature.  Though not silent, the noise during printing is at a level consistent with most modern printers.<br/><br/>Printing from the iPad was very straight forward and worked very well, no complaints there.<br/><br/>Used the copy function simply by purring the document in the document feeder and pushing the button.  Worked flawlessly !  It will even allow you to see a preview on the lcd.<br/><br/>The ink cartridges seemed quite substantial and I was able to order a replacement set on Amazon at a very reasonable price (somewhere in the $11 range I believe).  I do not fully understand the two black cartridges yet however the end result is very impressive.<br/><br/>Haven't tried scanning or double sided copying yet however I will revise this review once I have.  I am not sure I will ever use the FAX capabilities so I did not bother to connect that function.  However I looks like it goes beyond the average base line FAX machine.<br/><br/>If you have the room for it I believe this would be an excellent printer for the home office or even a shared printer on a LAN.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/>Large and in charge!  I have learned to love this printer.  After number reams of paper without any jamming or hit of a miscue and the inexpensive cartridges available make this a real winner.<br/><br/>It is easy to have issues with the software however the folks at Cannot provide the very best free technical service I have ever seen!  They are based in the US, speak preface English and really know their stuff.<br/><br/>A word of caution however, recently I made the mistake of looking up Cannon Support on the internet.  BIG MISTAKE!  The fellow that answered could barely speak English and took over my PC.  After roaming around in there he informed me I had a bad Virus and offer to fix it for over $100.  If you need assistance go to the number in your Printer Manual (1 800 OK CANNON) and they will help you for free.  I cannot say enough about their support.  My next printer will be a Cannon (if I manage to wear this one out).</span>

<span>I have owned and used the Canon MX922 for only a week, but I am very pleased with its performance -- especially since it saved my bacon in a business emergency.  I was preparing a complex 3-component mailing to about 100 recipients when my trusty 9-year old Canon iP4500 up and died (circuit board) on a Friday afternoon. I knew any repair would cost more than replacement, plus I had no time for that, so I logged on Amazon and checked out a variety of printer options ... and read the reviews.  I needed a full four-color printer with envelope-printing capability and also duplex capability (printing a 2-page letter on one sheet, both sides).  Despite a few mixed reviews on the MX922, I ordered it  Friday evening -- and it arrived on the following Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>The printer itself is larger than my old Canon iP4500.  The footprint is about the same, but the box is about 3 inches taller since it has the scanner and sheet feeder built in on top.  But I've actually saved desktop space ... since the scanner is built in to the MX922,  I no longer need the old flatbed scanner that previously took up a 10 x 17" footprint atop my desk.  BTW, I have had no need to use the scanner yet . . . so I will limit my comments here to printing use.<br/><br/>Set-up and re-orienting myself to a new printer took some time, perhaps an hour ... but no major hassles.  Like others, I found it easier to simply use a direct plug-in USB wire rather than fiddle with a WiFi WLAN hookup since my printer is immediately adjacent to my Mac computer.  I didn't bother to install the software CD.  Anytime I had a question, I simply asked it via Google and got answers right away.  My biggest challenge came with orienting the stationery in the print drawers properly -- making the tray adjustments for envelope-address printing, plus doing two different Mail Merges -- one for a 1-page personal-addressed reply form, a second for a 2-page personal-addressed cover letter.  I simply tested each document with a one-off proof and was good to go.<br/><br/>Some comments I read noted the stationery drawer was limited, but I found it easily held 100+ sheets of standard 8.x5 x 11 paper -- about the same as my old printer. I was more pleased when I printed addressed envelopes -- I suffered no jams, although it took me two tries to get correct positioning for the #10 envelopes in the drawer.<br/><br/>When I started to print the flatwork, I first test-compared the print quality of both "Fast Printing" and "Fine Quality" printing.  The Fine setting is very high quality, but much slower and I suppose uses more ink. I imagine I might use if for a high-quality one-off proof print, such as for a brochure or photograph.  The "Fast Printing" setting is very good for most everyday usage. However, using the printer's digital interface, you can upgrade the quality for Fast Printing in increments, which improved the output quality of my typed letters while delivering nice speed.  For a typical 1-page, 1-sheet print job, the MX922 goes pretty fast -- certainly faster than my old printer.  Duplex printing is slower, of course -- it's printing two sides of one sheet.  But it was still steady and I suffered no paper jams or quality problems.<br/><br/>One design feature caused me some frequent surprise.  To load the bottom paper drawer, you need to close the upper front door of the printer -- where the paper emerges after printing.  Of course, I always forgot to re-open that door ... but the folks at Canon anticipated this.  Once you hit PRINT, and the machine starts prepping a run, the door automatically pops open ... like an old Jack-in-the-Box.  A bit startling the first time it happens.  And the second ...<br/><br/>Some reviews here questioned ink usage, but I found it reasonable ... in fact, more thrifty than I'd anticipated.  After printing 400 documents (envelopes, 1-page reply, 2-page letter) all my ink cartridges are still more than half-full.  The built-in digital readout on the printer, that graphically shows ink cartridge levels, is a nice convenience. Nevertheless, I'd ordered the 28-pack ink cartridge kit from Arthur imaging as a precaution.  I haven't had to open the box yet!<br/><br/>My only mild criticism of the MX922 is with the main paper drawer tray.  Although it works fine, it feels a bit floppy or loose when you insert it in the printer.  And the plastic interior tab adjusters inside the tray (which need to be moved to account for various-sized stationery) seem a bit fragile.  So be gentle when moving them, and don't force them.<br/><br/>I can't recall how many desktop printers I've owned over the years -- I bought my first way back in the mid-1980s, when they cost upwards of $1800 and printed only in black-and-white (and not all that well, either).  Times have changed!  But for less than $100 and with so many built-in capabilities, my initial impression is this Canon MX922 is ideal for someone like me, who needs a reliable printer for both home and office use.  And Amazon Prime's Sunday delivery was a big bonus -- I got my project completed on schedule by Monday morning!</span>

<span>. After reading almost 75 reviews this will be focusing on the reviews with 1-2 stars. First to the complaints on the wireless air-print from Ios or Android, if you setup the printer using WPS your phone will never pick up the printer or will appear offline. You have to select WLAN Setup from Menu on the printer then select other setup options on the LCD screen then select standard setup and find your router then select and type in your password then connect. Also you have to make sure your phone is on the same channel, so especially if you have a dual-band router and your phone is on the 5ghz channel and the printer is on the 2.4ghz channel you will also run into problems. So every thing has to be on same channel, phone on 2.4ghz then the printer has to be on 2.4ghz channel then you will have absolutely no problems printing from your phone. Then with the complaints about noise there is a Quit mode selection in the menu when turned on it reduced all printer noise by at least 75%. Now to the ink consumption this printer is one of the best in the simple fact that if one of your cartridges runs out it will continue to print. Also the printer by default will print even all Black and White documents in the color setting because it brings a better quality this can simply be changed in your printer settings in your control panel to Black and White so most regular text documents will use the XXL cartridge which lasts for ever. With this setting changed if the page has color it stills prints in color.Compared to other printers when one cartridge runs out the printer will not continue to print until the ink cartridge is changed. The Canon PIXMA MX922 is one of the best printers I've used regarding ink, as a plus you can buy a color and XXL Black cartridge set from Amazon for a total of $60. As far as the scanner and copier go's it is one of the best I've used on a printer under $200. Have not had a chance to use the Fax so I can't reply in this review on that subject. One of the few downfalls of this printer is the size it really is a rather large printer compared to other all in one printers in it's class so take that into consideration. Photos are absolutely beautiful when used with Cannon Pro Platinum photo paper at 4x6 100 sheets for $20 on Amazon. As far as setup and install program wise it's pretty much standard  procedure. I've had the printer for about two weeks now and really I am so impressed for only $99. To those saying about break downs well with the SquareTrade 3-Year Electronics Protection Plan ($75-100) for only $14.20 how can you go wrong? There is another slight downside if you don't have a router or wireless access the printer doesn't come with the USB cable to direct connect, but one can be purchased on Amazon for $5.49 the Mediabridge USB 2.0 - A Male to B Male Cable (10 Feet) - High-Speed with Gold-Plated Connectors - Black. For those people giving this printer 1-2 stars it really is not their fault they are just ignorant to technology. Throwing off people into second guessing in purchasing this amazing piece of home all in one equipment. The auto 35 page duplex is also so time saving and conserves so much on paper consumption. I really hope this review finds people who are interested in purchasing this machine. The VERY few downsides like the USB and shear size is the only reason I didn't give this product a 5 star rating. I hope this review was helpful in letting you disregard the people giving this product 1-2 stars. Thanks for taking the time to read a real review!</span>

<span>UPDATE:  I've been through two of these in 4 years.  Each only lasted just under two years before failing.  I do not recommend the printer as it's just not reliable long term.  Both failures had the same issues:  printing is no longer clear - it's jagged (you can tell it prints horizontally and it's not matching up it's alignment from line to line.  So within a letter or image you'll see part of it slightly offset leading to jagged printing).  Printing is not complete - you'll be missing parts of what should be printed.  So it looks more like it was stamped and some ink was missed.  One or more of the colors will stop working - even if full. even if replaced.  I have tried cleaning EVERYTHING (spent a lot of time on youtube and can pretty much clean every part of this printer) and IF it works, the fix is only temporary before it fails again.  Printer tells me its' in use by another system when it's not - I have to turn the printer off then on to get it to work.<br/><br/>****************<br/><br/>I always buy the all-in-ones that are able to automatically print duplex and that include a fax since I still need to fax upon occasion.  In the past I've had HP, but haven't had great experiences with their printers lately (the last one I had starting failing one month after the 1 year warranty expired.  HP said "tough luck" essentially, even though I read that my issues were VERY common with their products. They had no sense of ownership...).  So I moved on to Canon.<br/><br/>This model, while shorter than my past printers, has a bigger footprint.  My husbands exact remark when I unpacked it was "So I see you decided to go with the small model."  Yes, he's a bit sarcastic :) .<br/><br/>What is great about it so far (I haven't played with all the features yet; I'll update as I do that):<br/><br/>1.  Unpacking it is relatively easy.  It's bulky and a bit heavy, but Canon put it in a bag.  So you can lift up the handles and it pulls the printer right out of the box.  This is the first time I've seen this.  It was so much easier than my printers in the past where I had to smash my hands down in the box, try to get a grip, and then try to coax the printer out of the box.<br/>2.  It was very easy to install.  The install takes about 14 minutes, but the install program warns you of this.  And since all you have to do is wait it's very easy.<br/>3.  It has a user guide that comes with the printer.  Now don't get too excited - it's not printed.  BUT it is added to your system upon installation and the sw that is installed on your system also has links to it online.  This is the first time I've actually found it easy to get a user guide since they stopped providing the printed copy in the box.  I may actually like it better than the printed copy since it's just a click away.  And I'm a person who uses the guide since I like to use advanced features<br/>4.  It is bluetooth capable.  I find this is the easiest way to print pictures from my phone (even my 6 year old can do it) so this is a plus.  Do I wish the bluetooth was built in?  Yes.  But since I had an extra adapter laying around this wasn't an issue.  I plugged in the adapter and it instantly was ready. So easy.<br/>5.  It is wi-fi ready and the wi-fi works.  This was the first thing to go on my last printer, so working wi-fi makes me happy.  We'll see how long it lasts, but I haven't heard of major issues with the Canons so I'm not worried.<br/>6.  It is cloud ready.  I set it up to connect to Google Cloud Print.  And I put that app on my tablets.  So now I can easily print from my samsung tablet.  The setup was easy to do - I followed the steps in the user guide.<br/>7.  The tray that catches the paper can fold up to stay out of the way when you aren't printing.  I like this because I've got pets and I hate the thought of fur getting into my printer.  And, the best part (and my favorite gee-whiz feature hands down) is that it automatically opens when you send a print job.  I l-o-v-e that.  It's the little things in life, right? :)<br/><br/>What I'm not so crazy about:  The menus and lack of touch screen.  Maybe it's because I'm changing brands, but the menus are not as intuitive as I'd like.  I find myself referencing the guide more than I'd like to so I can find what I need in the menus.  And since it's not touch screen you've got to navigate using a keypad off to the side. I find that cumbersome.  But I'm sure I'll get used to both these things as time goes on.  Oh, and I wish someone would invent a black printer that didn't show every dust particle.  Ooh, a stainless steel printer would be nice; it would then match my kitchen appliances and look quite snazzy in my office.<br/><br/>So far I've set up multiple computers, printed wirelessly, printed via cloud, printed via bluetooth, printed pictures and set up my fax preferences.  I haven't scanned or faxed yet, but all the printing has been good quality.  It's a bit quieter than my HPs which is nice.  And the starter ink that was included seems to be going a long way.<br/><br/>When I get a chance I'll put it through the paces (I WILL try every feature in the guide.  I'm just one of those people) and I'll update my review.  In the meantime, I definitely recommend the printer for ease of setup and solid performance.</span>

<span>Bought used from D.H. Varieties - this is the what they wrote me after I attempted to return and my response:<br/><br/>Mr. Wakeley, I am sorry that you are choosing to return the item in which I tested the unit before shipping it. I am going to return a partial amount. You will be returned all but $40 because of extra shipping cost I endured because of weight. You can keep the printer because you have unpacked it and put cartridges in the unit and used it for whatever reason. This means that the value to resell is less beneficial to me. I assure you that the unit was tested and working. We are not in the business of selling defective items. I'm quite sure you can get the unit working properly. As I stated in my listing, it was a used item not brand new so when you buy a printer used, you have to run utilities, and adjust the heads and follow the alignment procedures. These procedures can be costly on cartridges especially when you buy the cheaper half filled ones instead of the full ones. A lot of ink is used when doing cleanings. You can go ahead and keep the printer Mr. Wakeley and enjoy the printer. I will refund you all but $40.<br/><br/>MY RESPONSE<br/><br/>I'm sorry that you "endured" a shipping cost.  Let me explain what I "endured"<br/><br/>1) You suggested I bought "off brand" ink.  See the attached receipt where I paid $91.99 for Epson 78 print ink cartridges.<br/>2) You suggested I failed to follow the directions.

<span>Got a Tivo recently and archive my shows to DVD so generate a STACK of DVDs regularly. Tried all the standard transfer labels but just wasn't happy with the results; the white ones were "ok" but very pedestrian. The clear ones were the best looking but invariably trapped air bubbles. Solution: printable DVDs and the Epson.<br/><br/>Bought a used Epson 260 after reading all the reviews and have been VERY happy with it. True, the ink cartridges are expensive but the labeling has been just primo! Sharp, clear and very professional looking so it's been worth it IMHO. The included labeling software is easy to use and even my first printing attempt was right-on!<br/><br/>I use the Epson solely for printing labels on DVDs so can't evaluate how economical it is for regular printing, but if you need something to print on DVDs the Photo 260 is the cheapest of the Epsons and does the job!<br/><br/>And you want "printable" DVDs to print on, not "Lightscribe" cuz I almost made that mistake. I use the Verbatim DataLife Plus Printable DVDs and recommend them highly for several reasons: 1) they dry almost immediately and IMHO the glossy white surface looks the best. 2) My MacBook Pro's Superdrive refused to burn some other brands but the Verbatims were recommended by the Apple store's techs and burn reliably.<br/><br/>Labeling DVDs with magic marker or the regular CD-style labels works just fine, but if you want a finished DVD that looks professional, look no further than a Photo 260!</span>

<span>My very first printer was an Epson FX80 dot matrix.  A fine printer for what it did, so I expected good quality from Epson.<br/><br/>My second printer was an HP 820 cxi.  Very quiet, good quality printing.  When it finally broke, I really wanted to be able to print on CD's, and DVD's, so I bought the Epson R260.  Compared to the HP, it is relatively noisy.  It shows a display of the ink cartidges while printing, and the ink supply indicators show rapid emptying of the cartridges.  Perhaps the ones supplied are not full to start with.  I will find out when I replace them.  It seems that if Epson wanted to make a good first impression, the cartridges shipped with the printer would be full.  At best ink doesn't last long, and since a set of ink costs more than the printer, they are making their money fast.<br/><br/>Draft mode is readable, but awfully light.  The two sided printing feature works fine.  I have not yet tried CD/DVD printing.  The dried ink does not smear, even when I dipped a dried page in water.<br/><br/>In text, and text with picture modes the printing is fine.</span>

<span>When my Epson R220 printer died, I needed to replace it or get a different printer that could print labels on printable CD's and DVD's.  Since I had the R220 installed on four computers and had purchased several ink cartridges, it was cost-effective to replace the printer with another of the same type.  I found a reconditioned printer identical to what I needed for sale on Amazon for much less that a new one would have cost.  I ordered the printer and received it by the time delivery was promised.  It arrived in excellent condition and has been working fine ever since I connected it started using it.  Since the serial number was different, I had to reinstall the printer on the computers, but since the driver was present, it was trivial.

<span>I bought this printer mainly because of its great price and its ability to print on DVD's.  The ability to add text or an image to a sildeshow DVD is a great plus.  It adds a lot of value to the overall presentation when presenting this to a client.  I already own a dedicated photo printer (Canon), but I thought I would try it for some 4x6 and 5x7 images to test quality and the vibrance of color.  WOW! I was impressed.  This printer hands down produced a better looking image than my Canon.  I suppose it wasn't an apples to apples test, due to the Canon being a few years old, but all things considered the image did look better.<br/><br/>If you need to print high quality images at home, this is the printer for you.</span>

Product Description   CW-75 Disc Title Printer with QWERTY keyboard   From the Manufacturer   The print format of the CW-75 consists of 18 alpha-numeric formats and four graphic formats that you can select from. The machine will produce crisp, clear, professional CD-R's/DVD's without the hassle of applying unprofessional looking sticky labels that can damage your CD drive.  The CW-75 is a thermal printer with a print area measuring 5/8" x 2 15/16". On a typical CD-R, you can print up to eight lines in one print area above the opening in the center of the CD-R, and up to eight lines in one print area below the hole, for a total of 16 lines. (The thermal transfer ribbon will print about 50 CDs using one print area.) The Disc Title Printer is powered by eight "AA" size batteries or an optional AC adaptor.What's in the Box Casio CW-75, USB cable, software, black ink ribbon, template, sample CD-R, batteries

<span>I bought a re-furbished CW-75 and found it to perform exactly as it is designed.  It's not intended to do all of the fancy picture printing that the computer based programs with paper labels do.  It prints CLEAR black lettering (or other colors, if you choose) on CD's/DVD's with a smooth surface.  The best part is that there is no requirement for a computer and computer printer.  If you just want clearly printed titles, etc. this is the way to go for a small amount of discs.  I would not recommend it for any mass production of the same disc (more than 10 or so)  Update: Over three years later, this CD/DVD labeler is still working and doing a great job.</span>

<span>Decided to go with this unit instead of the lightscribe technology and inkjet printing to DVD/CD media.<br/><br/>I burn about 500 DVD-Rs per week at work and use dozens and dozens of source discs. I use this to create the source/master disc title. It takes me as little as 10 seconds to create and print onto a disc. I have not tested it using a PC since I have no need for that.<br/><br/>You need to be sure to get a media that works well with it. Media with no text and graphics works best. I've found that it won't work with certain 'silver inkjet printable' media.<br/><br/>One reviewer pointed out you need to use the makers own brand of media. This is not true and as far as I know CASIO does not make DVD/CD media, maybe i'm wrong. I just haven't seen it!<br/><br/>The only negative is that it does use up the ribbon quickly. I'd be surprised if you could get 25 discs printed with a single ribbon. I've found ribbon for it very inexpensive, so it's no big deal to me. At least you don't have to go out and buy lightscribe media!<br/><br/>8/18/2006 UPDATE:<br/>I've stopped using this device. If you only label 10-15 discs a week then this unit is good. I label too many and it's gotten way too expensive to use this unit. Another problem is that the device wastes a LOT of ribbon. Way more than it needs to. A more cost effective way of printing out titles onto a disc is to get a  Printer with a CD tray. They are about the same price.</span>

<span>This printer was fine for my purposes but is pretty limited and would not be a good choice for someone seeking flexibility and heavy use from the device.  It's slow and pretty persnickety in requiring a very smooth disc surface.  Fonts are limited too.  For the price, though, it's not bad if you can accept its limitations.</span>

<span>The printer worked pretty good while I used it often, but when I used it less frequently the problems started to mount - namely with the ink situation. It started to give the "ink out" messages even though the ink was not out in all the cartridges.  And, even if I just had a full black in cartridge and another one was "low" it would not print in black only either. Very frustrating (and expensive to buy ink). We tried cleaning it and still doesn't want to print. It won't print if it senses that any cartridges are "out of ink"(even though they aren't). I just don't understand how it says you're "out of ink" and won't print when I know that is not true. What an expensive machine this is to run- and a frustrating one. Won't buy Epson again.</span>

<span>I've had this printer for two years, and mine has printed literally thousands of CDs and DVDs (somewhere around 5000 by my estimate). In its price range, this is simply the best disc printer available -- by far. It also does great on glossy and heavy matte paper of all brands.<br/><br/>But printing on this machine is not effortless. It has many quirks which can sabotage your efforts unless you make accommodations. It's important to learn how the machine works first, and do so with great care because a mistake can render it useless (I speak from experience). The results are worth it.<br/><br/>This printer requires a great deal of TLC, plus genuine Epson inks (which cost more than off brands), and some patience. Many of the negative reviews here describe symptoms which I have experienced, but which can be avoided by just being careful. Of course, a printer probably shouldn't require that of the users, but the results are truly spectacular if you play along.<br/><br/>Most of the problems can be attributed to genuine design flaws -- some of them quite small but with great consequences. For example, there is a little arrow on the printer which is used to align the disc tray before printing. It matches up with a printed arrow on the disc tray itself. But the arrow on the printer is simply an area of indented plastic, making it almost invisible. When you get this printer, the first thing to do is make that arrow visible by putting a piece of tape or something on it.<br/><br/>If you don't make the alignment arrow visible, you will inevitably push the disc tray in too far and expose another regrettable design flaw: the disc tray has a clear plastic leader which helps it find it's path inside the printer. But if this leader gets bent (which it will if it gets pushed in too far), the tray will not go in and out. Instead it will jam every time. Once that strip of plastic is broken or bent, the disc tray must be replaced (I bought mine for $5 from a part supplier recommended by Epson, but it was a hassle).<br/><br/>Also, the plastic can get bent if the disc tray is not inserted exactly level with the slot. If you angle it a little bit up or down, the plastic lip will get caught and shred. Again, you'll need another disc tray if this happens.<br/><br/>Next, the tray movement in and out is not always smooth. On mine, once the tray starts moving in, it stops at a point and I must give it a gentle push or it won't go in. Likewise, when the disc is done printing, the tray stalls before it is completely ejected.<br/><br/>Neither of these things would be a big problem except that the printer kind of freaks out if it happens. Resetting it requires removing the tray, pressing the middle button, and waiting for it to go through a reset cycle before reinserting the tray. This reveals another design flaw: if you do not wait for the reset cycle to complete, the disc tray can sometimes be drawn in and all the way through the printer, smashing it against the wall behind the printer (be sure you allow at least 8 inches between the back of this printer and the wall). Again, if that happens, your disc tray is ruined and must be replaced.<br/><br/>The reset cycle happens periodically, sometimes in the middle of a print job. When it happens, everything must stop, the disc tray must be removed, and you simply must wait until it's complete (2-3 minutes). I don't know why it does this, but it happens without warning and it can be quite frustrating if you're not expecting it.<br/><br/>A couple of other small things: If the disc insertion slot is down when the printer is first turned on, it will not go through its warm-up cycle. Instead it flashes frantically until you put up the tray intake. Not very intuitive, to be sure. If the printer has been turned on but not used for quite a while, it will initially reject the disc tray and try to do a warm-up cycle. It's confusing and unexpected (it doesn't happen every time).<br/><br/>Also, if a print job fails or is cancelled, it can take up to 5 minutes for the printer to reset. During this time, nothing appears to be happening, and you'll wonder if the command got sent. So you'll turn off the printer and turn it on again, and discover that the print job is still there and it starts printing. If on the other hand, you simply wait, eventually the printer will reset.<br/><br/>Finally, the printer will not print at all if even one of the ink cartridges is empty. This is annoying and inexcusable, and could probably be fixed with a simple driver update. As it is, always make sure you have a spare set of cartridges on hand.<br/><br/>Using non-Epson inks will lead to blotchiness and ultimately clogging of the nozzles. Also, sometimes they come up as empty when they are new. It's tempting because of the price, but don't do it. You will regret it.<br/><br/>And you must be aware that the cleaning routine uses A LOT of ink. If you start with completely full cartridges and do just one cleaning cycle, you'll see the inks drop to about 85%. That's really unacceptable, but not a problem if you realize that the cleaning cycle is hardly ever necessary with genuine Epson inks. I never run it unless I can visibly see problems with the output (which is quite rare). Some of the problems I get are due to fuzz or stray cat hairs getting into the printer. When this happens, you simply have to keep printing until the blothces go away. Again, this can be frustrating, but it's relatively rare.<br/><br/>The Epson PrintCD software is pretty rudimentary, but it works. Just be aware that it isn't exactly WYSIWYG (for example, the shadows under text look better when printed than they do on the screen, and sometimes the background image looks like it fills the entire disc when it actually leaves a small area uncovered when printed). With a little bit of experimenting when I first got the printer, it was pretty easy to pick up what I could and could not do.<br/><br/>So, that's a lot of design flaws and problems and things to remember and/or avoid. You may ask, is it worth it? Based on the output, the answer is an unqualified YES. There are more expensive disc printers, but I have never seen a higher quality inkjet printed disc. My customers simply love them. And the inks, though not cheap, are cheap enough to be cost effective for me. The colors are deep and true, and the images and text are always crisp.<br/><br/>Just be aware that the quality comes with a price above and beyond the dollars you spend. "Type A" folks should stay away, as should those who are not technically savvy. And if you buy, remember to stay calm.<br/><br/>** UPDATE May 2007 **<br/><br/>This printer finally died with a most unfortunate error message: "A part of this device has reached the end of its service life."<br/><br/>After a bit of research, I discovered that these "suicide" dates are built in to the machine and can be overridden only if you're willing to get out your soldering gun (which I'm not).<br/><br/>So it's gone. Replaced by the similar but disappointing Epson R260, which I have also reviewed extensively.</span>

<span>I bought an R200 last year to print DVD labels. After about 150 labels, the label print function jammed. I returned the printer and received a replacement in about two weeks. Since I was facing a deadline, I had to purchase another label printer right away. The R220 was available so I bought it instead of another R200. The replacement R200 was put aside as a backup. The R220 lasted just under a year, printing mostly DVD labels. Now the R220 DVD print function won't work. I unpacked the replacement R200 backup printer and discovered, much to my dismay, that it won't print DVDs either. It's DVD print function is jammed just like the printer I returned. Epson must test only the paper print and not the disc print. Now I have two usless printers and another deadline!<br/><br/>The photo printer does a good job, even on 8 x 10 or 8-1/2 x 11 paper. The DVD print quality, however, is mediocre at best. As such, I would not recommend either the R200 or the R220. There are much better photo printers on the market and the useful DVD print life seems to be a paltry 200 discs or so.<br/><br/>Some further advise: Don't buy spare ink cartridges for either printer since a full set will cost as much as the printer. Just buy replacement cardridges as needed. The printer will likely fail before you have used up the factory supplied cartridges.</span>

<span>Like a lot of people, I used to print labels, but problems like not sticking 100% or air bubbles or peeling at the edges happen. I still have some labels left so I am using a 2" wide wallpaper roller to smooth them down onto the disk so it sticks a whole lot better. BUT printing directly to the disk is so much better (obviously). True you have to let the disk dry 24 hours, but guess what, I had to let the labels dry too! No chance of air bubbles, no peeling, no problems! But shop around I've seen these priced around the $400 range and that's ridiculous, I don't know if it's true, but I heard some repairmen talking about this printer saying that when it was new it was priced around $70...!  Oh, you need to use Epson's driver (obviously) AND their utility....somewhat of a misnomer, as this is both a utility (let's you align the printing) but it is ALSO the print program!  You will NOT successfully print from another program...I've tried.  Best of Luck!</span>

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure it in different ways? Now you can. Much like “MPG” ratings on new cars, there’s now an industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an “apples-to-apples” comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry-approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for inkjet printers and all-in-ones. It measures “out of the box” (default) print speeds using “real world” printing scenarios, so you can be sure you’re getting a product that performs at the speed you need.ADDITIONAL FEATURESSuperior performance, Small-in-One design — get all the tools you need for photos, documents and more, while saving valuable space on your deskEPSON Connect — Print and scan from anywhere — convenient mobile printing from smartphones, tablets and more; also supports Apple AirPrint and Google Cloud PrintSave paper — automatic 2-sided printing, copying and scanning One-of-a-kind creative projects — rear paper feed accommodates specialty paper, printing directly onto inkjet printable CDs/DVDsBrilliant results, smart value — individual ink cartridges; replace only the color you needPackaging Specifications (W x D x H) — Dimensions: Printing 17.2" x 23.5" x 8.1", Storage 15.4" x 13.3" x 7.5" and Weight 21.5lb.WHAT'S IN THE BOXExpression Premium XP-800 Small-in-OneSetup and instruction manualsCD-ROM containing software and drivers (Windows and Mac)Power cordClaria Premium Ink Cartridges:Five 273-series: Black, Photo Black, Cyan, Magenta, YellowEPSON INK SUPPLIES273 Claria Premium Black ink cartridge, Standard-capacity (T273020)273 Claria Premium Cyan ink cartridge, Standard-capacity (T273220)273 Claria Premium Magenta ink cartridge Standard-capacity (T273320)273 Claria Premium Yellow ink cartridge, Standard-capacity (T273420)273 Claria Premium Photo Black ink cartridge, Standard-capacity (T273120)273 Claria Premium Color MultiPack, Standard-capacity (T273520)EPSON PAPER SUPPLIESPremium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)ECO FEATURESRecyclable productSave up to 50% of your paper supply with automatic 2-sided printing/copyingSupports printing on recycled paperENERGY STAR qualifiedEpson America, Inc. is a SmartWay Transport partner

The setup process is long and difficult, and the device frequently disconnects from wifi, often in the middle of printing.  It eats up ink, I'm replacing the black as well as color ink even though I don't print in color very often.  In this year I've printed about 200 pages, and have had to replace the ink five times.  I've spent more money on the ink than the printer.  The most recent problem is the ink nozzle cleaning - it actually gets worse after it the nozzles are cleaned.  The print quality is some of the poorest that I've had since the nineties.  If you're looking for photo quality, please buy another printer. Loading the paper is also a big pain - and it doesn't have a large capacity for paper, so I am constantly reloading the thing with paper.  It's also difficult to remove jams - you have to take it apart three ways to get the jammed paper out - rather than just disconnect the back end to remove it.  What else?  Oh yeah, changing the ink - guaranteed to get splattered by it, you have to put on gloves and be very careful or it will get on your clothes.  Pages would often be splattered with black ink on the corners after changing the ink.  It's very loud and moves around a lot, my desk would shake every time it would print or even just turn on.  Turning it on it would go through this whole process and take forever to actually be ready to use.  The scanned pages often ended up crooked, even if I loaded them as straight as possible, and the feeder often double feeds which means you have to start all over again.  The software that came with it was not straight forward to use, it did not give you the option, for example, to default to scanning to .pdf.  If you forget to do that it would scan to photo and send it to my photos folder, which was extremely annoying.  It will also only scan to .pdf if you tell it to from your computer software, if you do it on the device itself it doesn't give you any option to do that.<br/><br/>I regret the amount of money I've spent on this printer so far and I'm shopping for another one.</span>

<span>This is an excellent all in one. I have owned this printer for about a month now and review it based today only on its design, printing and scanning because I have mostly used those features.<br/><br/>Design: Much smaller than I expected. In light of how functional it is, the small size is all the more impressive. The finish is a textured midnight blue, which looks very modern and sleek. I especially like the folding ADF tray, which, when shut, gives the printer a smooth clean look. Wireless setup was very easy. Design criticisms: (1) When printing, the control panel and print tray automatically extend. This is a very nice feature, but they do not automatically close up again once you have taken your printed document off the tray. (2) The bypass feeder in the back of the printer allows you to use specialized paper without having to change the contents of the paper tray. This is very nice, but the bypass feeder can only hold a single sheet of paper at a time. If you are printing more than one of the specialized paper (e.g. envelopes), you would have to feed in the paper one at a time.<br/><br/>Printing: Fast printing times for a inkjet. Clear text, crisp images. My printing needs are rather basic, and the XP-800 met them very well. Printing Criticisms: (1) There is a a tray of paper and then a tray for photo paper. There is no dedicated second tray for other types of regular paper (e.g. envelopes, letterhead), and to the best of my knowledge, the photo paper tray cannot be used as such.<br/><br/>Scanning: I use the scanner more than any other feature on this printer. The scanning is fast, and yields good quality PDFs. If the colors seem too rich, the scan software gives you the ability to correct them. Scan criticisms: (1) The scanner cannot automatically detect if the document is on the scan bed or in the ADF tray, which means that you cannot put a document down and hit "Scan" without setting it up in the software first. In terms of ease of used, this is a big step backward from the much older Lexmark that I used to own.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with this all-in-one. If seems that I focused on the negatives, it is only because this device is so good at what it does that the few areas of weakness are brought into focus. I would highly recommend purchasing this all-in-one to anyone shopping for a printer right now.</span>

<span>After purchasing this printer from Amazon in early July 2013,I'm now waiting for the 3rd replacement printer.  Each printer lasted approx,. 3 weeks before the ink cartridges/print head assembly failed.  The printer would stop printing certain colors, mostly black, followed by not recognizing the ink cartridge. The 1st replacement was a new printer.  The second replacement, which I was told would be new, was refurbished.  The refurbished printer didn't print any black text from the moment I had it setup.<br/><br/>After the 1st replacement printer arrived I used if for less than three weeks before it stopped printing.  The service call resulted in my waiting 8 days for a replacement Initial Ink Cartridge needed for diagnostics. I was told it would take 2 to 7 business days, the ink cartridge was shipped 6 business days after the service call was made.  This did not fix the problem.  I had to argue with them about getting a new replacement which they conceded to, but I received a refurbished printer two days latter.<br/><br/>The refurbished printer from the moment I got it setup would not print black text and eventually wouldn't recognize the ink cartridge.  I'm now waiting for my 3rd replacement which I was told will be a new printer.  Whether or not it works, I have no faith in the manufacturer, their products or the customer service.<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>Update Jan, 2014.<br/>After the most recent replacement of the ink cartridges the printer "Nozzle Check" indicated that the print heads needed cleaning.  After numerous print head cleanings and subsequent nozzle checks, the printer ran out of ink before the print heads were clean.  Considering the fact that the black ink was a day old, and the color ink cartridges were only at best a week old, I just wasted about $50 of ink.  At this point, I'm going to replace the printer even though I bought the original just 7 months ago.  The printer does a great job when it works, but considering this is my 4th printer since I bought it in July 2013 and the fact that it eats ink, especially since cleaning the heads is not a one and done.  It takes several (5+) times to clean the print heads at which point you are close to needing new ink cartridges, or in my case running out of ink before the heads are clean.</span>

<span>I bought this printer to kill two birds with one stone. My old hp finally kicked the dust, and I decided to make and print my own wedding invitations. So I was looking for a high quality printer that could handle printing on card stock and had a rear feeder. I also wanted to be able to print reasonably high quality photos from home. So after a lot of research I decided on this printer. It had mixed reviews, but it did have all the components I was looking for.<br/>First off we received the printer and it would not print any black ink. After hours and hours on the phone with Epson and a week of wanted to pull out my hair, Epson finally concluded that the printer I received was faulty and began the exchange process. Epson was helpful in trying to troubleshoot the printer initially, and for a time I thought we had fixed the problem only for it to return. But when I called Epson back I was re-walked through all the things I had already done, several times. So my patience was wearing thin.<br/>The second thing that really irritated me was that I bought a new printer, but my replacement was a certified refurbished item. Not the end of the world, but just another thing to piss me off. I got the second printer set up and found the auto document feeder not to work after calling Epson and trying to fix the problem, I finally gave up. I will most likely not use the top feeder too often, so I just cut my losses with that one.<br/>So finally after using the printer for a few months, it works great when you don't change anything. But replacing ink is a lengthy process which waste a large amount of ink. In my most recent cartridge replacement I had to do at least three head cleanings, which put my brand new ink cartridges down to about 75-80%.<br/>All in all, I would not recommend this product, and it is extremely unlikely I will ever buy another Epson product again.</span>

<span>For some reason my printer arrived without a cord or ink. The box was retaped, so something happened somewhere.  Inside the box everything was packaged as shown in great detail in the directions.  I have never seen detailed pictures of what the packing and contents should look like with a printer before.  Maybe this is a common problem.  I wanted to send it back but I work from home, so I needed a printer.  The cord from the old (dead) printer worked and I went to the office supply store and bought ink.  These are pricey for a printer, but well worth it for me.  I read all the reviews, especially the negative ones.  I was skeptical but so far this printer has been incredible.  The photo software is really good.  Mixing multiple photos on the same print.  The photos I have printed are just as good as the ones from the store.<br/> Hundreds of options for printing everything.  No more high priced throw away ink cartridges.  You fill this one with ink bottles.  The ink lasts a very long time.  I haven't refilled it since I bought it.  The only problem with the ink bottles is dripping when you remove them.  Cover the area in front of the printer with something that will not allow ink to hit your table. Make sure you have a paper towel close to the tip of the bottle when you remove them.  That has been my only complaint aside from the original missing parts.  I will post an update if I have any issues.</span>

<span>Thrilled with this printer. It took a bit to dial in all the features, but now that I have it figured out, it's a peach. Love the small profile for my very tiny desk space. Great quality pics and thrilled that I no longer have to deal with annoying and expensive cartridges. I've been printing lots of non- fancy things as well as photos and am pleased with how little ink its using. The printer was a fair amount more expensive than I was hoping to spend to replace my old Photo R380, but am very happy with it now.</span>

<span> I bought a Cricut for Christmas and needed a great 3 in 1 printer to print stickers, print docs front and back, print 4x6, 5x7, and 8x10 photos, as well as scan my ultrasound photos. (I did not use this for sublimation, but hear that it can be great for that too.) This thing exceeded my expectations. I’ve been using it almost every day for 5 months and it still is almost filled completely full with ink, which I can see on the front of the machine. Setup instructions were super easy and was a pleasure to get through. Before this printer I had returned 2 other printers that disappointed me. (I ended up tossing my old one years ago because the HP printer dried up so quickly.) This printer feels like it was built to last. The doors and cassettes click into place, feeling very satisfying and never leaving me wonder if I pushed it in all the way. I’ll probably never use ink cartridges again. Eco tank is the way to go.<br/><br/>First of all, I had no idea when I bought it that you can scan and print photos using the app on your phone. It’s made things so much simpler to manage and edit. One thing I wish it had was color sliders to tweak the images a bit before printing.<br/><br/>The scan bed is AWESOME. It’s very basic with a thin plastic lid, but I’m comparing it to the scan job the scanners at Office Max did. Those were terrible, costly if you have multiple images needing scanned, and always came out blurry with noticeable glares. (The employees also wanted to argue about HIPPA with me with my own ultrasounds…) This printer’s scan does a phenomenal job. With 300 dpi it is crystal clear with no glare! And I love that it saves directly onto your phone. A USB or SD card is only optional. You can choose to scan in color, grayscale, or black and white. For ultrasounds, definitely use the grayscale.<br/><br/>The photo print quality is very good as well. Not sure if it’s as good as WalMart prints when it comes to color, but the quality is pretty similar. Sometimes the photos appear slightly blue, but I think it’s the photo paper I’m using. The white paper may have a slight blue hue to it. As a photographer, I’m content with saving me the trip by using this printer instead for my own personal needs.<br/><br/>The main con I can think of is that it does print slow if you choose higher quality prints. (May take 3 minutes to print a photo.) If you need speed, this may not be your guy. If you choose Normal quality prints it goes a lot faster, but documents appear very pixely. I had a paper jam once, but it was very quick and easy to open up the printer and pull it out.<br/><br/>I have yet to try printing with the cardstock paper feed in the back. I’ve been printing thin cardstock from the top feed and that seems to work out just fine.<br/><br/>Another con is sometimes when I’m printing from the computer I have to turn the printer off and on again because for some reason it doesn’t always get the signal to print. Not sure what is going on there, but it doesn’t happen too often.<br/><br/>Overall, I am still elated with my purchase 5 months later. Never had a printer that made me smile weekly before. This was worth every penny.</span>

<span>I understand that some printers may be defective from the factory and perhaps I got lucky, but I don't understand some of these negative reviews.  This printer is not cheaply made.  It is made just as well as any other printer at this price point.  Setup was quick and easy.  I print to it from several computers and an iPad over wifi.  It prints both plain black text documents and photos (if you use glossy photo paper) quite well.  I have used the scanner bed and feeder several times and they work flawlessly.<br/><br/>I purchased a complete set of high capacity ink cartridges along with the printer because I understood that the original ink cartridges were just for setup and calibration.  Perhaps Epson put the wrong cartridges in my printer, but  I have used it for routine home printing for five weeks, multi-page documents with color graphics and a dozen or so photos, a couple of which were full page photos, and all the original ink cartridges that came with the printer still show at least half full.<br/><br/>I had bad experience with an Epson printer 30 years ago and had been using only HP and Canon home printers since then.  I decided to give Epson another try, and so far I am glad I did.<br/><br/>P.S after three and a half months of use.  Just changed original ink cartridges yesterday.  We were printing about 150 pages of partially-color text.<br/>After using it for a while, I will concede that it does feel bit more fragile than previous Canon and HP printers, but nothing has broken yet.<br/>Printer hardware and software work perfectly.  It takes a while to start printing after you send a job, but prints quickly once it gets going.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace an ailing Epson Artisan 810, which I had for a number of years and did very well.  Printing CD/DVDs was an important feature, which limited the field.  Have been using it now for a few months, so let me tell you about this printer.<br/>First, let's be real, this is a hundred dollar printer, not a five hundred dollar printer, and it's built like what it is.  In places the plastic body and guides seem flimsy, but if you take care they should do okay.  The Artisan had similar components and lasted for years.  However ... the paper tray seems to have less capacity, and the tray for photo paper is for 4x6 or 5x7 only.  And the CD/DVD printing tray comes out, and needs to be positioned in the correct slot to use, as opposed to the one that was internal on the Artisan.  There is a rear slot feed, which takes some getting used to, but that is useful for envelopes.<br/>Print quality is fine, there is a preset for draft quality which saves ink at the expense of lighter print, a reasonable trade off.  Photo quality is also good enough to frame, at least for the work that I do.<br/>The scanner is a flatbed with an ADF.  In general the automatic feeder works well.  It has occasionally jammed on a piece of paper, and one needs to remove the bottom pad of the lift up section to free the paper.  A bit tricky to get the pad placed correctly until you get used to where the slots are.  Scanning quality is good, and it scans to JPG, TIF, PNG, PDF and searchable PDF, although I have not used that last feature often.<br/>The scanning software is a bit kludgy, in that you have to jump through two menus to set the name of the file and the directory.  While you can preview the scan before committing, you can't enlarge the preview to see any detail.  And if scanning a multipage document, you can't open a document to add a page.  Editing only before saving the entire package. Also, file names cannot contain a period, so naming a file as "2020.04.06.jpg" does not work.<br/>Most importantly, and the biggest reason I cannot give this printer a higher rating, is that the software that connects the printer to WiFi appears to be buggy, and frequently loses connection.  With the router in the same room, I was able to scan a document, then a few minutes later the software was unable to connect with the scanner.  Only a reboot of the computer and printer would reset the system, for a while.  I never had this problem with the Artisan, which maintained a stable WiFi connection under the same conditions.  Ultimately, I broke down and used a USB cable to connect the device, so that at least it works when I need it to.<br/>Just to note, unlike the Artisan, this printer/scanner does not support a Fax connection.  This is clearly less important than some years ago, with Fax only rarely being called upon to transfer data - scanning and Email being more common - but it is worth mentioning if that is a requirement.<br/>Perhaps if Epson improves the software to enhance operational flexibility and WiFi connectivity I would give this a high rating, but likely the unit will be obsolete before that can happen.<br/>--  11 Apr 20 update --<br/>Three other issues have come to light since I wrote this review.<br/>One, which I had experienced before but did not include in the initial review, is the annoying habit of the Epson Scan 2 software to variably display an alert when started, saying, "Unable to create a work folder in the specified location. The default location will be used instead."  No location had been specified, and there is no option to locate the work folder anywhere, nor any indication what the "default location" would be.<br/>Second, trying to integrate this scanner with a graphics program, I found that the TWAIN scanner it installed was 32 bit, in my Windows 10 64 bit system.  There appears to be no way to install a 64 bit TWAIN driver, so the scanner will not interface with the graphics program, which needs a 64 bit TWAIN scanner driver.<br/>And third relates to the ADF.  As I mentioned, there is a pad that encloses the paper path for the ADF, which must be removed to clear any paper jams.  Well, the clear plastic over the scanning area is prone to pick up little flecks of paper or dust, creating vertical streaks on the resultant scanned image.  Seems to be much more frequent than with the old Artisan, and a real pain when scanning a lot of pages with the ADF.<br/>Just some more cautionary notes to those considering this printer / scanner.<br/>-- 04 May 20 --<br/>The more I use this printer/scanner, the more irritating some things become.  When scanning multiple pages using the ADF, you can select to add further pages after scanning, and you can rotate, delete, or change the order of pages in the edit screen, but you cannot change any scanning parameters.  So if you scanned a 5 page document with the ADF, you cannot add an additional page scanned with the flatbed, nor change from color to monochrome, or other changes.  You also cannot reopen a scanned PDF to add another page, as you can with other programs.  With all of these issue, have downgraded from three to two stars.<br/>Made even worse as there is no one at Epson to contact for any of these issues.<br/>Caveat emptor<br/>-- 29 Mar 21 -- about a year of use and more problems arise.  Now, there are lines and blotches on both text and photo prints.  Printing a mailing label is  challenge as the blots obscure the bar code; and photos come out with black dots and lines at various places on the print.  At this time I am having serious doubts about replacing this with another Epson product.  Cleaning the print heads does not help, and there seems to be no way to prevent this problem.  I am not a happy camper.</span>

<span>First of all, I had to go to a bricks-and-mortar store to find out where the paper tray was.  I wanted to put the printer into a utility closet with an outlet and print without moving it, and until I could see the paper tray, I couldn't purchase it.  Just showing the front of the printer without the open paper tray was not enough.<br/>I set up this printer with my MacBook Pro running OS 10.14.6.<br/>The power button is all black -- it lights up nicely when it. is on but is a bit difficult to find when it's off, although the setup sheet does show the location.<br/>I had trouble getting AirPrint to work.  The setup sheet gives you enough information to get what I think is called Direct Print to work over your wireless network, but that's not enough for AirPrint -- you have to set up Wifi Infrastructure Mode, and the Epson online help is no help.  Using Google, I eventually found an Epson YouTube video that showed how to do this from the printer's front control panel.  Before I downloaded and used the 7100 User Guide, I also set up Epson Connect and the iPrint app, and after they did not help with AirPrint, I wondered if I would ever use them at all (but I did use iPrint, see below!). These different wireless print options and a one-sentence description of what each is good for should be on the Setup Sheet.<br/>Color print from MS Word, Excel, and Notes on iPhone and iPad worked perfectly the first time (once I had AirPrint).<br/>Then I started checking functions from the User's Guide, including several I've never done with any other printer.<br/>Duplex color copy and scan worked perfectly the first time, even though my input was an old and slightly<br/>wrinkled drawing.  I did both from the Automatic Feeder Tray with the printer control panel.<br/>Photo print from Preview came out really well, even though I had only Another Brand photo paper instead of the Epson Ultra Premium Glossy paper I prefer.<br/>Photo print from a camera memory card, using the front printer control panel, also came out very well (my photo wasn't so great, so I won't say it was excellent yet) and I was able to preview what was on the memory card and select a layout right from that panel, without my computer.  I didn't try transferring those photos from the printer to the computer because I put the memory card away before I saw that was possible, but I did confirm the Mac could see the printer over the network.<br/>I checked the printer supply levels from the printers and scanners icon in System Preferences.<br/>Finally I printed a layout of four 4x6 photos from my iPhone using iPrint.  Worked fine.<br/>I am amazed at what this printer can do.</span>

<span>I bought this printer because of the review for photo print quality, I was not disappointed. It has good speed and very good quality. The scanner works great as long download Epson Scan 2 software. I have not had to call for tech support</span>
