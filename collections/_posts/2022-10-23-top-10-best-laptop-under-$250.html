<span>OK, this is my second Stream.  The original was a 32GB that is still operating and is obviously limited by the couple GB remaining after the operating system space.  However, was useful for web browsing.  This one is 64GB and that leaves about 30GB space for programs plus one year of MS Office free.  I got rid of the Windows 10 S mode and the speed for web browsing and program operation is fine.  And I'm used to an Intel 11th generation i5 on a desktop and have no complaints. That is an absolutely amazing unit for $200.  Of course, in both cases, I've added extra room using a USB 128GB flash drive so really, it's a fantastic deal.  The only con that I've found so far is that the sound is rather puny but connecting a cheap bluetooth speaker solves that issue.  Update:  I hooked this up to an external monitor and it gave me an option to go from the native internal screen resolution of 1366x768 to 1920 x 1080 and it shows up great on the external monitor.  I'm shocked.  I cannot believe this computer was $200.  Well, we'll see how long it lasts.</span>

<span>For the money I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I've had the machine for about 3 weeks now and it only took 3 days to arrive, just in time for me to prepare documents, etc for my troop meeting. My only complaint is trying to use M364 tools (Word) was VERY slow so I reverted back to Google docs. I'm downloading all our wedding photos to it so it will probably take up most of the 64 GB of space but I'm ok with that as well.</span>

<span>I'm writing this for a typical user, using plain language, so they know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation, which is a monster configured for performance, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop, knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy, but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced, and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.<br/><br/>My preferred browser is Opera, so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault, that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world, so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.<br/><br/>My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge, the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages, and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it, until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate, and that's a serious problem.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it came optimized the way I made, it, I'd give it a 4, maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3, if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year, and based on what I saw, there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email, that has better data management than a Chromebook, then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.</span>

<span>I really, really like this little gizmo. Looks good, feels as solid as one can expect, nice response feel on the keys, crisp display and bright, and lightning fast... for a reason. First things first, I ripped Windows out of this mini laptop shortly after powering it up. Why? Windows is a memory and resource hog. Secondly, the amount of information they want just to run the laptop outside Windows S mode is ridiculous. Hence, Windows had to go, so it I took it out.<br/><br/>In place of Windows I installed Manjaro Linux, based off the Arch Linux distro, using the Xcfe interface system. Both are considered light weight and just seemed perfect for this mini laptop. The OS slid right in without a single problem, it picked up all the hardware on boot-up, and the response times proved better than I hoped. As a test of the battery, I loaded up Youtube with 15 hours of videos and let it run. After nearly exhausting the 15 hours of videos, the laptop battery finally gave up. It impressed me since it played for 14 hours and 27 minutes non-stop. Moreover, the speakers sounded much better than I thought they would. A little tinny, but what could anyone really expect? The laptop never got too warm, either, considering it is a fanless system. It just powered through without a hiccup.<br/><br/>After ten days of regular use it seems rock solid. The shakedown period ran without a hitch. The distro comes with automatic updates, so the OS is kept fresh and update. The WiFi range is quite good. I remained connected to my WiFi for just about fifty feet, and the signal needed to pass through walls. The camera is okay, but to be honest I do not use it much if at all. I simply tested it. At just over two pounds, it travels well in my backpack and I use it during my commutes to and from the office. LibreOffice runs like a champ. GIMP runs like a champ. Audicty runs like a champ. KPatience is quick and fun. Firefox with extensions is incredibly fast... faster than on my main desktop.<br/><br/>This is a great little mini laptop and, with the Manjaro OS changes, is worth more than purchase price. I highly recommend it since it proved so amenable to modification. I would definitely buy again.<br/><br/>6 Months Later... I still love this mini-laptop. I use it almost every day. Mostly I use it for writing, streaming music to a Bluetooth speaker, and a little web surfing, and I could not be happier with this machine. I made the right choice of swapping out the OS. I have recommended it to others, and I know of at least 3 other people who purchased one. They also seemed pleased, but I don't want to speak directly for them.</span>

<span>Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!<br/><br/>This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.<br/><br/>I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.<br/><br/>The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this.<br/><br/>GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!</span>

<span>This laptop is an excellent value and great for travel use.  It's about the same cost as a tablet, except that it has three USB ports that can use flash drives and has the versatility of a laptop.  It's compact and lightweight.</span>

<span>THE SCREEN IS REALLY GOOD FOR OUTDOOR WORK AS I FOUND IT TO BE MORE THAN BRIGHT ENOUGH. THE  UP FACING SPEAKERS MAKE IT SOUND LOUDER THAN IT SHOULD.  I AM USING THIS LAPTOP TO WORK REMOTELY AND IT FILLS THE BILL PERFECTLY. IF I HAD 1 DOWNSIDE IT IS THAT THE CPU IS KINDA WEAK FOR MULTI-TASKING IT ONLY USES 6W WHICH IS GREAT FOR BATTERY LIFE, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN MULTI-TASKING - FOR EXAMPLE WHEN TRYING TO DO 2 BROWSER WINDOWS AT ONCE (SAY PLAY YOUTUBE IN THE BACKROUND AND SOMETHING ELSE) THE SOUND STUTTERS AND MAY CUT OUT FOR A SEC. WHETHER ITS A MATTER OF RAM OR CPU IT DOESNT MATTER AS YOU CANT CHANGE EITHER. THE 64GB SSD IS THE BARE MINIMUM YOU SHOULD SETTLE FOR AS AFTER WINDOWS THERE IS PROB &lt;20GB LEFT. FOR ME THIS IS A GREAT WORK LAPTOP AND THE PRICE COULD NOT BE BEAT.  YOU COULD EVEN PLAY SOME OLDER GAMES ON LOW SETTTINGS (YOU JUST CAN ONLY INSTALL 1 AT A TIME DUE TO SPACE). I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP.</span>

<span>This laptop could be considered good for its price, but it is so slow, it becomes impossible to work on it and by work I mean just browsing on websites and creating PDF and Word files. Nothing crazy. I think this laptop is only good to watch movies, but even for that, the screen is not the best quality.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend it for a 3rd or 4th grader.</span>

<span>I bought an 11.6" Asus back in 2015. Yes it got a slow at a certain point but it maintained! This time round decided for a bit of a bigger screen and happy I made that choice. I've had this 14" notebook now for 4 days and so far it's exactly what I wanted...same as my one before just a bigger screen. And of course way faster since it's new! Highly recommend. Definitely sticking to Asus when the time comes again to buy another notebook!</span>

<span>I'll do my best to update this review as time goes on.<br/><br/>23 Aug 2022 -- Day 0 -- I just received the laptop. So far it's impressive for the price point. First thing I did was charge it up, start-up (don't connect to the internet if you want to bypass Microsofts mandatory account login) and immediately went to disable S mode.  If you don't already know, S-Mode means you can ONLY install Microsoft apps from their app store. Nope. Gone. That's when I noticed the first issue.<br/><br/>The title of the laptop I purchased was "ASUS L410 MA-DB02 Ultra Thin Laptop, 14” FHD Display, Intel Celeron N4020 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, NumberPad, Windows 10 Home in S Mode, Star Black"<br/><br/>The laptop I received has Windows 11 S-mode installed. Thankfully my applications installed correctly. I'll do my best to not turn this into a Microsoft/Windows rant - but yes, things are different from 10.<br/><br/>Another thing to note. The description on the Amazon website (and even the photos) say this laptop comes with a backlit keyboard, which was a huge selling point for me given the use I had planned for it. Taken right from the description "L410 comes with a backlit keyboard." This laptop does NOT have a backlit keyboard. The key F7 is blank. Pressing it does nothing, even w/ the Function Key + F7.  Bummer.<br/><br/>Otherwise, seems like a legit laptop so far. I'll update if anything changes.</span>
