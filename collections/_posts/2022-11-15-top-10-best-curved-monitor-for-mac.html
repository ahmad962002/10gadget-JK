<span>I work from home time to time and had enough of my little laptop with a small screen attached, I decided to spoil myself with the greatest and I purchased just that. My laptop and PS4 are both connected to the monitor and I hooked up speakers to it and it’s just outstanding Quality for both. Make sure your PC’s video card supports 4K before purchase (not that it matters depending who you are) to get the best out of this monitor.</span>

<span>Just got this yesterday. 32" from corner to corner, a little over 31" diagonally across the screen. Bottom edge of monitor while on stand is about 3.6" above desk. Everything on screen appears smooth and sharp (because 4k). I feel that monitors over 30" should be UHD if your face is between 2 and 3 feet away. With a WQHD monitor of this size, I was having a harder time seeing enemy players from long distances away while gaming, but UHD brings in that detail.<br/><br/>When I first got this, the screen was extremely bright and a little washed out. (Mine came from a company that had been testing it in another language too, apparently, so the settings had already been messed with.) I lowered the brightness to 35 and boosted the colors to more accurately match my IPS monitor. It looks great now and much better than other VA monitors.<br/><br/>For Freesync, you will need to install third-party software. I originally thought this was a Freesync monitor when I bought it, but there were no options in the on-screen display. I already had a program installed for custom resolutions, and I found that it also had options to enable Freesync. AMD's Freesync range is pretty big, but monitors have a specific range in which it actually works, so I tested between 35 and 60Hz. This one's Freesync range turned out to be 43-59 Hz. If you stray outside the range, you'll experience signal loss. Additionally, this only works with HDMI.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: if you choose to enable Freesync on a monitor, research how to do it first, and don't freak out if your monitor goes black. You should probably have another monitor handy in case you mess up. If your Freesync range is different, you'll have to test your lower and upper bounds by limiting framerate to test for signal loss. I will not share exactly how I enabled Freesync because someone capable of doing this should be able to figure it out from what I wrote, and I don't want to be blamed for someone somehow bricking their rig and setting their house on fire.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm in love with this monitor already, and if anything were to happen to it, I would be deeply upset and agitated.</span>

<span>first off, once again, 1 star removed bcz the carriers you choose to use lie about delivery, then dont deliver to my actual address forcing me to walk heavy boxes up 3 flights of stairs. the carriers have dollies and stuff for that, i do not, so ill keep removing a star until you gain control over your carriers.<br/><br/>1 star removed bcz i tried to cancel this before it shipped but received an email saying it was too late to cancel, but it didnt actually ship until 30 hours later. good job people, keep it up.<br/><br/>1 star removed because you sent a 400.00 item in a giant box with not one piece of bubble wrap. if i had the energy i would box all this up and send it back. all my packages from amazon these past 2 weeks have come with little or no bubble and im buying up parts for a VR computer, so that about 3500.00 over 3 e-tailers and 4 different carriers, all arriving in busted boxes at the wrong location with no protection. this is your job. why is it hard?<br/><br/>so you just lost 60% of your rating for avoidable things that are persistent in your supply chain. amazon has been getting worse and worse and worse ever since it started being another e-bay with shady sellers and wildly fluctuating prices and shipping. your usefulness is coming to and end when prime video is no better than free youtube, your products are price matched , and your delivery methods are corrupted.<br/><br/>now for the monitor. i should keep taking stars away, but i would be left with negatives. first the bezel"less". there is a bottom branded bezel, along with 1/8" of dead space. the other 3 sides all have 1/4" dead space. so you effectively have an internal bezel of non-usable screen real estate that still takes up the space a monitor that doesnt shave off inches does.<br/><br/>next - display port. it does have 1 display port. ive read reviews where it did not, and that was the reason for my cancel request. well, that and no vesa, really, why would you not include that? seems intentionally cheap. anyway about the DP, i dont know if samsung updated this model to include it, or previous reviewers got bait and switched with a different model (this also happens here on amazon, just look at some "renewed" item listings), or simply didnt recognize the port as it looks like hdmi in the dark, and it is dark up in the cable attachment area. in any case you get one now. just one. version 1.2<br/><br/>no vesa. you know, this is disheartening as vesa compatibility has almost become ubiquitous. so this was a choice. a choice made by someone who is completely out of touch with todays home and soho computing. its one thing to not include the vesa if you are going to give us a stand with lots of motion, and stability, and good materials. instead you get a cheap tube frame and about 5 degress of motion up and down, no side to side. the frame is so cheap , i assume, bcz they engineered the weight and design of the monitor to hold it steady. in this it is marginally successful, but only by using a lot of desk space.<br/><br/>controls - are a joke. i do enjoy the joystick type navigation on the power button, serving double duty as the way to nav the menu. however, you get contrast, brightness, volume....oh yeah, thats it. why have a menu?<br/><br/>documentation/box contents - you get a lot of useless information, like a warning not to pour water on it, but no product spec sheet, which i immediately hunted for to put the display port thing to rest. no case badge, no stickers of any kind, no cleaning cloth, no display port cord. nothing. im sorry, you do get a cheap 6' hdmi cable and a typical power cable.<br/><br/>color. when i plugged it in, i had typical hd settings on my ben-q ips. so i immediately got a pop up warning for that. once i changed it to 4k settings, it filled up my screen but was washed out, grey. even now with brightness on 100, the top amazon blue nav bar looks muted and washed out. the white area where i am typing is kinda grimy grey. there are no controls to change this on the monitor. obviously you can use windows to calibrate, which i just took a time out from this review to do. setting brightness on 50 even though it looks like typing on a gym sock, i went through the process, only to find at the end, nothing changed at all. except my brightness control was reset to zero, giving me the ability to raise total brightness past the previous max. welcome because now i can see, but still washed out colors.<br/><br/>cyber monday had some ok deals and there are screens by AOC and even LG that i should have tried. but i own lots of samsung stuff and im typically happy, so i went with this one. at 500.00 original cost i would lol in your face while i packed it up and returned it. at the 399.00 i paid i feel raw by about 150.00. this is a 250.00 monitor tops. there is way too much competition, good competition, for samsung to release this giant box of pffft.<br/><br/>im going to keep it for either my 3rd or 4th favorite computer, but thats only bcz its here in my house already, but it wont ever be connected to any machine i use every day.<br/><br/>skip this. people will say its the cheapest 4k so get it. but washed out colors, no vesa, simplistic controls and giant footprint on your desk make it a sure pass. i havent even tried to watch anything in 4k yet bcz it cant make web browsing look good and im too tired to get more irritated at this junk.<br/><br/>oh, i forgot cable management. imagine the cheapest thinnest plastic ever, then make it thinner, and this is your backplate which covers the area where the stand screws to the screen and offers a hidden channel to run your pwr, dp, and hdmi cords down to the desk level. this demands careful thought as a previous reviewer ranted about the cables falling out. well, yes, the hdmi slot is too wide and it will fall out over time, as will the power cable, however you can coil and bend the wires to a point where you can make then exert upward pressure to keep them seated. no tape or glue needed. it takes time bcz you dont have alot of room to work in and you dont have a lot of room to coil up inches of cable in there. the fisher price backplate is not strong enough to hold it if you could. this was a design flaw and an obvious one that should have been caught and rectified during product testing. recessed, side facing ports with a usb 3.0 or 2 or 3 would have been a good addition, and one which most of the competition has included so once again im left scratching my head as to why samsung decided not to include these features.<br/><br/>after i finished writing this, i have to go back and take another star off for quality of product. i hate 1 star reviews, but samsung and amazon deserve it.</span>

<span>This monitor is good but not great. I could not understand why a curved 4K monitor was as affordable as this one, but now I think I get it.<br/><br/>The stand is unusable unless your desk is built on bedrock. I use a sit/stand desk, so sometimes a bit wobbly to begin with. While it was never an issue with my old iMac, the flimsy stand on this monitor makes it unusable for my Mac mini setup.<br/><br/>The curve is kind of eh. It’s not a uniform curve, so anything on the edge of the screen seems mildly distorted without adjusting my seating position. After I moved my desk around a bit it was better. Be patient if you’ve not used a similar monitor before.<br/><br/>I don’t game but I do read a lot using my computer. Occasionally some fonts were blurry when the next paragraph with a system font was crisp. So I looked at the same email on other devises with zero problems. It’s only a problem on this monitor. It doesn’t make sense to me.<br/><br/>The exterior of the monitor looks great. The menu is relatively easy to figure out. The cable management piece on the back of the stand is outstanding; makes for a very clean setup. I just wish it were sturdier.<br/><br/>I want to love this monitor but the stand makes it unusable with anything more than the most gentle typing. I’ll be returning it as soon as it’s replacement arrives in a few days.</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I want to start by saying this monitor is amazing, hands down worth the money. It can almost replace your TV!(we will get to why it can not though in the cons section) Just make sure you have the desk space for it as it sits about 45 inches long and a good 9 inches away from the wall.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-Large, Very large, honestly it is game changing, I upgraded from a 35inch ultrawide and didnt think it would be a huge difference... I was wrong, and now I cant go back.<br/>-2 27 inch monitors with out the bar makes it great for multitasking, and better because you can have 3 full size windows screen up since there is no bar.<br/>-5120x1440p is honestly a must at this size, any smaller resolution and it wouldnt look so great.  Another good thing about this resolution is that it looks amazing but its still not as many pixels to push as 4k making gaming on epic at max resolution possible<br/>-120hz You can probably OC it to a little bit more if you drop the color to 8bit or lower, and maybe even to 1080p(probably get 144hz) but honestly 120hz is a sweet spot for most gamers.<br/>-HDR10 yes 1000 nits of HDR beauty, only problem, is there aren't a lot of games that support it and not a lot of shows that do either. Still at the time of this review is the only 49inch with HDR10<br/>-Customize-able menus, you can change colors, black light,refresh rate,etc all at a push of a button.<br/>-Crosshair , yes a crosshair built into the monitor makes it so much easier to aim for games without it, and even helps for games with bad crosshairs.<br/>-Stand allows an above average range of motion(no swivel, but pivet and vertical movement)<br/>-Gsync/Fresync compatible (I tested it, it does work with this monitor)<br/>Picture in picture, allows you to see both HDMI/DVI ports at one time by splitting the screen or putting one in an overlay.<br/>-Qled while not as good as OLED, QLED does improve the blacks, RGB and still gives your a pretty snappy response rate.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-No Speakers (not that it matters too much at this price point, as if you can afford $1000 worth of monitor you can afford some solid speakers/headphones)<br/>-HDR on windows 10 kind of sucks at the moment, leaves a hazy look when you aren't on HDR content. And if you are in a game on fullscreen and try to adjust the volume, windows will tab out the game to show you the volume then tab back in causing you to miss a good 10 seconds.<br/>-If you use to a dual monitor setup for work, and you screen share a lot, this may not be the monitor for you. As there isn't a way to share just one side of the screen, you'll have to share the full screen<br/>-It is really large, had to buy a bigger desk to actually fit it comfortablely.(not really a con but still)<br/>-No movies or tv shows will take up the whole screen due to the aspect ratio of 32:9 Which is why it can't really replace a tv as you'll be watching most content on a 27inch portion of the screen and a few on 21:9. Now on chrome you can install an extension called ultradewide which will stretch out the content on most streaming sites but thats as good as you'll get.<br/>-A lot of games (like overwatch) wont support 32:9 aspect ratio, however most games that support 21:9 do support 32:9 and you'll just have to change Field of View. Rare exception is Overwatch which supports only up to 21:9<br/>-The stand breaks relatively easily, well at least the little connectors at the bottom.. not a big problem but still., as the monitor is pretty heavy. could be due to improper installation.<br/>-The box it comes in is revealing, I would make sure it gets delivered at a time that you're home as you can't hide it, it's too large, makes it an easy target for thieves since they know exactly what's in the box.<br/>-No way(as far as I know) to split the screen and have 2 full screens applications open, now this can be a limitation of windows or software, but I wish there was a way to do that because this monitor is the perfect size for it.<br/><br/>UPDATED REVIEW<br/>It’s been a few months now and the monitor is still holding up pretty well.<br/>Pros<br/>-windows has fixed the hdr issues where if you adjust volume while in full screen it would flash a black screen,<br/>-I believe if you plug in 2 HDMI/DVI into the monitor from the same computer you can treat it as dual screen<br/>Cons<br/>-gets  hot, you’ll notice if if you’re in a small room especially with your computer on.<br/>-This version is not worth it seeming the price is almost the same as the Odyssey but the odyssey specs are better.<br/>-if you a big into movies and  videos this monitor is not for you, honestly I would say go get a 21:9 ultra wide or one of LGs new TVs with 4K 120hz, you can get a 48in for about the same price(it is tower however there are more months available)<br/>- it does support vesa and does include a vesa mounting bracket however there are few vesa mounts that are able to support this behemoth. I’m using one that is underrated for this monitor size so far so good...<br/>- Qled is good when the whole screen is taking up by content, on 32:9 aspect ratio but anything below that will have the black bars on the side(literally all streaming content and quite a few AAA games)  since Qled is still LED it has a back light that noticeable fades away from the center. So you have the big bright grey area when it should be all black. The price of 32:9<br/><br/>Overall still good however save your money for the odyssey/ a gaming tv unless you can find a used one. Samsung doesn’t offer much support or parts replacement for these anymore so good luck if anything ever happens to it or gets lost.</span>

<span>I loved this monitor for the 10 days I had it. The screen real estate beats having two normal 1080 monitors side by side. Using Display Fusion I even set it up to have 3 sections and it functioned like 3 4:3 monitors when I was working. I could do anything I wanted to with so much horizontal space.<br/><br/>A slightly higher vertical space would have made it a perfect. Maybe they'll release a 1440p version soon. But this is the only gripe I have about this monitor, other than the problem that required me to return it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't comment on the FreeSync2 technology. I have a 980ti graphics card so i can't get the full effect. But I never really saw screen tearing when I played games on it which is what *Sync technologies are meant to fix. I played the entirety of South Park The Stick of Truth and it looked outstanding on this monitor. Especially since I could play it windowed and have all my other windows open at the same time. I jumped into Rise of the Tomb Raider just to see full 32:9 gaming and it was amazing. Although I didn't play extensively in this mode, I would love to get back to it one day. If you get this monitor, consider searching around for 32:9 gaming suggestions, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>And it defaults to 144hz refresh rate. I've never really experienced high refresh rates outside of televisions with 120hz, and it gave TV shows an unreal feel until I got used to it. For gaming, the increased refresh rate adds a smoothness that can't be denied as anything other than awesome. The short time in Tomb Raider gave it that leap from game to actual cinematic experience for me.<br/><br/>The build quality is quite good, with some caveats. There are some little plastic parts that could break easily right at the hinge of the stand. And there is some weird plastic shield that goes around the hinge as well, I assume to disperse the light on the back of the monitor. The stand itself felt like I could go on a car bludgeoning spree with it and still use it as a monitor stand at the end of the day. It extremely solid. The monitor is actually pretty heavy when it's all put together, but moving it vertically up and down is super smooth and it never slipped on me, even when I accidentally bumped the table numerous times. This is obviously a foundation that's built to last.<br/><br/>The options on the monitor are super easy to use, with what it normally a power button on other monitors being turned into small joystick. It has tons of options available to get your picture exactly how you want it. In fact PRO TIP: the first thing you should do after you set up this monitor is go into the settings, look under System and change the DisplayPort version to 1.2 or 1.1 if you are using a DisplayPort cable. When I first set up the monitor I had the same problems other people did. The text was a little fuzzy and weird to read and everything felt a little fuzzy. Moving this setting down to 1.2 clicked everything into focus. The screen was super sharp from there on.<br/><br/>But, as I've said earlier, all was not well in Samsung land. The DisplayPort cable that came with the monitor lacks the locking mechanism distinct to DisplayPort cables. Which is made even more weird by the fact that it actually has the button that normally retracts the locking feature. So it's like they ordered cables without the locking feature, but didn't want to redesign the rest of it. This resulted in random disconnects in the source to the monitor. I thought the screen was refreshing, which sometimes happens when I view HD content from my PC on my TV. But it started occuring more often and turned out to be the loose cable. But I replaced it with a Cable Matters brand DP cable and it worked like a charm. No more random black screens.<br/><br/>And sadly, that brings us to the reason I had to return it. About 10 days into using the monitor, it randomly flashed white, like the LEDs were in overdrive. The screen contents were barely visible and everything still worked, it was all just super whited out. The screen refreshed and it went back to normal. But I woke up the next morning and the screen was permanently stuck in this whited out mode. It wasn't the source, cable, or settings. I tested all of them individually. Samsung's troubleshooting page lists this exact problem and to test it without the monitor connected to a source at all. And yep, I disconnect the DIsplayPort cable and the entire screen was bright white on it's own. The only option was getting it serviced. Again, this thing weighs a ton and they would have probably charged me shipping to service it, so I chose to replace it instead through Amazon. But immediately after setting up replacement, which was an option I was allowed to choose during the returns process, they told me they couldn't replace it. Most likely because I got it during a sale. And I totally understand. They even offered free return shipping so a replacement felt too good to be true. So instead I'm getting a full refund, which is nice.<br/><br/>So if you buy this monitor, I would 100% buy it through Amazon. Their service is amazing. But know that if something goes wrong, you can't really replace it, you have to get a refund and buy it again.<br/><br/>Man, I'm seriously going to miss this monitor. That week I had it put me off multiple monitor solutions completely. One giant, seamless screen is just to good and useful in my job (Software Engineer). Maybe if it goes on sale to 999 or less again I'll jump back in. Or even better, a 5120x1440 version which I would pay full price for if it maintained this size and all of it's features. I was days away from buying a Vega64 card for FreeSync2 before these problems started, so if they got those handled and increased the resolution just a bit, this monitor would be the best choice ever. But this monitor was in no ways disappointing. I only gave it 4 stars because of the lack luster cables that came with it and the fact that 1440p might have been a bit better for vertical real estate. Still, I highly recommend this monitor is it drops down to a normal, sub 1.5k or even sub 1k price. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>And remember, if you do get it, SWITCH THAT SYSTEM SETTING FROM DP 1.2+ TO ONLY DP 1.2/1.1!!!!!</span>

<span>Updated Review - received this item almost 2 months later than promised.<br/>Updated Review - Product DisplayPort failed working and Samsung support is unwilling to resolve the issue as they have the item miscategorized in their system and they told me to contact Amazon for replacement. Amazon refusing to replace.<br/><br/>DESIGN - 3/5<br/><br/>The monitor is super curved and I like that. It's not like those gimmicky "curved" ones where it's not really curved. It's definitely more curved than it looks in the photos. That's part of the reason it looks so thick in the stock photos, however, this monitor is still extremely bulky. The bezel is pretty large, and the stand is large for no reason. I have a heavier TV that has a smaller stand than this - there's absolutely no reason they needed to make the stand take up this much space. It's almost impossible to really put the monitor "back" that much and make sure you have a pretty large desk. Right now I have this on a dining table (pretty large) and it takes up a large portion of it, not just the length but depth. The back of the stand is pretty cool with the lightning, the stand is pretty solid, and the anti-glare works as well as other monitors. But I honestly feel like this should have been able to make this a little less bulky.<br/><br/>PICTURE QUALITY - 3/5<br/><br/>This is where I started getting disappointed. The picture quality doesn't really look like "QLED." I have an LG OLED TV and I've also seen the Samsung QLED TVs on display. It's not really as bright as they say, or at least it doesn't feel like 600 nits. Maybe I misread that figure somewhere - Samsung has finally updated their site to show 350 nits. It's important to note that their QLED TVs have over 1000 nits of brightness so I'm not sure why they're calling this QLED. They're obviously not as good as OLED, but this one is a lot closer to a TN monitor than their "QLED" Televisions. Everything looks washed out. I mean it's not bad when you compare it to other "regular" monitors, but it's pretty bad compared to anything in this price range: OLED, QLED TVs, and OLED TVs. The viewing angle is also pretty bad. If you get too close to the monitor (which you'll have to since the stand is so big) the viewing angle may bother you to a degree, especially with the anti-glare. I had a curved IPS LG monitor before this that I returned because of backlight bleeding. There doesn't seem to be much on this monitor, but the picture quality on the LG, I would say, was better. In addition, you can really notice the lower pixels per inch when you're forced to get closer to this monitor, due to the stand as mentioned previously. There's a wall mount bracket that comes with this so you could give that a try.<br/><br/>PICTURE AFTER TUNING - 4.5/5<br/><br/>Once you can mess with the settings, there's more you can achieve out of this monitor. You can put it on a high brightness mode where it definitely looks like the 350 nits now advertised on their site. However, once you tune it, it's not really a "gaming" monitor anymore. So again, it's nice to use the multiple-mode buttons to switch between them based on what you're viewing. However, it's still misleading when Samsung shows the HDR and high brightness on a game. Realistically you wouldn't lower the settings on a game to get a better picture quality. Still not as good as my OLED TV, but maybe a little bit brighter on average, since OLED TVs automatically lower brightness based on what you're watching.<br/><br/>QUALITY CONTROL - 2/5<br/><br/>Noticed a dead pixel on the screen. Really a shame when what you're really paying for is the panel. There was also a screw missing when this was shipped because of the way they ship this, which I will cover later. There was also scuffing all over the back of the screen because of the way it was shipped. Some back-light bleeding on the corner, not too bad. None of this is acceptable when they're charging $1500 for the panel.<br/><br/>DISPLAY CONFIGURATIONS - 4/5<br/><br/>This monitor does pretty good with 144Hz and the response time seems fine. With a GTX 1080 on this resolution I can get 144fps or higher on CSGO. Other games, not so much. There's different response time modes, and for "fastest" which I assume is 1ms, the brightness goes down, which kind of sucks. There's an "eye saver" mode which is cool to have on displays, as I have on my other newer displays, but this one is extreme. It'll definitely save your eyes but it washes out everything to an extreme degree and the brightness is turned down a lot as well. I definitely cannot use that mode, so I'll have to stick to f.lux to solve the problem. There's also a mode to turn the LED backlight on and off, but it doesn't do anything - it might be important to note this was "off" by default. So for gaming you obviously want the fastest response and best "gaming" settings but when you're not gaming you probably want the higher brightness. The thing I really like about this monitor is that they have 3 dedicated physical buttons to different "modes" so you can switch between different settings quickly. I wish all displays would do this.<br/><br/>FORM FACTOR - 4/5<br/><br/>This is the perfect resolution for multi-tasking. It's easy to arrange everything, and it's in the same line of sight. I've used 4K televisions before (and still do) to have multiple windows open. I would say it's not as nice having windows floating up higher on a 4K resolution, so this is basically 4K cut in half where you need it. You can comfortably fit 3 windows on the screen. Ever had two monitors and you had awkwardly small resolutions for 2 windows on both screens? Well this is the perfect resolution for 3, instead of 4 windows with scrollbars at the bottom. However, since this is a GAMING monitor, it's important to note that a lot of games don't really support this resolution so it's useless. For example, CSGO will just stretch the edges so you don't really get any extra real estate and it just looks bad in the corners when you look at it. Overwatch doesn't support it at all. Then when you game borderless, you can't really use the corners. If you game in windowed mode, since it's 1080 pixels high, but you lose space at the task bar and the top of the window, so you can't really play at 1080p. What would have been really cool is if they made this a little "taller" and bumped up the resolution while maintaining the same pixels per inch. So something like 1200 pixels high and have it be like 50" or so diagonally instead.<br/><br/>SHIPPING, SPECS &amp; PRICING - 1/5<br/><br/>I purchased this immediately after it was released for a pre-order on Amazon. It looks like Amazon sold more than it actually had ordered with Samsung, and Samsung delayed the launch. Then it went from July to August delivery. I should have ordered directly from Samsung.<br/><br/>With that set aside, this is an extremely high pricing got what you're getting. This is basically a 55" curved QLED cut in half. Samsung is definitely price gouging on this one, even though the response time is better than a TV. Now I'm not complaining specifically about the price, but lack of features for the price. Samsung has opted for the cheaper FreeSync over G-Sync and anyone who can afford this probably has an Nvidia GTX 1080 or higher. Otherwise you won't even be able to utilize the 144Hz on most games that come out today. So why go with AMD when their new graphics cards aren't even out? There's also a lack of a lot of specifications on Amazon and Samsung's website. When I received the item, it was single shipped and there were some scuffs already on the back of the monitor. They also leave the screws dangling inside the monitor stand, so I was missing a screw when I received the monitor. Finally, it's extremely hard to get this out of the packaging if you're just one person although it's manageable, but I do like how they organized the box from top to bottom.<br/><br/>DEFECTS - 0/5<br/><br/>This monitor came with a bright dead pixel. Samsung's policy is only to replace these if you contact them within 7 days, but this isn't sufficient time to notice it and it's also not sufficient time to contact their support for RMA since the product isn't even listed properly on their RMA portal since it's a new product. This effectively means they won't be able to assist you. In addition to this problem, DisplayPort stopped working after about a week. So it's not possible to use 144Hz with my monitor anymore.<br/><br/>SUPPORT - 0/5<br/><br/>I have been trying to contact Samsung for weeks. Using the live chat, email, and calling them. Originally this monitor did not even exist on their site. The Consumer support says it's a Business product, which doesn't make sure, but they ensured me any monitor above 34" is business. The Business support says it's a consumer product. If you call them you'll get transferred in an endless loop because Samsung didn't put this in their system properly, and this is months after the product is out. You cannot request a service/RMA because you cannot select the model # that doesn't exist, and the serial number lookup does not work either.<br/><br/>TOTAL - 2/5<br/><br/>Overall this is an okay monitor if you factor in everything, and pretend like you didn't pay $1500 for it. I have a lot of money to blow, desk space, as well as a separate OLED TV to watch movies on and do everything else, so its fine for me and I'll most likely keep it since it's the only monitor right now with this type of ultra wide screen.</span>

<span>Took me a week or so to get used to the ratio (this replaced a 49" Seiki 4k TV that had a more standard aspect ratio). I find for some reason that keyboard placement relative to the middle of the screen has become more important to avoid awkward arm stretching. Having a browser, Slack, mail, notes, and other apps all side-by-side, without overlap (and without the awkward up-and-down visual scanning that the traditional 16:9 ratio required on a 49" screen) is ... life-changing might be too strong a word, but it will definitely change how you work and game.<br/><br/>Regarding games: if you're on a Mac, manage your expectations; gzDoom + Project Brutality runs great, and Borderlands 2 does, but the last Deus Ex vehicle has weird offset problems with button/crosshair offsets that render the game virtually unplayable. Finding games (FPS, anyway) that run well at 32:9 on the native resolution, that *also* run on Apple Silicon, is a bit of a challenge. I haven't tried on Windows yet; if you're connecting to a MacBook Pro, be sure you get a good quality USB-C to DisplayPort cable - the native HDMI port on the Mac won't drive the monitor at full resolution. I'm using this one and it works great: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08B3XNZGS/<br/><br/>One downside is that I get the occasional flicker in the screen after wake from sleep, but it seems to subside after a while. I got the entry-level QLED model, not the 240Hz or the mini LED variants - decided that even the base model was such a huge upgrade that it wasn't worth twice the price to get the mini LED variant. If you're doing game streaming or anything competitive, you may want to spring for the high-end version.</span>

<span>I needed a curved screen, but there are not a lot of options for these in the market anymore. That's a shame because curve screens are helpful for a field of view and maximizing space on the desk. In any case, I needed a curve screen in 32 in, or I would have to go down to a 27-in flat screen. This is for my second monitor. Where I would keep a discord window, web browser, etc. open. While working, I use the second screen for my thumbnail picture viewer, and my main screen (also 4K) is split in half between a composition window and usually a Kindle or web browser.<br/><br/>For my purposes, this monitor is perfect. I cannot speak to its gaming performance at all, and I'm not terribly concerned about color fidelity, nor am I a good judge of such things, but I am very satisfied with the picture quality.<br/><br/>The second major requirement for a monitor was that it switched inputs effectively. I was replacing a flat screen 32-in Samsung that was having difficulty recognizing new inputs even when there was only one active input. This screen accurately and quickly picks up the active input, either display port or HDMI, quickly and consistently. This is not a function of the graphics card as many troubleshooting recommendations suggest, because the only factor that has changed was the monitor itself.<br/><br/>Lastly, the controls for the monitor are located beneath the screen not on the side and not on the back. This is extremely important if you're using a second monitor because so many of these things come with controls on the back of the monitor! This makes them inaccessible for side by side screens! There is no such problem when the controls are beneath the screen rather than on the side or the back. So that was another major upgrade from the Samsung.<br/><br/>My only criticisms, thus far, is that this end almost every other monitor I've looked at only come with one display port and usually two HDMI ports. These are computer screens. DisplayPort is the computer screen standard. My graphics cards have three display ports and only one native HDMI port. That's because their computers, not TVs. Thus I would like to see multiple display ports and only one HDMI for legacy compatibility. Instead, 90% of the monitors on the market are the opposite.<br/><br/>Secondly, the port on the back of the monitor stick out at 90° angles. Thus requiring more space to accommodate HDMI display port and power cables. They should be flush with the monitor plugged into a female port facing down. I'm not sure what the decision making process was for this design, but I generally dislike monitors with cables that stick out at 90° angles. Although, they are always easier to plug in if space is not a concern.</span>

<span>Just got this monitor today and I've set it up with my gaming PC. First, this monitor is quite large. I love that though! I was looking for a monitor I could use as a TV in my room as well and I'm happy about this one since I can watch Netflix from my bed as well. The monitor is a great size for doing split screens as well. Both sides are still super easy to see/read. The quality of the images are really good as well. I was playing a game with lots of colors and it looked great! So far, I don't have any negative things to say. Overall, perfect for both work and gaming. Highly recommend!</span>

<span>I bought this monitor 8 months ago as an external for my 2021 Macbook Pro M1 16", and although the picture quality was nice, it kept flickering.  I had to constantly change the color profile to remedy this, and it would often be a color profile that didn't quite work for me.  The screen was also VERY fragile.  Last week, I accidentally bumped the screen VERY lightly with the edge of my bluetooth keyboard, and it cracked, rendering the monitor useless.  I had no accidental damage protection as far as I know, and it would have cost hundreds to fix, so I decided to sideline it and purchase a new LG 34WN80C-B UltraWide 34” 21:9 Curved WQHD (3440 x 1440) IPS Display, and it has performed flawlessly, ... with NO flickering.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this Philips 328E1CA monitor due to the flickering and fragility, among a few other annoyances like the questionable support and UI.  Although the picture is nice, I'm way happier with my new LG Ultrawide 34".</span>

<span>I'm using this curved 4K monitor with my Mac Mini and I love it. In order to get 60Hz at 4K with a Mac Mini you will need to get the right cable. I'm using a $15 Thunderbolt/USB-C to DisplayPort cable and it works great. With HDMI you will only get 30Hz at 4K, I believe.<br/><br/>The other thing that took me days to figure out is that some apps/games will cause the screen to flicker really badly. Don't panic! You just have to change the color profile. Go to the "Displays" settings, and select sRGB, or P3, or Adobe RGB, or some other profile and you WILL find a profile that doesn't flicker. I use the same profile 99% of the time, and then I change it for the one or two odd apps that cause the problem. I really don't think this is a monitor issue. I think it's a graphics driver issue with the Mini. In any case, the fix only takes 10 seconds and it always works.<br/><br/>By the way, the text will be tiny by default. If I set the resolution to "scaled" and then select the 3008x1692 option, the text and UI elements will be scaled to be readable, but the rest of the screen will still be 4K. I didn't believe it at first, but it's true. I didn't want to scale anything because I thought it would work like Windows where it scales the entire screen and you lose clarity. With Mac OS the scaling appears to only affect the UI. The app window content is all still 4K.<br/><br/>I've been using this monitor for about 4 months now and after doing all the above, it has functioned perfectly. The curved thing does take a while to get used to though. I actually like it now.</span>

<span>Will try to edit later. This is a good monitor, had previously bought one a few years back at Best Buy for  my Dad. My old Viewsonic just bought the dust so, I was looking for a new  monitor &amp; after trying to find one that fits my criteria - I ended up choosing this model.  I am currently unable to review this particular monitor I just received, as it does NOT come with a VGA cable, which I know is antiquated - but, I am still using a VGA style KVM switch &amp; need to get a new HDMI style. I will try to edit OR add on later once I am able to determine how well this one from Amazon performs..<br/>===================================================== UPDATE (6-28-21) it has been a while &amp; forgot to update - I love this monitor --- the only thing that bugs me &amp; I may not have noticed on my older monitor to see if, it happened there also ---- is that you will notice some shimmer around text &amp; icons. Other than the aforementioned, the colors, the brightness, etc are all great - BUT, have noticed at least with these monitors of the shimmer or vibration around text &amp; icons - you will NOT notice on larger items on screen.  I have never noticed this before on any monitor until this one - it may be common to all monitors OR just this one - I have not been on any other monitor yet since to compare. In any case it does NOT bother me, just something I noticed.  I would buy this again !!</span>

<span>*Update 3*<br/>My replacement screen now has several dead pixels, and several pixels which wont unstick attempting several different methods. Not too pleased with the overall quality control on these.<br/><br/>Potential in this screen, but quality control issues would prevent a recommendation.<br/>Finally if you have two TB3 devices connected, you can switch between the two by powering one down fully while the other remains on, this will switch input and then you can power back on your other device.  Not the most convenient process, but I find it easier than removing cables.<br/>*** UPDATE 2 ***<br/>Some very important items if you are considering this monitor:<br/>#1 Bad item: YOU CANNOT SWITCH SOURCES BETWEEN THE 2 TB3 INPUTS.  If you have 2 TB3 devices plugged into the monitor.  You have to fully SHUT THE MONITOR DOWN as well as both devices, then power on the device you want to use and the monitor will pick up the correct TB3 input...repeat you cannot switch input sources between the two TB3 inputs...this stinks.<br/><br/>#2 Bad item: You can't just press the power button to turn it off.  You have to go through the OSD to turn off the monitor which makes it 3 clicks for a function that should be 1 click.  Really annoying and really terrible IMHO.<br/><br/>#3 Bad Item: The monitor will regularly fail to power your peripherals in which case you may have to power cycle the monitor, unplug the devices from this screen itself.  This is a real annoyance.<br/><br/>I still stand by the picture quality but this monitor has so many other flaws it may be best to wait until the next gen or a different brand has something similar (if your needing 2 TB3 inputs)<br/>***** UPDATE *****<br/>So after having the monitor for only 4 days, the joystick that operates the On Screen Display stopped working when being pressed a certain direction.  Calling amazon to hopefully get this exchanged right now.<br/><br/>Having been used to laptop screens primarily for the last decade, I had been wanting an ultrawide and it was a tough choice deciding which screen to go with.<br/><br/>I was between this monitor, the new LG 34gk950f which was eliminated because it is on backorder everywhere, and the old Alienware AW3418DW.  The Alienware I had seen in person several times and while gameplay is fantastic on the screen, the colors were not very vibrant and it seemed a little dull.  Since I will be using this for work, media and gaming I saw the samsung and the contrast compared to the Alienware is a good bit better.  So my choice was made, and I hoped for the best for gaming.  Now here are my thoughts after one brief day with it; I'll update this review down the road.<br/><br/>********NOTE********<br/>In windows with 100% scaling the text is clean and crisp looks great on websites and documents etc.<br/>On Mojave 10.14.3 the scaling is not perfect.  Pictures images still look great but the text is a little jagged.  You can mess with the settings and make it a little better but oddly it does look better in Windows 10.<br/><br/>Build Quality/VESA MOUNTING -<br/>So let me get the red herring out of the way and put it out there; I don't like the VESA Mount setup for this monitor at all.  Sure it's actually pretty easy to remove the pre-attached stand and install the mount, only 2 phillips screws, but the way it is designed it adds about 2" of depth to the monitor when depth is the area that I am already lacking.  This could have easily been solved by having a flat portion on the back of the monitor or having the vesa mount point on the monitor itself be vertically positioned against the rear of the monitor and having the adapter plate attach the same way.  Either way just know if you do plan on mounting this that the screen will end up 2" deeper than it should be.<br/>Build Quality of the frame and stand itself is fantastic. It's all plastic all around, but it doesn't reek of low quality, it definitely feels sturdy.  A 'joystick' on the rear of the display controls the OSD easily and when it is pushed it powers the screen on/off.  If you plan on using the stand, it has a removable panel for cable management but it doesn't look like it will fit more than 3-4 cables max.<br/>Last thing to note about the cables; they are NICE! Samsung stepped up and gave use some very high quality HDMI, and power cabling here make sure you account for the HUGE power brick.  They also included a 2m Thunderbolt 3 cable in which is high quality as well.<br/><br/>Screen Quality-<br/>So I don't have any professional tools but there are calibration results saved from the factory you can look at in the OSD and there is ability to do fine tuning.  Beside my 2018 Macbook Pro the colors have a little bit of a red tint to them but they are very very close, the blacks on this Samsung VA panel are far superior to the macbook's though. It's not perfect, the blue/green colors aren't as well defined on here, but again overall this is a fantastic picture on this panel and the 100hz refresh rate makes web browsing and videos playback very smoothly.<br/><br/>Features-<br/>Part of the reason the 21:9 34+ monitor decision is so difficult is because seeming no one monitor has everything, KVM, 1440p+ resolution, 120+ refresh rate, Speakers (i know they suck but I want them), gsync/freesync, Thunderbolt 3 connectionS.<br/>This Samsung does not have everything indeed, but the TWO TB3 connections (1 85w 1 15w), KVM functionality, and decent 100hz refresh rate sold me on the screen.  I use KVM lightly because this isn't a true KVM, BUT if you are using two machines with TB3 it works fine and you can simply select which machine will have control in the OSD...super easy and a great feature for me as I have the screen connected to my 2018 mac and 2019 Razer Blade 15 and I can switch which gets the KB/Mouse functionality, have the screen split or PIP.<br/><br/>Sound Quality-<br/>Not too much to say here. It gets loud enough to fill a small room, no real base or clean treble but its not the worst things I've ever heard and it's significantly better than 99.99999% of laptop speakers out there. Its acceptable for what it is no more no less.<br/><br/>Gaming -<br/>So being 100hz and coming from my 2019 15" Razer blade's 144hz screen I thought the step down would be very noticeable.  I can definitely tell it's not quite as smooth, but it's still a very smooth gameplay experience.  There is no Free/GSync so that can be a concern, but as a casual gamer while I noticed a difference it wasn't significant and I am happy to sacrifice that by upping the resolution and having a wider FOV (in most games).<br/>Besides the refresh rate, input lag was pretty good and shouldn't affect anyone outside of top pro gamer types.<br/>This kind of brings me to the next topic which isn't so much about the quality of the monitor but an idea of what you might need to run it.....<br/><br/>Horsepower-<br/>So gaming 'rig' wise my Razer Blade 15" has a 2060RTX, i7 8750h hexacore, 16GB DDR4 and a 512GB Samsung NVME.<br/>Two games I've been playing lately are Path of Exiles and Apex Legends here's a very brief breakdown of the frames:<br/>Apex Legends @ 1080p w/RTX 2060----------@3440x1440p<br/>------------------avg ~105-------------------------avg ~80<br/><br/>In apex settings are mostly maxed (no AA), still very playable at this resolution with a 2060 RTX and doesn't dip below 70fps (on mobile 2060 even mind you!)<br/><br/>Path of Exiles @ 1080p w/RTX 2060 -------------------- @ 3440x1440p<br/>------------------avg ~120fps --------------------------------avg ~90fps -------<br/> windows<br/>Not sure why but PoE took a much bigger frame hit going to the higher resolution but still averaged 90fps at native resolution with maxed settings.<br/><br/>So as far as horsepower and today's current games I would say a 1070/2060 would probably be the minimum you would want to have if you plan on gaming at the native res and getting framerates in the 60-100 range on MOST current AAA games.<br/><br/>So other than the design of the VESA mounting bracket I really enjoy this monitor.  It's bright, vibrant and contrasty and plays games smoothly with little to no motion blur.  The speakers are decent and with 2 TB3 ports KVM functionality its a great value @ $800 and below!</span>

<span>I will try my best to make it as short and concise as possible. Note that I use this screen with two main laptop devices: ASUS zen book, and MacBook Pro M1 14". From prospective of a university student:<br/>--Pros--<br/><br/>* Size! I can't emphasize this enough but this size is just perfect. It allows me to open several apps/programs at the same time. Mainly useful when reading papers or when coding (as will as following tutorials).<br/>* Versatility is pretty good. It is a little shy from perfect. That is because the lack of rotating sideways (around the vertical pivot). You would have to rotate the whole base to do that.<br/>* Picture quality is amazing. Can't be as good as the MacBook Pro screen but it differently doesn't look bad either. When using it with my other laptop (Asus), it shows its true perks.<br/>* USB connectivity is very useful. I won't go into more details about this but I highly recommend searching on the web why this is useful.<br/><br/>--Cons--<br/>* sturdiness is a bit of a problem. If you set the screen at the highest extension, it wiggles pretty easily. You would have to have a super sturdy desk to limit this wiggling but that would still not help that much.<br/>* lack of speakers. Paying this much for a screen would be great to have a built in speakers. Unfortunately, depending on your desk setup, you might want to get external speakers. I am at the point of seriously getting one after few months of use.<br/>* Not enough USB ports<br/><br/>----EXTRA Advice----<br/>You might see reviews of other users online complaining about USB-C connectivity that it stopped working after a while. From my experience, this has happened to me two times where I could connect to the screen but my MacBook Pro was not charging. I found out it got back to normal once I updated the system. My take is you need to keep your system up to date all the time to ensure functionality.<br/>That is said, I am still having a problem of display settings getting back to default once my laptop gets into the sleep mode. It doesn't happen all the time but it happens often and it is not a pleasant experience. I will update my review if I find a solution to this issue.</span>

<span>Using this monitor with my Macbook Pro. At first I tried to connect it via my own Hdmi cable and all I got was flickering, white dots and the screen going on and off sporadically. Then I connected it with the USB-C cable it came with and it worked perfectly fine. It will not work by connecting the cables to my dock station. I tried a different Hdmi cable and that also gave me the same issue. So after talking to Amazon customer service (which was no help) and then getting transferred to a LG tech rep, I played around with the resolution of the LG monitor and it seems to be working fine once changed to 2560 x 1080. When I used the Hdmi cable that it came with, it automatically set it to this resolution setting. I then switched it to what's recommended which is 3440 x 1440 and so far it seems to be working fine.<br/><br/>So, my verdict, just make sure to use the cables it comes with and don't bother plugging them into a docking station.</span>

<span>I'll qualify that I knew of the shortcomings before buying, so overall I still think this is an excellent product and worth the money (@$550) depending on your needs.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Great panel<br/>- Fantastic for work<br/>- Maybe I'm weird here, but... Thank you for leaving speakers out. Who is spending &gt;$500 on a monitor and can't afford a cheap pair of speakers<br/>- Solid stand<br/>- Functional curve<br/>- Plenty of I/O<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Stand isn't the best LG has<br/>- USB ports, with USB-C used for display, are limited to USB2.0 speeds<br/>- Some may not like 60Hz if they're looking to game a lot.<br/><br/>Usability:<br/>I'm using this monitor for work alongside an M1 macbook pro. I was becoming frustrated with using a displaylink dock, knowing that it wasn't natively driving 2 displays. For most, that solution probably works fine, but I couldn't get it out of my head that I was using CPU cycles to run additional monitors non-natively.<br/><br/>So, I decided to swap 2 2560x1080 ultra-wides for this. Yes, I lost some vertical screen real estate, but having the extra vertical real estate for a single window actually opens up the workflow better in my opinion.<br/><br/>So, all in all, the real estate on this monitor is perfect for my workflow (Software Support).<br/><br/>Screen:<br/>The curve is perfect. Not too "immersive," but I don't need to physically move my head to see the extremes. I first tested out a flat screen 3440x1440 and this was the case.<br/><br/>IPS glow is present (as with any IPS panel I've experienced), but not distracting.<br/><br/>Lighting is uniform except for the very edges of the screen. In particular, on the bottom edge, there are just a couple millimeters of slightly darker areas. I'm just nitpicking here. Still very pleased with the backlighting compared to my old IPS.<br/><br/>Pixel density is perfect. No scaling required, but text is crisp. It all looks as I would expect.<br/><br/>I'm not a photo. editor, so I can't speak to color accuracy. I will say that along side my m1 mbp panel, the colors seems just as good. Contrast is not as high, but not far off for what I'm doing.<br/><br/>I've dabbled in games and have always been fine with 60Hz. It's plenty smooth for my needs. Gamers these days are probably going to want more though. I just didn't think it was worth it for the extra money to maintain an IPS panel. I wasn't willing to cheap out on a VA panel due to black smearing. For me, this panel is still perfect.<br/><br/>Stand:<br/>I appreciate that most new monitors seem to have height adjustment now, and this one has it. That being said, I was disappointed with the stand compared to LGs TAA compliant panels which seem to be more targeted at business. They're no frills solid, heavy stands with all the adjustment you want. Those stands provide height, swivel, and tilt adjustment. This does support their One-click setup, so I suppose I could try to find one of those stands. This panel does not have swivel, but that's ok for a curved monitor. My issue is not with the lack of adjustment, but the quality of the mechanics. The spine of the stand, in pictures, seems to indicate its a brushed metal. It's not. It is plastic. The stand is still sturdy, once set, but it still just feels like it has cut corners compared to the others. That being said, had I not experienced the other LG stand, I would probably be calling this a good one. If you're upgrading from an older monitor, you'll probably love it.<br/><br/>I/O:<br/>On paper, it has all the I/O you need for a single cable solution. USB-C Charging and display, 2 usb connections, great! This may be true, depending on your peripherals. Something a bit disappointing, though apparent when searching the documentation, is that if you're using USB-C for your display, the USB A ports on the back will only function as USB 2.0. For what many will use this for, a mouse and keyboard, you will have no issue. However, I wanted to use a USB3.0 dongle for further expansion, and a gigabit ethernet adapter. When utilizing this particular dongle at USB2.0, I cannot get higher than 300Mb/s . So you may be asking, why are you interested in the USB ports if you already have a dongle. The short answer is that the dongle is USB-A, and the macbook only has USB-C. As a result, I've switched to using one of the Apple USB-C to USBC/USBA/HDMI dongles. Problem solved. I'm just running the display through HDMI</span>

<span>Eleven days of owning and no issues, but after reading the reviews and seeing all of this crap said about DisplayPort ports dying, non-mountable, not powering on, Sceptre isn't a brand name.<br/>I'm left to ask a serious question. Are any of you taking into mind what comes with the monitor, taking advantage of it, and using the right equipment.<br/><br/>I'm gonna cover a lot of this in this review.<br/><br/>'Sceptre is not a brand name'<br/>___________________________<br/>What? Sceptre is a relatively big brand and a decent one at that. Though they've always been on the budget friendlier side of the equation, and there's tons of research you can do on it to reinforce my claims.<br/><br/>'DisplayPort dying within a month'<br/>________________________________<br/>If this ever happens, there are several things that need to be considered.<br/>1. Was this during a graphics driver update? If so, unplug the DisplayPort cable, connect an HDMI, DDU your drivers, and install again with the cable in fresh.<br/><br/>2. What kind of DisplayPort cable are you using? I don't care if the monitor came with one. I don't care if you have a DisplayPort cable laying around.<br/>Purchase a VESA Certified cable and ONLY use VESA Certified cables like this one - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CD1FB3A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1<br/>Cables can kill a DisplayPort rendering it entirely useless. Stop being cheap and making up excuses for your monitors port dying out.<br/><br/>'How do I mount the monitor?'<br/>____________________________<br/>There's a VESA Certified mounting plate that comes with this monitor. You need to already have a mount setup and ready to use, and be ready to make sure the mount supports the monitors weight.<br/>After that, attach the mounting plate to the monitor, and then screw it in with the screw provided for the stand. After that, you want to mount this to your VESA mount, yes it will flex the plate, but at least it's keeping the monitor stable. Continue to mount until tightened.<br/>All mounts should be compatible.<br/><br/>Please stop coming to Amazon ready to complain about something you may have caused on your own.<br/>Sceptre doesn't deserve to be strung out all over the place because of human error.<br/>If you encounter any sort of issue on opening, you need to be in their Amazon messages issuing a return or RMA, not writing asinine reviews and giving the company a bad rep.<br/><br/>Onto my opinions!<br/>This is a budget monitor, it has BUDGET MONITOR ISSUES.<br/>The monitor looks great, sure. Though I will say, this monitor doesn't exactly achieve the whole ultrawide appeal to the fullest extreme. Yes, it's great. Though I feel wider would've been a little more genuine to the ultrawide claim.<br/>So far, I love it. Though I have noticed, if you don't mess with the settings properly, there is ghosting, dull looking image, and so on.<br/><br/>NVIDIA users should completely avoid this monitor.<br/>There's been countless reports of this monitor flat out not achieving 144Hz+ 100FPS+ goals on this panel. A lot of it seems to lean to this monitor being tied to FreeSync and not cross compatible.<br/>I use an RX 5600 XT and have hardly any issue.<br/>All of these things need to be taken completely into account before you buy this.<br/><br/>I can recommend this monitor to responsible people who are actually going to verify issues, and obtain the proper equipment before purchasing, as you should.<br/>I like it, I will likely be upgrading though. This is likely going to be a media monitor for me in the near future, just because I think I'd like stacked ultrawide panels and a different panel.<br/><br/>Gaming works fine on here, though there's a reported issue of ghosting at 200Hz. I can't test this myself, though I'm sure it's something that can be fixed.<br/><br/>Hopefully everything I covered was at least of some use to people, thank you for reading.</span>

<span>It's a great looking screen with a good feature set and good specs for the price.<br/><br/>I really like the buttons and menus as they make it super easy to change settings, unlike many monitors these days.<br/><br/>There are really only two things that prevented me from giving 5 stars:<br/><br/>First, PBP/PIP feature only works with certain combinations of connections. Unfortunately, it does not work with HDMI on one device and USB-C on the other. So for my use case with a Mac Mini (HDMI) and Macbook Pro (USB-C), I'm not able to do PBP/PIP.<br/>I ordered a USB-C to DisplayPort for the Mac Mini to see if this fixes the issue as USB-C/DP is one of the combinations that the manual says works.<br/><br/>Second, the "cable management" is subpar. As you can see from the pictures on the item listing, it's just a couple of tabs on the back of the monitor stand. The cables do not go through/hide in the monitor stand as they do with many other monitors on the market. The power cable specifically shows without using something else to hold it up (see photo)<br/><br/>The PBP/PIP issue may be a deal breaker for me as I specifically bought this monitor over others for this function, but I can live with the cable management.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>The USB-C to DisplayPort and USB-C combination worked for PIP/PBP. Using this monitor in combination with Logitech mouse/keyboard with flow technology allows me to very easily work with both computers side by side &amp; switch peripherals easily.</span>

<span> Screen is good I like it a lot. I’m not designing or editing graphics or video, It’s not pro image quality, but the size eases long days at my desk no end. For me it’s an investment in my future sight!<br/>The usb hub works!!! (Mostly). Usb-c to my laptop and my phone shows up as does the usb camera. Occasionally they don’t connect. Power off and on the screen usually fixes this. One thing that is unacceptable is the audio, through the hub anything connected to the mini jack has a very loud hum it’s unusable! After reading the reviews I didn’t expect to use the hub anyway(other than charging) so I’m still happy! Everyone who sees my desk complements it! One note: 34” seems the sweet spot to not have to turn your head from one far side of the screen to another. The curve really helps to bring in what you’re looking at, I don’t think 34 flat would be a nice to view. I really hope this thing lasts!</span>

<span>This model is updated, in fact, the pictures don’t match what was shipped for one small but critical detail. The USB-C port is much more capable in the newer version.<br/><br/>For starters, the USB-B hub is gone. The hub is now integrated with the USB-C port, making this connection option an excellent port expander for Macs. The USB-C also carries audio signal through it.<br/><br/>The DisplayPort and HDMI also carry audio. This means switching between two computers, like Windows and Mac, is very easy, with one set of speakers connected to the audio port.<br/><br/>Only issue I faced was low refresh rates in MacOS via USB-C. Idk exactly how I fixed it. The monitor documentation says that 3440x1440@100Hz is only supported on DP and HDMI. That much is true. But USB-C seemed pegged at 30Hz and no way to correct it in Settings. Eventually I connected the Mac via a USB-C to DP dongle and that opened up the refresh rate option in Settings, then reconnecting back via USB-C allowed me to finally select 75Hz because it appears the Mac finally figured out that it was DP over USB-C capable.<br/><br/>This was in Monterey. Have not tested with Ventura yet.</span>

<span>I enjoy using the wide screen so I can keep multiple programs open while I'm working.  I'm constantly cross referencing multiple website and programs for work.  So being able to keep 3 or more windows open and have eachone open at a size I can read makes this worth buying.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor as an upgrade from my previous 28" 4k monitor with the intention of having enough space to view 2-column diffs on two separate windows while doing software development.  The 34" monitor definitely made that easy, but I found that it was actually a little too wide, not tall enough, and left the font too pixellated to clearly differentiate the characters.  I eventually returned this monitor and got a Dell 32" 4k monitor, which actually has more usable screen space and allows for a 1.25x zoom for higher resolution fonts.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/> 1) Really nice gaming experience with ultra-fast refresh rate.  You don't realize how much the high refresh rate helps until you start moving around in a first-person perspective game.  It also made scrolling in a web browser super smooth.<br/> 2) Good picture quality (not amazing, but good enough)<br/> 3) Easy to view multiple windows with software side-by-side<br/><br/>Cons:<br/> 1) Lack of built-in USB hub meant that I had to purchase another external USB hub (although the price savings on this monitor more than offset the extra cost of the hub)<br/> 2) 34" at 3440x1440 means that the most comfortable zoom is 1.0x.  While this is nice if you're working with legacy applications that don't support HiDPI, it also means that the fonts look really grainy by today's standards.  For software development, I discovered that I could no longer distinguish certain characters when underlined with red squigly lines.  I considered this to be too much of a step backwards, which is why I eventually went with a 32" 4k monitor with a high enough DPI to support a 1.25x zoom.<br/> 3) The stand wasn't very good, and I was no longer able to place it on the platform that I had used for my old monitor (due to its width).  This is a relatively minor issue, but speaks to the general issue with monitors this wide needing extra space.<br/> 4) I'm also of the opinion that 34" is just too wide in general for a software developer.  It's awkward to get behind the monitor, and the width causes more neck strain from looking farther left and right.  The aspect ratio is also non-standard, and makes it harder to work with maximized windows and for viewing videos that are almost all 16:9.<br/><br/>So if you're a gamer looking for a good deal, I would recommend this monitor, but for software developers I would really recommend a good 32" 4k instead.</span>

<span>I did have to get a replacement because the first one was damaged, but I think that’s understandable when you have something like a screen shipped. I did a lot of shopping, and decided to pull the trigger on this mostly because of the refresh rate and price point. I play games like forza and cyberpunk and write music the screen display is beautiful using a older 20 series gtx graphics card. Really no complaints very easy to set up and again very good price for the size and specs</span>
