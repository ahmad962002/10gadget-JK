<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Our Grand Design XPLOR 200MK came pre-wired for this camera with a preinstalled mount.  The camera and monitor were synched when we received them and installation was quick and easy.  Our trailer is 25' and the distance to the monitor is no more than 40'; however, there is little to no signal.  I've submitted a help request to Furioin customer service, so maybe I'm missing something, but this is pretty straightforward;  the camera-monitor combination should function over a much greater range.  I may update this review if Furion is able to offer a fix.<br/>UPDATE: Furion customer support was very responsive.  After several emails back and forth, the Furion representative determined our Monitor was at fault and Furion shipped out a new one.  We received the new monitor in just two days.  After pairing our camera to the new monitor we had a signal!  Hooked up and went for a test drive.  So much better being able to see what's behind you!  But, wait.  The Grand Design pre-installed camera mount is significantly below the roof line on the back wall.  This places the camera antenna entirely behind the trailer.  At best our signal strength over just 40 feet is one bar.  The video runs smoothly most of the time, but occasionally it freezes and is "jerky" at times.  I asked Furion about an extended antenna, but they do not make or sell them.  The representative did tell me that they were available after market...such as through Amazon.  Will be looking for that next!</span>

<span>Easy install as camper came prepped from the factory. Took less than 15 minutes to complete. There is some minimal lag in video transmission when going 70 mph down the interstate, but nothing bad. I love being able to see behind me when backing up. A plus is being able to hear the mrs. as she gives me directions also. I would definitely purchase again.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace the one that was installed on my R V after the picture got to fuzzy to make anything out on the screen. Turns out the camera lens was bad on the old one. The outside surface of the lens somehow lost it shine, and clarity. I only bought this to replace the old camera. if the new camera goes the same as the old one, I will defanatly be replacing the whole system next time. There are much cheaper alternatives out there, some with better picture quality. Why spend alot of money for something thats only going to last a few years.</span>

<span>First let me start off by echoing every other review on the non-existent wiring instructions. There's a wiring diagram included that provides zero details.  Worst instructions I have ever seen.  I installed this system on my Dodge Ram 2014 2500 4wd and was wanting it to activate when I placed the transmission in reverse. No big deal because that's what the camera system is intended for.  I connected the camera power wires (red and black) to the reverse light wires according to instructions, connected the monitor power wires to the provided cigarette plug. Fired up the truck, and placed it in reverse.  This is when all the fun started. The monitor picture was completely distorted, no picture at all. So, I went back and took the camera power ground wire and ran it to a frame ground. Same problem, complete interference, no picture.  I tried every possible combination with the wires to get the picture to show. Green wire, orange wires in the wiring harness may serve a purpose in particular installations, we may never know because the crappy instructions are well crap.  I boxed everything up and contacted amazon for a refund because the monitor would not work.  Then later that night my smart and lovely wife suggested I lay the system out in the living room floor and use an extra lawn mower battery I had to see if I could get it to work.  Like a good husband I listened and obeyed. Except this time I ignored the extra orange and green wires and just hooked it up straight. Black is ground, red is positive,  It worked perfectly.  I had to admit to her that she was right again.<br/><br/>The next morning I installed it on my truck just like I did in the living room the night before. I had to provide an additional power wire long enough for the camera to reach the cab but yes, it worked great. My advice on the install.  Forget about the reverse lights if installing on a Dodge Ram 2014.  Way too much electrical interference from some where.  Older vehicles may be fine, but not the newer ones. Forget about the extra orange and green wires, tape then back or cut them off.  I used zip ties to keep the AV cable and power wires nice and tidy under the truck, use shrink wrap on your connections, this is insurance for the future.  I'm going to keep the system since it's working now.  I'll have to plug the cigarette plug in when I need it, but that's no big deal to me.  The good thing about wiring it up straight, instead of using the reverse lights is I can use it anytime I want to.  The truck does not have to be in reverse to activate.  Now I can see whos tail gating me I guess. If you have trouble on the install, just ask your wife.</span>

<span>This is a great product for the money! The only reason I am giving it four stars is the fact that the instructions are awful, that's saying it kindly. It only comes with a note card with an incomplete wiring diagram to show you how to install. I will give a couple hints here to help anyone that had the some issues I did.<br/><br/>On your main video cable that runs from the camera to the display there is going to be a little red wire on each end. What does this do and how do you install it? The instructions will not tell you. These two wires are what tells the display to turn on and off when the vehicle is in reverse. If you don't hook this up then the camera sucks and you have to manually turn it off all the time. Here's what you do... The end that is going to the camera, take that red wire and connect it to the red wire that is going to your brake light. This tells the monitor that power is going to the camera.<br/>On the monitor end you will have a little green wire attached to the harness that you will have no idea what it is for. This green wire hooks to the red wire on the other end of your video cable. This completes the relay between the two machines. After these are properly hooked up the camera and monitor it will turn on when you go into reverse and off when you go into drive or park.<br/><br/>If you plan on using the adhesive mount that came with the unit dont even try using the adhesive sticker. Go the the auto store and buy some good 3M double sided adhesive for mounting.<br/><br/>Tools you will need:<br/>Small screwdriver<br/>Large screwdriver<br/>Electrical tape<br/>Heat shrink tubing<br/>Wire connectors<br/>Wire stripper<br/>Plastic conduit to run the video cable through where it may rub<br/>Zip ties</span>

<span>I bought this camera and mounted it on our tractor. We use it to watch the hay enter the baler,while driving forward. The ones specifically designed for tractors, from the dealer, were several hundred dollars. We thought, even if it lasts one season, it will be worth it. My husband had neck surgery so he can't turn his head to watch behind him all day. The screen is large, &amp; clear. The guidelines never go away, but they are helpful in getting hay in the right spot! There isn't a tougher environment than a Texas hay field in the summer, so hoping this camera will take a beating &amp; keep on going.</span>

<span>Towing a Jeep at the end of our 31' Class C the Furrion system is a great confidence builder and stress reducer.<br/><br/>In the rain, at night, with headlights behind you it looks like a million "shooting stars" are pelting the earth ;-}  It became pretty distracting but still is helpful  when in rural areas for lane changes.<br/><br/>Still worth the price of admission and am much happier with it than without it!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>On our first big trip the monitor entirely stopped functioning after going through a bumpy stretch of freeway in the Salt Lake City area. I purchased in November so technically should be able to get replacement through warranty. I'll update as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>CLOSURE:<br/>The Furrion technician I spoke with directed me to check the fuse that is in the plug that goes into the cigarette lighter. That was not the problem so he guessed it was the power cord itself, as he said " . . . since we've been having problems with them."<br/><br/>I received a new cord under warranty. It is really unfortunate they cheaped-out on such an expensive system with a tiny gauge power cord. One would think they'd upgrade since they know it is a problem so I guess must say, "Buyer Beware" until they do. Too bad!</span>

<span>After a little over a year my back up camera showed only a solid blue screen when I put my truck in reverse. After trying to figure out what was wrong myself with zero results It finally dawned on me to call their customer service dept. I spoke with Naomi Heinitz and explained that I knew my camera was out of warranty but wanted to know if she could give me advise on fixing it myself. She immediately identified the problem and although it was out of warranty she was replacing it at no charge. I received the completely new camera. FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!</span>

<span>I chose this backup camera because it was a wired system and because it not only includes a camera, but also sensors so it beeps as you get close to backing into something.  That part can get annoying if you're backing a trailer, but there is a mute button.  I have a 2010 F-150 SuperCrew, short bed and there was plenty of cable to mount the screen at the top of the windshield just to the left of the rear view mirror.  Probably a couple of feet to spare.  If you have a long bed or maybe an F-250 if you might need an extension or might need to mount it on the dash.  The screen is pretty good.  I've never had any other aftermarket backup camera so I can't compare it to any of those.  It's not as nice as the factory screen on my 2017 Fusion (with the larger touch screen), but that's to be expected.  One warning, there's no option to invert the image so if you mount the screen upside down like I did initially by accident you'll have to physically reverse it.  When I did that I found that I had mounted the base too high so I could not get the angle correct.  I e-mailed Hopkins and they mailed me a new adhesive pad right away, no charge.  Was easy to pop the base off, clean the windshield, and remount correctly.  I would probably give it five stars if the screen was just a little bit larger and the image quality and colors were a little more vibrant.  It's a good screen, but I think it could be just a little bit better.  Does the job though and I'm happy with it.  Installation was fairly easy as my truck had a trailer wiring harness already.  Hardest part was crawling under the truck with zip-ties and routing the cable.  Would definitely be easier with a lift.<br/><br/>Update: Six months later and it's summer in Georgia.  The sticky pad that holds the camera to the windshield can't take the summer heat.  Kept falling off.  I've removed it and re-attached using a rear view mirror repair kit.  I've used those before to remount a mirror on an old car and mirrors are heavier than this screen, so should work fine.  We'll see.  No change to rating.  Relatively minor issue.</span>
