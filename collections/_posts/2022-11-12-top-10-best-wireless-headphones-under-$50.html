<span>Sound quality is good although it could be more bass in my opinion. The earbud tips does not fit in my ears even the small. So I bought an xs earbud tip and now it my case doesn’t close all the way. Overall product is good maybe just not for little ears people</span>

<span>I love these! The color is cute, and for the price, the sound quality is pretty good! They have good battery life (mine went about 6 hours of nonstop use before I got a low battery warning) and seem to have a really good distance range too - I live in a 3 story house and I can easily go to the top floor with my phone on the bottom with no interruption.<br/><br/>The only reason I knock a star off is that the fit is not quite just right - they’re a little too big to get a completely perfect fit, and if I move around a lot I need to adjust them a decent amount to make sure they’re secure (I’ve never really felt like they’d actually fall out though).<br/><br/>If you want a good solid pair of budget ear buds, get these! We have a JBL wireless speaker and love it so this seemed like the obvious choice, and we weren’t disappointed.</span>

<span>I think they are great headphones. I’ve gotten a pair for me and my wife. Unfortunately the only complaint I have is that I got sent the wrong color. But would definitely recommend these headphones. They are comfortable, cheap, and the sound quality is pretty great. I use them to watch videos on my phone and for hands free calling since my audio went out on my phone I use these everyday all day and they hold a charge for the full day so that’s a plus.</span>

<span>I have purchased several other wireless earbuds in this price range; some have slightly better sound, some are better build quality, but it's nice to have something from a brand that gets it done where it matters. The instructions can be comprehended, the sound is quite good for the price, and they CONNECT reliably in mono or stereo. A strike against them is the case - very poor design. The bottom is not flat, so the case doesn't stand vertically. It's extremely difficult to remove the earbuds because there is no room for fingers and the plastic is very "slippery." Ultimately, I would recommend these because they work. Some others I have purchased are designed better, but they don't work reliably and form really should follow function.</span>

<span>My Fav Xtra Bass Loud Headphones 🌷<br/><br/>- Awesome Sound 🌷 Great HD Loud Sound with Heavy Bass. 12mm. Even when I am operating heavy loud machinery, I can still hear my music very loud and clear. Even when making calls, I can hear clearly and the caller hears me clearly. I love that even though they can be used for phone conversations, they're still really loud for listening to music. Excellent Quality.<br/><br/>- Comfortable 🌷 I wear them all the time and I do not ever feel any aches in my ears.<br/><br/>- Noise Cancelling 🌷I use the large earbud pieces and I literally can't hear anything. Even when I am not listening to music, I still use them as ear plugs because they are amazing.<br/><br/>- Earbud Pieces Stay In Place 🌷 I love that the earbud pieces grip on the headphones really well so they will not fall off easily and have to be replaced.<br/><br/>-Cord 🌷 I actually prefer to have the cord that attachs the two bluetooth earbuds because if I did not, I would probably lose them quickly...lol When I go to put them away, it's easy and I do not have to look for different pieces. Or if I am doing a physical task, I do not have to worry about one of them falling out of my ear and I cannot find it like an earring...lol<br/><br/>-Easy To Use 🌷 It is really easy to pair them with any device. You just press the power button for 7 seconds and then, it will appear on your bluetooth device section. Very quick and easy process.<br/><br/>- Fast Charging/ Long Lasting Battery Life 🌷 It literally only takes 10 minutes to charge and they will last all day. This is one of my Fav features in addition to the great loud sound.<br/><br/>- 3in USB Type C Cord Included 🌷 They give you a usb cord for charging. You just have to have your own adapter for the usb to plug into. Fast charging cord, I can charge my phone fast with the cord too...lol</span>

<span>Sound good and do the job for playing music and making calls wo the phone in hand all the time.  Purchased to try help focus while working from home and not be distracted as easily along with being a big time Sony product owner (think back to the walkman no not the CD one but the cassest sports one) for both home audio and video among other things as they still work and provided great picture quality for the CRT's way back then.  Wasn't expecting much as they are sort of wireless and for the price under $30 at the time, but was pleasantly surprised and knew I lose headsets rather often so getting the Plantronics's for my desk could wait to see if I even ended up using these.  The only thing to be aware of (they don't make the claim and for the price and Brand loyalty I went w/o the ANC and charging case that the ear buds usually come with).  Do they block out sounds like people above me and other distractions?  Are they still working and am I using them still?  Do I wish I would have gotten the higher model, not so much since I've used a smartish phone since windows mobile (pocket PC 2003 when Motorola dropped one around 2006 along with their bluetooth headphones which were around 200 bucks then and mini USB was the standard and only came in black/red while it didn't go with my suit, I could go to the gym and use the mini SD card and play the bland mp3's while still doing rip and replace for 2nd largest Cisco contract leading teams and taking calls in MDF's to swap fiber links (old motorola not the China lenovo owned company) and was the only headset left standing of the 13 lost or wires ruined and actually one other of theirs that the clip for the ear piece broke, but couldn't find a replace for that size at the time and forgot about it till now.  These will do the job and with the around the neck cords I they make it easier to find when I forget I set them down somewhere vs. looking for just an ear bud which with physics I'm not sure that a driver that small can produce the sound they want for the amount I use these or my smart phone today anyway.<br/><br/>I gave them a 4 since 4.5 isn't an option and I'm use to audiophile purchases and hearing the color of sound, but realize how the supply chain works today and manufacturing that for the purpose they would do the trick and if I feel I need headphone's to play records or a physical media medium vs. UDP (best effort) streaming where packets are going missing with wireless to bluetooth and all the network hops before it, well then I'll just hook the turn tables up and order whatever vinyl or get a dedicated device for it, but chances are I'll stick to the home theater setup and speakers I had to drive to pick up where voice coils and speakers were still handmade for under 50k each.  Since I don't know if the ANC really works better as I haven't found a reason to upgrade and compare and the only issue I have with these is that on calls I sometime forget that the wire has the mic on it and or service might be a bit light down here that I'll have to turn them off and then your normal bluetooth pairing to the proper device and crowded unlicensed spectrum interference that I can't really blame Sony for what I've consulted clients on for a decade+ about with wireless speakers and other products when they say they want a setup that sounds better then mine until they'd have to actually spend the $ and not know what for as they don't appreciate the audio as I once did, but rarely find the time or content these days to be concerned with it along with the fact that networks drop packets and streaming via UDP not TCP is designed to handle dropped packets mixed with the fact that I realized the picture looks fake to me on certain displays at times, but that is because it is, since most is designed with digital tools and is just me being the old fart that one would argue on message boards that digital w/o the static in a lossless format is the best medium where the old timers would say vinyl and not let it go, but until I understood what the color of sound really was when listening to vinyl I had to search the globe for much of it and risk buying a used piece to get the 90's grunge or numetal I think it is referred to as today in a world of mostly rap and poorly mastered dubstep at one point where a mixtape CD ruined the competition car audio as the track was so distorted that lovely smell came, but the kill switch saved 1 sub which only from SPL and the smell that comes with fried electronics did I know to kill it, but had to be sure later and it was and fried the rest =/  Battery life on these seems more then suitable for the day, keep your ears clean and remember that others are around you and moving objects for some of you and these do the job just fine, sleeping in them might not always be the most comfortable, but I usually wake up drool down my face and someone yelling as I have my face smashed in the pillow when I sleep well, even though I'm not sure how I breath and sleep that way, plus w/o the cord I'm not sure I'd be able to those small ear buds out if I used it and had to grab it with scratching it with something if pushed to far in, for those of you heavy sleepers once you are asleep.  If they break I'll update this otherwise 4.5 and maybe wait for a CC promo or other discount as I see a lot close to the price point now that might be white label and have newer features or even the buds for about 20 more at time from the big tech names and most are fan boys anyway so you might just want those otherwise.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace my SBH70 that I loved for years but needed something with plugs to stop outside noise. The sound is great and battery lasts me at least ten hours a charge. The length of the wires is perfect for the earbuds to sit inside of a chest pocket when bot in use. Buttons are fairly easy to use while wearing gloves. I work in an oily environment and have had no problems with the material deteriorating.<br/>Only things I don’t like are the magnets on the end which attract metal shavings and it doesn’t vibrate when you get a call or notification like the SBH70 does.<br/>I would highly recommend them, especially for the price. I bought some other Sony ones a few years ago that were more expensive but weren’t nearly as good as these.</span>

<span>I like that these ear buds are wireless but they are connected. I wear them around my neck, with the little magnets keeping them together. Sound quality seems great to me, my bf loves them and he's a audiophile who always gets the best (expensive) speakers. People prefer that I use the earbuds when talking to me on my cell so I assume vocally they sound pretty good.</span>

<span>The first thing I noticed unboxing these as that they feel cheap, because they are. The plastic they're made of is light and almost seems brittle. The ear pads aren't terribly soft like some other brands. There is no padding on the top, and since I shave my head, that's really annoying having the bare plastic scrape against my scalp. I really wish they would have spend an extra $1.15 and put padding up there. The noise cancellation isn't even noticeable compared to other brands I own. If I sit next to a fan (which should be easily canceled out), I honestly can't hear a difference between the headphones being on and the headphones being off. Compare that to another brand and the sound of the fan is completely canceled. While the description on Amazon claims "smart noise cancellation" those words appear nowhere on the box and I can't find any reference to noise cancellation in the (very tiny) instructions. Nor could I find that on Sony's web site description about these headphones. I'd have to say the Amazon description for them is wrong.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the sound is decent. It's not as great as my Bose, but then again these headphones cost a fraction of the price, so I'd say the sound they provide is a good deal. The bluetooth paired quickly and easily with my Android phone, and a double tap of the power button brought up the Google Assistant. I could pair the headphones with multiple devices, however in order to switch between them, I would have to turn the active device's bluetooth off, then move to the other device and force it to connect. Again, my Bose headphones allow me to flip between multiple devices with a button (although, again, the Bose are fare more expensive). I also paired them with my Windows laptop, but had issues with Zoom. The microphone appeared to work and others could hear me, but I couldn't get the headphones to work, despite playing with the settings.<br/><br/>Sony has an app for headphones in the Google Play store, however these headphones don't appear to work with it, which was disappointing. I was hoping to find additional settings in there and thinking maybe that it leveraged the app and the phones microphone to accomplish ANC through software, but that doesn't appear to be the case.<br/><br/>All in all these headphones are just OK. I'd give them a solid "C". You can't beat the price, however I think this is definitely a case where you get what you pay for. I think I'm going to return these and spend $30 more and get something better, especially since I can't get them to work with Zoom, which is a show-stopper for me.</span>

<span>Once I learned how to set up a Custom EQ (the Settings icon under the EQ) I've been very pleased. What I like is (my taste): boost the bass 2 dbs, attenuate the 400 Hz 2, boost the 1K 1 (this combo gives some punch to the bass), then I boost up the 2.5K 2, the 6.3K up 4, and the 16K up 6. Those last 2 for my old ears.<br/><br/>The noise reduction is excellent, the touch controls good.<br/><br/>I'm happy.</span>

<span>These are great for me. I have lots of ear problems so over and in ear headphones were problematic to say the least. The open ear concept is a godsend for me. I do wish there was a way to make bass more noticeable but that is just the nature of all current bone conduction headphones. The overall sound is good enough for background noise and podcasts. Movies are decent. The 90 degree angle ear hooks are uncomfortable at times but not a deal breaker. Overall fit is snug but not too tight. Its not going anywhere but also not squeezing and pinching your face. Battery life is decent I wear them for about 10 -12 hours a day at work and a charge at lunch keeps them topped off and going till i get off. These are OSHA approved earphones so it's nice to be able to have a loophole for the safety rules on earbuds in the workplace. Overall I recommend shokz as a brand but if you can make splurge for the openrun do it but if you can't then these still will be your new friend. I go everywhere with these and i am very happy with my purchase. Will be getting more when I can.</span>

<span>I purchased these because I was tired of the in-ear type that just do not stay put.  These are fantastic for any activity and are secure all the time.  The sound quality was not what they would be for any in-ear headphones, but so what?  The quality was definitely good enough and they fit the bill - not falling out - perfectly.  They are also very reasonably priced.</span>

<span>After buying a couple of "earbud" products that would regularly and irritatingly fall out of my ears, I happened on my new Shokz Bone Conduction headphones and eliminated that problem.  Note: hang them over your ears, not under if you would like them to work as intended.  (Yes, it's possible to do that if you have a low IQ like me).  They don't actually go inside your ear, rather along side and they work awesome!  I use them more to listen to podcasts vs music while I take my dog on three mile hikes, but when I do switch to music I am more than satisfied.  If you are an audio or stereophile you might notice a difference musically compared to high end buds, but if you are an average Joe and proud of it, you are going to like these just fine in the "tunes" department.  Of course, there is no outside noise reduction with these.  Come on, they sit outside your ear canal man, but that doesn't keep you from easily hearing whatever you are listening too.  It will however keep you from getting run over by a car or from hearing a wild animal or crazy person charging you from behind.  That seems like a win in the noise reduction debate.  Anyway, after wanting to stomp my earbuds into the ground with them falling out of my ears so often I find myself really jacked about this style head phone and you just might too.</span>

<span>I love this headset. As a cyclist, it's important to hear approaching vehicles and other external cues that help with safety. This headset has great sound quality, very good volume, and simple controls.<br/><br/>It pairs immediately when turned on, and has very handy volume controls and a button for going to next or previous track. I don't do phone calls while cycling so I'm not sure about those options. I like the fact that there are spoken responses to power on or off and when connected. I tried another headset that just beeped and I was never sure what the beeps meant.<br/><br/>The headset is comfortable to wear for quite long periods and the battery life is great.</span>

<span>They look great and feel comfortable. The sound is exactly what you expect from skull candy, however the one thing you should be aware of before buying, is the BT range isn’t that great. If you have your phone on you while listening, you’ll be fine. But if you go to set your phone on the charger and continue to do things around the house, you will be limited to about 30’ max. Other than that, they’re great. Highly recommend.</span>

<span>The sound quality is above average.  I don't think you'll find many headphones that sound better for under $20.  The bass is clear, could be louder.  The knock is slightly distorted and they're not very loud at full volume (but that's bad for your hearing anyway so they're doing you a favor).  They also swivel at the earpiece, connected by a piece of plastic about the diameter of a pubic hair.  I expect one of them to snap in half the first time I accidentally glare it it for too long.<br/><br/>I wasn't thinking about any of that when I put them on my head because these are the softest things to grace my ears since Christy Weiler motor-boated me in 10th grade gym class.  If you could buy pillows spun from virgin unicorn mane hair, I still think they'd come in a distant second place.  Normally I'm ready to tear any headphones off after 30 minutes or less because they make my ears sweaty or they find some tiny pressure point on each ear where they focus all the tension created by stretching across my oversized noggin.  Not these.  I kept wearing them after the music ended.  Skullcandy nailed it as far as comfort is concerned.</span>

<span>There is such a wide variety of wireless earbuds on the market that can cost as much as $200.  As such, these are on the low end of cost but very big on features.  This is replacing an old set and the technology has come a long way.  It was so easy to pair and use.  I really like the recharging case that automatically turns them on and off.  They have great sound quality and are very comfortable, too.</span>

<span>JBL has outdone themselves again with these earbuds. If I could give it 4.5, that is where it'd be.<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>Right away the packaging is really nice. You see the earbuds on the back of the case along with all the features. The charging case for the ear buds has a nice matte black sheen to it. It's very compact making it super portable and it feels really smooth to hold too. The earbuds also have a (satisfying) neat magnetic clip when putting it back in the case so that's a cool plus from me. The instruction manual is also really user-friendly and has nice visuals of what tapping or a press-hold does. You get 2 different size earbud covers that aren't already on the earbuds themselves so there's S, M, and L--a standard for most JBL products. The last thing in the packaging is the tiny bright orange USB-C cable.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>Like what it says on the front packaging: PURE BASS. That's what you get with these JBL earbuds. This is where they excel on, but not so much on the treble department. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but if it was a little higher without adjusting the EQ in-app, this would get that last star (with ANC). Having the right earbud suction thingies helps a lot so if you're not getting that right sound, try the different suction thingies they provide because these sound great.<br/><br/>Noise-cancelling:<br/>I'll talk about this really quick because this was apparently a feature that I had to rate on, but I give it 3 stars, but 3.5 sounds more like it. Having active noise cancelling would be a 5 star, but with the sound on half, you wash out most of what's going on around you with the sound quality.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Having physical buttons on these earbuds is the way to go compared to touch controls. You can do 1 earbud mode which reduces the amount of functions you have on the one working earbud, but hey, you can hear the rest of the world better. It works with all the assistants like Alexa, Carmen, Ollie, Google, and whoever else you use. With the physical buttons it's really easy to pause, play, skip, rewind, all of that good stuff.<br/><br/>Battery: I've used these for hours and hours and with the combination of having it charged in its case, I've never had the "battery low" warning. It has around 8 hours of playtime and with the case, it charges back to full in 2 hours. The case itself has supposedly 24 hours of charge on it, but I've never had to get to that amount of use.<br/><br/>I got these mainly for running since the bulky over-the-ear headphones got in the way of my hair blah blah so these minimal earbuds were a good replacement. The suction thingies were very useful and is probably why it stayed inside my ear the entire time. The fast pair function is really nice and right out of the box connected to my phone and laptop really quick.<br/><br/>Would I recommend these earbuds to others? Totally. For around $70, these earbuds are one of the best, long-lasting earbuds in this price range. It doesn't cure cancer, but it uplifts you with the sweet power of music.</span>

<span>I have had these for about 6 mnths now and i love, love, love..d them!! They last FOREVER charged and fit really snug! I love that you can be phone calls with either or both not just the right. About a month or so ago my right 1 is having ussues charging. I cant just put them in the charger and walk away now, i have to position it in a certain spot and make sure it doesnt slip from that spot. Ive noticed the left is starting to do this as well which prompted me to write the review. It sux if they will stop charging soon, i use them while working! I have cheaper 1s that i have washed and dryed in the washer machine and they have been tosseled, dropped and god knows what else and they still kicking!! Kinda sucky but i REALLY DO LOVE these! They definitely sound better and last longer than my cheap 1s, as long as i get a full charge in them lol that is the biggest complaint. 1 other small, tiny complaint is you cant answer your phone with them, you have to physically answer on your phone, but thats not a BIG deal lol i do recommend these but mabe baby the charging dock?!!!</span>

<span>As a big audio fan.. the buds are good, they seem to catch all sounds from the music with out canceling out any frequency of sounds. As for the bass, it has a good bass nothing that's going to be like wow but it has good bass. Down side the fit is a bit bulky and you really need to get them in ur ear for the bass to react right. But I am happy with the purchase and would recommend</span>

<span>These are bone conduction headphones with remarkable sound quality (at least for me).  They work with hearing aids on (my wife loves them) - had to get a second pair so we'd each have our own.  I like having the situational awareness of being able to hear the enviornment around me.  When I need to shut it out (like a load machine) foam earplugs do the job (and the tunes or phone calls) roll on!<br/><br/>Also found a neat trick you can do with these and your phone is to give a hybrid tour - you are present for the people you are with (giving a tour to) and on a zoom call on a phone you can connect with others who are on the call, who can hear what is going on during the tour.  Unexpected benefit!<br/><br/>Would recommend this type of headphone for flexibility (generally) and these ones specifically - they seem to work really well.  If I lost them I'd go buy a replacement without hesitation.</span>

<span>I got these for my walks, as a long time cyclist I know it’s not a great idea to be out and disconnected from the sounds of the world around you.  These headsets provide both good sound and the ability to hear cars, bikes, dogs, etc… that may be coming up from behind.  The only negative with the headsets is that while that have a very nice case, it would be nice to be able to fold these up tightly and be able to put them in your pocket and not worry about them breaking.<br/><br/>Note that if you’re in a high noise area, you most likely won’t hear your music very well, but I think that’s the point of them.<br/><br/>The touch points are good, I can operate them using a pair of thin walking gloves, the battery seems fine, but I’ve only been on 3-4 walks with them (averaging 1.75 hours a walk).  I can’t say how well the microphone works yet.</span>

<span>If you want noise cancellation this is not the product you are looking for. However, if you've always wanted to be able to listen to music in every situation in life, like a soundtrack deep inside your head as you work, attend meetings, go shopping, wait in line for your number to be called, these headphones let you still hear the world while you hear the music or whatever you want to hear.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, the listening experience with these (and all bone conduction headphones) is different! Your hearing will compete between the sounds coming in through the air in the holes of your ears and the vibrations through your skull. It is something your brain will need to adjust to, but we're talking a day or two at most before they feel "normal". Also certain situations require some adjustment, like if you ride a bus or train with lots of background noise you will notice that even at max volume it will be hard to hear these headphones, which is why Shokz includes earplugs in the package, which immediately solved the issue with background noise. Again, these headphones are NOT effective for noise cancellation AT ALL! That's not what they are for!<br/><br/>Shokz markets these to athletes, mainly runners and cyclists who need to negotiate the world where you share your path with other people and cars. In these situations being able to hear whats around you is important, and if you want that but also want to listen to your music/podcasts with minimum friction, these headphones are a perfect solution.<br/><br/>As for the ergonomics, the back-of-the-head rigid wire connecting each bone conduction speaker can take some getting used to. If you wear a jacket with a thick collar or hood that can bump in to the wire which moves the speakers against your head and can be annoying. A similar issue comes up if you want to wear a warm hat that covers your ears. The simple and effective solution is that you can push the wire up so it follows the contour of the back of your head, and tuck the wire in to the hat. This is where the beauty of the bone conduction headphones really shines: unlike in-ear or over-ear headphones, THE POSITION OF THE BONE CONDUCTION HEADPHONES DOESN'T ALTER THE SOUND QUALITY! Unlike earbuds that for me are the worst for this problem, when you reposition the Shokz the sound comes through the same, and you're never needing to find just the right way to fit them in your ears (a huge problem with so many earbud style headphones).<br/><br/>The biggest benefit of these just how comfortable these are for long-wear times. I put mine on in the morning and take them off at the end of the day. I actually have to make sure I check if I have them on when I get in the shower because I frequently forget I'm wearing them! I wear them with both a mask and sunglasses, no problem. Unlike both in-ear and over-ear headphones where after some time they start to bother my ears, these never really have given me that issue.<br/><br/>Last thing I'll mention is that this particular product is the latest iteration of Shokz' athletic-focussed line, where they adjusted how much the wire protrudes beyond the back of your head and also improved the microphone and battery life (these are a huge improvement over the "Aeroplex" line on all of these dimensions). Worth every penny!</span>

<span>I bought a pair of these 6 months ago and I'm so blown away at how amazing these are I'm coming back to post a review. But you have to use the product for what it's designed for. These are open-ear headphones. So right off the bat, forget the idea of noise cancellation. These are designed for the opposite use - to allow you to listen to your stuff while also listening to the environment. They hide in your hair if it's decently long, and they disappear under a loose beanie. This means you can use them to listen to whatever you want and tune the world out, and if someone says your name you can easily pop back into reality. Essential for the workplace!<br/><br/>Sound quality is pretty good - given it's vibrating the sound through your skull. If it's touching your head you'll hear the music. Which means it's not going to be the go-to for audiophiles. But if all you want is decent sound while being able to answer your colleague's question that they've asked 3 times already and keep your cool cause you've got your music playing, this is the set for you!<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent. I use it for a whole 8 hour shift, switching from music to WebEx, and back again. I pair it to my phone when I leave for lunch, and then pair it back to my computer to resume work. I plug it into the weird proprietary charging jack and leave it on my desk. And as the Immortal Todd Howard once said - "It just works".<br/><br/>I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because the audio isn't the best. Stuff like FLAC will sound terrible, relatively speaking. But, hey, save that stuff for when you're not at work and can appreciate it; this is a business expense!</span>
