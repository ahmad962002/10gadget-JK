Product Description   The Sena SMH10 Motorcycle Bluetooth 3.0 Headset and Intercom was designed to keep you connected to your riding companions over longer ranges for conversation and music sharing--up to 900 meters (980 yards). When paired with a Bluetooth-enabled phone, it'll also let you make hands-free calls. The SMH10 features a Universal Microphone Kit. The Jog Dial makes for an intuitive user interface that is much easier to control while riding. The Jog Dial default is volume control, and pushing the integrated button lets you cycle through all device functions with minimal fuss, which means you'll ride safer. The SMH10 delivers crystal-clear, natural sound through the stereo Bluetooth headset that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. The Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward and track back functions, plus each audio source has its own adjustable volume level. Integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device. You'll get up to 12 hours of talk time and 10 days of stand-by time on a single charge. And even if your companions don't have Sena gear, the SMH10 uses the Universal Intercom protocol, which allows your gear to work with theirs, regardless of brand.   Amazon.com   The SMH10-11 is a Bluetooth v3.0 + EDR Class 1 Stereo Headset with long-range Bluetooth Intercom designed specifically for motorcycles. With the SMH10-11, you can call hands-free on your Bluetooth mobile phone, listen to stereo music or voice instructions of GPS navigations by Bluetooth wirelessly, and have intercom conversations in full duplex with a passenger or other motorcycle riders. This SMH10-11 bundle comes with a universal microphone kit that includes both a boom mic and a wired mic for versatile helmet installation.  Features include Bluetooth 3.0, multi-point connection, and conferencing for up to 4 people Thanks to the latest Bluetooth v3.0 and the advanced digital processing technology, the SMH10-11 offers the best sound quality for both incoming and outgoing sound in its class. Also, the easy-to-access and intuitive button operations make the SMH10-11 a perfect companion for motorcycles.Bluetooth v3.0 WirelessSMH10-11 can wirelessly connect to other Bluetooth devices supporting HSP/HFP (Headset Profile/Hands Free Profile) and A2DP (Advance Audio Distribution Profile). HSP/HFP is standard in all phones with Bluetooth features. Almost all Bluetooth MP3 players, smartphone, and audio dongles support A2DP to send stereo audio to Bluetooth headsets like the Sena SMH10-11. Enjoy Bluetooth music playback control by AVRCP: play, pause, track forward and track back.Other Bluetooth features include Multi-Pair to allow intercom functionality for 4 persons, and compatibility with select motorcycle GPS systems. Use as an intercom, or connect to your portable devicesIndividual Adjustable Volume ProfilesYou can easily decrease/increase the volume of the voice, music and intercom using Jog Dial. The SMH10-11 can save volume levels of previously connected profiles. This means that phone volume (HSP/HFP), music volume (A2DP), and intercom volumes will be saved separately and return to its own saved volume level whenever associated profile is reconnected.Profile volume adjustment is only affected during the use of its specific profile. However, when changing volume during standby mode, then volume change applies to all profiles. Alert tones like low battery warning and connection tones can only be adjusted in standby mode.Easy Installation for Most HelmetsThe SMH10-11 will fit onto various types of helmets. The universal microphone kit included in this bundle includes both a boom mic and a wire mic, and will fit onto most types of helmets. For installations which may require extra wire length, ear buds instead of speakers, and wire microphone instead of boom microphone, Sena offers different types of clamps as an additional accessory (sold separately), to allow various installations and user preferences.Two-Year WarrantyThe SMH10-11 offers peace of mind in your purchase with a 2-year warranty against workmanship defects.

<span>I only use it for listening to music while I'm riding.  At first the music sounded terrible and I was going to return it.  Then I found if i go into my equalizer on my phone and set the bass to max and the treble to min it sounds pretty good.  The one hand controls are great and would buy another one.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I commute on my motorcycle as much as possible all through the year..  I am a general practice attorney, so unfortunately I have too often run into occasions where emergencies come up, and calls from Judge's chambers come in while I am riding..  I had relied on feeling the vibration from the phone in my chest pocket, and if there are repeat calls, I would pull over and check to see if the call coming in was a priority..  Obviously, there have ended up being plenty of occasions where the call was my wife calling about the garbage disposal being clogged or the wireless internet in the house not working!!  So my purchase of this Sena unit was initially fueled by a desire to have the ability to press a button and answer a call to find out if a pull over was needed or not..  but then as I looked at these units, I realized I could also play my music wirelessly into the helmet AND have turn by turn GPS..  all from the phone..<br/><br/>I had to give it a try, and the Sena SMH10-11 received rave reviews from a few of my friends who are "real" riders..  not pretty Sunday ride type guys.  These guys ride in the sun, the rain, the snow, hot, cold, 10 hour highway days, 10 hour blue ridge parkway days..  So I trusted their recommendations..<br/><br/>IMPORTANT PART OF MY REVIEW:  I was initially considering going with the SMH10r version, because on some pictures I viewed the SMH10 looked big and possibly in the way..  now that I have it installed, it is totally fine, in my opinion..  the toggle is handy as heck, and as I have messed with it, I think the little buttons on the streamlined "r" version may have been a hassle.<br/><br/>I popped the unit on my Scorpion EXO-1000 and routed the wires in about 10 minutes..  install was simple and a breeze.<br/><br/>Paired the phone in 5 seconds..<br/><br/>Test run today in a monsoon of sorts -- raining, getting blown all over the road..  this unit stinking rocks!!  Music in my helmet was plenty loud and I didn't have it cranked all the way..  my Exo-1000 is not a quiet helmet, and I'm splurging on a GT-Air, so sound will be better with a more quiet helmet.  But plenty loud, and absolutely AWESOME not to be tethered with earbuds when I'm craning my neck around looking for predatory cage drivers!<br/><br/>If water resistance was a big flaw, today's downpour might have created a problem..  but nada.  I haven't tried a call while riding, because I didn't get one..  but the phone worked well when I bugged my wife calling from the garage inside my helmet.  She couldn't tell, but that is not a useful "test" anyway..<br/><br/>Main reason I wanted to post this is on the size issue.  I think these Sena units have a great rep already as far as function, but I just wanted to give my two cents on the form aspect.  I almost didn't go with this one thinking I didn't want some bulbous thing on the side of my helmet..  but now that it is installed, for me the size is a non-issue, and surely is outweighed greatly by the simplicity and convenience of the toggle type operation of the unit..  FIVE STARS!</span>

<span>In preparation for a 1 month, 4000 mile motorcycle trip I thought I would try a Bluetooth system in conjunction with my new iPhone 13. Without a doubt, this combination has greatly changed - for the good - my motorcycling experience; it’s also made my wife happy since I am now accessible to her while I’m driving.<br/><br/>I recall reading a few reviews stating the installation took them maybe 30 minutes. That was not my experience at all, I would say it took me at least two hours. Perhaps I’m more anal than some, but I wanted to get it right.<br/><br/>The audio is exceptional, as long as you enjoy treble more than bass (the treble brought clarity to whatever I listened to). In my experience, I was able to make &amp; receive phone calls easily as well as listen to my Sirius XM radio stations or my portfolio of music. As others have mentioned, the 4 buttons which require various combinations of actuation are a bit confusing, but only because the process is new. A couple more weeks of this process and I will have them down pat.<br/><br/>As for the battery, not only does it charge very fast, I have yet to run out of battery power although I have had days in excess of eight or nine hours of use.<br/><br/>BTW, for those of you who are wondering, and it should be many of you, how bad was the wind noise? I personally wear a full shell, HJC helmet, which is on the low end of price points of helmets. Though the wind noise usually seems fairly loud, I was shocked at the clarity of the audio the first time I received a phone call. I inquired of my caller and was told they could hear me perfectly, almost like I was just calling from the backseat of their car. As for talk shows and music, almost always I could hear in such a way as to have full understanding of what was being said or sung.<br/><br/>Prior to my purchase of the Cardo Bluetooth, I studied and studied and studied other Bluetooth systems. Thus far, with over two weeks and nearly 2500 miles of driving, I am 100% satisfied with the Cardo system</span>

<span>This is a great product and over install was easy. Works well and has a slim fit on a modular or full face helmet. SMH10R which is slightly different from Sena10R in terms of HD speakers and few more futures I believe. So make sure you are buying keeping that in mind. Otherwise both products are good for what you want. You do save few extra $ between the models.</span>

<span>Honestly not impressed with this. It is my first foray into bluetooth for a motorcycle, so maybe my hopes were just too high to begin.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-Relatively straightforward install on a Shoei Neotec. Takes a little bit of patience to tuck away the wires neatly and avoid pressure spots while wearing the helmet. Initial install probably took me 15-20 minutes, taking my time. From there, about three or four adjustments after riding and noticing a pressure point from a poorly routed wire.<br/><br/>-Low profile, obviously. I'm a big fan of how clean it looks on the helmet, compared to the normal TV remote-sized units.<br/><br/>-Charge lasts pretty well. I've pulled numerous 10+ hour days streaming music or audiobooks from my GPS the entire time, without running out of juice. That about maxes it out, and it's dead in the first few miles of day 2, but I've yet to have it die on the first day of fresh charge, so that's awesome.<br/><br/>-Call quality is reportedly pretty good. Low speed use around town, people tell me I sound much clearer than my Motorola unit in my truck, but a bit muffled. Overall, everyone says it's much better than most hands free units they're used to hearing.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-Cumbersome controls. Obviously to be expected with the limited buttons and such. Not terrible for normal use, but if you're trying to access something you don't frequently use, or something you've never used - good luck.<br/><br/>-The rubber charge port cover is a pain. If you try using any but the charger that was supplied with it, the cover likes to push it out and stop charging. You have to borderline rip it off to get it to stay out of the way and allow a secure charge.<br/><br/>-Sound quality is absolute garbage. Works fine at lower volumes and speeds around town. Freeway: forget it. I ultimately threw the speakers away and opted for the earbud adapter, but now I'm back to running wires into my jacket - voiding 100% of the reason I purchased this in the first place. I guess the full-size unit has some software enhancements to help with sound quality that this unit does not. Maybe they actually help, and this thing desperately needs all the help it can get in this department. Phone calls are inaudible at max volume around 60mph. Music may as well all be Bieber over 45mph.<br/><br/>-Noticeable wind noise. Not terrible. Hardly a point to complain about. But I read countless reviews that say there is zero wind noise. Maybe my helmet is just quiet enough on its own that I'm able to notice it, I don't know. But there is undeniable wind noise that didn't exist prior to installation.<br/><br/>-Not impressed with build quality. The speaker connection cable has stretched and exposed the wire at the plug end. This is definitely from use of plugging/unplugging the earbud adapter, and not something you'd experience if you stuck with speakers, but a shameful shortcoming that should have been anticipated in design. I fully expect it's only a matter of time before the unit is rendered useless by this flaw, then I'll see how Sena's support is.<br/><br/>-Possibly the worst of all, it malfunctions. This issue is 100% repeatable with my unit, and Sena has refused to acknowledge it. I sent log files, spoke with customer support, etc. and they simply tell me there's nothing wrong with my unit and there's no way the issue is the fault of their product. set up; linked to my cell phone (Galaxy S4, also confirmed on friend's iPhone) and streaming music, as well as having voice prompts enabled for navigation. If I use the Sena keys to pause music (toll booth) it will freeze the unit completely. Occasionally it will allow me to un-pause the music, and go into an extremely low-volume setting, then freeze completely. Most of the time, it won't even allow me to un-pause my music, and the map prompts also stop. No combination of button pressing/holding does anything, and the only fix is to pull over, take off the helmet, dig out the wires and physically unplug the battery, then reconnect and restart the unit. This is a very handy feature on busy highways in areas I don't know.<br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't install one of these on a helmet if it were given to me for free. The only reason I still have it is because my new bike's GPS is bluetooth only, so I'm stuck with something as long as I want to stream music or voice prompts from the GPS. If it does die from the separating speaker connection, I'll be hunting very hard to find a different replacement.</span>

<span>Out of the Box: This is a great product, takes about 15 minutes to download a software update and about 30 minutes to install the way you like. Personally I didn't use the tape to install the speakers as the attached velcro made it easy to attach and move slightly If I didn't like the placement the first time. Just follow the handout in the package to connect a cellphone, Ipod, GPS, or other helmet for the first time and then every other time you turn it on takes 30 seconds to connect to your devices automatically.<br/><br/>Included: instruction manual for everything you'd ever want it to do, a quick guide for most operations you'll want to know how to do such as volume control, skipping songs, pausing, answering phone calls. Larger and lower profile speaker pairs, boom mic and velcro mic, charger, usb cable to connect to computer...basically everything you will ever need is included.<br/><br/>Sound Quality: 9/10 I ride a CBR250, a sportbike with a small windscreen and at 60 mph there is a little windnoise but these speakers get plenty loud to hear over it. Every so often the connection to the IPOD will beep or cut out for 1/2 a second but almost always works flawlessly. Cellphone calls are easy to hear with my Iphone and those I talk to say it sounds pretty good but slightly muffled (expect that to be because I am wearing a fullface helmet with the velcro mic). Clarity is very good, much better than if you were using your speakerphone to listen to a call.<br/><br/>Controls: Take a little getting used to as there are only 3 buttons (plus, minus, and middle button), skipping songs and changing volume is easy enough while riding and using the left hand to hit the buttons. Connecting devices is a little more complicated but you do this in the comfort of your home with the instructions in front of you. Accepting phone calls is easy through either talking into mic or pressing a button and you can set up 3 phone numbers to dial easily using your computer to program them into the headset and then pressing a series of buttons on the bike. Controls are large but the first time I rode it took me a few seconds to determine which button to press for volume/skipping song, expect this to be instant once I ride with it a lot more<br/><br/>Durability: No problems yet, but haven't dropped it or rode through the rain<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this product, will probably buy another in the future for a passenger helmet</span>

<span>I'm a fairly new rider. I've only had 1 helmet (Shoei GT-Air), and I've only used this bluetooth unit. So, I can't really offer a comparison helmet-to-helmet or bluetooth-to-bluetooth for this review. What I can say is that this bluetooth unit does about everything I could want, and does it well. I'm riding for work now, and put a LOT of time in the saddle for my job (approaching 3k miles, been less than a month since I got the bike), so I do feel like I can offer a good review for this product based on my usage and gear.<br/><br/>Installation:<br/><br/>Easy, easy, easy. Never installed any bluetooth or modified a motorcycle helmet in any way. I tried putting the velcro side of the speakers directly onto the ear pad of the helmet (they stick to the fabric with no trouble, nice and secure) but I didn't like the fit after a few hours of use in that way. The following morning I removed the padding that covers the ear cavity (pops right out, stuck 'em in a drawer where I have random motorcycle gear stuff in case I want them back in later) and used the velcro mountings that came with the Sena to install the speakers. Fits good, speakers sit right by my ears.<br/><br/>The main part of the unit can go just about anywhere you want on the left side, so figure out a good spot and stick it there. A lot of folks have said they got the battery on the inside of the helmet, but as I mentioned I'm gonna put a lot of hours on this thing so I'm going to leave mine mounted on the rear outside of the helmet so I can carry a couple extra charged batteries with me.<br/><br/>Finally the microphone. I haven't used the boom mic, figured I'd start with the other one. Stuck a piece of their mounting velcro in front of where my mouth goes in the helmet, stuck the mic to it, done.<br/><br/>Last but not least, all these wires. Basically, I unbuttoned the padding and neatly ran all the wires around until nothing was sticking out more than it needed to, but none of the wiring was stretched tight. Looks good! Very inconspicuous.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/><br/>Works great for voice. I've listened to audiobooks through it, phone calls sound good, turn-by-turn navigation from the phone is clear. Music however... well, there aren't a lot of really AWESOME sounding speakers for motorcycle helmets out there. If you're after some really nice sound you may want to get the adapter that lets you connect earphones to it and get a nice pair of ear buds. I appreciate great sound quality, but not enough to drop the convenience of the helmet-mounted speakers. IMHO this quality can be tolerated while riding.<br/><br/>What "THEY" hear:<br/><br/>Great. I've got a bluetooth stereo in my car that includes microphone, used it for a long time for work. It does an alright job, but I've had complaints that it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel while I'm at highway speeds. Not so with the Sena! I would have thought on the motorcycle the noise would be even worse than in the car, but because of the positioning of the mic folks on the other end don't even know that I'm riding, even at high speed! The first night I used it I called my girlfriend while riding around. Even with the face shield open she couldn't hear that I was riding. I got to a highway on ramp and when the light turned green I went from 0 to 60 fairly quickly and she said "I kinda heard that a little". I've got a Honda VTX 1300, not what I'd call "stealthy" but certainly not the loudest.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>Pretty simple, takes some getting used to. You've got 3 buttons, + , -, and a center button in between the two. Everything's done by tapping the buttons or by press-and-hold for various lengths of time and in various combinations. I'd advise actually reading the instructions when it comes to this, because aside from tapping + and - to adjust volume, it's not intuitive and you will have to memorize some stuff. It's not hard, once you use it a handful of times you've got the hang of it.<br/><br/>Good luck on your quest for a bluetooth unit for your helmet. Keep the rubber side down folks!</span>

<span>After years of my wife riding on the back of my motorcycle she now has her own can am spyder (and loves it). So, this created a need to communicate between vehicles instead of shoulder taps and hip squeezes. Honestly, I had no idea there were so many blue tooth units out there until I started researching them. After checking reviews, I decided on this unit and the fact that prime had their two-day sales event and I saved a bundle. Installing on our helmets, hers 3/4 and mine, full face was fairly easy, just follow directions and a couple of you tube videos. Normally I wear a half helmet with my windshield, but I am not creative enough to install unit on the half helmet. The first time we went out and tried them I was very surprised. Once we figured out how to talk to each other it was great. We've been using them for a while now and am quite pleased. It makes gas and bathroom stops easier to do. Also being able to say "did you see that" as you are traveling instead after you stopped is kind of nice. Being able to listen to music is also a great feature. I'll be honest I am definitely not qualified to comment on sound quality as I wear hearing aids. My hearing situation is a little different as one ear has 80% loss, but the other ear is still quite good, so I don't need them to actually hear. Now this leads to an issue that was unforeseen. As I mentioned I went back to my full-face helmet. I wear a size small which is quite tight. Between the hearing aids and glasses, I have to "spread" my helmet a little to put on. What happens now when I do this the unit actually pops off. Has fallen on the floor twice and still works so that's good. When putting on my helmet now I be sure to have a finger on the unit and so far, it works. Overall am very pleased with how these unit's work. The issue's I mentioned are my own and nothing to do with the units themselves, just thought they might relate to a few other people.</span>

<span>This is the first motorcycle headset I've owned, so I don't have much experience with them. I've had this one since May 2018 and it's done pretty well. I usually ride with ear plugs and with my old helmet (Scorpion T-1200) I had to turn the volume to near max to hear my music and GPS. With my newest helmet (Icon Airframe) I really don't have to turn it up that high. The padding around the ears is much thinner in the Icon helmet and it fits much tighter than the scorpion.<br/>Sound quality is nothing special. It plays music and I can hear calls just fine while going down the highway. But it's definitely not Bose surround sound, and it won't cancel any noise. You just have to make it louder than all the sounds around you.<br/>The intercom system works really well and I accidentally found out that you can actually intercom the music (or GPS) you're playing to the other headsets on the intercom. All in all, this headset is pretty good for the price and I would recommend it.</span>

<span>Well, I can attest that this will stay on a helmet during a motorcycle crash that had me going head first into mother Earth, followed by numerous flipping and flopping. It also still works.  I did not have the antenna out during the crash.  The app is very smooth especially with Spotify.  Battery life is really good. Especially with the amount of riding I was doing.

<span>Great device when you are riding with somebody. Definitely will not ride without once you tried it. Regarding the quality- my first pair, one of it was bad/defective. I could hear but other side couldn’t. Got it exchanged fixed the problem. However, we believe the other one the battery is defective as it drains to 20% after an hour or two rides. Sounds ok when not riding but hard to hear while going on highway speed. Overall I’m happy with Cardo but expect better with hefty price to pay.</span>

<span>Works as advertised. I was reluctant because the other riders in our group have Sena’s and I saw all the comments that Sena would not pair up with the Cardo’s.  After getting ours setup, I invited one of our friends to try pairing the units up.  We had some success but when using on the bikes there was a lot of static that was annoying but we at least knew we could use them when needed but switch them over when not using.  The comm and music was very clear when in mesh mode with other Cardo users.  I loved the voice command capabilities and also found I could call “hey Siri, call…” our Sena friend and then I can push a button and tie the phone call in with the other Cardo users and the sound was very clear, no static and everyone could be in the conversation.<br/>I highly recommend the Cardo Packtalk for the waterproofing, voice command, mesh, sound quality, and ease of use.</span>

<span>This BT headset has all of the features I have been looking for - and they work!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it doesn't have an option to plug in your personal ear buds for better audio quality.  The speakers that it comes with are best for the voice, not so good for music since there is really no base response.  Once I verified the unit worked as advertised, I cut the speaker wires and removed the speakers.  This is easy to do since the earflaps have zipper access and the speakers are held in place by Velcro.  I then soldered on a female 3.5mm headset jack to the Left and Right speaker wires and their grounds, shrunk wrapped the wires, and it is all easily contained in the left earflap.  Now I just plugged in my comfortable ear buds tucking the majority of the wire in the left earflap, and tucking enough wire between the helmet shell and foam liner so that the ear buds hang down from the back center of the helmet.  Now I just put the helmet on, stick the ear buds in and go.  It is great having integrated GPS directions, phone, intercom, and music with no wires running from my body to the bike or iPhone.  I use my iPhone5 for GPS, phone, and music with it mounted on my handle bars and plugged into a Karyaken USB power receptacle.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this is a fantastic unit that enhances the ride and simplifies communication with your fellow riders with the intercom ability.  I used it in the above mentioned configuration for a week long trip with another rider.  We were riding 10 hour days and the battery lasted all day long, just charged it up at night.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to plug it in to charge while riding.  I have not used the intercom feature with more than one other bike (the week-long trip), but the range on it was good to .25 to .5 miles max.  Plenty for bike to bike coordination, and if you get separated by more than that you can always call them on the cell by pressing the phone button and telling Siri to "Call Buddy" ;).<br/><br/>Regarding the Mic., I was traveling 75 MPH on the interstate and had several great phone conversations with folks, all of whom were amazed by the audio quality when I told them.  In fact, my mother said "I will let you get back on the road" and I had to tell her that I was riding.  Of course she said "then hang up the phone and drive!" :)<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you don't have one, get one!</span>

<span>If you're a motorcycle rider, and you want to communicate with someone riding b ... in the back seat ... or on another bike (or group of bikes), this is a good option.  It is also useful if you need to hear your GPS or answer a call while riding.  The music quality, however, is terrible.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>* Battery life is good for at least 5 hours of constant use - probably a bit more.<br/>* Fairly easy to attach and remove to your helmet.<br/>* Phone pairing and pairing with other headsets is fast.<br/>* Can hear others pretty clearly - even on the highway.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>* These do not work well with the "novelty" helmets (non DOT certified).  You can force a fit on most models, but it is clunky at best.<br/>* Music quality is terrible.<br/>* These try to do too much - there are so many different patterns to remember to try to turn on FM radio, switch to bluetooth, share music, answer calls, etc.  You'll likely use those mostly to sync with other units and to listen to bluetooth (the other features look nifty, but they're just too much to remember - particularly when you're riding).<br/>* The "intercom" mode picks up all the wind noise - so you'll constantly hear the crackling of the other persons mic.  The only other option is to manually turn the intercom on or off which - in most cases - isn't very practical.  I don't know that there's a better option for this, however.  There's so much noise when you're on a bike wearing a half-helmet, that I don't think noise sensing technology can shut that out.<br/>* If you want to use this to communicate with someone else, they will need some sort of headset too.  These do appear to pair with other devices, so they may not be required to use this particular headset.<br/>* Many functions appear to rely on a firmware upgrade (easy to do - but probably not for the non-technical folks).  And some features are turned on or off via your computer (so if you're on a trip and you don't have your laptop with you, you're out of luck until you get back home).</span>

<span>This is my second Sena product. I bought a kit for my full face helmet and was impressed with it, so I decided to take a chance on this set up for my half helmet. I'm glad I did because I can ride and still hear my music slow or fast. I can hear the GPS directions just fine as well. I don't talk on the intercom or phone, but its nice to have the feature. I have a Daytona half helmet and the ear pads fit fine.<br/><br/>Don't sit on the fence, get it and enjoy your tunes!</span>

<span>Very happy with these speakers and this intercom. Though, I do think that the built in voice recognition (“hey Cardo”) should have more controls and actions. I’m very happy with this headset. It connects to my BMW f900XR’s computer and my phone seamlessly. I’m able to turn music up, skip songs, and respond to text messages/answer calls with my voice, WHICH IS HUGE. Not to mention, GPS navigation is just as amazing with voice control because I don’t have to stop to type in addresses.<br/>It is kind of annoying though, that when you say “hey Siri” the headset actually also says “hey Siri” and you have to wait for this pause every-time you want to use hey Siri for a voice control.</span>

Occasionally, it doesn’t respond.  Even with the engine off, it’s like it stops listening. Powering it off and back on resolves it. Most annoying issue is probably more where I have it installed on the helmet. If I turn my head to look over my shoulder I hit the volume wheel with my shoulder and turn it all the way up.

The Jog Dial, meanwhile, makes for an intuitive user interface that is much easier to control while riding. The Jog Dial default is volume control, and pushing the integrated button lets you cycle through all device functions with minimal fuss, which means you'll ride safer. Bluetooth 3.0 technology provides the capability to listen to and share music, make phone calls with speed dialing, and participate in a four-way intercom conversation with riding buddies up to 900 meters (980 yards) away from each other. The SMH10 delivers crystal-clear, natural sound through the stereo Bluetooth headset that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. The Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward and track back functions, plus each audio source has its own adjustable volume level. All registered Sena owners get access to free firmware upgrades, which ensure your SMH10 is always operating with the latest software updates. Meanwhile, integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device. You'll get up to 12 hours of talk time and 10 days of stand-by time on a single charge.

<span>I bought these because my helmets are set up for them. The installation was easy and they look good in the helmets.  Sound quality is pretty lousy.  They are very tin like in sound and I often get a lot of static, especially when communicating with my passenger.  I have $40 wireless headphones that have much better sound. I wish I had listened to the reviews that mentioned the sound quality. If I hadn't waited past the return date I would definitely send them back. I do not recommend them.</span>

<span>Works perfectly with Bell qualifier dlx helmet.  No special adapter/bracket needed to fit the helmet.  One negative  is sound quality.  I feel like these headphones are a throwback to the 80s/90s headphones sound.  I would've gave it five stars if the sound quality was better.</span>

<span>The Good:<br/>- Installation in my Bell Qualifier DLX helmet was a breeze. Very well put together by Bell and Sena. Well done!<br/>- Audio levels are decent. At 55MPH I can hear music and phone calls with foam earplugs in.<br/>- Speakers are a little tinny. Tweaking your equalizer or booster does wonders. Download an app if you have to. It kicks some life into these little speakers.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>- Updating the firmware involved a lot of research. When following the process outlined my software locked up at 90%. Apparently this version does not like Windows 10 and USB3. There are quite a few posts on people bricking their headsets during the process so you may not want to update the firmware. If you do Windows7 and USB2 appears to be the way to go. Hopefully this process works better with newer versions.<br/><br/>Would I purchase this again? Absolutely. Minus the software issues, the is a great piece of tech.</span>

<span>The headset was easy to install on my Bell Mag 9 helmet.  Is was easy to pair with Bluetooth to both my phone and to BRP Connect on my Can Am Spyder.  The audio quality is good, not great.  I still have trouble hearing when driving at 60+ mph due to wind noise, but if I get a taller windshield, I expect better performance.  All in all, I think this is a good product and I am happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>This unit gets the job done, simple, discreet &amp; easy to use. Installs simple and if you’re lucky your helmet will be as compatable as mine was. It has an app, it takes calls &amp; music easy off Bluetooth. A added perk is this device will raise and lower volume dependent on your speed. Pretty great but I should’ve got packtalk</span>

<span>Mounts easy and sounds great even at 65 mph with a full face helmet. The radio feature is also a plus and notifications come through clear. Shuts down after a short time out of range from phone to save battery. Worth the price!!</span>

<span>Great bang for your buck. So far no downside for the price point.<br/><br/>The install was the most difficult part as you have to plan the wiring and if you're as meticulous as I am (often mistaken as a perfectionist), things have to look right, sound amazing and feel comfortable. The hardest part is lining up the speakers appropriately to your ears if your helmet doesn't have designated cutouts. Also the speakers are thick (making amazing sound), so if there isn't a recess for them to sit in, and your ears already fold a bit putting on your helmet, this will be a painful experience. Plan accordingly. Cardboard traced to the speaker shape, a razor, and a ton of patience.<br/><br/>The sound qualify is clear and loud, calls are crisp according to the opinion of who I call (actually clearer than using the phone as normal, so I've been told).<br/><br/>Functionality is easy, but the button combinations to use the features take some memorization. The FM radio is a nice touch if you use the Cardo app. And if you have MP3s saved to your phone it has a "music player" feature that reads them. But I doubt that will get any use as I use a streaming service. GPS also is clearly audible as well and has a nice fade out/in when you get a call.<br/><br/>Overall very pleased with the purchase. The only negative from a Cardo Design perspective is the way the device attaches to the plate, in comparison to others. It is a horizontal tab that click the unit in place. The release lever cannot be mistakenly hit, but if it is the unit WILL disconnect and go flying off. Other devices sit in a vertical post or slide in a tab, in a way they can "dangle there" for a second, allowing you to realize your sound interruption is due to it physically disconnecting, saving it from dropping. Again just a pet peeve of mine, as I shopped almost every other brand big and small, make and model, to eventually purchase this unit.<br/><br/>Would definitely purchase again if lost or damaged (or flew off). And would make any rider happy if it was a gift.</span>
