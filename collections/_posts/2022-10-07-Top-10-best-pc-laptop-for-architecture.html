In the field of architecture, a laptop is one of the most essential tools an architect can have. It is an essential tool for drafting, modeling, and viewing projects. So, what is the best laptop for architecture?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to that question. Factors that will influence your decision include the type of architecture you practice, the software you use, and your budget.

That said, here are three laptops that would be a great fit for any architect:

1. The MacBook Pro is a great option for architects who use Mac-based software. It has a high-resolution retina display, powerful processors, and plenty of storage.

2. The Microsoft Surface Book is a powerful Windows laptop that is perfect for architects who use software like AutoCAD. It has a detachable screen, making it perfect for sketching and drawing.

3. The Dell XPS 13 is a great option for architects on a budget. It has a high-resolution display, a powerful processor, and plenty of storage.<table>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several "premium" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.<br/><br/>With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly "hot". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.<br/><br/>I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.<br/><br/>This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.<br/><br/>The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.<br/><br/>It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.<br/><br/>For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.<br/><br/>As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the "lite" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.<br/><br/>Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.<br/><br/>I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.</span>

<span>Purchased this laptop because I didn't want to use my gaming rig for work and other basic tasks.<br/><br/>Build quality is far better than I  expected at this price point. Sure, it would be great to have a solid aluminum case instead of just the top, but that is to be expected for the price.<br/>Took it apart as soon as it was delivered so I could add a 8gb ram stick and a second ssd.<br/>Installation was super easy.<br/>Kudos to acer for adding the ability to install a 2.5" hard drive with provided hardware.<br/>Not many other rigs at this price point that have a second drive option.<br/>You can also upgrade the nvme drive if you want to.<br/><br/>Backlit keyboard is also a huge plus and it is the perfect brightness in my opinion.<br/>Keyboard is comfortable to type on and the addition of a 10 key is another bonus at this price point.<br/><br/>Screen is nice and bright with no glare. Honestly a much better picture quality than I expected for a sub $500 laptop.<br/><br/>It has all the ports you need to get the job done.<br/>2x usb 3<br/>1x usb 2<br/>1x usbc "Out only unfortunately" You have to charge the laptop with included charger.<br/>Lan/Ethernet<br/>Headphone jack<br/><br/>Performance is where this laptop really shines.<br/>I am dual booting the stock windows 11 and linux mint.<br/>Both run flawlessly and super fast.<br/>Hasn't slowed down at all with multiple apps and browser tabs running at once.<br/>Everything runs just as fast as my desktop gaming rig.<br/>Would't run any high end games on it of coarse since it is not built for that and has no deddicated video card.<br/>Pretty sure you could run minecraft or wow/diablo on lower settings.<br/><br/>Battery life is also amazing.<br/>I am getting about 8 hours of usage before I plug the battery in at 30%.<br/>That is with full screen brightness, wifi and bluetooth enabled.<br/>It took 10 hours to completely drain the battery after the first charge.<br/><br/>I would recommend this laptop to anyone that wants a solid rig at a great price for everything other than gaming.<br/>It is also very light for a full featured laptop, so it would be a great choice for school or business for someone that needs/wants to carry around a full sized laptop.<br/>I don't think you could find a better laptop for a student at this price.</span>

<span>Biggest case of buyers remorse in my life. Always bought HP with Intel hardware but figured with the reviews for this Acer Aspire 5 with AMD Ryzen 5 and Radeon graphics why not explore unfamiliar territory and see what the hype was about in the reviews. This Acer Aspire 5 for $489 Brand New shipped to the door I was astonished the laptop didn't come with an actual user manual. Was even more pissed that you can not setup and use this without first connecting to a WiFi network.<br/>For those who don't care about WiFi connections and just want a localized laptop with out brand manufacturers spying on you and gathering data your SOL. Wanted to read the user manual to see there if there was a way around this but for $489 you have to have the internet and download it. After I connected to the internet against my will the computer restarted and entered an error message that an error was encountered and it needed to restart. It did this twice with no luck just blue screens. It then went to diagnose repair screen attempting to diagnose the failure to start up with no luck only option was to shut down. After shutdown it actually loaded back up the and the very next screen was demanding to log in with a Microsoft account or sign up for one. Now there are ways around this with HP laptops. All you have to do is say no internet connection at 1st use and then you can sign in with a local account instead of logging in with a Microsoft account. For those who may not understand why this is an issue for some is when you login with a Microsoft account no matter what settings on privacy you think you can control you have zero privacy. Microsoft can see anything any everything you do on your laptop down to the keyboard typing and all activity. Oh well I know how to fix that later and I sign on with a Microsoft account. Finally get to windows and do what I always do download Firefox and Uninstall Microsoft edge. I restart the laptop to the same cycle of error loading operating system and attempt to diagnose that fails. Shut down the laptop and it loads again. Finally found out that anytime you restart the laptop whatsoever it cycles back to the same blue screens of error loading windows and diagnosing. Performed a factory restore back to complete factory settings so it was like the first time I opened the laptop up no difference. Still doing this cycle of device ran into problem gathering info, then diagnosing PC, PC cant be repaired, shut down, loads till the next time it restarts. Being upset is putting it mildly. I'm 38 and have been using computers and fixing them since I was 12, this is not a foreign language to me. This Acer Aspire 5 with AMD processor and graphics is total garbage. Brand new and it don't even work properly right out of the freakin box. I factory restored this thing 3 times and supposedly this wipes the hard drive completely and saves nothing but yet every time it re-installs it still has my name has the device owner. I started growing aggravated with HP but Acer is a complete joke. The display sucks also. Everything looks fine till you open a windows system or program property window then it's so blurry you think u have something in your eye, played with resolution and display settings and everything is clear and fine until you open a windows properties window and you can barely make out the letters. Same windows on my 3, 5 and 7 year old HP laptops zero issues but this brand new $500 Acer laptops display stops wanting to work properly over a properties window??? Who ever designed this model and it components and said yeah let's ship that out to the unexpected consumer needs banished from working in the information technology field. I wanted to get product support from Acer to address this issue but I couldn't even register this product through the preinstalled Acer Care Center software or their website, everytime I tried it gave me an error message and to try again later. So if you know a little about computers and want to fix a Brand New laptop yourself to get it to work properly I think you will be very pleased with the performance of this machine with the AMD components.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Found the fix for above issues. Don't use the operating system or ghost recovery drive programmed into the laptop. Download windows media creation tool and perform a full wipe and installation using the USB flash drive on startup.  The install will only load windows 10 but after 2-3 days windows update will automatically install windows 11.  I used Driver Booster 9 to update all the drivers for the hardware which always works flawlessly, best part its free and fast and has 1 click upgrades for all drivers. After a bunch of headache and wasted time I'm pretty impressed and happy with the hardware components. I bench-marked and stress tested this PC to some remarkable results. Too bad it couldn't work properly right out of the box, someone at Acer really dropped the ball. What I like about this Acer Aspire A515 45 is that it has 2 memory slots and comes with 8GB preinstalled and is up-gradable to 32 GB. The Graphics card takes half of the preinstalled 8GB and dedicates it to graphics processing which is nice in a way but its a give and take. I had a 4GB card of DDR4 with a 2666MHz clock frequency and threw that in the unused memory slot.  I was unsure how the PC would benchmark after this because the memory preinstalled was 3200MHz and that basically bottle necks the original memory card from 3200MHz down to 2666MHz but it still performed better than without it. Ideally you want to match the memory frequency with what is preinstalled to avoid this but like I said I had this 2666Mhz card already. In the near future I will match the preinstalled memory card with an after market 8GB DDR4 card with a 3200MHz frequency as well as matching the rank of the card (single rank/double rank) and all other specs. Ideally you want both slots to match down to the last detail including the memory capacity to prevent bottle necks between the processor and the motherboards ability to communicate with the memory. When I had the back off this the 2nd memory card slot was right there and accessibility but the original wasn’t visible so If you want to replace the original memory card it appears you have to remove the mother board and flip it over to get to the original used memory slot. While I was installing the added memory I scene that it has a space for an extra additional hard drive which is really great! I have a 500 GB Samsung 870 EVO SSD hard drive in one of my older HP laptops that will be going in this next. I thought I was gonna have to buy different brackets and sata cable to install the Samsung Evo SSD but they were included in the box with all the screws as well! If you buy a model with Intel products that stuff will be inside the laptop taped where the second hard drive goes. After setting up the additional Samsung hard drive so it was recognized by the laptop I used Samsung's "Magician" software to benchmark both drives and was astonished that the western digital SSD was 3 times faster than my Samsung EVO 870. My Samsung was doing almost 600MB a second read/speed and the WD was almost 2GB per second! My fastest laptop before this Acer was a HP Notebook 15 with an dual core Intel i3 processor. That HP ran me the same price as this Acer 2 years ago. It worked great but its a night and day difference between this Acer for multi tasking and for video and graphics capabilities. That HP didn’t have the extra bay for an additional hard drive either. I’m very pleased with this Acer after I removed the pre-installed operating system and software.</span>

<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>So far this laptop seems decent. Manage you’re expectations. You can’t buy a mid-range gaming laptop and expect all the best. I’ve yet to try some of the more demanding games. But for the games I play these days, like Fortnite, Apex, Rust, R6 Siege, Subnautica, and No Man’s Sky, it’s performing pretty well.<br/><br/>I will say one thing negative: in the pictures, the USB-C port shows the Thunderbolt icon. When I received my laptop, the Thunderbolt icon was missing and only showed the normal USB icon. I was excited for the thunderbolt port but alas the port is not Thunderbolt. This cost them a star on my review simply because having it in the pictures is misleading and they should be updated to reflect the correct icon.</span>

<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>I needed to replace my previous laptop after 5+ years, but I didn't want to break the bank. After researching different gaming laptops, the Acer Nitro 5 stood out as the best balance between price and performance.<br/><br/>I was nervous about upgrading to Windows 11 (I'd avoided upgrading from Windows 7 to 8 because of the terrible UI), but it's actually very clean and minimalist.<br/><br/>The Nitro 5's performance has blown my expectations out of the water. My previous laptop could barely scrape by the FFXIV benchmark on "normal laptop" settings, but the Nitro 5 scored very high on the "high desktop" settings. I've signed up for PC Game Pass to take advantage of my new hardware power, and it's been amazing playing Microsoft Flight Simulator on high settings.<br/><br/>I did end up buying an extra 8GB Crucial RAM, and installing that was a breeze.<br/><br/>Fantastic value for the price!</span>

<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span>I've recently taken up 3D printing and saving files to an SD card on my 8 yr old laptop with a broken screen was a pain. I like this lil laptop. It's been pretty easy to use. I did take it back to the windows 10 because thats what I'm used to using and so much easier to use and navigate. I use this Asus laptop for my 3D model searching, slicing 3D model's in several apps, I was able to connect it to 1 of my 3D printers and successfully printed model's, I've used it for my Cricut machine with design space. I've used it to watch Amazon prime, Netflix, and YouTube videos (I do have to connect a Bluetooth speaker). I've done file transfers from my phone to the laptop. I would not say this is a gaming laptop, but my son did try it out for a couple of games and liked it. It does not have a touch screen, which is a disappointment. It charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a long time. 1 issue with the built in number pad in the mouse pad, it keeps turning on and then can't get it to turn off for a while. It's pretty touchy. It is very lightweight and portable. Something a college student could fit into a backpack.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>For clarity, this review is for the 15.6" GTX 1650 version, not the 17.3" GTX 1650Ti version.<br/><br/>Positives!<br/><br/>This laptop is perfect for me and what I need right now. I am currently in between homes, over the road a lot for work and have all of my stuff in storage, including my main PC, so I bought a laptop so I could continue doing work and gaming while on the go.<br/>This laptop is not top of the line by any means, it's no $2,000 laptop with an RTX 3080 or anything like that, but if you want a good mid-range laptop that can get 60FPS on some everyday gaming, this is as good as mid-range laptops get in my opinion.<br/>Even on my main, much beefier PC, I've never been one to crank up the settings and enable raytracing, 4k etc. I'm more of a framerate type of person and this laptop does a great job getting high frame rates if you're willing to adjust the settings accordingly. The screen is a clean 1920x1080, lovely quality (though the brightness isn't that great), comes with an NVME 512GB hard drive which is not a bad start if you're not trying to install a Call of Duty game with 100gb patches, but that leads into another glowing positive - this thing is upgradeable and I love it! One of the hardest things about picking a laptop for me is the eventual obsolescence, so in the few times I've bought a laptop in my life, I prefer ones you can upgrade which will allow you to skirt by the expected lifespan for a bit longer.<br/>Overall, my complaints a few, but I will point them out.<br/><br/>Negatives!<br/>Honestly, 8GB of RAM is... well, it's not enough for any modern PC that you want to do more than browse the internet, but this negative hardly counts against it because once again, it is upgradeable! I added 32GB to mine and it runs like a dream now. The fact it ships with such low RAM is forgivable because that's probably why the price of entry is as low as it is.<br/>I also had a few problems with the Wi-Fi antenna at first, which I know is not unique to my laptop, but after a few online searches, troubleshooting and settings adjustments, it hasn't dropped the connection for a couple of days, so I think I'm over that hump.<br/>My last complaint and honestly maybe the only one that could be considered "major" is the screen brightness. To be clear, I'm talking about BRIGHTNESS, not QUALITY. The resolution is wonderful and the screen is a clear HD experience, but keep this thing away from the sunlight if you want to see it easily... I took it to the park one day and while I could see the screen, I felt like I was squinting, and I had to change my preferred dark mode to light mode just to see the Windows UI better. Once again, I consider this a minor gripe and won't take a star off, because if you're using this thing indoors or in appropriate shade, the screen is beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for an affordable, upgradeable, laptop suited for everyday gaming (as long as you're not trying to push max settings, 4k or raytracing), you won't be disappointed!</span>

<span>this is my first time having a asus laptop and it is just excellent! The multicolor backlit keyboards are beautiful and the computer is looks and feel very sturdy. The features  are very convenient; i can see my phone notifications, transfer calls from my phone to my laptop, and drag tabs to my phone with myasus and xglide. it has three modes: silent, performance, and turbo which I find very useful for different task. However, I gave it a 4 star because the battery life isn't as long as they describe and also one of the keyboard's keys fell out and I had to reattach but it was minor problem so not that serious.

<span>Well, it really is premature to write a review about a laptop on the day it was received but I was loving how it felt in my hands that I just had to say a few things about it.<br/><br/>It is by far the best, fastest laptop or pc I have ever owned. I was so impressed with how fast programs seemed to download and install. It was pretty amazing to me. Even in comparison to a relatively new and powerful laptop owned by my wife, this was far quicker and snappier.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in finding out that it uses a proprietary charger. I was really hoping it would be a usb c charger. Can't win them all.<br/><br/>I had to settle for a non touch laptop. In order to get the other components, the graphics card and the processor etc, I wasn't able to find a combo with a touchscreen so I had to settle for this. But this is not a negative on this laptop.<br/><br/>Even coming out of the box you could tell it was premium. The packaging was really good and protective. It even came inside a soft cloth bag. First time I've had a laptop come that way.<br/><br/>The screen is sharp and very clear. Obviously, I still need to test it and put it through it's paces to see how beautiful things will look but the few video clips i put up sounded and looked great.<br/><br/>Update: I reduced the rating by 1 star all related to 1 thing. Battery life. I lowered the refresh rate on the screen to 60hz with intent to increase it if and when I game. With settings like this, the laptop seems like it would run for around 5 hours but that's an estimate. And that is not bad. Throw in something that uses the gpu and you get very little. In fact, I was running a golf simulator program called e6 and casting the screen to a 2nd laptop screen. In that mode, this laptop died in about an hour. I shouldn't be surprised though as nobody would game on battery power... Not for a serious gaming session. I still thought I'd get more than 1 hour.<br/><br/>Other than that, the laptop performance is spot on and pretty amazing. Crisp and snappy... Fast. Coming from a 6 yr old unit... This thing feels amazing in comparison. Startup is done in a matter of seconds and away you go...</span>

<span>This is my 2nd Acer product and I've never been more happy. The speeds are amazing, quality is top notch. The laptop can get hot if you don't have proper venting but even with higher temps I've never had issues. Solid laptop, plays any game or program I throw at it.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop to dip my toes in the water for PC gaming and also to use as a personal PC for emails, browsing the web, etc. I used a separate monitor as I wasn't using this as a mobile gaming set-up. The version I got with the i7 and 3060 laptop GPU was great for warzone. I was able to run well above standard graphics on Warzone at about 100FPS. I never had any issues with overheating, although I did buy a cheap "fan deck" to put the laptop on. The fan isn't quiet, but that is to be expected with any gaming laptop, especially when under stress. I have since bought a full gaming desktop as I realized I did want to fully make the jump from console to PC but I gave this laptop to my wife who plays the Sims and Age of Empires and she has seen HUGE performance boosts compared to her older Asus Nitro 5. Her games run much smoother on this laptop. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get into pc gaming or someone that is looking for a multi-use portable PC. Be sure to check the specs and reviews for the specific model you're buying as Amazon shows reviews for similar pcs with different internal specs.</span>

<span>This is the second time I bought a Helios 300. The previous one is the 2018 version, compared to these two not only it remain a cheap price, but also it gets much more well-designed. For example, its size is smaller, making it easier to carry, and I can add one more PCIe SSD.  Looking forward maybe 2 or 3 years later Acer would make a laptop with this much upgrade!</span>

<span>I acquired this machine after having a Toshiba S55T-C5165 for almost 7 years. Unfortunately my Toshiba suffered a processor damage which could no longer be fixed.<br/><br/>This MSI is by far a better option than the other brands that exist in the market.<br/>It is super fast, fluid in the processes that I carry out that are related to my profession such as electrical engineering, I have no problems running simulators, computer-aided drawing programs such as autocad, solidworks, among others.<br/><br/>In addition, all the complementary software programs such as the Dragon Center are an excellent alternative to have control of the cooling of the machine by accessing the revolutions of the fans.<br/><br/>The battery life is 7-8 hours with a heavy workload and with all the brightness and definition of the screen it is astonishing.<br/><br/>The only problem I found is that in the Dragon Center when the automatic fan selection is left set, the laptop turns off with some games, just at the moment the third fan is turned on, however this does not happen with simulators. that I use for my work.<br/><br/>To solve this problem with the games I have chosen to create a custom ventilation mode and with this I solved it.<br/><br/>Apart from that, in this month of use I have not had any additional problems.</span>

It stays connected, but throughput is slow compared to other devices in the same spot connected to the same router.<br/><br/>Fans can be noisy, but you can choose a battery saver mode which will limit cpu speed and give you zero fan noise. This is enough for light work like browsing and youtube. You can easily switch back to normal mode and full speed.<br/><br/>Hinges look fragile. They did not break but you should be extra careful with opening and closing the lid.<br/><br/>Always connected to ac, so no opinion about battery.<br/><br/>There is space for an extra nvme ssd, if you want to add one.<br/><br/>Includes a mux switch to connect the nvidia gpu directly to the lcd, accessed through the msi control panel.<br/><br/>I hope this review is helpful for people considering this laptop.<br/><br/>Overall 5 stars.</span>

<span>It is fast which I hate waiting for programs or rebooting. My biggest and most annoying complaint is the display. Maybe its just that Windows 11 display adjustments are lacking. Some documents with certain programs don't display to where they are properly functional. If I needed this for a significant period of time per day it would be sent back. I have nearly 3 weeks to decide if I'm returning. This display may be Windows 11 and other incompatibility problems of other programs. I won't hold my breath.</span>

<span>This is my first time to purchase a gaming laptop, so far I’m not a serious gamer but sometime play ETS2 by my 2017 PC.<br/>After serval days of watching reviews in different brands or different model of ASUS. Finally I decided to get 3070Ti version rather than 3060 or TUF series.<br/><br/>Design: No objection on the Ports and RGB position, they are friendly and eyeballs attractive. Keystone, hi-tech design to lock or recover. Never though it happened in a computer.<br/>Performance: Excellent, even this is “noisy” cooling FAN during “turbo” mode, that is acceptable and reasonable. Moreover, this is just feeling warm on the keyboard, NOT hot. The display is also surprising to me, I don’t think this is FHD when watching Netflix or Disney+, this output like 2K. The 300Hz/3ms is great, my games is “running smoothly with clear image”.<br/>Setting / Changing: Easy and Fast response among different performance modes. Hot keys presented individually but not just the normal speaker volume, monitor brightness, they are GAMING setting.<br/><br/>Room of improvement:<br/>Armoury crate: better if adding more description of the function or to align status, some using on/off but some is option.<br/>Loudness of speaker: these 4 speakers are<br/>no significantly giving Dolby Atmos.<br/>Power cord: better if providing multi adapter for different countries, like UK or Japan style.<br/><br/>I didn’t read any instruction before enjoying my ASUS, just tested / tried what I can find from it, the overall is easily to be understood and to personalise your needs.<br/>IMO, this is best CP ratio of a performance Laptop with users-in design. Also, you can receive a warranty extension from ASUS for the review.<br/>No regret at all. Will recommend someone who is looking for a performance or gaming laptop.</span>

<span>This laptop gets hot quick when gaming, even after I bought a cooling pad, even had to get a new keyboard because playing on a hot keyboard got old quick, wish it had more fans and wish the fans were more powerful, other than that tho this laptop is pretty good, would recommend upgrading ram for it, slapped in some 32 gbs for this thing and works great now, good purchase over all</span>

<span>This laptop is amazing. I've had it for only a week since writing this, but I am not disappointed. Getting 16gb of ram for well optimized games should suffice, but it would be better to aim for 32/64gb. I ended up upgrading to 32gb and am very happy.<br/><br/>With laptops typically I am concerned when they start to heat up, but this one no matter how intensive my gaming has gotten, it stays at the same temperature range. Will update if any changes.<br/><br/>Update 9/27/22: So in terms of performance I still have no issues with this laptop, but I randomly experience screen glitches that render the laptop unusable unless restarted. I can't pinpoint the cause of the problem unfortunately.<br/><br/>Update 10/1/2022: The error keeps getting worse and is usually when it's been gaming which leads me to think that it could be the graphics card?</span>
