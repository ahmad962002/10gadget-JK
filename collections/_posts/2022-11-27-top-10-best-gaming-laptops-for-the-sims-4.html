<span>I don’t play games on this computer. I just use this for school and work purposes. The laptop came undamaged. It works. It came with Microsoft (Microsoft Office, PowerPoint, Excel, and many others). I couldn’t ask for more,  but I know that I’ll have to buy an anti-malware to prevent my laptop getting messed up after a year.</span>

<span>I am happy with my purchase of this hp laptop. With the Amazon Prime subscription, I paid $169.00 altogether. This price includes taxes. The reason why I purchased the laptop is for college. My 2011 laptop runs on Windows 7, and I needed a back-up computer for classes and binge-watching Netflix. For any student I would recommend obtaining the free Windows 365 subscription and signing on later with your school email. I received a prompt to add a credit card at the beginning for the 1-month subscription to 365 with the setup tutorial. If someone were to skip this there are alternatives for adding a credit card. It is possible to download the 2016 Word addition for free as well.<br/>I enjoyed the voice activated tutorial at the beginning; I was able to set up my Wi-Fi password quickly. Also, I downloaded Google Chrome as well. The sync properties on Chrome allowed me to sync my favorites and history from my 2011 laptop. The laptop is so fast; it takes seconds to load the homepages and Word documents. Just for fun I purchased a very cheap, 20-inch television from the thrift store and hooked the hp laptop up via the HD HDMI cord slot. Now there are two screens. This is helpful for writing papers and binge-watching Netflix. So far, the laptop works great, and I would recommend this product for anyone.</span>

<span>So I got my new computer, opened it up.  No I don't want Cortana, no I don't want you to track me, turn everything off.  Throw Chrome and Avast on the system and try it out.<br/><br/>Everything was unresponsive.  Open Reddit, google Docs and Youtube studio to work on a video... it's taking multiple minutes.  What's going on?<br/><br/>Turns out this computer strurgles to do almost anything.  With Chrome open with a single tab (Youtube studio).  The processor is maxed. Memory is at 80+ percent, and it's not just chrome.  Windows is choking the system with it's Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry, and then Microsoft Search Index...  (Which has been disabled in the image, and still problems)<br/><br/>"But this must be a problem with Windows, it's not the computer's fault."  I'd agree with that if I installed a custom Windows.  This is the Windows 10 this system has right out of the box.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is probably too low for windows.  The processor here barely keeps up and the system can't run the operating system it ships with.  It's a cheap computer but that's not an excuse, for an extra 30 bucks I could get a solid laptop from woot, or Amazon.  This one is not worth anyone's time.<br/><br/>I wanted a computer where I would open Google Chrome, open google docs and type out scripts for videos I'm making, or record notes.  It's unable to do that, which should be the simpliest of tasks, which makes this an awful purchase.  Returned.</span>

<span>I'm not a fan of Windows at all, however I decided to leave it as dual boot with Linux. As is usually the case with laptops, battery life is much better in Windows than it is in Linux. That is an inherent issue with Linux and not a detriment to the laptop itself.<br/><br/>Running Arch Linux, all of the hardware was found automatically. The only issue is not being able to cycle through the different modes of keyboard lighting. It's fine because I usually leave that turned off anyway. I could probably find a way to get it to work, but I don't really care to.<br/><br/>The fans are quiet, the keyboard feels positive and comfortable, the display is very good. I have no complaints.</span>

<span>I admit that I comparison shopped a lot of various laptops in various pricing categories.  I admit I am not a heavy "gamer" but from time to time I enjoy playing Gears of War or Halo and sometimes simpler things like Risk.  My libraries are, for the most part, all on Xbox Game Pass and on Steam and thus far this laptop is doing great.  Seems to manage temps well, plays the games smooth and for having a 10th gen processor and the GTX 1650 on board, its handling what I need it to without breaking the bank.  I am very glad I decided to go with this laptop!<br/><br/>I will say that almost immediately I upgraded the RAM from 8gb to 16gb, put in a second 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD card and installed a 1TB internal hard drive (thanks to a couple laptops we had laying around to donate parts!) and its ready to go.<br/><br/>If you are on the fence and are a moderate gaming user like me, don't be afraid to pick this one up!</span>

<span>I got this product on sale for $599, and it is more than worth the price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Battery life is fairly decent. The only time the battery would burn itself was when I was using additional monitors and graphic intense activities at the same time. Even when the battery may be low, the charge speed is very powerful, and you should have full charge in an hour even if your using the laptop.<br/>-Processor is a beast. i5 10300H has the firepower to run some games that normally require high specs. Dark Souls III runs very smoothly on normal settings, haven't been able to test Elden Ring yet. (This may require more ram.) I'm also able to hook up a monitor, among other peripherals, as well as have other things open, like Discord, without a problem.<br/>-Screen. With 144hz (or 144 visible frames per sec.), you don't need additional monitors to see just how good your games are running.<br/>-RGB Keyboard. Can change how the lights appears, as well as their intensity, or turn them off if you don't need them.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-RAM. With only 8gbs of RAM, you may yourself upgrading to something more using the extra empty RAM slot. Luckily, this laptop is designed to be easily upgraded with a poppable bottom. All you need are screwdrivers that fit and a RAM cartridge of your choice.<br/>-Storage. Again, with only 512gb of space, you may find yourself upgrading using the empty extra M.2 SSD spot. One thing to keep in mind is that this laptop will only support up to Gen 3, so make sure to save some money and not but a Gen 4 SSD, as you will not get the full power out of it.<br/>-Graphics Card. The GTX 1650 isn't exactly the best graphics card out there, but it gets by for meeting recommended settings on older games, while meeting minimum requirements for newer more graphic intense games.</span>

I stand by my review, i feel the laptop is good for casual gaming, but i ended up wanting to PC game full time, and this wasn't going to cut the mustard.<br/><br/>This is my first gaming PC, and overall its good.<br/>For the price, i think its a great snag, BUT if you plan on using this PC as your main gaming station, or plan on playing every game out there, id buy something else.<br/><br/>This PC has run every game ive thrown at it, but it runs noticeably worse when running newer games, or higher demanding games.<br/>You wont be getting 144 frames on majority of games without dropping every graphics setting to low, and even after that you most likely will not get 144 frames.<br/>Max i was able to get for Insurgency Sandstorm was 80ish, Ready or not 80ish,  Death Stranding 60, Madden 23 60, Apex Legends 120s, GTA 4 60s. I had to run these games on low settings to get these frames, and it wasn't steady. I was dropping down to the 20-30 ALOT when playing Insurgency and Ready or Not. Even GTA4 was pretty janky while driving and shooting.<br/>I got max Frames in Valorant, Counter Strike GO, and all older games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, Left4Dead 2 i was able to play on ultra graphics.<br/><br/>Graphics card is meh. I can easily notice the graphics dropoff when playing Apex and Madden on here, then hopping on Series X and playing them, its a steep drop off. The issue is you cant play a majority of games on medium or high settings, which also hurts the graphics big time.<br/><br/>The screen is excellent. Its anti glare, and very clear. I ended up buying a second monitor to game on, just because 15inches is too small after years of gaming on a 50inch TV, BUT i could have gotten away with gaming on this screen.<br/><br/>Battery is pretty bad, but i usually always have it plugged in. Just web browsing at 50% brightness youre getting 2 hours battery life.<br/><br/>I see some reviews claiming that the Wifi adapter is bad, i havent experienced this. I game upstairs on wifi, my router is downstairs, and i usually get 25 ping in online games, which is pretty great. I also got 150ish download on steam. Ive never gotten buffering when watching a video, or live stream(I watched the Bills vs Rams game last night on this without any buffering).<br/><br/>I highly recommend upgrading the ram if you do end up buying, the max this PC can use is 24 RAM, so i installed the Crucial RAM 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22, very easy install.<br/><br/>Speeds for the PC are very fast. From web browsing, to gaming, to tab switching, everything is very fast, even faster than my Macbook 2020.<br/><br/>Overall its a solid gaming laptop, just go in knowing the limitations going in. Id recommend for casual /light gamers.</span>

<span>This is a great computer for the price and I am very happy to have it. I have bought earlier versions a couple times and I like it, but there are some keyboard layout issues you might want to consider. This is not my main text editing computer but when I use it for that, it is a bit of a trial that the up and down buttons are so small and that in NumLock mode which I prefer, the four main movement keys are unaccessible: Home, End, PgUp, and PgDown. Also, the keyboard light times out pretty fast and the onky option to fix it is to go into the bios and turn off the keyboard light timeout – which is not hard but may be daunting for many users. Here's my quick tutorial: 1) Restart computer, 2) when screen goes blank start spamming F2 button including during Acer logo screen and the bios interface will load, 3) use right arrow to get to next page pf bios and look for "Keyboard light timeout" which will be set to "Enabled", 4) use down arrow to highlight that line and F6 to change it, then F10 to save and exit and confirm with "Enter" key. Not hard but be careful not to change anything else while you are in there.</span>

<span>This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.<br/><br/>Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.<br/><br/>The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.<br/><br/>The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.<br/><br/>This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.<br/><br/>Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.<br/><br/>Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.<br/><br/>Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.<br/><br/>The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.<br/><br/>I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.<br/><br/>The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.<br/><br/>This boots in about 15 seconds.<br/><br/>It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.<br/><br/>This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.<br/><br/>I can't sing the praises of this enough.<br/><br/>Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.<br/><br/>Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.<br/><br/>This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.</span>

<span>This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several "premium" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.<br/><br/>With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly "hot". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.<br/><br/>I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.<br/><br/>This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.<br/><br/>The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.<br/><br/>It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.<br/><br/>For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.<br/><br/>As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the "lite" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.<br/><br/>Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.<br/><br/>I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.</span>

<span>First of all; there is not touchscreen! If your used to one, its tough to go backwards. The laptop is fine, I'm a real estate agent and it is fast enough and gets the job done for the price I'm happy. However, after 5 months the touchpad mouse doesn't work at all. I plugged in a wireless mouse but that can be a pain when you're on the go.</span>

<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span>This was the first gaming computer I ever bought, so I had no idea that the plugs were different from regular computers. When I first plugged it in and tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I thought I got a bum computer! I called the number on the package and was told that gaming computers have different plugs than standard computers, and that I had to push the plug into the back of the computer all the way until I heard a click. I thought I had, but when I pushed on it again I heard the click and it started right up.<br/><br/>Onto the computer itself... the graphics are great, the speed has worked well for all the games used so far (Minecraft, Bloons TD6, etc.), the picture is vivid, and I have no complaints so far!</span>

<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>I needed a laptop with a decent battery life, and room for upgrade. Mostly for office work and media consumption. Web surfing needed, strong wifi, I wanted S mode for security. I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things. I recommend this laptop for the things I've mentioned and the low price. The laptop I bought has the following specs.<br/>Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop was delivered in two days.

<span>I bought this laptop just to have something "mobile" when I want to get online or do some "light work" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)<br/><br/>I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.<br/><br/>The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GB<br/><br/>It does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.<br/><br/>It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothly<br/><br/>It came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).<br/><br/>It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!<br/><br/>I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!</span>

<span>While I don’t love that the microphone stopped working 3 months in, I am impressed with the repair process. I had to mail it back to Acer, which was a $40 pain in the butt, but I received notification as soon as they got. Even more impressive, I was notified a few hours later that it was repaired and on its way back! I’m hoping there won’t be any additional issues that require another update to the review. For now I’ve revised my rating from 1 star to 4. (Having to use my old laptop for a week or so made me appreciate this one even more!<br/>****<br/>really want to love this laptop, and other than this one *critical* issue, I do. I tutor online, and it's not great for business when I start a lesson and my student can't hear me. This has happened several times, and troubleshooting has been zero help. It happened again tonight, and I wasted 30-45 minutes of my student's time trying to fix it, then ultimately waiting for my old laptop to update so I could switch to it. I went to the Acer site, but it doesn't recognize my serial number OR my model number, so what's up with that, Amazon? I've had this computer for less than 5 months, but I don't seem to have any recourse.<br/>I guess I should have bought the extended warranty, but I've had refurbs work without issues for years, so I didn't see this coming. I thought Acer's reputation was protection enough, but...no.<br/>Back to HP or Dell for this consumer.<br/><br/>**Update: I spent roughly 3 hours chatting with Acer technical support person yesterday, and they made the problem worse. The tech gave me step by step instructions that included uninstalling the Realtek audio drivers. The goal was to then reinstall them, but instead of it getting to that step, the installer repeatedly uninstalled them, and produced an error message that prevented us from reinstalling. For some reason, he then asked me to check and see if the issue was resolved. Well guess what? With my audio drivers now removed there was NO microphone driver, and now I’ve lost speaker functionality as well. The “solution”? Mail it back to them on my dime for repair. I’m now stuck using my older, much slower computer for my lessons, and it’s not going well.<br/>Acer may have a superior processor, their subpar customer/technical support makes that great processor completely useless to me. Never again, Acer. 😡</span>

<span>There’s nothing fancy about this thing. I bought it to supplement my Mac products for work compatibility when needed. I don’t really use it to run apps or thirsty programming. It does Microsoft office, saves files, talks to the cloud, and connects to the web with wifi. It does everything I need and nothing I don’t. For the price, I’m happy, and if it’s stolen or breaks, I won’t lose sleep.</span>

<span>it would be a decent computer but the glare is crazy bad. i’ve never had a laptop where this was such a big issue but it’s like there isn’t a correct viewing angle. everything i’d either shadowed or too bright and unsaturated. in retrospect i would pay more than $50 for this.</span>

<span>I know its super cheap, but the viewing angles on the laptop make it borderline unusable. Looks like a holographic trading card opening and closing the thing.</span>

<span>I got this as a tablet replacement. I like having one hinged device with a keyboard, rather than a tablet plus keyboard packaged into a cover. And I didn't want to pay for a Microsoft Surface. I purchased a renewed unit so it was very cheap. It does everything I need it to do. I can install apps on it like on an Android tablet, and I run everything off of Google Drive and Google Docs. I switch to my Windows laptop if I need to do any intense editing of documents, then I put them on Drive, and I can view the docs on this device.</span>
