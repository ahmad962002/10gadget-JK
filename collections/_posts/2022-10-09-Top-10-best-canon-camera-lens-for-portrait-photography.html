There are many great Canon camera lenses for portrait photography, but the 85mm f/1.8 lens is by far the best. This lens is perfect for portrait photography because it is fast and has a wide aperture, which allows you to create beautiful background blur. The 85mm focal length is also ideal for portraits, because it allows you to get close to your subject while still maintaining a flattering perspective.<table>

Product Description   The wide f/1.8 aperture lets in more than 8x the amount of light compared to the standard zoom lens that is provided with your EOS. This results in sharper images with less motion blur and reduced need to use flash in dimly lit conditions so you can easily capture the atmosphere of a low light environment. The 50mm focal length allows you to fill the frame with your subject from a comfortable distance making it a great lens for portraits. A similar perspective to the human eye and its compact size make the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM a great everyday lens to always carry with your EOS camera. The near-silent STM (Stepping Motor) technology focuses extremely quickly when shooting photos, so you can react suddenly to capture fleeting moments. Creating high quality movies is easier with STM as it delivers steady and quiet continuous focusing, so your movies are smooth, and soundtracks only capture the surrounding sounds and not the noise of a focusing motor. The EF 50mm f/1.8 STM replaces the popular EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens which was affectionately known for giving outstanding picture quality at an affordable price. This latest version gives the same stunning photo quality but with a fast, near-silent focus motor and a more robust build that belies its price.   From the Manufacturer     EF 50mm f/1.8 STMCompact and lightweight—an outstanding walk-around lens Canon's EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is a great entry into the world of EOS prime lenses. With an 80mm effective focal-length on APS-C cameras, 50mm on full-frame cameras, it's an excellent prime lens for portraits, action, even nighttime photography. Its bright maximum aperture of f/1.8 helps it not only to excel in low light, but also to capture gorgeous, sharp images and movies with beautiful background blur thanks to its circular 7-blade design. An updated lens arrangement with new lens coatings helps render images with excellent color balance, plus minimized ghosting and flare. Performance is brilliant, with a stepping motor (gear-type STM) to deliver near silent, continuous Movie Servo AF for movies plus speedy, smooth AF for stills. A redesigned exterior with improved focus ring placement makes manual focus adjustments a breeze. Canon's most compact 50mm lens, the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM has a rugged metal mount, plus an improved minimum focusing distance of 1.15 ft. (0.35m) and a maximum magnification of 0.21x. Offering sharp performance for the best in movies and stills, it's a fixed focal length gem—the perfect lens for photographers and moviemakers to expand the creative possibilities with their EOS cameras.

<span>Ah, the “nifty fifty”!  This is without question the best-selling lens from Canon, maybe even of all lenses.  Its high price to performance ratio is the reason for this.  It can be useful on both crop and full frame, and should probably be every beginners first upgrade lens, which I will discuss more in the review.  As with all WOFG reviews, I will cover the pros and cons, offer advice for how to use the lens, and give some suggestions at the end.<br/><br/>Let’s pro/con this thing!<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1. Price – Right at the top of the list is the price, typically 125 USD, though sometimes it can be had new for as little as 100.  There are few lenses in this price range that can perform at the level this lens can.  Most come with large compromises; lack of or poor auto focus, increased aberrations or fringing, soft when wide open, terrible build quality, etc.  The Canon F1.8 STM has minimal compromises.  This is not to say there aren’t better lenses, just none in this price class.  The closest is probably the Yongnuo 50mm F1.8, which is a cheaper lens (about 50 USD).  Realistically though, the Canon outperforms it by enough to be worth the additional 50 dollars or so that it cost.  AF performance alone makes it a better choice; the Yongnuo is spotty at best for AF.<br/>2. Image quality –Sharp lens, even when wide open it stays fairly sharp (wide open meaning when shooting at F1.8).  Colors and contrast look good.  If you are using an APS-C/crop camera like one of the Rebel series, you will see a clear difference in image quality with this lens over the 18-55mm lens that likely came with your camera.  Full frame users, I personally feel like the F1.8 is a more practical option than the 50mm F1.4 USM, which I will breakdown later in the review as to why.  The very good IQ combined with the low price is the reason I suggest this lens more than any other lens as the first upgrade to your camera.  I cannot stress enough the value this lens has for either crop users or full frame users.  Possibly the best value in all of photography.<br/>3. STM focus for video – If you are not familiar with the Canon STM focus, it is a silent focusing system made for video.  It is also good for still photos as well, but depending on what you are doing it might be a little slow (see cons).  In any case, when I put it to the test on an 80D and a 5DmkIV, it was very quiet in video; no sound could be heard as the lens focused.  Note – Not all Canon cameras support the silent focus feature of STM.  Any model older than the T4i does not support it.  Also, the base models do not support it, even the latest versions (T5, T6, T7, or older).  The lens can still use AF; it just might not be silent.  One other note, STM requires power to be supplied to focus, even in manual.  So keep that in mind if you plan to use accessories like extension tubes or other adaptors.  Not all of them supply power to the lens.<br/>4. Great focal length – On a full frame camera 50mm is what you might call the most “classic” of focal lengths.  Very useful for general photography as well as portraits that have a bit of context to them (meaning more of the surroundings are in the photo).  It is also the most popular focal length for street photography (though I admit I don’t really get into that).  On an APS-C camera it takes on a more specific role.  The crop factor narrows this to 80mm equivalent focal length, which is just about perfect for portraits that have that classic “isolated” look.  Think in terms of 8x10 portraits on the wall, or even senior portraits.  Combined with the F1.8 aperture I would say it is the best choice for portraits on any APS-C camera for shooters on a budget.  It will make similar photos on a crop camera as an 85mm will do on a full frame.  A note on 85mm lenses – you have probably heard that 85mm is the best portrait lens.  This however considers that you are using a full frame camera, where it is one of the most popular choices for portrait work.  On a crop camera the 85mm lens is not as ideal for this purpose.  One of two things will happen.  You will have to frame everything too tightly (mostly headshots and bust ups), or you will have to move further away to correctly frame your subject.  The added distance from you to your subject robs the 85mm of all the things that make it special for portraits when used on a crop (background blur).  It isn’t just about being able to shoot at 85mm, it’s being able to do it from the distance it takes to frame a classic portrait, while shooting with a wide aperture to gain the background blur that it creates from that distance, while still having enough depth to keep the main subject in sharp focus.  Moving further away decreases your compression and also loses detail.  For the classic look you want to be close, and the 50mm gives you that on a crop sensor camera so much more than an 85mm will.  This is why I recommend the 50mm focal length for portraits if you have a crop sensor/APS-C camera.  It is much more about the distance to your subject with portraits, and knowing the length that works best for that based on your sensor size will take you quite far.<br/>5. Fast aperture – For those that have only used the lens that came with your camera, this right here is the main reason I think you should get this lens (other than price).  The F1.8 aperture is pretty fast for a lens, offering not only a significant increase in light throughput but also will create the coveted bokeh effect for portraits as described previously.  If you’ve not experienced what a wide aperture can do, this is one of the least expensive ways to do it, and fortunately it’s also a good one!<br/>6. Compatible with all EOS cameras – I am adding this here mostly for people’s info, since I frequently see people asking about “will this fit on my camera?”  This lens is EF, so that means that it will work on all of Canon’s EOS cameras.  That is the full frame models; 1D, 5D, and 6D.  The crop sensor/APS-C models; all the Rebels, the mid-range models from the 10D to the 80D, and the 7D.  It is also able to be used on the mirrorless cameras as long as you have the adaptor for EF lenses.  It will even work on older film EOS cameras, going back to the very first ones released in 1987!<br/>7. Good minimum focus distance – At just over a foot, this lens can be pretty close to a subject and still focus.  I find that on crop sensor cameras that makes it pretty good for close up work.  Not as good as a true macro or even the EF-S 24mm F2.8 STM, but still pretty good.  Add an extension tube and you have a budget macro setup! (I suggest Kenko Extension Tubes)<br/>8. Other stuff – 49mm filter thread means cheap filters if you are into that.  Not a common size, so it might be better to use a step down ring with a larger filter.  Metal lens mount.  Full time manual focus override (you have to “wake” the camera by half pressing the shutter button before turning the focus ring).  Overall improved over the older model, the EF 50mm F1.8 II (see comparison later).  Very lightweight, especially when compared to other fast 50mm primes.<br/><br/>Cons.  Most of this is for your information and is not worth the removal of a star.  I will say why if I remove a star for any reason.  Otherwise it is up to the user to know what they are getting and how to use it.<br/>1. Not ideal wide open (F1.8) – Even though it is better wide open than the older F1.4 model, it still suffers from a slight loss in clarity when shooting at F1.8.  Not a big deal since most shots will need stopped down a little to increase depth of field anyway (meaning shooting at a narrower aperture).  I shoot at F2-F2.8 a lot for portraits, and appreciate the increase in sharpness without losing too much exposure or background blur.  I think this is more noticeable on a full frame camera than a crop, since it’s around the outer edges where it is the worse (A crop camera doesn’t really see the outer edges of this lens).  The center sharpness is still pretty good at F1.8.  I didn’t notice any serious chromatic aberration issues either, but then I don’t use the lens in strong backlight scenarios where those problems become the most pronounced.  I haven’t heard from others that it is a problem, whereas on the F1.4 model it is. (See comparison for more info)<br/>2. A bit soft in the corners – As to be expected on a lens like this, it loses clarity around the outer edges of the frame.  This is most noticeable at F1.8, and is more pronounced on a full frame camera than it is on a crop camera.  Once you stop down to even F2 you see an improvement, though it really never becomes as sharp on the edges as it is in the center at wider apertures.  I don’t see this as a deal breaker though.  This would be the biggest difference in image quality when comparing it to lenses like the EF 50mm F1.2, or the Sigma 50mm F1.4, both lenses known for their high level of optical performance.  But those lenses are significantly more expensive.  The Sigma is 950 USD, and the Canon is 1400!  You get the “nifty 50” because the compromises vs price are just worth it, at least until you know if you want to invest more into a higher quality lens.<br/>3. Focus by Wire – Since this is an STM lens, there is no mechanical connection to the focusing gears.  What this means is that as you turn the focus ring, instead of that tuning the focus, the camera is sent an electronic signal to tune it instead; it’s not as precise as mechanical focus.  I don’t use manual focus on this lens so for me it’s not that big a deal.  If you do a lot of manual focus, you might prefer the F1.4 model.  Again, focus by wire doesn’t bother me, but I do not know even one photographer that prefers it over mechanical.<br/>4. No IS – Does not feature image stabilization.  This is really only an issue when you want to shoot at shutter speeds slower than 1/50 sec (1/80 on crop).  Since this lens has such a fast aperture there are not a lot of times that is going to be an issue.  It makes it less ideal for vlogging though, but the focal length already makes it not ideal for that (vlogging is done from wider angles than this).  For me this really didn’t matter since there was no scenario where I would be using this lens that having IS would be a benefit.  But if someone wants a 50mm lens with IS, then this isn’t it.  Canon doesn’t make one, and I don’t know of any third party 50mm lenses that have it either.  Even so, adding IS tends to cause a slight loss in overall sharpness due to the floating element that performs the stabilizing, a definite increase in price, and probably a loss in overall max aperture.  So I don’t think I would even want it on a lens like this, since the price, fast aperture, and IQ are the main reasons I am suggesting it.<br/>5. Other stuff - No hood is included; I suggest Promaster for hoods (cheaper than Canon and work just as well).  For the price of the lens I really didn’t expect a hood.  Hood is reversible but covers the entire outside of the lens, making it a bit larger in diameter.  Mostly plastic design with a metal mount.  Not fragile by any means, the casing still feels solid.  No weather or dust sealing.  STM focus isn’t as quick as USM, so it’s not really ideal for sports, but not impossible either (shoot in continuous focus mode for sports).<br/>I really don’t have anything negative to say about this lens that isn’t also washed by its price.  Just a great value for the performance you get from it.<br/><br/>Conclusions<br/>What a great little lens!  It’s so good no matter what kind of Canon you have.  I have used it on anything from the entry level SL2 to the professional 5DmkIV.  Always gives me good images.  Sometimes I switch between the Canon F1.8 and the Sigma 50mm F1.4, and there are times when I am going through the photos and I have to check which lens took what shot.  It compares pretty well.  In the end the Sigma outperforms it in overall image quality, but as I said before that lens is very expensive.  I am a pretty serious shooter these days, and sometimes I even get paid for my work.  So I can justify the more expensive Sigma lens.  But I cut my teeth on the Canon F1.8 to get to that point.  If you are someone that is looking to get more serious, or even just wants to improve over the quality of your kit lens, the 50mm F1.8 is probably the best way to go without having to break your budget.  Anyone could afford it, and you will see an immediate improvement in image quality.  Just know how to use it to its best purpose on your camera as described earlier in the review.  I see no reason someone couldn’t use this lens to eventually move into higher levels of shooting, or just keep using it if it does all you need.<br/><br/>Compared to the Canon EF 50mm F1.8 II – You may have seen this lens around for about the same price as the STM model.  I really don’t suggest this lens.  It’s the previous version of the “nifty 50” and is outclassed by the STM model in all ways.  If you already have it then it probably works well enough.  For about the same price I would take the STM model every time.  I won’t even bother with a breakdown since the older model has no advantage over the new one; the STM model is the clear choice.  Even if you can get the F1.8 II cheaper, the STM model is so inexpensive that I can’t see it being worth saving a few bucks.  This is also why I don’t recommend the Yongnuo 50mm F1.8.  You can get it as cheap as 45 USD, but you really get what you pay for.  If it’s all you can afford then I would think you can make it work, but 100 USD probably isn’t out of reach for anyone that has already spent 400 or more dollars on a camera.<br/><br/>Compared to the Canon EF 50mm F1.4 – This is the real battle here.  The F1.4 model is a lens people also like, since it is fairly inexpensive for its class (about 300 USD).  Side by side, it does have the advantage of the F1.4 aperture, which is 2/3rds stops more than the F1.8 (theoretically 66% more light, though reality is probably more like 33%).  What this does is lets you shoot at faster shutter speeds or lower ISO, and also gives a shallower depth of field (DOF), but there are some compromises here.  For one, the F1.4 has known soft focus and chromatic aberrations when shot wide open.  To avoid these issues, you have to stop down to about F2-F2.8.  So really, you don’t get more from the F1.4, since the F1.8 STM is still fairly sharp wide open and without aberrations, and is technically sharper at F2-F2.8 than the F1.4 lens (in testing that is, in the real world there is no obvious difference).  For the difference in price, I just don’t see the “advantage” of F1.4 being enough to be worth almost 200 USD in additional cost.  However, some people actually like the soft focus look of the F1.4 model, which is something you can’t get from the F1.8 STM without using some kind of software, filter, or other method (I’ve seen chapstick used on a UV filter to do this, LOL).  So if you want that, then the 50m F1.4 isn’t a bad choice and is also fairly inexpensive.  If you are just looking to add a better lens to your kit for a low cost, then there is no practical advantage the F1.4 has over the F1.8 for the money.  I don’t think there is any situation where the additional light or shallow DOF will make a mind blowing difference, and for good quality images you will be shooting at about the same settings anyway.  The F1.4 model is just a really old lens (released in 1993), and has never been updated.  The F1.8 is much newer and has more recent engineering and lens coatings that make the 50mm F1.4 almost obsolete.  I can’t think of one time that I suggested it over the STM model.  I do like it more than the 50mm F1.8 II model.  From a practical point of view, the EF 50mm F1.8 STM is Canon’s best budget 50mm lens.  If you already have the 50mm F1.4 then just keep using it, it is also a good lens as long as you know how to make it work.  If you don’t have either, save some money and get the F1.8 STM model instead and put the money into another lens!<br/><br/>Other Suggestions – It wouldn’t be a WOFG review without suggestions!  I’m going to do this a little differently since really there is no other lens I suggest for a 50mm that is in this price class, for crop or full frame.  Instead, I am going to list my “4 lenses to buy first for Canon APS-C/crop cameras”, to help people acquire a more diverse kit of lenses.  The list is only good for crop users though, as the 50mm F1.8 is the only one that can mount to a full frame.  I really don’t have such a list for full frame users, but I do have a couple suggestions for other lenses that might be useful to full frame shooters on a budget.<br/><br/>For crop users - I’m just going to post the whole list, including the 50mm, and the reasons I suggest each lens.<br/>1. EF 50mm F1.8 STM – The lens under review.  Great for portraits on a crop camera.  No other lens with this quality, speed, or sharpness is available at this price.  The review should be pretty clear as to why.<br/>2. EF-S 55-250mm F4-5.6 IS STM – Best telephoto for less than a grand.  Beats the 75-300mm in all categories except overall reach.  Can be bundled with new cameras for about 200 USD, or found used/refurbished/white box “bulk packaging” for about 150.<br/>3. EF-S 10-18mm F4.5-5.6 IS STM – For landscapes, architecture, large equipment, or whatever needs a wide angle.  Good for video too, especially vlogging, not only thanks to the wide angle but also the IS (one of the only wide lenses Canon makes with that feature).<br/>4. EF-S 24mm F2.8 STM – Adds F2.8 to your shooting for a low price (130-150 USD).  This makes it possible to shoot at faster shutter speeds than the kit lens can, making it better for moving subjects.  Nice that it has a wider angle than the 50mm F1.8, so it’s more versatile for framing.<br/>Each of these lenses adds something different to your kit, is highly rated, and is affordable (under 300 per lens).  If you are a beginner and looking to expand what you can do, this setup adds a lot of diversity to your kit.  Always invest in lenses before getting a new camera!  If interested in more info on these lenses, just go to my profile and find my reviews of them.  Simply click on my name and then scroll until you find the review.<br/><br/>For Full Frame<br/>1. EF 40mm F2.8 STM – Not as fast as the 50mm, but a little bit wider angle, and a lot more compact.  Easy to shove into a pocket or purse when you are out and about.  Just a nice lens, for about 150-180 USD.<br/>2. EF 24-105mm F4L IS II USM  – This is actually a pretty expensive lens, but for those that want one lens that can do the work of a couple lenses this is it.  At 105mm you can get pretty good compression, making up for the lack of a wider aperture, so in some ways it can take the place of a portrait lens if you just want to shoot your kids or other family members.  Its 24mm wide angle makes it great for most general shooting.  It’s basically the kit lens for full frame Canon’s.  There are a couple versions, the latest is the best (IS II), but the older model is cheaper and isn’t too bad.  Sigma makes one that is nice and is much sharper than the Canon models, but has sketchy AF.  Probably fine for most users.<br/>I really only list these since I know they are good lenses that people like to use.  I still suggest the 50mm F1.8 to all full frame users.  I keep mine in spite of having much more expensive lenses, so that I can use it at times that I might be afraid to risk my Sigma or my 24-70mm lens, since I could pretty much throw away my 50mm F1.8 and get a new one.  But these other lenses are pretty useful too, and I think someone that can’t really afford a lot of lenses can benefit from them.<br/><br/>That is all I got, all that is left is to check out the images.

<span>BACKGROUND:<br/>Let me start by saying I'm a hobbyist photographer and I've been shooting with a Canon Rebel T1i (500D) for the past 10 years. I was heavily budget-constrained, so I rocked my OG Canon 50mm 1.8 (non-STM) version since 2010. For $150 at the time, it was a fast lens that was affordable to most novice DSLR photographers like myself.<br/><br/>After recently getting back into my hobby after a couple years of being tied up with other stuff, I noticed my 50mm was producing softer images than I remember. It had never been dropped or otherwise abused, but it just seemed to be not performing the way I expected. The autofocus was reasonably quick, but very loud and lacking in smoothness and accuracy.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY:<br/>Now that I had a little more money saved up, I decided to purchase the updated STM version of this lens and this is a MASSIVE leap from the old version. The build quality and finish, while still being mostly plastic, feels way more robust. The cheap shiny finish of the old version was gone in favor of a beefier, textured plastic. Also, the lens mount itself is now made of aluminum which fits very firmly against the camera body.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE:<br/>After testing it out I can say BOY is this thing tack sharp. With my old lens, I had to shoot at F/2.8 if I wanted anything with usable sharpness. This lens is producing razor sharp images wide-open and the autofocus is extremely quiet, smooth and accurate. It is still audible but you really have to listen for it. As far as speed goes, it doesn't seem much quicker than the old 50mm, but is way more accurate and reliable. The quiet STM focusing makes this usable for video, whereas the old version simply wasn't<br/><br/>Just keep in mind the manual focus still uses an internal motor to move the lens elements. With the camera turned off, turning the focus ring doesn't do anything. Also, on an older camera body like my T1i, turning off the camera wouldn't retract the lens barrel. Now that I've upgraded to a Canon 90D, I noticed turning off the camera will auto-retract the lens barrel all the way, making it suitable to store in a bag without damaging the lens.<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/>If you're getting into DSLR photography and have a reasonably modern Canon DSLR body, this lens is a must-have. For $125 at the time of this review, it's even cheaper than the old lens (especially accounting for inflation), while out-performing it in nearly every metric. Prime lenses are the kings of affordable speed and sharpness, and this lens is right up there with the very best primes you can buy for under $500. If you aren't jumping on the mirrorless camera bandwagon, this is an excellent lens for both full-frame and crop sensor Canon DSLRs.</span>

For anyone with an EOS R series camera, add the RF50mm F1.8 STM lens to that list. As a 50mm lens it’s already compact, but as part of the EOS R System, it’s even more compact due to its compatibility with an EOS R camera body, so there’s every reason to keep it attached or put in your bag so you can shoot – and get a great shot – anywhere and anytime. Size isn’t all though. As a fixed focal length lens, it lets you be creative with composition and can be used for a wide range of scenes, from snapshots to portraits to landscapes and more. Those images will stand out, too, just like you intend whether on social media or just sharing, thanks to impressive optical features like a PMo aspherical lens to suppress aberrations, coatings to reduce flaring and ghosting, and a large f/1.8 aperture for low-light shooting and circular bokeh. Pick it up and use it one time and you’ll see for yourself, and you won’t be able to leave the house without it.

<span>This performs very similarly to the EF 50mm 1.4, maybe better. Native lenses do better on RF cameras, there is no way around that.

<span>I bought this lens a week ago before spending several days hiking and camping on California's Big Sur coast.  I own a Canon 7D and bought this for macro and telephoto purposes, and for the most part I am extremely impressed.  Some of the macro shots that I got were unreal (I'll post some in the next few days).  Amazing sharpness, detail, and beautiful bokeh.  The only lens I've used that comes close is my 24-70 f/2.8L, which has a "macro" setting (but only .29X).  The lens is large, but after using the 24-70L for the last three years as my primary "walk-around" lens, it feels light.  The construction feels very solid, but keep in mind that it's made of hard plastic, not metal.  Probably not as durable as some "L" lenses, but every bit as weather resistant and a lot lighter.  And, now that Amazon has dropped its price (it started at around $1050 in November and is now down to about $884), I can say that its a great buy.  Most "L" lenses cost well over $1000, and I don't begrudge paying a bit more for increased durability, image stabilization, and sharper optics.  If you're not willing to shell out quite this much cash, Canon makes a "non-L" 100mm macro without the IS, and Amazon sells it right now for about $540.  By the way, it looks like Canon is discontinuing that lens (its been recently removed from the Canon USA website), so act fast if you want that model.  Also, the Image Stabilization seems to work well, but I can't comment too much on it because I've only used one other IS lens.  It certainly helps but isn't a 100% cure-all - you will probably still want to use a tripod at times.<br/><br/>The reason for the 4 star rating relates to some trouble I've had focusing on the telephoto end.  I tried using the lens for some star photography and the pictures came out really blurry.  I set the lens to manual focus, turned off the image stabilizer, and turned the focus ring to infinity before doing the time exposure and was pretty disappointed with the results.  I then decided to try and see if the lens would focus on the stars, which (surprisingly) it actually did!  I noticed that the focus ring was slightly before infinity.  So, I tried the time exposure at that setting.  Better, but still blurry.  I know that its not my 7D because I then used my 24-70L and got amazing pictures.  When I returned home yesterday I tested it again, and realized that the lens simply doesn't focus at infinity, but will focus on distant objects a little before the ' mark on the ring.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any information about this?  I'm wondering if I have a defective copy or if there's something about this lens that I don't know (I'd like to figure out if its defective before my 30 day amazon guarantee runs out).  If I can figure this issue out, I'll update this review and change my rating to 5 starts instead of 4.</span>

<span>Well...what can I add that others haven't already stated...For what it's worth I'm going to add my two cents...<br/><br/>Like many of you, I was at the point I want to get some great macro shots of bees and bugs...While I occasionally can get a good shot using either my 24-105mm f/4L or 70-200mm f/4L lenses, the results are disappointing. Similarly, while I can generally get very good bokeh out of the two lenses above...I often wonder getting more.<br/><br/>So I just got my 100mm macro lens Friday and took it for a spin the next day.  Here is what I found so far...<br/><br/>1. Size: This lens is tiny and light. It takes a 67mm filter which is the same size as my 70-200mm f/4L zoom but is of course shorter.  The outside appears to be made of plastic but you can tell it is high quality worthy of an L lens.  The manual focus action is glass smooth as expected.<br/><br/>2. Hood: This lens comes with the ET-73 lens hood which is very long. It practically doubles the length with the hood on.  While both the 100mm macro and the 70-200mm has the same diameter (67mm), the two hoods, while almost identical in looks, are not interchangeable.  The 70-200mm hood fits very loosely on the 100mm.  I was hoping to only carry one hood for both lenses...oh well.<br/><br/>3. Image quality: I keep hearing about how good prime lenses are compared to zoom. They are not kidding. IQ is astoundingly sharp. Color saturation and contrast are much better than my other two lenses and it has less distortion.  I'm still having problem closing my jaw...it dropped and stayed dropped.<br/><br/>4. Bokeh: the bokeh, especially at f/2.8 is so dreamy.  I'm so happy with it. This makes the lens a great portrait lens.<br/><br/>5. Focus: the lens has 3 focus modes: FULL, 0.5mm-Inf., 0.3mm-0.5mm.  I have so far tried only the FULL mode. In this mode, focus speed is slow compared to my two other L lens but very useable.  When I get really close to subjects for extreme closeup...the lens has trouble staying in focus...it keeps drifting off. It would be in perfect focus for about half a second then drifts off.  This is true in manual focus also. It's not a real big deal but I'm not sure if this is normal.  Perhaps I need to switch to 0.3mm-0.5mm.  Like many men, I do not read the manual. I'll report later.<br/><br/>In short, this is a great addition. Shots of bees that were extremely difficult before, I was able to routinely get on the first day.  I highly recommend getting this.</span>

<span> I bought this lens a couple of years ago and it’s probably the lens I use the most for all of my work.<br/><br/>I was hesitant at first to buy this lens because I already had a 50mm and an 85mm<br/><br/>But I took the gamble and I’m glad I did. This lens is super versatile and could handle basically any type of job.<br/><br/>The Pros<br/><br/>Build Quality - this is not a cheap lens and because of it the build is nice and sturdy.<br/>Image Quality - the images that this lens produces are spectacular and you won't be disappointed.<br/>Portrait Monster - This is an amazing portrait lens once you start doing portraits with it you’ll fall in love.<br/>Macro - With this being a Macro lens you could really get close to your subject and get great detail.<br/>Image stabilization - if you’re manually focusing or shooting video you’ll love the image stabilization. I  shoot with a cinema camera that doesn't have any sort of stabilization and when I turn off the image stabilization my videos look like they were taken during an earthquake. It really does make a big difference<br/><br/>The Cons<br/><br/>Because it’s a 100mm prime lens most of the time depending on what you’re shooting you’ll have to step away from your subject especially if you have a cropped sensor.  It takes a little getting used too but to me it's no big deal.<br/>Not very good in tight places - To that point if you’re in a tight place and you need to get a whole subject and you can’t move back then you’ll definitely need to change lenses.<br/><br/>Overall I love this lens. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</span>

<span>This lens delivers very clear photos and videos. It has a very fast auto focus. This lens is all plastic! It's my very first L series lens and I'm extremely disappointed in the build quality. To this point I have always used sigma lenses and those are built like a tank and the image is nearly identical for a fraction of the price!!!

Product Description   The Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens is highly practical and ideal for a range of applications including portraiture. Its fast f/1.8 maximum aperture is effective in low light and ideal for shallow depth of field focus control. An ultrasonic autofocus motor (USM) provides fast, smooth and quiet AF action and because the front lens group does not rotate during focusing, polarizing and special filter effects can be used effectively.   From the Manufacturer   Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Medium Telephoto Lens.

<span>I've owned a few copies of this lens, mostly due to switching between camera systems multiple times.  I've used all of them on the Canon 5D but have not tried them on a crop sensor body.  My take on the pros and cons of the lens is as follows:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ In terms of sharpness/resolution there is little to complain about.  As long as the lens is properly focused, the lens is sharp enough in the center, even at f/1.8.<br/>+ Bokeh/out-of-focus transitions are surprisingly smooth considering this doesn't have any fancy aspherical/ED elements or rounded aperture blades.  Very well-suited for portrait work.<br/>+ Fast autofocus - goes from MFD to infinity (or vice versa) in a fraction of a second.  Also the USM focus motor is fairly quiet, and is the ring-type which is a step above the micromotor AF of the EF 50 f/1.4.  Works for shooting action as well.<br/>+ When stopped down the lens is quite sharp across the frame, which makes this suitable for landscape shots as well if you use this focal length for that.<br/>+ Internal and FTM focusing - no extending/retracting parts when focusing, and it has full-time manual focus so you don't have to switch to MF to use the focus ring.<br/>+ Inexpensive for what it is.  I actually prefer this lens over Nikon's new 85mm f/1.8G, which is significantly more expensive but doesn't have as fast AF and is made in China.  This lens has been around for 20 years so its R&amp;D costs have probably been paid off by now, but it's still excellent for digital.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- I'd read reviews saying this lens has very reliable AF, but my experience has been that several copies I owned required sending to Canon for AF adjustment to correct front/back focus issues.  Once adjusted to match the camera, it is pretty reliable even in low light.  The DOF being as shallow as it is at 85mm and f/1.8, I imagine there are quite a few that will need adjustment to be spot-on.<br/>- Bokeh fringing at wide apertures. If shooting in high contrast scenes (lights or specular highlights), this lens has a strong tendency to show green/purple/magenta outlining on the edges.  Luckily if you have the latest version of Adobe Lightroom, this issue can be corrected with the chromatic aberration tool, but it does take some time.<br/>- Tendency to attract internal dust.  You would think that an internally focusing prime lens would not have many dust problems, but it turns out that the rear element has gaps that allows dust to get in quite easily but not come out.  Dust in this lens is more visible than most because of the large aperture. I would avoid cleaning the rear element unless necessary, and if necessary use a bulb blower or a wet solution like a Pec Pad and Elipse solution.  I would not use a LensPen on the rear because the carbon dust from the pen can easily get into the lens.  The good news is that dust has very little/no impact on the pictures taken, but it will probably affect resale value.<br/><br/>In total, this is not a perfect lens but it is still one of Canon's best values for lenses.  I would consider it Canon's best sub-$500 lens.</span>

<span>I am primarily a wedding photographer, but I do shoot portraiture now and then (especially engagement shoots), and so I have divided my review accordingly into those two categories. If possible, I would have given this a 4.5 star review as for my specific needs this lens is not ideal. In it's own right however, it is a great lens as I will explain below.<br/><br/>GENERAL<br/>In general, this is a great lens. The optical quality is fantastic, it is built like a tank, and any photographer will tell you that the 85mm focal length is definitely the sweet spot for portraits. The bokeh is creamy wide open, and definitely higher quality that the 50mm 1.8 or even the 50mm 1.4. When stopped down a little, the images it produces are quite sharp, have very decent color (if a TINY bit dull in some situations) and I like that it produces such powerful results in a relatively small package.<br/><br/>FOR PORTRAITURE<br/>This is probably the best non-L glass around for portraits, and I would venture to say that in the right hands it can produce L-quality results. As I mentioned, the bokeh alone makes this an incredible choice for your portraits, whether with just one subject or a couple. What I like especially about the 85mm range, is that you have to be pretty far back from your subject for a traditional head-and-shoulders portrait, which I have found makes people feel quite relaxed especially those uncomfortable around a camera. I always use a manual focus point for portraits, focusing in on my subject's eye before snapping the shot. In a relaxed environment such as this, the lens works perfectly and turns out great results...<br/><br/>FOR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY<br/>You might not think it, but Wedding Photography is one of the fastest paced photography categories, barring sports. The need to capture THAT moment in fact defines this profession, and therefore we wedding photographers need our gear to act right, and at the right time. Whether memory cards, DSLR cache or in this case lens focusing systems, it really irks me when I don't get the shot that I wanted. I have found when shooting weddings that this lens is less than ideal. I like to shoot without flash 95% of the time (venue allowing) and so all of my lenses are wide aperture such as this. The problem is, the focusing system on the 85mm is a little slow, so that I frequently noticed images coming out soft to the point of being blurry, as I don't have the time to wait for it to catch up. Initially thinking this might be a calibration problem, both my 1Ds MkII and my 85mm 1.8 went in for testing/calibration at Canon, both coming back with the okay. I tried a friend's copy of the lens, and came back with similar results. There are several forums that discuss this topic, and I found that many photographers found this same caveat with their lenses. When it does focus, it is spot on every time, but when the couple is having their first kiss, often you don't have more than a second or two to get it right.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>If you are looking for a good portrait lens, are a beginner or novice user, you are absolutely going to love this lens. Even some pros will enjoy it in many situations. If you are specifically a wedding photographer, or someone who shoots faster-paced scenes, you might want to look at a different lens. On paper, this lens should work for these uses, but in real life, I have found it to be less than ideal. This lens has earned a permanent spot in my gear bag, and I use it often and with pleasure, it does not however make appearances at weddings unless the bride and groom set aside a couple of hours for bridals, which doesn't happen all that often!<br/><br/>4.5/5</span>

<span>The Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 II USM lens is a moderate weight (15 oz), very well built lens. It does not come with the appropriate hood, the Canon ET-65 III. You get both a lens cap and a mount cap, all packed inside tight conformal foam to protect the lens during shipping. There's also a very brief manual and the usual warranty paperwork.<br/><br/>The lens offers AF and manual focus, and allows manual focus even when AF is set to on, a very useful feature for low-light and other challenging focus situations. This is a USM lens, and as a direct consequence focus is fast and precise, just as you'd expect.<br/><br/>The AF/Manual switch is in a reasonable location, close to the camera body. There is a range indication on the barrel of the lens behind a transparent window which serves to keep dust and debris out of the workings of the lens. Manual focus is controlled with a broad, easy to manage textured ring about mid-body on the lens. During focus, nothing external on the lens body moves or rotates, so there are no complications for using polarizing filters, and no concerns about the lens "pumping" air and so causing dust contamination in either the lens or camera with use.<br/><br/>The lens lacks any form of image stabilization. IS is showing up in more and more lenses, though for the price... perhaps this is one of the justifications for building IS into the camera body. I'm sure that this design wouldn't be anywhere near its current price point with IS added to the build. One last point is that since the lens is a fairly fast design, perhaps there is less overall need for IS (though that argument falls completely apart the first time you *do* need it!)<br/><br/>It takes a 58mm filter, though I highly recommend the use of the ET-65 III hood rather than a filter; filter use should be limited to polarizers, neutral density filters and so on, rather than keeping a filter on the lens with the idea of protecting it. Here's why: filters create a flat surface over the end of the lens that can (and often does) create low-level reflections. These are most apparent in low-light shots, but they are almost always there. In the case of a UV filter, no other benefit is gained (UV can't get through the lens system anyway) other than physical protection. The hood, however, keeps the lens out of harms way quite effectively, and it increases contrast and reduces flare at the same time by preventing light from entering the lens at high angles of attack. I have shot with both hoods and filters, and after decades of experience, I have to come down firmly on the side of hood technique. It only takes one shot ruined by a filter reflection to wake up to this reality; and hoods never, ever compromise an image. They're simply the best way to go. Finally, the hood for this lens is inexpensive, well worth the extra few dollars it costs.<br/><br/>Aperture is controlled by an 8-blade system. The available f-stops range from f/1.8 wide open to f/22.0 fully stopped down. MTF (sharpness) peaks at f/5.6, and vignetting is almost gone by that setting.<br/><br/>On my camera, an EOS 50D, resolution loss from diffraction effects begin at f/7.6, so in many ways, the "sweet spot" for this lens for me lands naturally at f/5.6. On a camera with a lesser sensel density such as the 40D, diffraction doesn't set in until higher f-stops, but you're beginning to lose sharpness from other effects, so I'd still call the sweet spot as f/5.6 (which also provides a fairly extensive depth of field) for shots where detail is the primary consideration.<br/><br/>For portraits, you'll want to go right for f/1.8 if lighting conditions allow in order to take advantage of the shallow and pleasing DOF isolation this lens is famous for; background blur is very soft yet very strong, while the in focus region remains deep enough to keep the important features of the face in focus from ear to nose. The loss of MTF at f/1.8 is noticeable, especially once you get a feel for how the lens performs at f/5.6, but in my opinion, the compromise is perfectly acceptable in a portrait context. There's another benefit as well; at 85mm, and especially on a crop body like the 40D or 50D, this lens allows you to get some distance from your subject which tends to make them more comfortable, while giving you the modest compression that is the hallmark of any telephoto lens. Portraits "pop" and backgrounds blur away with commendable speed. Head-and-shoulders work will put you at about eight feet, and as the lens can focus down to just under three feet, this gives you considerable control over framing without ever running into a limit imposed by the lens design.<br/><br/>This is also a truly excellent lens for not-very-wide field astrophotography, although at critical focus and maximum aperture, chromatic aberration will make itself felt on the brightest stars, which you will then have to compensate for. I have successfully used this lens to capture the the Orion nebula, Andromeda galaxy, Triangulum galaxy, and a number of other astro objects that range from the easy to the difficult, all using no more than a standard (non-tracking) tripod, this lens, and the EOS 50D. On a crop body, 85mm (136mm effective FOV) is definitely the place to be to compromise between star trailing and magnification, and the f/1.8 aperture allows fast enough exposures to eliminate trailing at ISO 1600 and above.<br/><br/>I carry this lens nested in a large camera bag (a Tamrac 5612 Pro 12, *highly* recommended); I rarely put the lens on the camera until I am ready to use it, and when I am done, I take it right back off, cap it, and bag it without wasting any time or motion. I do both the assembly and disassembly "blind" in the bag, using the bag top to shield the camera and lens from the wind and environment as best I can manage. The lens has a raised alignment dot that makes blind assembly practical. It's the size of the overall investment that drives this behavior, of course; both the camera and a lens like this deserves -- demands -- good care and that is just what I try to provide.<br/><br/>Physically speaking, this lens isn't as large as you might think. Canon did a great job of packing a lot of glass (nine elements in seven groups) into a decent form factor of 3" diameter by 2.8" long; even with the hood mounted, this lens provides a fraction of the intimidation factor of, for instance, the 70-200mm f/2.8L. But at 85mm, it can still "get in there" and catch a lot of action without forcing you to crop to extremes. It's light enough that you can shoot for quite a while before fatigue sets in, an issue that will rear its head in any situation that goes on a while, like a wedding or a play (and that low-light capability is great for stage work, where a flash annoys literally everyone.) Plus it is black, and so looks more like it is designed as part of the same camera system, unlike the L's with the white bodies. That's also less distracting in a dark theater.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that this is definitely one of my favorite lenses. I have a fair collection of primes to compare it to, some of which are L glass, and I've got some great L zooms as well; yet for portraits, I inevitably turn to this specific lens as it outperforms everything else I own in the successful shooting methodologies I find myself returning to over and over. Frankly, at the price, I think it is perfectly fair to characterize this lens as a "must-have"; if you're ever going to shoot a portrait, trust me, this is the lens you want (even over the 85mm f/1.2L, which has far too narrow a depth of field for most reasonable portraiture, though you can't beat it for light-gathering.) Like Canon's 100mm f/2.8 macro lens, the 85mm f/1.8 is one of those where you're left scratching your head as to why it doesn't have an "L" designation. It is an outstanding performer.<br/><br/>If Canon were to re-do this lens, I'd like to see them add image stabilization, and perhaps some modern anti-CA elements, as this is the one area where this lens occasionally bites the photographer in high-contrast situations. Until that day, though, this lens is unmatched by anything else in Canon's line for price/performance, and I can't imagine anyone ever regretting its purchase.</span>

<span>This was my second prime lens, the first being the "I-am-prime-too-50/1.8" lens and I specifically bought this to shoot a badminton tournament (and more for the future).  FYI, badminton tournaments are definitely 1.8 situations at ISO 1600 and no flash permitted.  And what a lens!<br/><br/>The focus is absolutely sharp, crisp with gorgeous bokeh to make the subjects stand out.  I took photos of professional badminton players (USA rank 1-5) and emailed it to them.  Even though I am a serious amateur, they replied back saying the photos were gorgeous and amazing, and loved it.  I shot the complete tournament at 1.8 ISO 800/1600 and have absolutely pleasing results.<br/><br/>On just one or two occasions, the focus was hunting, but I would put that down as a one off occasion as there was aboslutely very challenging situations - moving subjects in low light.  The focus is quick and absolutely smooth, no noise at all.<br/><br/>The lens is compact, not at all heavy and is perfect portrait lens.  My only disappointment is that it comes without a hood, and even if I buy a Canon hood, it does not have the same look as other (say, Tamron 28-75 2.8 hood is a really good looking hood) hoods.<br/><br/>The relationship between the background and the foreground is something that impressed me with this lens, especially for an 85mm focal length.  The lens makes the subjects stand out and you dont need to stop down for sharpness.  I know I am going to keep this baby at 1.8 at all times in future.<br/><br/>This in concert with my 50 1.8 for wider angle situations like awards and group snaps, the photos are absolutely stunning.  The reviews I received for my photos are pretty good, thanks to this lens with my 20D.<br/><br/>I am sold on primes now and will probably end up buying more primes than zoom lenses.  Go on Canon, put a red ring around it!<br/><br/>Definitely 5 stars.<br/><br/>Other lenses considered before this purchase - 85/1.8, 100/2, 135/2L and to a small extent, 200/2.8L.  Finally chose the 85/1.8 due to the 1.8 and the effective focal length on 20D with 85mm. No buyer's regret, I am very pleased with my purchase now.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>11 Mar 2009<br/>This is a comparison of 85/1.8 and 135mm/2L.<br/>Ive had this lens for 3 yrs now and have taken so many portraits with this, simply put, amazing results every single time.  Never been able to find fault with this lens or the images.  Image quality has been consistently awesome, consistently 5 stars.  The only lens that bests the images from this lens is my 135/2L, but that is of an entirely different league and shouldn't even be compared to this lens.  Merely stating that for academic interest.  Even then, the three places that the 135mm beats the 85 mm are<br/>1. Sharpness - 85mm is very sharp, 135mm/2L is simply a notch above.<br/>2. Saturation - 85mm is good, 135mm/2L is much better, image has a pop.  But then again, 85mm has half a pop too!<br/>3. Bokeh - Again, 85mm has a lovely bokeh, esp @1.8 and 2.  However, the 135mm is in an entirely different league, one simply cannot, should not compare.<br/>Now, the $350mm lens compared to the much more expensive, much higher quality lens worth $925 is completely unfair.  However, I would give the 85/1.8 4 stars assuming the 135mm is the gold standard with 5 stars.<br/>If this review second rates the 85mm, that is certainly not my intention.  I have consistently enjoyed shooting with this lens and will continue to have a lot of fun.</span>

Product Description   Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras.   From the Manufacturer   Capture the far-off action of fast-paced sports or zoom in for an intimate portrait with the Canon EF 75-300mm telephoto zoom lens. The optical system, construction, and exterior are the same as the EF 75-300 mm f/4-5.6 III USM’s. The difference is that it uses a DC motor instead of a USM to drive the AF. As with all Canon lens, this 75-300 model carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 75-300mm Maximum aperture: 1:4-5.6 Lens construction: 13 elements in 9 groups Diagonal angle of view: 32 (at 11 feet) to 8 degrees (at 15 feet) Closest focusing distance: 4.9 feet Zoom system: Rotating type Filter size: 58mm Dimensions: 2.8 inches in diameter, 4.8 inches long Weight: 16.8 ounces The most affordable of Canonís long telephoto zooms, this lens is excellent for subjects from portraits to wildlife and nature. It shares the same 13-element optical system as the 75-300mm USM lens, but uses a DC motor for autofocus. Close-focusing down to 4.9 feet (1.5m) allows filling the frame (at 300mm) with a subject the size of a dollar bill, and itís compatible with the Canon 58mm Close-up lens 500D for even more spectacular shots of small objects. Isolate the Interesting Part The eye tends to see the whole rather than the individual parts. It also sees whatís near and not whatís far. By bringing attention to those things missed by the eye, you can create many interesting pictures. It could be the grimace of an athlete, the grill of a classic car, or a girl against a blurred background. Telephoto lenses can also compress images to give dramatic effects. You are limited only by your imagination.

<span>The autofocus of my ef version of this lens started to fail, so I replaced it with this RF macro.  Immediately the fist difference I noticed is that the autofocus is practically silent on this lens, but that doesn’t improve image quality.  I think image quality is about the same between the two lenses.  Where the RF stands out the the spherical aberration control ring.  You can play around with bokeh and get absolutely stunning results that you could never get with the ef, especially with night photography.  If you take Christmas pictures at night and you like to make bokeh in the background, this lens will knock your socks off because you have control over how sharp/well formed the bokeh is.  You can make it soft and ethereal, or go for sharp, crisp bokeh light spheres.  All the videos I watched on this lens said “you’ll probably never use the SA control ring”.  Turns out it’s a great feature.</span>

<span>This lens offers more features than it probably needs to, but at its core it is an amazing macro lens. With greater than 1:1 replication, and reliable robust image stabilization, you can shoot macro shots handheld and still produce stellar results. At f2.8 you're not going to get the insanely crisp subject and blurred background to the extent you would with a F1.8, but this lens isnt primarily for creating that. At 2.8 you still get plenty of bokeh to fill that void in your artistic soul.</span>

<span>I’ve only used this a couple weeks so far, but I am extremely impressed.  I am not a seasoned macro photographer by any account, but a handful of the images I have taken have really impressed me.  The 1.4:1 magnification is really nice, but achieving good shots at that magnification also requires manual focus, a good amount of patience, and a lot of softer focus images (throwaways).  I’m having a lot of fun with this lens and finding myself looking for more opportunities to take photos.  Portraits are also lovely with this, although, I’ve only taken a handful of my family so far.  Autofocus and sensor stabilization are fantastic as well.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback and negative of the lens certainly comes down to the Spherical Aberration ring, which is completely useless to me.  Most people don’t find this to be a useful feature and I would have to agree.  Maybe I just don’t entirely understand its application yet, but the adverse affects to the image don’t make this a worthwhile feature to me.</span>

<span>This lens rocks! I had not anticipated how much fun it would be, for both photo and video work. I have been in the market for a decent wide angle for my 70D for some time now... the tokina 11-16 f/2.8 is everyone's favorite for this, but $600ish dollars is just more than I'm willing to spend on a lens I (didn't) anticipate having mounted on my camera too terribly often. Canon's own ef-s 10-22 is similar as well, but also quite pricey, and i really don't need that little bit of extra zoom range it offers, as I already have a sigma 18-35 f1.8 which is much, much sharper anyway...<br/><br/>So after reading a number of very positive reviews of this new 10-18, and especially after seeing it's awesomely low (for canon) price of $299, i thought i'd give it a try. Yes, it is rather slow aperture-wise, so it's not so great for low light stuff or anything, but it is so useful! I hadn't realized how much wider (and how often!) i wanted to get past 18mm until i had the option to, and all of the sudden my sigma 18-35 has started feeling cramped, and i find myself reaching for the 10-18 way more often than i would have thought.<br/><br/>The super wide 10mm allows me to get shots that previously would have been impossible, especially in small, cramped rooms, and from a very cool perspective as well. For example the other day I was shooting a band recording in a small, cramped studio space, and i was able to get awesome full body shots from just like 2 or 3 feet away. This lens also has a much closer minimum focus distance than its competitors, enabling it to get super unique shots up a lot closer to your subjects than you could be with those other lenses.<br/><br/>For video, the wider the lens the more stable everything looks and the less you notice little bumps or shakes in the camera, which is great for shooting handheld (plus that image stabilizer!) but it gets even more awesome with this lens up on my shoulder stabilizer. Moving shots at 10mm are basically indistinguishable from a glidecam or steadicam shot, especially with a little warp stabilizer added in post. Even going up and down stairs at a pretty fast, even pace, this thing glides effortlessly along at those wide angles, plus the STM focusing means it's fast and silent when autofocusing (70D) as well.<br/><br/>The plastic mount does not bother me, everyone is obsessed with metal lens mounts but i have had a 50mm 1.8 for years and never had a single problem with it's supposedly crappy plastic mount and so i don't anticipate any problems with the 10-18 either. The whole "plasticy"ness in general that so many people complain about with cheaper lenses like these doesn't phase me, i only care about the glass itself, and the image quality it can achieve... which in this case is very respectable, no complaints at all. If you google head to head this verse the 10-22mm it's actually beating it in a lot of different areas, you should check out some reviews if you're on the ropes<br/><br/>TL;DR<br/><br/>Awesome price, awesome and unique wide angle shots, I'm very pleased with this lens</span>

<span>I needed a wide angle lens for the eos m.  I have the 22mm Prime, but that doesn't cut it in some situations.<br/><br/>I find that this lens works well with the EOS and the EF to M adapter.  So far the lens has sharp focus, and believe it or not, it seems better than the 22mm EFM that was made for the EOS m in focusing speed, and accuracy.<br/><br/>The Good :<br/>The lens is sharp, accurate, focus is quick, and silent.  The Image stabilization works very well. I can't tell you how many stops, because I have never needed to use IS for still photos.  I use the IS for video, and it seems to help keep down vibrations, and jarring.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>No focus number window!  One reason I wanted this was for long shutter night time shots of the stars....<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>For the price, this lens is a great addition to our EOS M, along with the adapter.  It is MUCH cheaper than the 11-22 EFM that is made for the EOS M camera.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  It slightly defeats the purpose of why I bought the EOS M in the first place, but it isn't that much more to lug along. I plan to use this lens just for the EOS M, as my other camera has a full frame sensor.<br/><br/>Other lenses and cameras in my kit:  70-200 F4L, 17-40 F4L, 35mm Prime, 50mm Prime. Canon 5D, Canon 20D, 300HS, Hero 3 + Black, Hero 4 Black<br/><br/>I could talk about vignetting, and barrel distortion, and edge to edge sharpness, but the only one I have ever really cared about is Chromatic Aberration which is VERY well controlled on this lens.  The lens is also very sharp.<br/><br/>You can easily fix vignetting, and a lot of the times, you crop out barrel distortion, so that isn't a big deal to me.<br/><br/>P.S, I am not going to try and act like I am some sort of nuts and bolts photography expert, but I do know a little about photography.

<span>Holy Cow!<br/><br/>The field of view of this lens is awesomely wide. I use it with a Canon Digital Rebel XTi and a Canon EOS 70D (both APS-C sensors), and the photos you can get with this lens is almost freakish.<br/><br/>This is my new favorite indoor lens when I'm shooting kids and family. If you need to shoot a lot of wide angle (to catch the action) candid/family type indoor shots, buying this lens is a no brainer and a great value. It's not going to set you back by a lot and you'll find yourself using it a lot.<br/><br/>It is plastic construction, so don't expect to treat/mis-treat it like an L series lens. At 10mm to 18mm its a perfect compliment to Canon's common 18-55mm kit lens that comes with a lot of cameras. With the STM motor its a fast and quiet focuser for the DSLRs that do video. It's a surprisingly larger lens<br/><br/>I do have one complaint about this lens: at f/4.5-f/5.6, it is not fast enough! I would LOVE to have this lens at f/4, or f/3.5 (like the 18-55mm kit lenses), or even better, f/3.2 or f/2.8 for wide open.  Having only f/4.5 wide open at 10mm indoors (with indoor lighting) means slower shutter speeds or bumping up the ISO to 400, 800, or 1600, which is less than ideal, or even worse, having to use flash.  When shooting outdoors during the day/evening, f/4.5 is fine because I typically shoot either f/4, f/5.6, or f/8 outdoors anyways, so with this lens I just set it to f/5.6 or f/8 and can zoom in and out without having to change any other exposure settings. I just wish it were faster for indoor lighting shots.<br/><br/>I'd be willing to shell out an extra $25-$50 to get the same lens in at least an f/4, and $100 to get f/2.8. A great mark ii version of this lens would be to keep the 10-18mm zoom range, drop the IS, make it f/3.5 at 18mm (the same as their cheap kit lens at 18mm) or f/4.0, and go bigger aperture as the picture got wider. At least f/3.5, or f/3.3, 3.2, 3.1, or 2.8 at 10mm would be wonderful for shooting indoor lighting levels with no flash.</span>

<span>Optically, I would give this lens only 3 stars, because I've noticed lens flare and/or internal reflection of lights against dark skies that I've not seen with any other lens I own, and this is very disappointing.  When I review photos that I've shot at night, if there is any light source in the picture (such as street lights, car headlights or brake lights, or traffic signals), there are accompanying light streaks that look like comets in the night sky.  Lots of them.  For useable pictures I have to Photoshop them out, which sucks mightily.  This lens has a very nice wide view, but it is giving me extra work to produce clean, flare-free photos at night, which is unfortunately the majority of what I use wide angles for.  Yea, very disappointing.<br/><br/>I was going to upload a nighttime picture with about 9-12 'comets' clearly visible, but I can't find any links to allow me to do that; only videos.  :(<br/><br/>Consider yourself warned; this lens flares badly (or has internal reflections), the worst of any lens I own.  However, it does not seem that *all* lights cause this, only some, not sure why.  Flare from having daylight sun visible in the picture isn't bad; perhaps it's mostly apparent with lights at night.  I'm really hoping that this is a QC issue, and sending it back for a check will correct this, but I doubt it.  (If the flare issue improves [disappears] after a checkup by Canon, I will update this review.)<br/><br/>Since this lens is fairly cheap, I'll give it an extra star (4).  It is an EF-S lens, meaning that it will *NOT* work on any flavor Canon that can only use 'EF' mount lenses, 1.3x cameras, or full-frame, such as the 5D I II III, 6D, 1D, 1Ds, or 1Dx (this includes any Canon 35mm film camera).  It will only fit APS-C Canon digital cameras, such as the Rebel series, and other 1.6x crop-sensor Canons.  If you're not sure if your Canon camera can use EF-S lenses, you can quickly find the answer on Wikipedia.<br/><br/>I've used an Optics Pro 8mm (semi) fisheye for the past few years, and have never seen a single instance of 'comets' in any nighttime picture.  BTW, the Optics Pro 8mm (also sold under a few other labels, such as ROKINON) is a FANTASTIC lens, about $80 cheaper than the Canon EF-S 10-18mm; this 8mm is highly recommended: </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Rokinon-FE8M-C-8mm-F3-5-Fisheye-Lens-for-Canon-Black/dp/B002LTXQUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rokinon FE8M-C 8mm F3.5 Fisheye Lens for Canon - Black</a>
<span> Keep in mind, though, the 8mm is a semi-fisheye, no zoom (it's a prime lens), and fully manual, while the Canon EF-S 10-18mm is *not* fisheye, and fully automatic.  (The manual-control aspect of the 8mm lens has not been an issue for me at all.)  Read some of the plentiful reviews online for the 8mm lens to see if it might fit your requirements.<br/><br/>I've never tried the older Canon EFS 10-22 mm lens so I can't compare them, but I have a feeling that the 10-22 is probably optically superior to this one, flare-wise, and I may end up switching over to the 10-22mm lens for nighttime photography.<br/><br/>This 10-18mm lens is very light, just as light as the 18-55mm IS kit lens that comes with your Canon Rebel.  The focus is absolutely silent.</span>

<span>I own about 10 lenses, including 4 Canon L lenses. This is my best lens by far. The rendering is sublime, the build quality is excellent, the sharpness wide open blows my mind. It's hard to put into words how good this lens is.<br/><br/>I don't really like the 50mm focal length. I sold two other 50mm lenses I tried because the focal length, for me, is neither here nor there. 50mm isn't wide enough to be a good general purpose environmental lens, and it's not long enough to capture subjects farther away. Even with that said, this is the lens that is glued onto my camera 70% of the time. The image quality is sublime at all apertures, and it's just fun to use. I even use it sometimes for product photography over my 100mm 2.8L when I can because I just love the rendering so much.<br/><br/>Cons are the price, and the weight. But I think it's absolutely worth the price, probably more actually. And I'm a large guy so personally the weight doesn't bother me, but I could see it being an issue for some.</span>

<span>I purchased this lens a month ago and wanted to put it to it's paces before reviewing.  Shipping from Amazon was quick, with no issues.  The Lens is built like a tank, looks good and feels good.  for a 50mm, it's massive.  The control ring is a nice addition, with just enough friction to prevent accidental adjustment.  The image quality of this lens across ALL apertures is absolutely incredible!  This lens puts the smackdown on EVERY 50mm Canon ever made.  I must admit, I purchased this lens for my studio work.  I wanted a prime lens that I could shoot full bodies with in my limited space studio.  The 50mm is the perfect focal length for this.  I purchased the Sigma 50mm 1.4 art and spent some days with both lenses to see which was better overall.  While the Sigma is a GREAT VALUE for a prime 50 below $800, it simply can't hold a candle to the Canon 50.  Corner to corner sharpness is the best I"ve seen in any 50 prime.  Focusing is fast, quiet and accurate on an R5.  Sharpness at 1.4 and 1.2 is the best I've ever seen in any 50 prime.  Saturation and color accuracy is on par with top shelf Canon L glass.  The price is the only negative here.  What do you want me to say?  It costs to be the boss.  But rest assured, it will deliver.</span>

<span>Brand new to photography. I took a black and white film photography back in college but always held off on learning anything more complicated. Recently decided to get with the times and now own a Canon Rebel EOS T8I. I’m learning more but wanted to focus a little more on the macro photography.<br/><br/>I took this lens for a test run on a recent trip to South Dakota. Loved it. It’s so light and easy to carry throughout a hike. I know there is so much potential to this lens but I think it’s a great place to get your feet wet</span>

<span>This is a great lens, overall. Getting close to the subject, this lens will naturally have more of a fish-eye affect. I've also noticed the images produced with this lens are a lot darker, especially around the edges. This can be easily fixed in Lightroom, but I just wasn't expecting them to be so dark. No biggie. Just boost your exposure meter up a notch or two to compensate.</span>

<span> aka the nifty-fifty, I thought I would take another flyer on one of Canon's budget, fixed lens offerings: Canon's EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM Lens. In short, this lens at this price point does not disappoint and if you're after quality on a budget this lens definitely belongs in your arsenal as a wide angle option.<br/><br/>--Build and Aesthetic Appointments<br/>As other reviewers have mentioned, this lens is small. It's small size helps the whole lens feel very sturdy despite it being 100% plastic. The focus ring feels nice (which can be adjust manually even when autofocus is engaged, which is a huge plus) and the autofocus and manual focus switch has just enough resistance for a good quality feel to it.<br/><br/>In terms of looks, this lens looks like any other non-L-series lens from Canon. Silver ring appointment with a nice rubbery-toothed grip on the focus ring, it's a nice looking lens. One thing you should notice before purchasing this lens is that the glass itself almost looks like a toy, seeing that it is so small and surrounded by a large plastic bezel. As far as I can tell, this does not have an affect on image quality, but definitely does not look like a conventional lens.<br/><br/>--Usage and Features<br/>The size and price of this lens makes it a perfect knockaround lens that will deliver some pretty stellar images--you can literally slip this thing in your pocket, fanny pack, purse or whatever when traveling; really cool. Its maximum aperture is 2.8, while not as fast as the amazing nifty-fifty, the extra light you can get at this maximum  f-stop across all focal lengths is a huge upgrade over most lens kits, making it a cheap and worthwhile upgrade.<br/><br/>One thing to take into account is the focal length on this prime lens on an APS-C body is the APS-C crop factor that adds a 1.6x (I believe) magnification to the focal length. What this means is that, while this lens is certainly wider than the nifty-fifty fixed lens as example, you will more than likely not have as much headroom as you would like with this lens. Still, you have plenty of frame to take some nice architecture interior and exterior shots or group photos; just do not expect fisheye’ish expansive landscape shots from this lens--which would be too high of an expectation for this lens in the first place.<br/><br/>Autofocus is fast and, for a lens at this cost, pretty quiet. I have not had any trouble getting proper focus with this lens even when shooting quick moving subjects like my dog running around at the dog park. For videographers planning on purchasing this lens is to be wary of the noise that your camera’s on-board microphone will pick up from the autofocus and manually adjusting focus. Believe it or not, noise from autofocus is not as big of an issue as the noise made when manually adjusting focus. I’ve noticed on video I have shot with audio that the focus ring makes a bizarre whirring sound that is almost cute, but the sound will cut through all of the other audio being recorded. If you are really serious about shooting video on a DSLR and need audio, it should go without saying that you should buy a separate mic for your rig and you will minimize or completely avoid picking up unwanted camera audio but this is just something that is good to know before you buy.<br/><br/>A cool secret feature is this thing takes some pretty good macro shots. I have been able to get extremely closeup on subjects such as flowers, plants and my dog with really great results. My images turn out sharp even at f/2.8 and I have been pleased with the flexibility to get in tight on subjects to capture more depth and details.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed the first time I attached this lens to my 7D is that it was almost scarily snug. I was a little worried, but I have not noticed this issue again since changing lenses a multitude of times. So, if you notice that this lens fits a little tight on your camera’s body, this is more than likely not something to worry about as my camera and all of my lenses are functioning properly as they should.<br/><br/>--Image Quality<br/>For a lens this size and its price point, this little thing takes some fantastic images. There is noticeable softness in the edges with this lens, even at lower f-stops but is still a jump up from just about any Canon kit lens. Vignetting in my use has been negligible in my use and have noticed very little barrel distortion, even when getting close to subjects when shooting.<br/><br/>Color aberration, or lack of it, is incredible for a lens at this price and tier. While writing this review, I had to go through quite a few images in Lightroom before I could find any example of fringing in the photos I have taken with this lens. Even then, aberration would be very easy to remove in Photoshop or Lightroom.<br/><br/>Bokeh effect is fine on this lens as well. Nice, smooth bokeh where the background is still discernable but the focused subject jumps off the background, sharp and bright. I have been more than happy with the bokeh effects I have been able to achieve in still images and video with this lens.<br/><br/>Colors overall are luscious and vibrant. I have been very pleased at the saturation and color of my images and video shot with this lens, even before editing.<br/><br/>--Overall<br/>If you are just starting out building your lens collection and do not have the nifty-fifty, I would suggest purchasing the Canon’s 50mm budget prime lens offering before getting this lens. I do believe that after purchasing any of Canon’s budget or L-series prime lens offerings, this lens is totally worth purchasing--as long as your camera has an APS-C sensor as this is an EF-S lens. Even as a knockaround, travel lens this thing smokes kit lenses and is just a fun little toy to have in your rig.<br/><br/>This lens is always on my 7D by default because it is a prime lens with a little more versatility and frame headroom than my fixed 50mm. I love prime lenses and will end up purchasing Canon’s L-series fixed lens offerings eventually, but will always have a use for this lens as long as I own an APS-C camera body. Quality, fun and portability make this lens one of the Canon’s more intriguing offerings in the EF-S lens class and would highly recommend the lens to any photographer beginning or intermediate photographer. Buy it, love it and get a even more insatiable taste for prime lenses.</span>

<span>I have a Canon T5i with the two standard lenses of 18-55mm and the 55-250mm. This is the second lens purchase for me. The 55-250mm was the first lens I purchased. Before all this I had a nice prosumer Kodak P880 that took excellent lesser megapixel pictures. The 55-250mm has produced very nice photos also, but now that I'm getting slightly more savvy with my photos, this 24mm STM has opened my eyes to better lighting. The kit lenses work great if you give them plenty of light to work with. This 24mm STM is great indoors with a little light, better outdoors in low light, and the kit lenses can't function at all, adequately many times. I went to a pro camera shop sometime ago and asked about kit lenses and I never saw a nose go up in the air so fast, wow, and he had none.<br/><br/>I watched a lot of reviews on all these lenses before I grabbed this 24mm, and glad I did. I am seriously considering the 40mm next. I read a lot verbiage about this lens being slow, and yes maybe for video, but photos on  Live View or View Finder, I found it very fast. View Finder was almost instant. I went to Yosemite with kit lenses in early June, and plan on hitting Yosemite again to try out this new little 24mm gem.<br/><br/>Every review has mentioned the cool sleek factor of this tiny guy, and it is slick. I can now use my old Kodak camera case again for grabbing it quick from the hip. Other folks also mentioned the noise in the video. My favorite method of shooting video with the T5i is using video snapshot with 2-4 second clips melded together for one MTV style video of your trip. Amazing, people will sit through your whole trip of video if it is only a few minutes long. Now, for the sound, people have said that the 24mm STM is noisy. Since the lens movement is external for focusing, the lens is somewhat audible, unlike the kit zoom lenses that are internally focused. Here's another option that most folks don't know about. This process takes a little time to learn. Load your Canon software on a computer. As a short cut, I tried to copy this process from one SD card to another, Bzzz, won't work. You need to do this for each memory card. What is it? OK, in the Canon software, you are able to put your own music or another WAV sound track into your T5i. When you play back any video, your music will play instead of the terrible recorded sound through the camera. Voila, high quality sound for your videos. I never turn on audio recording. If you do, turn on the wind filter if you are shooting outside. Last note on this, you need to take a CD or mp3 and turn it into WAV format, and it would help if you can trim these files to a quarter of song for more varied tracks. I think you need to have the camera on and software open to get into that portion of the program to upload the songs. Good hunting. I will generally answer a question if you have one.<br/><br/>I have included the first two pictures, and I think the 18-55mm set at 24mm compared to the 24mm STM is a good side by side. I loaded these directly from the camera with no processing either. The first thing I noticed after taking about 100 photos, I didn't toss out but a couple. Most everything focused wonderfully. The first pic is my painting of the Shining's bathroom rage scene taken with the 24mm, and obviously the second comparison is the 18-55mm. This is the most dramatic lighting experiment I've personally preformed with lenses. The last four are some decent close up shots. I really can't wait to try this out on some nice classic scenery besides the local nursery or garden. Get this 24mm STM lens to enhance your 18-55mm STM experience.</span>

<span>I just got this lens yesterday and the first thing I did is calibrate it using a LensAlign Pro.  I have a 7D and I have found the micro-adjustment feature invaluable.  I have a 24-70mm 2.8L, a 50mm 1.2L, a 100mm 2.8 macro, and a 70-200 4L.  All of them required slight micro-adjustments inside the camera to get perfect focus.  The 17-40mm 4L required a -6 adjustment to bring it in line with the camera.  That's the most I've had to adjust any of my lenses.<br/><br/>Tonight I had the opportunity to test this lens by taking a few shots at a specified focal length against my 24-70.  The 24-70 is a great lens and although it's not a wide angle like the 17-40 I could still use it as a base line against my new addition.<br/><br/>Both lenses were mounted to my tripod and set at F4 @ 40mm and all other settings were the same also.  I photographed a flower pot hanging off of my Gazebo.<br/><br/>The results:<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the 17-40 was very close in sharpness to the 24-70 - impressively so.  The 24-70 was better but not by much. I wasn't expecting that since many reviews on here complained about that aspect of the lens. Color was warmer - much warmer. It's color reproduction was not believable and couldn't hold a candle against the 24-70. Background blur was not as good also as I could make out details on my neighbors asphalt roof top.  On the 24-70 no details were visible.  The blur was just smoother - more buttery as they say. Contrast was very good and I couldn't tell any difference between the two lenses.<br/><br/>Now for the wide open tests.  This is my only wide angle lens and I didn't have anything to compare it to so I scrutinized the things other people have complained about when reviewing this lens: sharpness at the edges and chromatic abberation.  I didn't experience any issues of my lens being soft on the edges but that is likely due to the fact that I am on a 1.6x crop body and not a full frame.  What I did experience was bad chromatic abberation away from the center.  Straight on from my focal point was fine but from 17mm to about 25mm the chromatic abberation was evident.  It was the worst at 17mm and got progressively better until it was gone above 25mm.<br/><br/>Of course, I had to zoom way in to see it but when I did was it bad.  Purple on one side of a vertical fence post and green on the other side.<br/><br/>Bottom line for me is that while this lens will serve the purposes it was bought for, I don't think I'll keep it long term since I plan on moving to a full frame when Canon comes out with their next upgraded line (probably a 5DMkIII).  At that point I'll sell it and pick up the 16-35mm 2.8L.<br/><br/>Am I disappointed in the lens?  Not really, I expected some issues regarding glass simply because it's a very inexpensive 'L' series.  Build quality is certainly 'L' quality - but glass is not.  That's why it's so economical.  I gave it 4 stars because all things considered it's a good lens for the price.  5 star reviews are reserved for flawless products regardless of price and this lens is not flawless.</span>

<span>This is a magnificent lens deserving of high praise. In general, I tend to shoot "available light" and towards wide angle, and EF 17-40 F4L is one perfect lens for someone like me. On an APS size sensor camera (mine is Rebel XT), it works approximately like a 28-70 mm zoom--a perfect walk-around lens, giving you decent wide angle and at the tele end, a pleasing perspective on faces you expect from a moderate telephoto. I spent two weeks with EF 17-40 on the coast shooting nature and street stuff in small towns. It performed perfectly. But I only realized what a real treasure I have when I began having second thoughts about it on the eve of a long overseas journey. I asked myself whether I would not have done better buying EF-S 17-85 F4-5.6 IS. After all, it gives you better reach - an equivalent of 28-135 mm zoom on a 35 mm camera. Would it not be a perfect lens on an overseas trip? A dilemma worhty of Hamlet. So I decided to order it from Amazon while I still had time to return EF 17-40. As soon as EF-S 17-85 came, I did some tests taking pictures of still life, flowers and a portrait at similar focal lengths and at full zoom. The results put 17-85 to shame. Color and light were flat and paled next to 17-40. But there was still the problem of reach. I took a portrait at full zoom of the same person (40 mm or 65 mm equivalent and 85 mm or 135 equivalent), cut out the critical focus area from both pix and equalized the two crops in terms of pixel numbers. Unprocessed, 17-85 produced a perfectly focused picture, the 17-40 crop was visibly softer, but in terms of tonality and richness of gradations, it was way ahead of its rival. Photoshop to the rescue! After I fiddled with sharpening and contrast in CS2, the focus softness in 17-40 was gone, and the result was a better all-around picture of the same portrait detail. In other words, if you wish to take a picture, say, of a building's detail or a monkey mug shot in a zoo--a situation calling for a telephoto of 135 mm that 17-85 is capable of--EF 17-40 F4 can do the job, in fact a better job in terms of textures and tonality--and focus, too, if you do a little post-processing in SC2. I am returning EF-S 17-85 and will stick with EF 17-40, taking it on my overseas trip. Unlike EF-S 17-85 F4-5.6, which is a feels like a decent consumer zoom,  EF 17-40 F4L is built like a tank and has weather sealing. It should also come in handy if and when I decide to switch to a full-frame camera (EF-S lenses work only with the APS-size sensors).</span>

<span>Most photographers who consider themselves serious amateurs and probably almost all professionals will have at least occasional need for an ultrawide lens. Interiors, architectural exteriors, and some travel scenes are best recorded by a lens whose angle of acceptance approaches or exceeds 100 degrees. If you like and want to produce images in which large foreground objects play against smaller objects in the background while all remain in sharp focus, an ultrawide lens is a necessity. Some may also be surprised to hear that the ultrawide lens can produce interesting portraits when the goal is not just to show the individual, but rather to set a person in a context and let the environment become part of the portrait. For decades the usual focal length for such a lens has been 17mm, though of course even wider lenses, including those which do not attempt rectilinear correction, are available for special purpose image capture. This lens is an ultrawide zoom that pretty much covers the entire wide-angle range that most photographers will need -- extremely wide at the low end and just below normal at the upper.<br/><br/>Its advantages include its utility as an all-purpose wide angle lens (capture range from slightly wide to ultrawide) and its relatively low price for a complicated semi-specialty lens. At f/4 it is not a fast lens, and as has been pointed out in other reviews it suffers from slight softness at some apertures. It is one of Canon's L (red ring) lenses, which are higher-end products, and one can trust the company to have minimized the negative issues that can emerge in complex lens designs. If you feel the need for a perfectly satisfactory wide-angle zoom or primary lens, but don't want to break the bank to get the best one, this is a good lens to consider.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want a faster lens with a bit more lateral grasp, Canon also offers the 16-35mm f/2.8 zoom lens (also in the red ring/L class) at about twice the price of this one. The more expensive lens offers not only what the 17-40mm zoom does (though it does not go quite as close to a normal focal length on the high end), but provides in addition extra light capture for lower-light environments and the slightly wider angle of acceptance. If I had thought a little longer about the differences between the two lenses, I would have ordered the more expensive one. I may upgrade at some point in the future if I ever feel constrained in the use of the one I did buy. But I am not dissatisfied with this lens and have no qualms giving it the five-star rating it deserves in its own right. It is a solid and reliable tool, well made, and provides excellent images.</span>

<span>I love this lens, it shoots at the Sun, with excellent fare and ghost control.  Decent at 17mm, and much better around 24mm for ghost and flare.  This lens is light, manual focus works excellent on Panasonic S5 cameras, with adapter.  I would use this on any full frame camera.  Just recently used this lens on a feature film shoot, and got fantastic feedback from production.  THIS LENS IS ONE OF THE BEST BUYS IN LENSES!</span>
