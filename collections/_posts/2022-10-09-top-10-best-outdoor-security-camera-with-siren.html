<span>The camera went up easily and connected to the internet easily the first time.  We recently went through a storm and we had an extended power outage.  When the power came on the device would never blink red again, just blue.  I hit the reset button a hundred times trying to get it to enter the pairing mode but to no avail.  The camera was up for less than 6 months and I had to replace it.</span>

<span>Pros: pic quality is actually pretty good. When the light turns on you can see even better.<br/>The motion sensor is kind of spotty, a bit laggy for high motion detection. But not terrible.<br/><br/>-you can adjust light to be brighter or dimmer<br/><br/>-you can keep light on, keep off, turn on for motion only or set a schedule.<br/><br/>Cons:  as mentioned in another review: there’s no quick link to see where motion occurred. You literally have to look through all day to find it. PLEASE Add a feature to click to the time motion occurred. This is the whole reason I got the camera!</span>

<span>Pros: Sturdy construct, fits great on an existing junction box, being able to manually turn the lights on and off is a great feature, lights are plenty bright enough ( I actually had to dim them down), dimmable light is great, easy to set up on app, the live feed is very good, Camera quality is good, detection area is sensitive, reasonably priced relative to the camera and features (better value than most other comparable devices)<br/>Cons: Customer service poor, no detailed manual of all of the features and how to use them, no fine adjustment to control motion detection sensitivity, no event video playback just a picture of the event and then you have to go find the event on the local video playback (that's if it reads the SD card), lately the device is not reading the SD card also I'm not receiving notifications of events</span>

<span>I was looking for a WiFi floodlight/camera to add some security to my home but didn’t want a subscription service. This product exceeded my expectations, would 100% recommend if you can live without some of the bells and whistles.<br/><br/>General:<br/>-Attractive, sturdy housing. Comparable to the RING floodlight but I slightly prefer the looks of this one.<br/>-Quick install if you’re replacing an existing fixture like I was<br/>-App is streamlined and intuitive to use<br/><br/>Features:<br/>-Motion detection is very sensitive and has good FOV. I have it set to medium and it still detects me as soon as I step in my driveway/yard or even walk underneath the unit.<br/>-Motion alert notifications come through very quickly and show a still frame of the person/object. Can easily be turned off or snoozed for a set period of time.<br/>-Lights are very bright, timing and brightness can also be adjusted in the app. Useful for when I’m coming home at night or grabbing something from the car.<br/>-Video and audio recordings are clear. Good amount of detail without taking up too much space. Can store about a week and a half’s worth of footage on the included 32GB SD card.<br/>-Two-way talk can be quickly enabled. Useful for package delivery.<br/>-Really good IR night vision, quickly switches back to visible light once motion is detected.<br/>-Live and recorded video are watchable from your phone, as long as the camera is powered and connected to WiFi.<br/>-Has an alarm siren that is allegedly very loud. I haven’t tried it, but I could see this being a useful deterrent to burglars or wild animals.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Timeline of recorded video doesn’t highlight motion activity. Would be better if motion detection events were highlighted on the timeline, or if clicking on the notification automatically took you to that point in the timeline.<br/>-Can’t set up “zones” for the camera to ignore motion in, only adjust FOV and sensitivity of sensor. AFAIK this feature is only found on significantly more expensive units, or ones with subscription fees, so it’s hard to fault them for this.</span>

<span>Bought 2 of these. One worked for a week intermittently. Got a replacement that worked for 5 minutes until i let it update, now it won't connect at all. The second one I had worked just fine I though, until today, trying to connect my warranty replacement camera and found that the I thought was working camera stopped saving clips. So now I have 2 cameras that don't work properly. One works on live view only and the camera I was sent as a warranty replacement worked until it performed the updates.

<span> Arlo Pro does a great job capturing Amazon tossing your packages at your door with total disregard! Overall these cameras are worth it. I live in a crappy neighborhood right now and Ive caught plenty of sketchy stuff on my cameras which has helped law enforcement find some bad guys and also helped me to also catch people who did stuff on my property that caused damaged or transients trying to steal stuff. I wish the motion detection was pixel-based on the Arlo Pros when theyre plugged into power and not just a PIR motion sensors with zones, but with correct camera placement these cameras still do an excellent job capturing video that is good enough for the price. I have one camera placed in a high-traffic area and hard-wired with power, and Im very pleased with how well the recordings make it up to the cloud without ever skipping a beat...and I am talking VERY high traffic areas with a new recording every couple minutes for hours and hours on end and Netgear/Arlo has yet to complain to me for storing too much free video or anything like that. These Arlo Pro cameras, along with the Arlo Q cameras that I use indoors, all provide exceptional value in my opinion. Watch the video I caught today of an Amazon delivery driver tossing a 4 pound box at my door and waking me up from a nap, leaving me worried that someone was breaking into my house. I quickly reviewed my Arlo cameras outside and I caught the Amazon-branded delivery driver treating my expensive Amazon purchases like cheap garbage. Amazon didnt seem to care too much about the incident, if you were curious (and this isnt the first time its happened with the lazy package tossing by Amazon delivery drivers)...Amazon apologized and that was it. If I needed to use this camera as evidence to prove how a new delivery item is broken or how it somehow becomes faulty in the near future, these Arlo cameras have saved the day! :) Thank you Netgear for these amazing Arlo cameras and free cloud recording features; I am very grateful. For outdoor use I recommend getting some silicon protective skins to put on these cameras which are very affordable and can be found on Amazon. The battery in these cameras in a semi-high traffic area would last me about 1 month and in a very high traffic area the battery would last 5 days...this led me to finally hard-wiring the power to all of my Arlo cameras outside. If hard-wiring power to your cameras isnt an option I would still say that the battery life is excellent for what you are getting and recharging the batteries isnt the end of the world as long as you remember to charge the batteries when they need it and get the battery back into the camera before you miss a recording opportunity. I also own Blink XT cameras outside and while the Blink XT battery life is superior to the Arlo Pro cameras in the same areas; the Arlo's motion sensors and capture distance and quality is far better than the Blink XT cameras. Blink XT missed motion recording opportunities that the Arlo Pro cameras caught with ease even when I had my Blink XT cameras right next to the Arlo Pros with identical side-by-side placement. There is a place for the more affordable Blink XT cameras and I use my Blink cameras in less traffic areas and the Blink is closer to the distance of whatever Im trying to capture. My Arlo Pros do the heavy lifting for outdoor recordings though, where I can capture most (but not all) motion out to the alley behind my apartment building with cars and people walking side to side on the camera about 20 feet away which I consider to be excellent for the price and technology available here. I hope this review helps.</span>

<span>The Arlo pro camera system is a great improvement over the previous first generation Arlo system. (Which itself is improvement over the viewzone  camera system that Netgear previously sold.)<br/><br/> The first thing that any current Viewzone  customer should look at is seeing if your registered account has a $49 email link to purchase a refurbished Arlo system! The Netgear is currently trying to get rid of currently deployed  Viewzone systems.  There are excellent deals for people that are existing customers...<br/><br/> If you're new to Arlo, the pro system is really good.<br/><br/> Let me go over my installation:<br/><br/>I currently have in Arlo pro base station  with 11 cameras. (!)<br/><br/>They cover the back and front of our house, and the outlaying buildings; day and night.<br/><br/> They are installed all around the outside of my house, up to 30 feet away from the base station.  Interestingly, while some of my cameras did not connect properly to the first generation Arlo system base station, all of the cameras connected very well to the Arlo pro base station. ( so much so that I can even update the firmware of the cameras without any problems 30 feet or so away!)<br/><br/> The one downside to this system is that there is no way to actually attach to the system if you do not have access to the Internet.  Arlo is completely designed around cloud computing, and cloud storage.  This means that there is no possibility of using the system if you do not have the ability to connect to the Internet; the base station must be able to get out to the Internet.  It also means that the Internet of things rules apply to this device: you probably want to separate your network from your appliances and make sure the Arlo device is not attached to your internal home network;  that is to say that you should have two separate VLANs for all of your traffic at your house, with one VLAN going to your internal sensitive network, and the other going to all of your appliances.  For many people this will not be an understandable concept right off the bat, but it's probably something to consider given the complexity of the Internet of Things appliances.<br/><br/>( For example, my TiVos, TV sets, Arlo,  and guest wireless network are separated out from my home computer network.  They are physically  different network switches, which prevents them from talking to or infecting my home computers.  Most providers do not patch their appliances for CVEs - aka common vulnerabilities and exposures.)<br/><br/> By the same token, one of the greatest vantages of Arlo is that it uploads your videos to the Internet/cloud.  This is an advantage because that means if someone breaks into your house, all of the videos are stored  somewhere in the cloud.  It would take a fairly sophisticated operator to simultaneously hack Netgear and break into your house. (..and if that happens you kinda gotta wonder what you did to pi-ss off a nation-state!)<br/><br/> The web interface is actually very good, it tells you  A variety of things:<br/><br/>-  status of the battery for each camera<br/>-  shows the last picture taken by the camera<br/>-  shows that the camera currently requires a firmware update<br/>-  shows the firmware status in general settings of that camera<br/>-  allows you to view video out of the camera live<br/>-  allows you to set up record times for cameras on a schedule<br/>-  allows you to set up different rule sets to allow cameras to automatically record<br/>-  allows cameras to trigger the alarm in the base station; a 100 dB siren<br/>-  allows the cameras to trigger email alerts and push notifications on your cell phone<br/>-  allows you to configure external USB storage for when the base station temporarily loses its connection to the Internet<br/>-  allows you to configure multiple base stations so that you can use multiple Pro base stations and a combination of legacy and pro base stations<br/><br/>I tend to think the system is useful as a security system for the outside of your house, and for some extent with the siren and internal cameras (to trigger the siren).<br/><br/>It's also very useful if you want to be able to keep an eye on your children if you have a house large enough. ( our child loves to play in the basement for example… )<br/><br/> Now for the cons:<br/><br/>-  A number of people are reporting bad batteries for the pro system; they are lithium-ion the rechargeables<br/>-  The system is not designed to work  below 32°F/0°C;  i've personally seen the battery charger go from 89% to DEAD in 3 hours when the temp hit 31F! ( This doesn't happen with the older cameras that use CR123a batteries)<br/>-  A number of people are reporting a bad pro cameras; which then drain the rechargeable lithium ion battery that comes with the pro<br/>-  some cameras only  exhibit problems when further away from the base station, but not far away but they should have any problems working<br/>-  Arlo technical support can be difficult to work with according to their support forums<br/><br/> Obviously, the system is well worth going through the hassle of being an earlier adopter.  Likewise, if you can get a good deal on the original Arlo cameras and then buy a one camera pro system,  you could have a very good system for a minimal cost ( compared to full blown pro system...)<br/><br/> Overall it's a great system.  But make sure you visit the Arlo support forums,  and check the current status on things like bad connections / dropping connections to cameras and batteries dying without warning!</span>

<span>App Review:<br/><br/>Overall I love these security cameras, but to speak through the microphone to output audio on the app is flawed. The microphone sensitivity barely picks up your voice and in order to get the speakers on the cameras to be loud enough to be heard, you have to raise the volume of your voice directly at the microphone area of your tablet or smartphone. However if you have a headset or headphones with a microphone where you can adjust the microphone up close it works slightly better. I think the app needs to allow microphone sensitivity adjustments.  The app also cannot format your data storage device such as an External HDD or Flash Drive without encountering errors. Thus you have to disconnect the entire data storage device and reformat it upon the PC.<br/><br/>Website Portal Review:<br/><br/>As for the website after applying proper web settings, I noticed there are no issues with the audio as long as you own a headset and computer. You can format the data storage devices without any issues. I am getting to the point where the website is far more better than the app itself.<br/><br/>Camera Review:<br/><br/>The battery life on these cameras are amazing if you plan to go wireless, but it all depends on your settings. The higher quality of recording and how long or when it should record means you will have less battery life. However, there are power saving features which is nice to have and you can prolong the battery life without sacrificing too much video recording quality. I can get roughly a month on a single charge when I set up power saving settings properly if I am lucky. However if you have kids and animals, expect these cameras to die quickly if they are triggered by motion movements within view. Again depends on your settings. I can also plug in the charger with usb cable<br/><br/>Live streaming or viewing old recordings is a breeze through both the app and website. Additionally there is a few seconds or slightly more video delay when watching live, but that is to be expected and depends on your internet speeds. You also have the ability to take a screenshot of a still frame within a live streaming or previously recorded video.  The image resolution quality all depends on your camera settings, but at the highest settings there are no issues. Daytime and Nighttime video and audio recordings are crystal clear. You'll get the full RGB spectrum for daylight recordings while at night you'll receive black and white with greyscale recordings. Works in a variety of light conditions with no issues.<br/><br/>You don't need to have a subscription to use these cameras and can use a storage device or network pathway to store videos and pictures. However the subscription route may be best if you need better security features and further camera support which vary from 2.99 to 14.99 a month depending on your needs. Push notifications and alerts are improved, option to dial emergency services as long as it is supported in your area or alert a friend with one touch of a button.<br/><br/>All media stored can be downloaded, shared (share a direct url link to the video or image via email or on any social media platform or website) and donate (give Arlo developers your video, so they can research and make improvements on their devices and software). The image quality aka video resolution depends on your power saving settings and when or how to record.<br/><br/>Camera accessories:<br/><br/>There is a huge list of accessories such as tripods, protective covers, indoor / outdoor power chargers or cables, additional batteries and housings. So many that you are like a kid in a candy store. Plenty of options to choose from. I do wish there were more accessories that featured what Ring could offer, but maybe down in the future. I'd love a door bell or two way face to face communication.<br/><br/>Charging Support:<br/><br/>Sadly you can't use any random charger in your house because many or not all will be compatible with these Cameras. They require proper voltage ratings to be able to charge these cameras. However Arlo does sale an external charger with usb cable for 14.99 if you want to constantly go without charging or charge it every so often. You can however use almost any micro usb cable as long as it fits into the micro usb camera port. Using a different charger will prompt an warning error, but there are some third party chargers that will work with these cameras. You can keep the camera plugged in directly to the charger at all times, but the usb cable can be obstruct the mount slightly if you are placing your camera at a tight corner or at a certain angle. I recommend finding a right angle charging cable or adapter that will fit into the camera's charging port.<br/><br/>Overall these are good security cameras and I love the portability. I can use these cameras for almost any purpose such as keeping tabs on the baby sitter or as a nanny cam or keeping my apartment or home safe from intruders. I guess you could use this to record wild life if you wanted to, but all up to your imagination. I do recommend these security cameras and there different versions of these cameras, so do some research on which one is perfect for you.</span>

<span>So close but yet so far from being the right choice. I bought this unit because we didn't want wires running down our tree where we could set it up. Finally we found Arlo. It seems like the right solution and it is but not without its own issues. I wish I could have given this a 2.5 star rating.<br/><br/>Hooking up the unit to the existing wifi turned out to be a giant issue which took me hours. I couldn't get the camera to work even though it was hooked up to the base station. In comes Netgear support. By the time I was done with them, they had "joined" my computer, went through my internet settings and told me that I had unwanted users on my network which is the reason why the secure camera won't work. Then they wanted close to $400 to fix the issue. Ah... No. There were no unwanted users on my network. But just in case and considering Netgear was on my computer, I decided to reset my router and change the password. Once I did that here's what I did:<br/><br/>Syncing to Wifi:<br/>Reset Router and only connected my personal Macbook Pro laptop.<br/>Reset and synced the Arlo Base Station and Camera - VIOLA!! It worked.<br/>Proceeded to reconnect all other devices one by one and Arlo stayed connected.<br/><br/>Installing the camera:<br/>Installation was a breeze. I have it hanging from a tree in the front of my house. The downside is access, which I need a ladder to get to. It comes with a half round metal adapter that the Arlo Pro camera connects to either on top of the camera for ceiling mount or on the back for wall mount. The camera has a very strong magnetic for the mount which is great.<br/><br/>Picture quality:<br/>There are 3 settings. Even on the "lowest quality" setting that's suppose to save battery life, it's not bad.<br/><br/>Battery Life:*UPDATE<br/>Here's the downside. Arlo Pro has its own battery, meaning this unit is not powered by off the shelf batteries. I live in a high traffic area, which is a HUGE issue with Arlo's battery. The battery comes fully charged and after installing it lasted about 5 days. Now, I have to recharge it daily. It takes 1 hour to charge, but that isn't enough to adequately charge it. Netgear offers individual batteries, but here's the catch - a battery charger is not available as of this posting.  This means that I must climb a ladder daily to recharge.<br/>*UPDATE - I have a "workaround" for the battery life. Since my camera is up in a tree which I need a ladder to access it, I hooked up the USB cord and let it rest on the limb. When I need to charge, I hook up the plug and run an extension cord to it. I let it charge for a few hours and now my camera has power for about 3 to 4 days.<br/><br/>Software Interface:<br/>Everything is cloud base, which I like for the most part. Getting to the camera settings to adjust length of recording and picture quality is a bit confusing the first few times simply because it doesn't feel intuitive. But once you figure it out, it's fine.<br/><br/>Recording:<br/>Here's another issue. Length of recording and sensitivity of the camera to start recording. The default length is :10 seconds. You can change this up to 2 minutes. Once that time length is reached, the recording stops, even if there's still movement going on. I've had a few times where I wanted to see what was happening past the end. I need to do a little more trial and error for best results.<br/><br/>Recording Storage:<br/>Netgear has a free, 1gb, 7 day storage. You can view your library online and download the videos you want to keep. There are other option to keep the storage longer and more storage space. There is an USB option, which I haven't tried yet which allows me to backup my videos in real time as they're being recorded on Netgears cloud servers. Reviewing the videos is easy on your Arlo interface.<br/><br/>Infrared at night:<br/>Works great with a clear picture.<br/><br/>Will I keep it? Yes. Could it be better? Yes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Nice look.<br/>Good picture and decent sound quality<br/>Storage of videos and review process<br/>USB backup of videos in real time.<br/>Get's the job done<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Not completely plug and play<br/>Cloud based interface of camera settings not intuitive<br/>Battery life for high traffic area is 1 day<br/>Battery replacement is horrendous<br/>No external battery charger for extra battery available yet.<br/>*UPDATE - The way it records is an issue. You can only choose blocks of time to record from :05 seconds to 2:00 minutes. Because the camera is motion or sound sensitive it chooses when something is moving. But it won't start recording again immediately after it stops recording even if something is moving. Also there's no way of recording constantly such as a few frames every :05 seconds.</span>

<span>First, I like and have a lot of TP-Link products: their technology is very good to excellent and the products are well made and their tech support it excellent.<br/>This camera will allow you to zoom in and out ONLY in the "live" mode. If you record an event, it will ONLY playback in full screen mode. A deal breaker for me. And yes, i did call tech support to find out zooming in a recorded event cannot be done.</span>

<span>I've been using a Nest camera for over 10 years in my home.  When somebody was at my door at 3am I realized I needed a camera watching the front door.  The new Nest cameras outdoor have issues with going offline.  I even upgraded my internet to blazing speeds and a new wifi mesh full signal to the camera and they still go offline intermittently and it's not just me.  I've been on the forums and many others have the same issues.  I've tried most every other camera out there also.  Most only start to record when there is motion and you end up getting a clip of somebody walking away by the time the camera actually turns on.  This new Kasa camera has a crystal clear picture day and night.  What I like about it, is that you can set it to record 24/7 to a huge sd card and view the alerts without a subscription.  If you want to download the videos you would need the cloud subscription, but if I really needed to save one, I could just take the card out of the camera.  I have it just up high enough where it can't be reached on my garage and it covers my whole driveway.  It's side by side with the Nest outdoor cam that is by the way 4 times more expensive and it's out performing the Nest camera every day.  It gives me quicker alerts to motion, better quality video, and it's much easier to access than having to log into the Nest app.  The app they use for this Kasa camera works well and keeps me up to date about who's at my front door and it does it immediately.  I'll be buying more at this price and performance for sure.</span>

<span>I must preface this review by telling all that I am a mechanical klutz but semi-tech savvy.  I should also advise that I only received and assembled this product a few hours ago so I will certainly learn more as time passes and I will amend this review accordingly.  Having said that, there are a few things that I should mention for the benefit of all other klutz's out there.  The first thing I noticed is that there are no detailed instructions!  Everyone noted in Amazon revewes how easy installation was so I wasn't all that concerned when placing my order.  I should have been.  Inexcusable that there were no instructions.  I resorted to going to You Tube and found a couple of videos that were very helpful.  But even with the videos, I had some very simple but troubling issues.  I am after all a klutz.<br/><br/>The first step in installation is to download the Blink app.  Much to my surprise, the free Blink app is not compatible with a desktop PC Windows computer.  It is primarily an Android app so I was compelled to download the app to my Android phone.  Now I realize that most would not have an issue doing that but I wish I had known that because I prefer to control my surveillance systems on my PC.  I suspect there may be 3rd party companies that offer Blink compatible software for PC's but again, I wish I had known beforehand.  I am still investigating and will likely find a solution to use the app on my PC but for now, can only use compatible devices.<br/><br/>The cameras and the module are all wrapped in a thin and almost invisible plastic wrap.  One of the first steps is to install the provided 2 Lithium AA batteries in the rear of each of the cameras.  I finally figured out how to get the back plate/cover off the camera and it was a little frustrating.  First, you should know that there is a rubber plug that covers the screw which holds the back plate.  You need to take that plug out to access the screw.  The kit provided a plastic key that fits into the screw and can be used to unscrew the screw.  Simple right?  Well, I turned and turned and turned the screw but the back plate would not come off.  I finally figured out that there was a very thin and invisible plastic that wrapped around the edges of the camera body and that it had to be removed because it otherwise prevented the back plate from releasing once it was unscrewed.  Yes, you have to have had eagle eyes to have seen that plastic film and it was a little tricky getting it off.  (I warned you that I was a klutz.)  Ok, so now that I removed the plastic, I found a notch in the back plate to help lift it out of the camera body.  That now revealed the slots where to install the batteries and the slots were adequately marked to show polarity positions.  But after you install the batteries - do not screw the cover back on.  Why?  Because you need to access the camera ID serial numbers.  Again, I had to find this out on my own because there were no instructions! Also know that once you do screw the back plate back on, it should be orientated properly and there is only one way that will happen even though the cover will go on any way.  The easiest way to orient the plate correctly is to ensure that the USB C port opening lines up with the USB C port on the camera.<br/><br/>Synching the module and each of the cameras was relatively easy so I won't belabor these steps.  The You Tube videos were very helpful to get through these steps.  But here's another setup klutz problem I came across.  To mount the cameras, there are mounting bases that attach to the back of the camera body by snapping into that area where the screw is located.  Sounds easy enough but it is a little tricky.  First, understand that the mounts need to be screwed into whatever house structure your attaching the camera to.  But the holes in the mount are situated in such a manner that it is impossible to access the holes once the camera is attached.  So you need to first screw the mount on to the wall before attaching the camera.  The only problem with that is you now have to snap the camera on to the mount and as I mentioned above, that was a little difficult.<br/><br/>OK, now that I had the cameras set up, figuring out how to work the system was another stumbling block.  Again - no guidance because no instructions.  Even being a little tech savvy, I had some difficulty. I found that the software was not as user friendly as I would have expected.  OK, I am still playing with the system and learning but once again, it sure would help having instructions.</span>

<span> FINAL UPDATE: What was once pretty cool and recommended is now completely useless. If you don't subscribe they take away features and the entire system no longer works right.. They want you to pay every month.. $10/month that's $120 a year.. They also want you to link your Amazon account. Make sure to read the fine print.. Blink wants your Amazon data..  I've spent over $2,000 on these cameras.. Now all of it is useless.. Short clips blurred images glitches all the time deleted clips reappear sometimes it doesn't even record no live view saves, sensors don't pick up anything audio goes out, it all turned to trash. They want to blame it on your wifi. 🙄 They are throttling controlling how well your cameras work.. I feel so betrayed and swindled. I've been recommending these cameras even set my parents up told friends now it's all a waste because Blink wants to be shady.. VERY DISAPPOINTING DO NOT REWARD COMPANIES LIKE THIS WITH YOUR MONEY. 👎🤨<br/><br/>UPDATE: 4/28/21 - 8 or so months in. I have purchased 17 of these cameras and 3 sync modules and planned on buying more also purchased many accessories. Different mounting brackets for the cameras and modules wifi extenders larger battery packs etc. They all worked great at first then slowly came the problems. I put up with the failed views the super short recordings that happened now n then the modules going offline repeatedly no its not my internet the glitches etc ... Now something about a PLUS PLAN suddenly pops up on my app. You can no longer save live clips. 😡 One of the cool things was being able to watch something live then being able to save it. You cannot do that simple little thing anymore.<br/><br/>The cloud storage wasn't that big of a deal since you could pop in a thumbdrive to save recordings. Now they want to charge you for the ability to save live views onto your thumbdrive. It was cool and convenient the ability to view something live catch something happening which is the whole point of a camera then saving it. Now if you catch something happening live its useless because you can't save it. 😡 The system has to be armed and you have to hope the sensors pick it up and even then it may not even reset. They ruined the playback on the app now. No thumbnails and if you want to delete you have to delete clips separately no select all option. This is NOT WORTH BUYING anymore. For the amount of money I spent I should be able to save a short live view. I could have purchased a nicer security system for the money I spent. I no longer recommend this system as they want to charge you a monthly fee for a simple feature a doorbell cam can do. At bare minimum they should not charge Prime Members a subscription fee. Very disappointing that they change the functionality so they can charge you for it. My original review and updates are below.<br/>👇😕<br/><br/>This is pretty close to a must have they just need to make some tweaks. 🤙 Picture quality is pretty good. It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍<br/><br/>The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code.<br/><br/>So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera.<br/><br/>Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited.<br/><br/>After awhile there's inconsistencies short clip recordings failed views no restart recordings after the pause and the longest you can record is 30 seconds and it won't fully record the full 30 secs. Audio cuts out or doesn't record at all and lots of freezes. 😐<br/><br/>This is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty decent. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty decent but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍<br/><br/>UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in.<br/><br/>Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help.<br/><br/>I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much.<br/><br/>Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on.<br/><br/>The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍<br/><br/>Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.<br/><br/>Update 5: The inconsistencies have increased greatly. The syn module continually goes offline requiring a wifi reboot. The batteries are still good and it's been 6 months. There are more freezes and jumps in recordings.</span>

<span>I was fortunate to buy in early on the Blink camera system. Therefore, I have the included cloud coverage. Only recently did I find out just what an advantage that was.<br/><br/>After buying my initial system, I continued to add cameras to the initial sync module. I ultimately ended up having two additional sync modules from systems I purchased after the original system. I was under the impression that all my cameras had to be connected to the original sync module to continue receiving free cloud coverage.<br/><br/>I currently have a mixture of cameras to include 3-XT2, 4-Outdoor, 1-Indoor (2nd gen) and 2-Mini. I was using a schedule to arm the cameras, but I was disappointed that the system would not allow individual scheduling for each camera.<br/><br/>I recently decided to use my additional sync modules to divide my cameras into different zones and allow myself to set different schedules for each zone. Even if it meant the additional modules would not include free cloud coverage, I felt the scheduling control would be worth it.<br/><br/>I was happily surprised to find that even the newer modules set up under the original system included free cloud coverage. Therefore, I now have three different zones that can be individually scheduled. And furthermore, I can add up to 10 cameras to each module.<br/><br/>I only ran into one problem with the setup. The second module I had purchased had been sitting in the box for probably about a year. When I tried to add a camera to it, it would not connect. I called customer support and the first person wasn’t able to help me. I decided to investigate the problem myself and noticed there was a huge difference in the firmware on the second module.<br/><br/>I expected that the firmware of the second module would automatically update, and there was no way to initiate an update within the App. Since it didn’t automatically update, I called customer service back and told them the problem. The individual I spoke with didn’t seem to understand the issue, so I simply insisted that the module’s firmware had to be updated by them.<br/><br/>It took a number of increments to finally update the firmware once the issue had been escalated to the appropriately skilled technician. I insisted that the customer service representative stay on the line until the firmware of the second module exactly matched that of the existing module. I wasn’t trying to go through another 30 minute hold and 20 minute update again.<br/><br/>After the firmware was updated, I was able to add cameras to the second module. I will monitor the module to make sure future firmware updates occur.<br/><br/>I realize that the cloud coverage or camera support may change or discontinue in the future. But for the time being, I’m quite happy with my Blink system.</span>

<span>I've only had these outdoor cameras for a few days, so I won't comment on battery life yet. But overall, I'm very happy with these cameras and most of their features. I'm nitpicking a bit here, which is why there are so many Cons. They are minor issues outweighed by the Pros.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>* Setup was relatively simple--once you understand it--but the instructions weren't (see below)<br/>* Infrared is awesome in the darkest environments and does a good job switching between IR and non-IR automatically<br/>* Motion detection works well, as does the 1-9 sensitivity setting, although this requires some tweaking until you find the right setting for each camera<br/>* Daytime video quality is excellent and good enough to read stationary license plates up to about 50 feet.<br/>* Audio quality is amazing! Individual birds and nearby bees can be heard easily, and normal volume conversations within about 20 feet can be understood.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>* The cameras seem to require an active Internet connection, not just a wifi connection (although I could be wrong). This may be because the initial setup requires you to use cloud storage. This could become a problem if your Internet connection is lost or dropped.<br/>* Initial setup requires storage in the cloud (for the free trial), even if you install a USB drive in the sync module. I have not found a way to disable the cloud storage. This cloud storage requirement may be slowing down the entire system, since it forces everything to constantly use the Internet.<br/>* Setup instructions were weird and unintuitive. The included booklet simply said to install the app. And the app is kind of confusing at first, and I ended up trying to create an account (and failing) and adding the sync module several times until I figured out what it was doing (and I'm an experienced techie). The basic problem is the app requires cameras to be installed only by following certain steps, with no other option.<br/>* Setup requires the mobile app and an active internet connection to install the cameras.<br/>* Accessing the cameras and video clips requires the mobile app. There are no desktop app or web options.<br/>* Cannot schedule individual cameras. The weekly/hourly schedule can only be set for all cameras attached to a sync module. This is unfortunate and will make the scheduling feature useless for most people. It would also be helpful to be able to set quality, motion detection sensitivity, and IR settings on a schedule. The settings I use for night time would be different than the middle of the day or when I'm not at home.<br/>* No quality setting on the audio. There are multiple settings for quality of the videos, to conserve batteries, but there's no way to turn down the audio quality, for battery conservation. The included audio quality is great, but it seems to be "too" high for the purpose of these cameras.<br/>* Only 2 AA batteries in each camera. This could become very cumbersome to replace batteries if your camera is installed in a hard-to-reach location. The cameras SHOULD have 6, 8, or 10 batteries instead, so you don't have to replace them often. I would happily pay the extra battery cost so that I wouldn't have to climb up there very often.<br/>* When a camera is "in use", its settings cannot be changed, and if you try to change the settings, you'll get an error message, causing the app's settings screen to get out of sync with the camera's actual settings, until you go back and modify the settings again.<br/>* The "Talk" feature produces garbled, broken, delayed (by 3-5 seconds) audio that is unintelligible, no matter how close the camera and sync module are to your router. I have about 115 Mbps bandwidth, and it made no difference. You will never be able to use this to have a conversation of any type, even if they could understand what you're saying. This seems like a very odd flaw since the recorded audio is so excellent. This was obviously an oversight by the engineers.<br/>* The Android app's setting to disable the vibration on notifications doesn't work. It always uses my phone's setting and ignores the app's setting.<br/>* Insects near my 4 cameras are causing 15-30 false alerts per day right now, until I can figure out a better placement or setting. Other than the wear on the batteries, this is not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.<br/>* The installation hardware is inadequate. Each camera comes with 2 large wood screws that are too big and too long for almost every installation. Much smaller wood screws and double-sided tape or Velcro would have been much more practical. I ended up not using any of the screws that came with the cameras because they were too big or impossible to use on the required surfaces.<br/>* The back panels on the cameras are VERY weird to remove for battery installation. There are no instructions that I could find on how to do this, and the included plastic tools are not intuitive. I nearly broke one of the cameras trying to get the back panel off using the included tool. There's a certain trick to hooking and unhooking the tool from the back panel that you'll have to figure out on your own.<br/>* The cameras and lenses are fully exposed to sunlight and weather, which is not ideal. The cameras should come with a small hood the lens or camera to protect it even more from weather and shade from light.<br/>* User access cannot be customized. The only way to give someone access to a camera is to give them your password to your account and entire system. It would be helpful to be able to grant someone limited or temporary access, such as a neighbor, child, relative, or visitor.</span>

<span> This is a wired outdoor security camera, with light and two way sound. I haven't tried out the siren.  Not only does this allow me to view a good portion of the back yard, and alert me when it sees motion, but it's fun to see what critters wander through at night.<br/><br/>Installation was fairly easy, though it was easier with two of us. One to stand on a ladder and hold the camera, and the other to view through the app if it was covering what we wanted or not. The power cable was plenty long, and we were able to use the mounting clips to run it right along the edge of the wall and then down to the outside outlet. Use the punch-out holes in the outlet cover so you can keep it closed and protected against the elements. Once we had it positioned, even on very windy days, the camera doesn't move.<br/><br/>Within the app, it asks if you want to set up your location, and how detailed. "my exact address" or "my general area" which is about a 5 mile radius. When you join their 'ring neighborhood' it groups you with everyone in the area, though I'm not sure how big that is. It doesn't share your name though. Say you get an alert that someone posted a video in your neighborhood. You go to view "Neighbor 23's video" which (for example) shows a package thief stopping in front of the house, walking to the door and taking the person's package. They are also able to title and write a bit about the video. "This was on such and such street about X time of day, does anyone recognize the person?"  If local law enforcement is part of your ring neighborhood, they might ask for people to submit their videos if they also show that car or person, and to use such and such case number. Even if it's not a very good video, it still helps them establish a pattern. If I happened to have video of that car that captured their plates, or a better look at the people, I could submit that and it would only identify me as 'Neighbor XX". The numbers are assigned by what order people log into the app in that day. So one day I'm Neighbor 12 and another I'm Neighbor 27.  Of course, there are a lot of innocuous posts too. Someone might post with no video, "Hey, did anyone else just hear gunshots?" and someone else might reply, "there's kids on such and such street doing fireworks, could it have been that?" Which doesn't seem like a proper use at first, but it makes people feel safer, so it's all good.<br/><br/>The night vision light covers a pretty good area, and video quality is of course, better if you are closer, but it's pretty good.  I find that high contrast animals set it off before animals that blend in. The neighbor's black cat always sets it off when he comes scrounging, but the local foxes don't always, depending on if it catches their eyes and if there are a lot of leaves on the ground.  The two way audio is pretty good, I didn't really notice a delay when we tried it out, and the other person said the voice coming through the camera was easy to understand too. I like that I can zoom in while on live video, and also that it still records video if I am live viewing it.<br/><br/>Not only can you customize 'zones' for it to detect motion in, you can set a schedule for when you want it to work. So you aren't getting constant alerts when you have your dogs in the yard during the day, but can set it to turn on when they are in for the night. You can also set it to 'people only' detection, but I like seeing all the critters.  You can share the camera to other people or family members, so if you wanted your spouse to be able to see all the cameras too, you can share them all, but if you only wanted the dog walker to be able to see the back yard camera where the dogs are, you can do that.<br/><br/>Things I don't like:<br/>1.  Can't zoom in on a video playback.<br/>2. No 'snapshot' button. You either have to use capture software after you download the video, or your phone's screenshot feature.<br/>3. The "lights" button is slow to respond.<br/><br/>Video: Some ghosting of the deer, mostly while right in the center of the IR light.</span>

<span>RING Flood Cam Wire Plus review<br/><br/>My order arrived sooner than scheduled.  The support from RING has been excellent and they answer the phone 24/7.<br/><br/>I chose the wired unit for reliability and a white one because of our Phoenix Arizona hot sun.<br/><br/>I installed it vertically on the outside wall of my garage, about 8 feet from the floor of the driveway, facing my 2-car driveway and street.  I ran a 3-wire round power cord from an AC outlet in the ceiling of the garage – about 15 feet to the wall.  Measuring the location of where the unit is to be mounted is VERY important. I carefully calculated where the hole would be drilled through the exterior wall and stucco to the inside of the garage wall. I bought a 12” x 3/8” concrete drill bit and plastic 4” round box.<br/><br/>The hole through the wall had to be reamed out a little for the power cord to easily get through the hole, a 7/16” or ½” bit would have been better. After drilling the hole through about 13” of stucco and wood for the extension cord, I cut the plug off and poked it through to the outside. I mounted the 4” plastic round box with long screws, stripped the cord and 3 wires and wired it up per instructions.<br/><br/>The next morning, I discovered one of two tabs broke off on the plastic 4” round box and the unit was hanging with only the wire and the bottom tab.  DO NOT USE A PLASTIC 4” Round Box.  I bought a metal 4” round box and rewired and remounted the unit onto the wall. Be sure to use proper screws for mounting the 4” Round Box to the wall or surface.<br/><br/>The unit is very heavy and there are only 2 tabs on the round box to attached it to whatever surface its being mounted on.  The metal 4” Round Box with ½” threaded outlets comes with the screw plugs for the holes that will not be used.<br/><br/>The panhead screws that came in the unit for mounting the metal bracket to the round box were too high and did not allow the unit to seal completely with the foam rubber gasket against the 4” round box.  I used two Truss-head screws.  Again, the unit is heavy, so be very careful when handling and mounting it.<br/><br/>I sealed the 4” round box to the stucco wall with liquid nail to prevent rain from getting into the power cord and into the back of the unit. I painted round box and touched up the stucco.<br/><br/>Now the functions and performance… I’m disappointed in the resolution of the image when zoomed in to enlarge the image of a person. The camera apparently does not have lenses, so the depth of field is very small. The feature to physically select the motion detect area is nice. The app is a little confusing to use but after playing with it, it’s works fine.  The on-off selectable motion alarm is interesting.  It has a recorded female voice that says “Hi, you are currently being recorded” when the motion detect is triggered.<br/><br/>Overall, this unit is well worth the price and the time to install it. It has provided a nice level of comfort for added outside home security and links with my RING doorbell.  I will know more about its environmental quality after a couple summers and rainy seasons.  I subscribed to the Plus option for $100/year with video recording of all devices at home.  I get shared neighborhood alerts on security issues that RING products detect which is nice to know what is happening around our area.<br/><br/>Customer Feedback to RING:  I suggest you revise your installation video to state to only use a Metal 4” Round Box and replace the panhead screws with a flatter head screw.  Also, the resolution with a zoomed in image is very important for visual identification.  Please improve this in future revisions of this product. I would pay extra for improved resolution.</span>

<span>This camera is much better than the Ring doorbell I have. Motion pick up is good, though when it sees my dog it tells me a person is there (and yes I have the smart settings turned on).<br/><br/>The light from the camera, mounted at about 7’ is good enough for my small back yard and the immediate area is flooded well. It’s not a long throw flood light.<br/><br/>Signal strength and uptime is also much improved from the doorbell.</span>

<span>I’ve had two of these spotlight cameras for almost a year now. I have the lights to go on at dusk and off at dawn.  Dozens……..several dozens of times they come on and then go off in the middle of the night or don’t come on at all. One is very close to the router and the other is farther away.  They take turns doing this so it being signal strength doesn’t wash.  I’ve tried setting a specific time to turn on and off and that is just unreliable.  Done the reboot, moving router, rebooting router.  I’m not happy to be spending so much time trying to get these things working reliably with no success.<br/>Heads up.</span>

<span>I purchased this camera to replace a different one I had bought from Amazon because the original one was horrible and cheap. This one was a little pricier but definitely worth it. It works great for motion detection. My only complaint about that would be that I get notifications when it’s an animal even when I select “human detection”. The picture quality is great during the day but the “smart mode” for the night vision is a little wonky. I say that because when it snaps the picture for the motion detection notification, the majority of the time, it’s very dark and you can’t tell what triggered the alarm. Luckily you can view the actual event (video) in order to see what it was, but it’s a bit of a hassle. The moveable camera is pretty neat and easy to use. It successfully follows the moving object as far as possible. I’m happy with my purchase and I would recommend it to others.</span>

<span>I really like this camera. I wanted something for my shop to help keep an eye on my tools and toys. I mounted this up by some high cabinets and ran the power cord down behind my tv. The LED lights pretty bright as you can see in the last 2 photos (one with the lights off and one with them on). The night infrared is very clear as well as you can see in a photo.  The image is almost as clear as some of our other much more expensive security cameras.  The app is easy to use, just drag your finger on the screen where you want the camera to move. I like some of the features like the follow feature and 2 way intercom feature. It does not include a SD card and will only take event photos with out one.  It needs an SD card to store event recordings. I ordered a 128gb (the largest it supports) for 10bucks. Was very easy to install and setup. I will probably order a couple more of these.</span>
