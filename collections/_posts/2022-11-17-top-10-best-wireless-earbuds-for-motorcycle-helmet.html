Product Description   The Sena SMH10 Motorcycle Bluetooth 3.0 Headset and Intercom was designed to keep you connected to your riding companions over longer ranges for conversation and music sharing--up to 900 meters (980 yards). When paired with a Bluetooth-enabled phone, it'll also let you make hands-free calls. The SMH10 features a Universal Microphone Kit. The Jog Dial makes for an intuitive user interface that is much easier to control while riding. The Jog Dial default is volume control, and pushing the integrated button lets you cycle through all device functions with minimal fuss, which means you'll ride safer. The SMH10 delivers crystal-clear, natural sound through the stereo Bluetooth headset that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. The Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward and track back functions, plus each audio source has its own adjustable volume level. Integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device. You'll get up to 12 hours of talk time and 10 days of stand-by time on a single charge. And even if your companions don't have Sena gear, the SMH10 uses the Universal Intercom protocol, which allows your gear to work with theirs, regardless of brand.   Amazon.com   The SMH10-11 is a Bluetooth v3.0 + EDR Class 1 Stereo Headset with long-range Bluetooth Intercom designed specifically for motorcycles. With the SMH10-11, you can call hands-free on your Bluetooth mobile phone, listen to stereo music or voice instructions of GPS navigations by Bluetooth wirelessly, and have intercom conversations in full duplex with a passenger or other motorcycle riders. This SMH10-11 bundle comes with a universal microphone kit that includes both a boom mic and a wired mic for versatile helmet installation.  Features include Bluetooth 3.0, multi-point connection, and conferencing for up to 4 people Thanks to the latest Bluetooth v3.0 and the advanced digital processing technology, the SMH10-11 offers the best sound quality for both incoming and outgoing sound in its class.

Almost all Bluetooth MP3 players, smartphone, and audio dongles support A2DP to send stereo audio to Bluetooth headsets like the Sena SMH10-11. Enjoy Bluetooth music playback control by AVRCP: play, pause, track forward and track back.Other Bluetooth features include Multi-Pair to allow intercom functionality for 4 persons, and compatibility with select motorcycle GPS systems. Use as an intercom, or connect to your portable devicesIndividual Adjustable Volume ProfilesYou can easily decrease/increase the volume of the voice, music and intercom using Jog Dial. The SMH10-11 can save volume levels of previously connected profiles. This means that phone volume (HSP/HFP), music volume (A2DP), and intercom volumes will be saved separately and return to its own saved volume level whenever associated profile is reconnected.Profile volume adjustment is only affected during the use of its specific profile. However, when changing volume during standby mode, then volume change applies to all profiles. Alert tones like low battery warning and connection tones can only be adjusted in standby mode.Easy Installation for Most HelmetsThe SMH10-11 will fit onto various types of helmets. The universal microphone kit included in this bundle includes both a boom mic and a wire mic, and will fit onto most types of helmets. For installations which may require extra wire length, ear buds instead of speakers, and wire microphone instead of boom microphone, Sena offers different types of clamps as an additional accessory (sold separately), to allow various installations and user preferences.Two-Year WarrantyThe SMH10-11 offers peace of mind in your purchase with a 2-year warranty against workmanship defects.

<span>First you pay for what you get and I didn’t want to spend a lot on a Bluetooth headset. This is another manufacturer who doesn’t provide detailed directions in the package, for that you have to go on line. I had issues with the phone connecting to my Indian motorcycle interface couldn’t get Siri or command ride to answer or dial numbers.<br/><br/>It did work when connecting directly to my iPhone. I didn’t have any issue getting it play music from my bikes interface system (Command Ride). I will read the directions I downloaded and utilize videos to troubleshoot my phone issue. As of right now for the money I would recommend it. This recommendation is subject to change if I still have the same problem going forward.</span>

<span>I only use it for listening to music while I'm riding.  At first the music sounded terrible and I was going to return it.  Then I found if i go into my equalizer on my phone and set the bass to max and the treble to min it sounds pretty good.  The one hand controls are great and would buy another one.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is my first motorcycle communications system. I wear an Arai Signet-Q, XL, with upgraded thicker cheek pads.<br/><br/>WHY I BOUGHT THIS<br/><br/>* Wanted Bluetooth communication w/ iPhone 5<br/>* Wanted<br/>* Easier on/off removal from helmet vs. SMH5-XX models<br/>* Wanted flexibility with mounting of the mic<br/>* Sena had the best reviews and price vs. other brands<br/><br/>I've ridden with this communications system for about 2-3 months (before the weather got cold).<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/>* Easy on / off between rides - It's really easy to un-snap the unit and stash it in a tank bag or pocket when you're not wanting it on the helmet. Takes 0.5 second and is relatively easy to do IF you have the helmet off.<br/><br/>* Easy iPhone pairing - I've not had any issues with the pairing. I stash my iPhone in my Tourmaster jacket with Bluetooth enabled, hop on the bike, turn on the Sena, and I get a voice confirmation that the phone is paired.<br/><br/>* Top / bottom volume range tones - If you turn the unit all the way up or down, you get a tone to indicate that you've reached the end of the adjustment spectrum.<br/><br/>* Mic flexibility - I used the bud mic because I didn't want to be limited with a full face helmet and a boom mic. There IS a boom mic included, but it requires you to velcro attach it to the inside of the helmet shell. I MAY eventually set this up to have options -- the boom mic MAY be better for voice quality, but for compactness, the bud mic can't be beat.<br/><br/>* Battery life - The battery life is awesome. I've had it charged for almost 2 weeks and listened to it to / from work (25 mile round trip) for podcasts and music before it needed charging.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>* Placement of speakers - You need more velcro options for sticking the speakers in the helmet. The back of the speakers isn't velcro-y (???) enough by default to just stick to the liner padding outright. I stuck the included velcro pads too high and behind the ears because that was the closest place I could find that was just styrofoam shell w/o the clothe liner. I eventually moved the speakers into the ear pads themselves -- not sure if this is safe, but I couldn't get them to sit close enough to my ears to hear them.<br/><br/>* Volume of speakers for Bluetooth audio (music, podcasts, etc.) - There is a software issue -- in my opinion -- that makes all Bluetooth audio like music, podcasts, etc. too soft. Note -- these speakers are the larger units included with Sena products. There are many complaints about this unit and this type of audio. I often have to boost audio for music and podcasts while, sadly, blowing out the speakers with phone calls and other activities. Firmware updates have not helped with this issue.<br/><br/>* Bud mic quality - I opted for the multiple mic model because I didn't like the fixed boom mic model (slightly cheaper). The bud mic that I mounded just under the chin vent is unobtrusive, but I get complaints that I cannot be heard very well. Additionally, Siri on the iPhone has a lot of trouble distinguishing commands.<br/><br/>* Firmware update process - You have to register the unit to get firmware updated. This is annoying -- it's done to discourage unauthorized Sena dealers and their buyers, but it feels more like having to use a social media login to get to a service that really shouldn't require a login. I've updated the firmware once and, once you're registered, it's fine, but it's still annoying to have to register the unit.<br/><br/>* Battery warning is untimely - I like the battery life, but the voice notification for the battery is abrupt -- you get one warning that the battery is low and the unit shuts off, completely dead. Definitely NOT a "You have 10% battery left" style system like on an iPhone.</span>

<span>My wife didn't like going for motorcycle rides with me because she couldn't listen to music and was afraid to wear earbuds for fear of losing them.  This headset not only allows each of us to listen to our own music, but the intercom system works perfectly as well.  So far I'm impressed with the battery life, we have ben out several times and still haven't had to recharge after the initial charge.</span>

<span>I am happy with the performance of this intercom; I give the performance 5 stars, but there are a few rough edges that cause me to give it 4 stars overall. I use it with Garmin Zumo 590 GPS, Apple iPhone (with Garmin app and Pandora), and SiriusXM radio, and all work and play well together.<br/>  When mounting the mic clamps (provided with this item and also available separately as Sena SMH-A0301 Helmet Boom Microphone Clamp Kit) I discovered you can crack the mic clamp (cracks horizontally on either side of the electrical contacts port opening), if you deform it in any way when you tighten the clamp screws. The mic clamp material is plastic. An 'extra plastic shim piece' is provided that can be used to add thickness to the body of the mic clamp. If the clamp does not fit the exact contour of your helmet I recommend using the additional plastic shim provided.  The 'extra plastic shim piece' has double-sided tape on it and can be used without the thin metal clamp and screws that are discussed in the instructions as the preferred method of mounting. You have to replace the provided two screws with longer ones so you can use the 'extra plastic shim piece' along with the thin metal backing clamp - this is what I did and recommend, if your helmet has a contour that deforms the mic clamp in any way when you tighten the clamp screws, or the mic clamp will eventually crack. (If the mic clamp cracked while riding the intercom would almost surely fall out of the mic clamp.) One of mine developed cracks after being installed for two weeks without cracking - crack detected before riding).  The provided screws for the thin metal clamp (that goes inside the helmet) are M3 about 8mm long. The longer screws (not provided) that are needed to use with the thin metal clamp and the provided 'extra plastic shim piece' need to be around 12mm long. (I had and assortment of socket head M3 screws on hand I and didn't measure the exact length I used.) My experience with SENA Customer Service was excellent and they replaced my cracked mic clamp under Warranty.<br/>  I have read reviews that describe that the SENA intercom - when used so that it is installed (snapped into place) and un-snapped from the mic-clamp every time the bike is stopped - as eventually developing problems with the electrical contacts. This is surprising because the contacts are high quality gold plated type. From my experience so far, I believe there are two reasons people may experience these electrical contact problems:<br/>  1) As I have described above, if the mic clamp is deformed in any way, it affects how the electrical contacts mate up when the intercom is snapped into the clamp. If when you un-snap the intercom (to remove it), and it is at all difficult, this is an indication that the mic clamp is deformed and flattened more than it should be - I would expect some type of problem to develop. (Until mine eventually cracked, I didn't have an electrical contact problem.)<br/>  2)  Unrelated to any deforming of the mic clamp, When you snap and un-snap the intercom from the mic clamp there is a lower tongue on the intercom that fits into a slot on the mic clamp to provide the lower retention mechanism. This tongue in slot system provides excellent retention, but it does not guide the intercom into the mic clamp so that the upper snap lines up perfectly. As a result, you may apply side pressure, toward the front or back of the helmet, on the intercom to get the upper snap to align while you are pushing in on it to get it to snap in. Repeatedly putting side pressure on the contacts (to align the upper snap) while pushing in on the intercom will eventually damage the contacts. If you look to align the upper snap before you rotate it toward the helmet to snap it in place, you can snap it into place without putting any side pressure on the electrical contacts, and prevent any damage to them.  Granted it would have been great if the SENA design engineers had been able to foresee this problem but all in all I believe they did a good job. I believe engineering relied too heavily on the high quality of the contacts to prevent this problem with possibly applying side pressure while attempting to snap in. I also believe that using a little care to align the upper snap before rotation the intercom toward the helmet, and into place, will prevent this problem.</span>

<span>2-month update on my experience with this helmet communicator.  This unit is perfect, just get it and be done.<br/><br/>After 2 months and 2,000 miles of riding with the Cardo Packtalk Special Edition, I have nothing but HIGH PRAISE for this unit when used with 3M PELTOR E-A-R buds Noise Isolating Headphones EARbud2600N (also on Amazon) .  When I bought this Cardo unit, I felt it was wickedly expensive for what it was, but now I'm so glad to have chosen it.  In my view, the expense was completely worth it - having natural voice control of the unit (and my phone) is amazing and works very well for me.  Audio quality on both ends of phone calls is very good.  I have also been able to pair and communicate with other bluetooth helmet units, and have not had any opportunity yet to try pairing with DMC units.<br/><br/>Hot Tip:  When used with an iPhone, using Siri and constructing smart Shortcuts, it is possible to control your device by voice in ways that would otherwise be difficult to do while riding with protective gear on, such as to simply switch from your ride tracking app to the Cardo app.  With this Cardo unit and the iPhone Shortcut app, there is no need to pull over and remove gear just to do that super-simple action.<br/><br/>Original Review Content: Tons of utility in this product - easy to install, configure and use.  Great app, excellent and very easy to use voice control.  Kind of cool that it also receives FM radio stations.  Where it fails for me is due only to the protective gear that I use when I ride, which is with a full-face helmet and hearing protectors, which makes it very hard for me to hear streamed music using the helmet speakers.  A giant selling point for this particular product are the included 45mm “JBL speakers”…and they’re completely and utterly useless to me.  HOWEVER, those fancy helmet speakers connect to the unit using a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, so removing the helmet speakers and plugging in a pair of 3M Peltor E-A-R headphones (20-30dB NRR) makes the system work perfectly for me.  The base mount is very solid and holds the unit securely in place on the helmet.  It is easy for me to recommend this unit, with the one caveat that if you are also wearing hearing protection, you likely will need to separately purchase some wired hearing protection earbuds to connect to the unit in order to hear the audio while driving.  Ride for the slide, wear your gear!</span>

<span>Bottom line: It works as advertised and I'm about to buy a 2nd. Anyone expecting dolby surround sound or 12 speaker car audio quality... doesn't understand acoustics and the environment this operates in. Do I wish it was more robust sounding audio, yes. But it is a good balance of on the road entertainment and still being able to track what's happening in your environment, YES!<br/><br/>Longer Version:<br/>Ok, so I've had this and used it on my daily commute for about 4 months now. So far I've never run out of battery, but I've not been on a ride longer than 4 hours yet. However, I've gone 2 week or so without charging it with roughly 30-40 min round trip runs. Still, not the advertised lifespan tested, but again no issues. I've only paired up with someone once. Worked without any headache. I bought mainly for audio navigation and music. Both have worked pretty flawlessly.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling is quite good. I've had trouble with people hearing me on a call when testing it in my apartment (I think it was too quiet in my apartment for the noise filtering to understand lol). But it seems to work great when on my bike. At 80 mph, they can still hear me as well as 25mph. At pretty much any speed, I'm told that the volume coming through on the call is low, but clear. I haven't discovered a setting that seems to impact that. It's not ideal, but it does allow me to flawlessly answer or make calls if necessary without stopping or any fumbling or fuss. Practice using the button to hang up on a call. I haven't discovered a voice command to hang up and it took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure that you had to press a button to end the call.<br/><br/>Music - the big one. Look, if you want to blast your music in your ear while riding, I'd humbly suggest reconsider the safety of that. But that's also what headphones are for. Having said that, I'm a music guy and I want to have tunes rolling while I ride. This is my first helmet system. So I can't compare it to anything else, but I am an audiophile and if you heard how strong, full, balanced, and clear my system is in my car, you'd know I spend a lot of time and effort getting it right. This system just works. I actually think it sounds very good. For those that claim they can't hear it or it's unimpressive, I don't know what you were expecting from a small scale speaker competing with 85-100db from road, engine, and wind noise in even the better helmets. But 2 things have made a big difference for me. Make sure your volume level on your phone is turned up pretty much all the way. This seems to have a very real impact to the volume range of the system for me. Also, to protect my ears, I ride with some Alpine riding ear plugs in that claim they filter out the white noise and spare reduce the strain on your ears. I think they do that well and a great investment. I also find that I can actually hear my music much better when I wearing those plugs than without and at a greater range of volume levels.<br/><br/>I'm about to purchase my second unit for my second helmet. I have a HJC RPHA 11 and a RPHA 90. One for short runs and imo improved safety. The other is for the longer hauls I've started running. So far this has been running in the 11 with the full face mic. I'll install on the 90 with the modula mic and update if I find a noticeable performance difference. It might help that I'm also on a semi quiet bike (2018 Versys 650) without burning cash on any aftermarket pipe. I also have an aftermarket windshield that is very effective. But even when I have that dropped down for some airflow I don't notice much, if any drop off in hearing my music. Weirdly, I feel like podcasts also tend to come through more clearly. But you have fewer audio waves fighting the environment to reach your ears. So to me I suppose that makes sense.<br/><br/>I spent the first 30 years of my life paycheck to paycheck. So even with the resources now to buy premium products, I can't shake the habit of bang for buck buying. I think this is a great bang for buck if it fits your budget and if comms and audio while you ride are important to you. If there are better options, I'd say this is at very least not a wrong choice.</span>

<span>This has been one of the best purchases I've made for my motorcycle riding.  The unit was pretty simple to install once I figured out how to take apart my helmet.  All the parts you would need are included in the box and the instructions are clear and well written.  There is a YouTube channel from CARDO, that covers all the basics of the install and using the units.  I'd highly recommend watching the videos before you start installing the units.  Once installed and setup on my helmet, I downloaded the app frrom CARDO (CARDO CONNECT) and installed it on my phone.  This really simplifies using the headset and configuring the units for a ride.  I also connected the PACKTALK Bold units to my computer to update the firmware to the latest version.  The process was super simple and can be done by anyone with basic computer skills.  The update is done via a download of a program to check for updates and then using the CARDO community website to install the new firmware.  On the CARDO community site, you can customize your headsets and prepare them for use.  I was able to set all of my FM radio stations, configure the audio settings (voice control, auto volume, etc.) and name the device for easy identification during bluetooth paring with my phone.  After the easy setup, it was time to hook the unit to my helmet.  The unit just clicks in and fits nice and secure on the side of your helmet.  I powered the unit on and put the helmet on.  The unit communicates to you via voice and lets you know it's powered up.  This is where the fun begins.  If you pull out the quick guide from the box, you can learn all the voice commands in just a couple minutes.  Other than setting up a DMC or Bluetooth intercom, most everything can be done via voice.  You can turn on the FM radio, turn on the media player, turn up/down the volume and communicate with your cell phone assistant.  The voice commands, in my mind make this thing worth every penny you pay for it.  I like the idea that you can keep your hands on the motorcycle and still operate the headset with ease.  Once you finally get on the bike and head out for a ride, communicating with a passenger or group of riders is simple and works very clearly.  The noise cancelling and auto volume work great and react fairly quickly.  I haven't ridden yet with another rider, so I can't really comment on how easy it is to pair with others using a non CARDO unit.  I will update the reveiw once I get a chance to try this.  I have however ridden with a passenger on my bike using the same PACKTALK BOLD units.  WOW!! IT was super nice to be able to talk to my wife while we were riding.  So much easier to communicate with each other.  I can say that talking with a rider is as simple as talking to the other person.  There is a small delay from when you talk and when the rider hears you, but it was not bad at all.  If you want the real benefit of having good communications with your rider, it's safety.  On our ride, my wife was able to spot some deer near the road well before I saw them.  She also was another set of eyes for me when we were turning into traffic from a dead stop on a blind hill.  I looked up hill and didn't see a car and started to roll out when my wife told me to stop as a car was coming over the hill.  There are so many reasons why this may be the best addition I've made to my riding gear and I encourage you to seriously consider buying this unit.  I love being able to answer my cell phone and hear navigation instructions without ever lifiting my hand off the bike.  The overall experience has been excellent and I would not heistate to recommend this to all my riding buddies.  BUY ONE NOW!!  You won't be sorry.</span>

Bose Sport Earbuds are designed to energize your exercise with acclaimed lifelike sound and a comfortable secure fit. Get ready to beat your personal best, again and again. Bose patented acoustic port design and premium, high-efficiency drivers combine to deliver big sound from a small acoustic package. Bose signature Volume-Optimized Active EQ automatically adjusts the bass, midrange, and treble based on how loud or soft you play your music. And Bose new StayHear Max tips create an airtight seal with your ear canal — critical for hearing the deep low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and for blocking the ambient noise around you so you can focus on your music and your workout. Bose Sport Earbuds come with three sizes of StayHear Max tips, so you can find the right fit for you. Every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep your Bose Sport Earbuds securely in place — without need of an ear hook — no matter how much you shake your head or jump up and down.Bose Sport Earbuds go through rigorous quality testing for durability. They’re also rated IPX4 for water resistance, which means they’re protected against sweat and light rain. The electronics inside are wrapped in special materials that protect them from moisture, so your earbuds stay in top shape, just like you. Bose Sport Earbuds feature a capacitive touch interface. On the right Earbud, tap to play or pause music and to answer calls. And on the left Earbud, double-tap to engage a Shortcut function of your choice like checking your battery level. If you get a phone call, instead of interrupting your workout, simply tap the right Earbud or press and hold it to reject. If you answer, you’ll hear the call clearly in both ears. Meanwhile, your caller will hear you clearly, too — thanks to the beam forming microphone array that separates your voice from surrounding noise.Bose Sport Earbuds provide up to 5 hours of battery life per charge. They’re charged by placing them in the included charging case. If the case is charged, it will automatically charge the earbuds. The status lights on each Earbud will pulse white, while they charge before turning solid white and then off when fully charged. When the case is fully charged, it can provide a 15-minute quick charge for up to 2 more hours or two full charges for up to 10 more hours.Bose Sport Earbuds offer complete freedom of movement. As long as you’re within 30 feet (9 meters) of your device, you’ll hear whatever you’re playing. And with Bose custom-designed antennas hidden inside each Earbud, dropouts are rare.Bose Sport Earbuds connect to the free Bose Music app, which lets you name your earbuds, set the controls the way you like them, check your battery, and more.

<span>Bought these on my boyfriend's recommendation, the tips make them fit and stay very well, they don't hurt my ears like other ear buds and don't feel bulky like a lot of them.<br/>They didn't have any directions for touch controls and I can't figure out any...do they have touch control?  With other ear bud brands I can use one bud at a time and I often do to extend listening time and remain aware of my surroundings...with these if I remove the left bud the right will continue to play but if I remove the right bud the left will not continue to play which is pretty frustrating.  Also I use these to connect to my computer for gaming and to my phone for audible listening, switching between the two is quite finicky, I am used to having to turn off Bluetooth on one device to get buds to connect to something other than what they last connected to, but with these even when I last connected to the computer and I try to connect to it again they go for the phone first.  Also they take forever to connect a lot of the time and several times have failed to charge when placed back in the case and often don't seem to turn on when removed from the case and placed in my ears...I have to replace the right bud in the case and remove it sometimes several times before they will turn on and start trying to connect.<br/>Overall, I could be more impressed, especially for the price point.</span>

<span>I own Bose QC 35 wireless II headphones, and the Soundsport Wireless Free earbuds. Both pair simultaneously with with my smartphone and tablet through the Bose Connect app, so I rarely have to worry about connecting/disconnecting a device. My Soundsport Free’s battery finally died after two years. They are great earbuds...great fit, sound. So it was natural to order the new Bose Sport earbuds to replace them.<br/><br/>To my surprise, the new Sports required that I use the new “better” Bose Music app. Whatever it’s mysterious advantages, the new app will only connect the earbuds to one device at a time, so I have to swap the connection every time I switch between my smartphone and tablet. This is better? And I have to use two different apps for two Bluetooth wireless headphones from the same manufacturer? Makes no sense. Bose...it’s simple. One app that can control all your Bose wireless products...like Sonos. Really your current approach makes you look very second tier from a software perspective. Get with the program.<br/><br/>The Bose Sport earbuds don’t fit quite as well as the Soundsport Frees for me. I use the midsize tips, and they look to be the same size on both but on the Sports the material is a little stiffer and more grippy (intentional I’m sure), but this makes them have more pressure against the ear which is a little less comfortable than the Soundsports, but I don’t notice after a while and they are still comfortable, just not AS comfortable. All depends on your ears though, and they are light and will never fall out, and a great design overall IMHO.<br/><br/>The controls operate through touchpads on each earphone. People rightfully complained that there were no volume controls, but they added it to right earbud through a software update and it’s hit or miss but works okay when running, though very imprecise. The overall limited controls...no ability to skip back a track, but can skip forward, doesn’t really bother me, but maybe it does others. Overall I think the approach is to have fairly simple controls on the earbuds that you can operate without searching for a little button. I think it works overall, and once you get used to it you can execute basic controls without breaking a step - but you’ll still “miss” a lot. Oh...and a  feature where if you take out the right earbud the music stops is actually very useful..a feature I can say really makes things easier for a runner like me seeing people I know on the street.<br/><br/>The sound is excellent, clean and deep bass (not “tight” or punchy) but accurate, with a wide soundstage with clear highs that you can play loud without hurting your ears. The sound doesn’t hit you up we the head with anything...just tries to present the whole picture accurately, and does this very well.<br/><br/>The phone capability is okay. Fine. No better than the Soundsport Free. Sometimes people can hear me and sometimes they can’t. Blech.<br/><br/>I’ve considered returning them, but for my use...mostly for running, working out and walking, they work well. Still pretty comfortable, very secure, good sound. Case is small enough for my needs but not svelte as many prefer. Battery life doesn’t compete well with competitors. There’s no reason Bose could not have added more charging hours in the larger case. What a miss competitively. But for me, 15 hours from a fully charged case and earbuds is plenty. There’s no noise cancellation...but I want to hear the cars coming. Not a need for me for this device.<br/><br/>The software thing really grates though. They need to add multipoint connectivity for this device via the app, and allow older devices to use the new Bose Music app. Like soon. They also should add some equalizer capability on the app.<br/><br/>Another weird thing. The bluetooth connectivity button is on the case, not the earbuds. Probably a way to make the earbudy ligher or simpler. BUT, as happened to me, if you go out or on a run and the earbuds are not connected to your device, there is no way to connect them without the case. I did the software update which disconnected them, then went on a run and by the time I realized this I was a half mile away and had to go without. Annoying. Im not sure what advantage this confers to the consumer. Maybe that's why the case is larger and doesnt have more battery supply. Who knows? I wish manufacturers would explain why they do things like this.<br/><br/>From a competitive feature standpoint, these earbuds don’t compare well with, say, Jabras, but if you appreciate the sound and comfortable, secure fit, you might end up preferring them anyway, especially as new software updates come out (I hope).</span>

<span>Ordered these headphones two months ago when they released. I'm a pretty serious cyclist and I have used these nearly daily for my rides, which last anywhere from two to six hours. I also live in a tropical part of the US, so I tend to sweat a lot.<br/><br/>Before these earbuds, I was using Shure wired earbuds for my rides. Those earbuds were not necessarily meant for my type of training, especially when I sweat as much as I do when I ride. I landed on the Bose SoundSports for their proposed protection from sweat and their earbud design. I have used Bose SoundSports a couple of generations ago and I always preferred their emphasis on fitting the concha of the ear as opposed to the traditional inner ear canal fit.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>* The fit is quite comfortable for me. I cannot stand traditional IEMs for their extremely uncomfortable fit (just my opinion), especially if I plan on using them for several hours straight. The size earbud I chose is close to the original SoundSports I used four years ago. After a couple of rides, I could hardly feel them. The tight fit also prevents any wiggle room or potential for falling out, so when I'm in the drops or sprinting I'm not concerned at all about these running away.<br/><br/>* They are not completely sound-proof, which is great for me when I need to listen to traffic and other people while riding. This means I can start a ride wearing these and not have to take them off other than to talk to people and to take breaks.<br/><br/>* The automation is really useful actually. Automatically detecting when the right earbud has left my ear to pause music, then detecting when I put it back on to resume music is probably my favorite of this aspect. Answering calls by putting on the earbud is okay too, but in reality by the time you open the case and put on the earbud (plus the time it takes to connect to your device) your incoming call has probably already ended. But, going back to the first bit of automation, there's honestly no better feeling than riding up to a friend, taking out the right earbud, and stopping your music with little to no effort. I'm sure other earbuds do this too, but I'm new to the true wireless scene.<br/><br/>* The touch controls make riding without pulling out your phone an easy feat. The option to skip tracks with a double-tap on the left bud, play/pause with a double tap on the right bud, and now a swipe up or down to adjust the volume all help me keep my attention on the road.<br/><br/>* The call quality is amazing, according to everyone I call while wearing these. I speak softly and mumble sometimes out of habit, but these earbuds adjust and pick up even the softest of rumblings I might mutter. They also amplify my voice enough to be heard by everyone involved in a call, thus improving my ability to articulate points beyond belief. These earbuds have made it into my daily carry because of this.<br/><br/>* So far, these have been completely impervious to sweat. I'm almost afraid that I'm going to break them in time because since buying them two months ago I have not had a need to clean them in any way (besides the actual rubber earbuds).  Hopefully, these will continue to resist all the sweat I throw at them (which is a lot considering that I wear jawbreaker glasses and have helmet straps pooling sweat around my ear).<br/><br/>* The battery life is strong and perfect for my use. Since my typical training ride lasts anywhere from 1:45 to 2 hours, I never have to worry about battery life. Even during my extra long rides, I can very easily take a break from my music, let them charge for 30 or so minutes, and continue my ride without care for battery life at all.<br/><br/>In-betweeners -<br/>* The sound quality is a bit more trebly than the Shure earbuds I used. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I definitely don't mind more or less bass than usual. Some people might choose against these for this reason.<br/>* Being a Bluetooth device, the connection between the earbuds and your device cannot always be perfect. I went from using wired to wireless and I had to learn this the hard way. I believe it's a fact of life for me now, but this is something that will only get better with time (I hope). Intermittently, my music will cut in and out as if I'm getting a call, then resume as normal. My phone also seems to be the culprit with a lot of other Bluetooth issues. Using IP voice comm apps like Teams or Discord will cause the microphone to produce this "shrill noise". I can work around this by using those apps on my work phone instead, so I definitely don't blame the earbuds at all for this. Otherwise, the call quality is excellent.<br/>* These are very reliant on the Bose app. Because I am just getting into the latest generation of Bose products, I was really unaware of this aspect before buying the earbuds. Not saying this would've deterred me, but it does make joining the product to other devices a little more complicated. It's definitely possible to connect these earbuds to your phone without the Bose app, but doing so makes you lose out on all of the extra functionality and the earbuds play at a much lower volume than they're capable of with the Bose app.<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>* Taking calls with these earbuds while riding a bike is not possible. The wind blasting into the microphones renders them completely useless during calls, so every call I get (depending on the urgency) will require me to pull over and take a break. This happens at speeds as low as 10-15 mph, so really these cannot function for calls whatsoever while riding a bike.<br/>* While I praised the fit initially, in the beginning, I did have issues finding the perfect size earbud for me. The type of earbud has changed from the earlier generations of Bose SoundSports to now, so I did have a hard time adapting to the different fit. My ears were a bit sore in the beginning, but, as I said before, I eventually adapted and now I can hardly tell I'm wearing them.<br/><br/>There's honestly not a whole lot more I can say about these earbuds. This is all just off the top of my head... All in all, these earbuds have out-preformed in almost every way I expected. I bought them really only to listen to music on my rides without being burdened with a wire, and now I can't imagine not using them daily for calls and such.</span>

<span>JBL has outdone themselves again with these earbuds. If I could give it 4.5, that is where it'd be.<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>Right away the packaging is really nice. You see the earbuds on the back of the case along with all the features. The charging case for the ear buds has a nice matte black sheen to it. It's very compact making it super portable and it feels really smooth to hold too. The earbuds also have a (satisfying) neat magnetic clip when putting it back in the case so that's a cool plus from me. The instruction manual is also really user-friendly and has nice visuals of what tapping or a press-hold does. You get 2 different size earbud covers that aren't already on the earbuds themselves so there's S, M, and L--a standard for most JBL products. The last thing in the packaging is the tiny bright orange USB-C cable.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>Like what it says on the front packaging: PURE BASS. That's what you get with these JBL earbuds. This is where they excel on, but not so much on the treble department. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but if it was a little higher without adjusting the EQ in-app, this would get that last star (with ANC). Having the right earbud suction thingies helps a lot so if you're not getting that right sound, try the different suction thingies they provide because these sound great.<br/><br/>Noise-cancelling:<br/>I'll talk about this really quick because this was apparently a feature that I had to rate on, but I give it 3 stars, but 3.5 sounds more like it. Having active noise cancelling would be a 5 star, but with the sound on half, you wash out most of what's going on around you with the sound quality.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Having physical buttons on these earbuds is the way to go compared to touch controls. You can do 1 earbud mode which reduces the amount of functions you have on the one working earbud, but hey, you can hear the rest of the world better. It works with all the assistants like Alexa, Carmen, Ollie, Google, and whoever else you use. With the physical buttons it's really easy to pause, play, skip, rewind, all of that good stuff.<br/><br/>Battery: I've used these for hours and hours and with the combination of having it charged in its case, I've never had the "battery low" warning. It has around 8 hours of playtime and with the case, it charges back to full in 2 hours. The case itself has supposedly 24 hours of charge on it, but I've never had to get to that amount of use.<br/><br/>I got these mainly for running since the bulky over-the-ear headphones got in the way of my hair blah blah so these minimal earbuds were a good replacement. The suction thingies were very useful and is probably why it stayed inside my ear the entire time. The fast pair function is really nice and right out of the box connected to my phone and laptop really quick.<br/><br/>Would I recommend these earbuds to others? Totally. For around $70, these earbuds are one of the best, long-lasting earbuds in this price range. It doesn't cure cancer, but it uplifts you with the sweet power of music.</span>

<span>I have had these for about 6 mnths now and i love, love, love..d them!! They last FOREVER charged and fit really snug! I love that you can be phone calls with either or both not just the right. About a month or so ago my right 1 is having ussues charging. I cant just put them in the charger and walk away now, i have to position it in a certain spot and make sure it doesnt slip from that spot. Ive noticed the left is starting to do this as well which prompted me to write the review. It sux if they will stop charging soon, i use them while working! I have cheaper 1s that i have washed and dryed in the washer machine and they have been tosseled, dropped and god knows what else and they still kicking!! Kinda sucky but i REALLY DO LOVE these! They definitely sound better and last longer than my cheap 1s, as long as i get a full charge in them lol that is the biggest complaint. 1 other small, tiny complaint is you cant answer your phone with them, you have to physically answer on your phone, but thats not a BIG deal lol i do recommend these but mabe baby the charging dock?!!!</span>

<span>I bought these to use at work during downtime and breaks. I got the white to match my phone, but I work in a warehouse so the transfer of dirt and grime which is difficult to remove from the white (especially the case). The performance of these headphones has been amazing though. The battery life has been great. Between the usage time and standy by time and the fact that sometimes I forget to charge the case....I've never had a dead battery yet.<br/>Noise cancelation is good and still if the volume is low enough (or in my case if you only use a solo bud) you can still hear surrounding noise if necessary.<br/>Sound quality is high end. The bass delivery is rich with nice range in mids and highs as well.<br/>This is an excellent quality product. I'm very pleased with these ear buds without having to spend the high end of Bose earbuds. More of a mid level range... but excellent quality!</span>

<span>Long time Sena user, I had the 20,20s,30k and 50s. This is what I didn't like about Sena. 1st sometimes my jacket would bunch up and when I turned my head it would rub the knob and turn the volume up. Which wouldn't be so bad but the max volume tone was very loud. Even when I turned the volume up on my own I hated that loud beep.<br/><br/>2nd when I used Google assistant that would be very loud too. If i turned it down then it would be fine for a few days but it would always go back to being extremely loud.<br/><br/>Things never really improved with them over each generation. The app was not user friendly.<br/><br/>When I bought my 50s I bought a 2 pack. Though I usually ride alone I do sometimes have a passenger. I was headed on a moto camping trip. It was about a 5 hour ride and I was about 45 min from home when the battery on my Sena 50s died. I intentionally brought the unit that didn't get as much use. I pulled over plugged it and and rode for about an hour. it said it was fully charged so I threw it back on and it lasted less than an hour and died again. I ended up riding with a power bank in my jacket with my Sena unit plugged in the entire 3 day trip. I was able to warranty it but it shouldn't have happened.<br/><br/>So I waited for the next generation cardo unit to come out. I watched a few review videos and decided to try it.<br/><br/>I didn't know how I would like the button layout because I was use to Sena. After a month of heavy use I quickly learned it is a lot more intuitive. The next track button is a lot better than Sena push in the knob and roll.<br/><br/>Battery life on this is absolutely incredible. I rode for 9 hours today starting from a full charge and I rode most of the way with the volume maxed out. When I got home and turned off the unit it told me the battery life was at 75 percent. Which I also like, every time you turn it off it tells you how much battery is left.<br/><br/>The magnetic mount is a genius solution. It works extremely well. The max volume sound is a light beep and my jacket doesn't hit the knob like it did with Sena.<br/><br/>The app is more intuitive and easy to use. I haven't used these to communicate with another rider yet. I will say nobody seems to hear a difference between call quality compared to my senaa 50s. also I don't know if the sound quality is any better than my Sena 50s.<br/><br/>One thing I think Sena did well was the USB charging cable that updated the firmware so it was always up to date. Cardo you use the app to update it. I haven't done that yet.<br/><br/>This is a great product and I highly recommend them.</span>

<span>Overall this product makes a big difference for me while riding, font need to look into my phone since it is siri enabled. Speakers are incredibly loud highly doubt people even listen to them at the loudest volume, after about 80 percent volume you do begin to listen to the music distorted, so there is definitely  room for improvement from jbls side.

<span>I was very bummed when I took my first ride. I could hear the speakers when I was idle and nothing when riding on the road. Little did I know I had headphone safety turned on to 80 dB I still have it turned on to 100dB but was finally able to hear podcasts and understand words. I have a straight pipe exhaust so I was easily producing ~90dB on the road.<br/><br/>You can even wear hearing protection and hear podcasts clearly with these.<br/><br/>The quality of the sound is decent enough for what it is. Really audio should be low on the priority list when you need to be aware of the road and take in the scenery.<br/><br/>These allow for awareness of your GPS turns coming up, hazards on the road, calls coming in if you need to know, and the occasional background music to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>I have not used the com feature, but expect it to be satisfactory since podcasts are easy to hear. The mic has been tested to do commands with Siri on the road and I do not have to repeat myself.</span>

<span>I have really small ear canals so this type of blue tooth earphones is the only kind that works OK for me.  They are easy to operate and the sound is clear.  They aren't noise cancelling.  They are convenient to carry around and make it easy to listen to programs from my phone.</span>

<span>I have had Beats and Beats Flex earbuds for years now. My last pair finally stopped wanting to charge and one of the buds fell in the pool so I couldn't use them anymore :( THEY ARE NOT WATERPROOF which is super sad because i love to shower it swim and listen to music or podcasts but I can't do that with these. I don't understand how Beats doesn't have a waterproof set yet. It's very sad since their quality is great. These types of rest buds are the only kind that I can get to stay in my ears comfortably. They have great sound quality for music and phone calls and the battery lasts through the day so I only have to change it at night. I like that it has the neck strap so I don't have to worry about losing one of them. I actually just bought two more pairs because I like them so much &amp; so I can always have a backup set that's charged. I just wish they had better waterproofing. Oh, and how could I forget..... THEY DON'T COME WITH A CHARGER!! Well they come with a USB C cable but not the part that plugs into the outlet. What's up with that??? I don't believe it mentioned that in the ad.</span>

<span>I purchased these to use when running and riding my mountain bike.  I've had zero issues with them and I'm quite impressed with the battery life.  The sound quality seems excellent to me, an average person with no musical skills.  My ONLY complaint is the charging cable, which is kind of a big deal and caused it to lose a star.  It would be nice if it were the standard USB connection instead of this weird thing that it is.  I can only plug in to charge if I have my laptop with me.  This is a huge annoyance since I also have no technical skills and don't know the first thing about what kind of adapter I might need.</span>

<span>Update:<br/>Knocking a star off. Still a decent headset. Discovered a couple, to me, significant deficiencies, since my original review.<br/><br/>1) Battery life is far lower than rated 12 hour. getting about 8, maybe. Mostly listening to podcasts.<br/>2) Lack of low battery warning. If there is one, I never heard it.  The other earphones I have used all have clear warnings , usually stating '20% battery remaining' and such. I have not had any warning, and ran out of battery 2 times so far.<br/>3) the buttons on the neckband are really not logical, or marked what they do.<br/>4) battery indicator is on the other side of the neckband than the charging port.  Not a big deal, just odd.<br/>5) no 'over top of ear' wire routing like others I have used. Just a preference.<br/>6) I miss having an add-on charged battery to greatly increase the use of the product without having to find a charging port. Not easy when out of the home/car.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I have found the phone function and quality is very good.  No complaints from anyone I have talked to about the sound quality on my end. Most headsets I have used were bad to very bad. These are very good.<br/><br/>From a dead battery, I charged about 20 minutes, got about 20% battery (according to the app).  I guess that is pretty good.  Using the headset as i type. Battery is now 15% after about 25 minutes of use (podcast listening)<br/><br/>Still don't like the neckband.  Prefer over top of ear, tight around the head wire style with nothing on my neck.<br/><br/>Still, the sound quality for music, when equalized using your music app, is very good. Sound and mic quality are very good for phone.<br/><br/>The business end of this set is there.<br/><br/>Original review below:<br/>Coming from an older pair of similar Jaybird headphones.  Purchased these because they seemed similar.<br/>Seems a lot of review are doing pros and cons. Seems reasonable. Impressions below pros/cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>lightweight<br/>fits my ears<br/>fast charging<br/>simple controls (also a con)<br/>good sound..well..after using your music app's EQ to adjust to your hearing level<br/>phone/mic seems very good.<br/><br/>cons<br/>disposable product. No adding/changing batteries that I can see.<br/>during quiet songs, you can hear sound transmitted from your clothing, etc. Not terrible. Just something new and odd.<br/>non-intuitive simple controls (simple to learn, however)<br/>no app to fine tune the headphones to your hearing level and tones to your ears.<br/>out of the box, sound is flat and zero bass. using your music app like Amazon Prime Music, you can tune an equalizer and greatly improve the sound<br/>relatively low volume<br/>not crazy about feeling the cord on my earlobes and the band on my neck.<br/><br/>Impressions:<br/>Not bad for the price.  Initially, I thought they were horrible. Turned on the EQ in Amazon Prime Music, which fixed that !  Out of the box , the sound is unimpressive, to say the least. Not crazy about the semi-rigid band. I liked the all wire of the Jaybird, as you could have it conform to your head with no movement for a real nice fit, making you even forget you had them on.  These, you always know you have them on, as you can feel them on your earlobe and on your neck.<br/><br/>Even with the annoyances, will give it 5 stars. Will revisit the review if there is any significant update<br/><br/>Nutshell, they are almost identical to a $15 set I have, in all respect except these do sound a lot better.  Is it worth the price... ehhh I don't know. As I listen to music writing this, I am liking them a LOT less than my old Jaybird Freedom.  The sound quality (after setting up the EQ) is better, however, but the neck band is getting more annoying</span>

<span>I have had these for about a year now and unlike my many other pairs of earbuds from other companies these have lasted and still work! Battery life is decent as well. After a year I charge them every other day or so and if I use them constantly all day I will have to do it daily.  They don’t have the quality of sound that my over the ear phones do with noise cancellation, but they are decent. I use them mostly for work meetings and listening to books/podcasts so the bass and music isn’t a priority. If it is for you these are OK. I am really glad I bought them since they’ve lasted this long.</span>

<span>These earbuds were super easy to pair to my phone. Then I needed to use them with my laptop, and they were easy to pair with it. Then I wanted to use them with my tablet, and they were easy to pair with that. When I want to use them with my laptop or tablet, I just click the "connect" button on the device to pair them. These earbuds will connect to any device that you have your Google signed in. For other devices, you just go through the normal pairing process of scanning for available devices and pair. The sound quality is exactly what I expect from JBL, are super comfortable, and fit perfectly in my ears.<br/><br/>The battery life is great as well. The case stays charged it seems like forever, and I have never actually had it die on me yet. I just plug it up and charge it about once per week, and even then it still has charge left on it. The case charges the buds, and the buds last about 6 hours for continual podcast listening. I love the fact that you can use these individually as well. I need to be able to hear in my surroundings, so I use 1 earbud at a time most of the time.</span>

<span>These are good. The battery life and charging case, the sound, all the normal stuff. But they have a known problem. They quit working as a pair.<br/><br/>I spent 3 weeks trying to fix them and found a lot of information. JBL knows they are sometimes not "paired as a set" when shipped and will replace them. But don't send them back until you try this!<br/><br/>What happens: one side or the other will stop working. They are not a set anymore. Not stereo. You can connect to R or L but not both as a unit. JBL help site says reset them by holding down the button for 10 seconds. They also want you to take them out of the case while the case is plugged in to the wall socket for charging. Then put them back in and hit the button on the L one 3 times in a row. Then do that on the R one. They should both blink blue then turn white when they become a pair.<br/><br/>NONE OF THAT WORKED FOR ME.<br/><br/>DO THIS: Unpair them from your phone. Put them both in the case and then take them back out. Hold one in each hand and push both buttons 3 times at the same time. It took me about 4 attempts but the lights turn solid blue when you get it. Then a prompt will show up on your phone that they are ready to connect. Click yes. Done.<br/><br/>More info: mine worked when I first bought them and then quit working as a pair. Nothing I found online worked. This fixed them today. I hope it helps you also. These are not cheap. I didn't want to throw working earbuds away.</span>

Superb audio quality, nice weight to em and snaps nicely into the case to charge. Pretty sure its magnetic. My only complaint is the battery life. Wish it lasted a few more hours. Still worth the money imo.</span>
