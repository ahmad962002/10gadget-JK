<span>I bought this camera just before a big scuba diving trip to Cocos Island off the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica. Before leaving I tested it briefly. It seemed OK. Only after I got out in the middle of nowhere did I realize the battery would not fully charge. When I got home I sent it to SeaLife to correct the problem. They received it on a Wednesday and shipped it back out on the exact same day! They clearly didn't take any time to investigate the problem. Upon receipt, I didn't receive anything other than a packing slip with a notation "Service". The battery charging problem was not corrected and, in fact, got worse. I was left with a useless $600 camera. I'm outside the 30 day return window, so thank you Amazon for at least giving me an 80% refund.</span>

I haven't gotten it in the water yet, but I've got a few issues with SeaLife on this model already:<br/><br/>1.  They don't include a lens cap. It's a big miss.  This is entry-level product management. If you scratch your lens, you basically ruin a $1300 setup because the OEM didn't want to include a $3 lens cap. Oh, I asked, and they will sell you one separately. [Update: I contacted the seller (not SeaLife, but a store) and they sent me a lens cap that fits, which is pictured nearby. I had to rig up a way to attach it to the camera<br/> with 550 cord].<br/><br/>2. There's no native way to dummy cord your camera or the light carriage to your gear. No hooks, loops, nothing. Again, entry-level product management miss. I've fashioned one of my own out of 550 cord and a combination of bowline and (half) figure 8 knot (pictured).<br/><br/>3. The arms for the lights don't move. You have to buy an additional (and separate) flexi arm for ~$60. I bought one and offset the camera to one side. Why is this important? Because you need the lights behind or to the side to avoid backscatter. This is a packaging miss on SeaLife's part.<br/><br/>4. There's no digital Zoom on this model.  Maybe that's a function of the "mini" but the camera isn't all that much smaller than my 10-year old DCS model.<br/><br/>5.  The camera itself is waterproof. This has benefits and drawbacks.  One big one is you can't add a removable memory card, or swap a card out on a trip.<br/><br/>6. The directions for the lighting have gold connections. The directions say you must wipe these with alcohol EVERY SINGLE TIME you charge the batteries.  a) it's hard to reach without something like a q-tip and b) this is a huge pain on a trip. I don't mind maintaining my gear, but this is *high* maintenance.<br/><br/>Generally, I don't think SeaLife has met up to the standards of their own reputation. I'm absolutely fuming about the lens cap thing.<br/><br/>Update: I have tested the camera in the water over 8 dives recently and am pleased with the photos.<br/><br/>- It's simple to use in the water - good for a non-pro-photographer.<br/>- I like the extra settings on the white balance which gives you some flexibility to experiment with.<br/>- I set my white balance to the "quick button" which is a nice feature underwater.<br/>- On their website, SeaLife has a pro photographer (Brent Durand) do a ~20 minute summary on how to use the camera which I thought was very helpfu.  You can also find that video on his YouTube channel. Basically, you watch that video and you know everything you need to use the camera.<br/><br/> There's a photo above with a remora attached to a parrot fish that I took with this camera (the other two were taken with a phone).</span>

<span>This is a good basic point and shoot camera. It is rugged and waterproof. I took this on a rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. It is easy to change settings and takes good pictures and videos. I only wish the lens would shed water faster. There were a few pictures and videos that had a blurry water drop on the lens and did not turn out. It you have a dry cloth to wipe it off it would not be a problem. The video is in 1080p HD but only 30 fps. I would have liked the option to up the fps as 60 fps is an HD standard. Over all it took a beating and battery lasted a long time when charged correctly.</span>

You can see the quality of your photos after you download them to a device that has a better display. And regular photos look great too. I did have a difficult time focusing on some objects underwater but that could be user error and some practice is needed.</span>

<span>We just recently got a Hero8 Black GoPro to take videos of hikes and mountain climbing adventures.  The good: setting it up and taking videos is simple and straightforward, and the video quality is clean and sharp (recommendation: go for at least a 128 GB sim card to ensure adequate storage capacity at high resolution).  The bad: transferring videos off of the unit is a pain.  After spending over three hours installing and reinstalling the GoPro app on our phones and computer, we were unable to get anything to recognize that the GoPro was even there (it was plugged in at 100% charge, and our wi-fi had no problems at the time).  There is no option to directly connect the GoPro to a computer to transfer files, and the only customer support available is apparently based in India or Pakistan (judging from the accents of the support people we contacted), so clear explanations of the problem were difficult and took a lot of work on both ends.  Ultimately, the only way we were able to transfer videos from the GoPro was to manually pull the sim card out and plug it into a reader in our computer.  Customer support told us that this is not a bad thing, as it would ultimately take 5 times longer to transfer files via wi-fi.  I don't think this is an acceptable solution, because (1) handling the sim card multiple times increases the likelihood that it will be damaged or broken and (2) damage to the GoPro is possible if the sim card is inserted in the wrong orientation (there is no indication on the unit of the correct orientation to use, and even when you have it correct, you have to "shove" the card pretty hard to get it seated properly.)<br/><br/>Customer support gets 5 stars for willingness to be helpful, but 1 star on convenience and ease of use.  As mentioned before, the only way to get customer support is to submit a report on the website, which apparently goes to a call center in India or Pakistan.  You then wait for a call back, which could come minutes or hours later.  Of the three call-ins we made, two had such scratchy, bad connections that I am doubtful we could have understood what the support tech was saying even if they spoke crystal-clear English (seriously, we could only hear every second or third word, the rest was static).  Ultimately, the tech who helped us was helpful and knowledgeable, especially given that he could not see what we were dealing with.  All told, the customer support setup needs work to make it more accessible.</span>

<span>I paid about $240 on a promotion. GP has had the Hero 10 for a deep discount, on their site. I might have done that. But the price I paid is pretty great for what this camera does, and I don't worry about it much. The good thing is that the stabilization on the Hero 8 is close to fantastic. I ride an ebike up a very rough road and the picture is almost too smooth. It's just remarkable what the electronic stabilization can do. And these are pretty tough cameras. The picture is very nice, if a bit punched up. I guess there is a bland setting. The camera is a lot of fun. It's fun to go outside in the snow and rain. It's fun to point it at odd angle and mount it in weird places. Hey, you want a fantastic camera that does it all, get a Sony A7iii. But that's not reality. The stills from this camera are pretty good, but always wide views. The battery life honestly sucks.</span>

<span>Bought to video fishing trips.  Warms up while filming, and really chews up the batteries, only around 20 minutes a charge.  Recommend getting additional batteries and charger.</span>

<span> I purchased a Hero 8 and they sent me this Hero 9.  My first test out on a bike ride this morning, and I can really tell the difference between this one and my cheap little Sportscam.  In the GoPro video, you can see the horizon and trees and road and surroundings all stay stable and don’t move. Only my bike is moving. In the cheap camera video, everything is jiggling with my movement. This was well worth the money I believe.  The only thing that never improves from product to product is battery life. There’s really no answer for that other than to buy multiple batteries and keep them handy. This battery lasted me about 59 minutes before it died.</span>

<span>Ok, so the camera itself I have tried but I from the setup seems exactly what I was looking for. Really I came here to shout out the vendor. Some things came shipped separately. I reached out before knowing that and let them know an item was missing, they were so sweet and let me know things were being shipped out separately. To add, everything was shipped out quickly and prior to the expected date :) overall great experience.</span>
