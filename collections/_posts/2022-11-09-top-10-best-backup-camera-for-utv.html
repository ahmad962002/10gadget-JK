<span>Excellent quality image and night vision.  However I dropped my rating to 4 stars for these reasons:  first of all the online description is inaccurate.  The camera comes mounted on a different style bracket than shown in the Amazon ad.  Secondly the field of vision spec is incorrect - actual field of vision is 150 degrees - not 105 degrees as listed in ad.  Neither of these issues were a problem for me but it might be for someone else.  And lastly there was no warranty information and no help line or contact information for support.  Hopefully I will never need it.</span>

<span>Update:<br/>This unit is so much better than the wireless units on long RVs. They sent me a FREE 2nd camera so now I can see the 5th wheel hitch and the pin box when hooking up.<br/><br/>I bought this wired system to replace the wireless system we have been using on our 44' 5th wheel.  The wireless system was always intermittent.  I t would work at &lt;5MPH, when passing close by hills or underpasses, when passing semi's but an intermittently and always with a delay the rest of the time.  On top of that, the camera itself failed twice over the last 4 years.<br/>So, I decided to go back the the old fashioned and very reliable wireless system that we used on our previous DRV 5th wheel.  Reliable, good picture and good night vision.<br/><br/>I cannot attest to the life of this product but the picture is good, plenty of settings options on the display and the vendor responds quickly to inquires.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>No fading in/out.<br/>A must for longer trailers.<br/>No delay in the image like wireless.<br/>Good display.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>Is harder to install if your trailer isn't wired for analog backup camera.<br/>Requires connecting/disconnecting cable at stops.<br/><br/>Will add to the review when I get some time on the unit regarding reliability.</span>

<span>I mounted this camera on the rear of our 24' toyhauler, just under the flood light at the very top of the ramp door. It sits about 9' off the ground. Installation was easy and I had no trouble running the wire where I wanted to. The wiring itself, though, is cheap and flaky. If you jiggle the connections, even with the locking rings securely fastened, the image on the screen will cut out. You have to get everything held in place just so, then tape the cable down or otherwise somehow fix it in place so it can't move. I got one replacement harness from the seller and that was a little better, but the image still jiggles from the 23' foot cable going from the camera to the harness. Not sure I'll bother trying to get that one replaced, too.<br/><br/>Once you get an image it's nowhere near as crisp as what's shown on the listing. It's OK, but doesn't by any means have the contrast, detail or color depth the listing shows, regardless of any adjustments that can be made to the monitor's display. I haven't tested it at night yet, so can't comment on any aspects of that. The screen also needs to be mounted so you can view it dead on, otherwise a slight angle can make the screen image dim quickly.<br/><br/>The backup lines are just that: strictly for backup. I've seen some cameras that allow you to turn them off or on whether you are in reverse or drive, but not this system. You would need to somehow connect the "reverse trigger" wire to be energized at all times. However, that would probably also continuously energize the night vision LEDs and burn them out well ahead of schedule.<br/><br/>Why would you want the backup lines on when you are driving forward? Because the biggest weak link of this system is the extraordinarily wide angle view of the camera, and the backup lines MIGHT give you some rough estimate of how close behind you other traffic is. Having used this system several times now, I can clearly state that its only real value (at least as an RV rear view camera) is in detecting whether there is someone directly behind the camper or not. For traffic in a lane to your left or right, the camera view is so sweeping that by the time a vehicle is close enough to you to be able to identify it on the monitor, it's already practically right on the camper's rear bumper. What appears as a dime-sized blob on the screen (Is that a car or a truck?) is actually so close it's already fully visible in, and fully filling, your side view mirror. You really cannot safely use it to determine if it's OK to change lanes or not unless you see absolutely nothing at all on the monitor (or in your mirrors). That may be OK on the open highway, but once you get in town and everyone is tailgating or cruising in someone's blind spot, this camera will definitely not give you peace of mind when changing lanes.<br/><br/>I thought perhaps changing the "zoom" setting to 4:3 instead of 16:9 might help, but all that does is prove that the 16:9 setting merely stretches the 4:3 image to fill the screen. There is absolutely no different in the image content itself. I was hoping I could actually zoom the image to make it more closely resemble real life, but the "zoom" feature is just a toggle between 4:3 and stretched 4:3.<br/><br/>The optics and usefulness of this camera MAY be different if I mounted it much lower on the camper, but I doubt it. It needs to be high enough that a car behind you doesn't take up the entire screen and you need to be able to see what's BEHIND that close car. If you just want to know if someone is behind you in your lane, this system is OK. If you want to rely on it to see if it's safe to CHANGE lanes, don't. The image is just way too wide-angle to be useful for that.<br/><br/>I rolled out a tape measure and had my wife stand at 25' behind the camper, then put small strips of white tape on the monitor to line up with where a car would be at that distance. I haven't tested that out yet, but that would be the minimum safe distance for changing lanes IF the traffic isn't fast approaching. If this system had a more natural angle of view, that "calibration" wouldn't be necessary. I shouldn't have to be so fixated on the camera image, trying to determine what I'm really looking at to figure out where the nearby traffic REALLY is, that using this setup makes driving less safe, not more.<br/><br/>You should consider this system to be an accessory to, and in no way a substitute for, your rear view mirrors.</span>

<span>This system is very easy to install running one wire to the camera really speeds up the install I have installed it on my 1998 Chevy K1500 standard cab 8ft bed The camera that came with the kit is installed on the back window inside the cab i did this so i can view the load in the bed the other camera will be a license plate camera so I can view the trailer when hooking up I will be running the system with the cigarette lighter socket I will not be hooking it up to the reverse light wire.I have contacted Yakry for the free item which will be the license plate camera.I have to give a review and send them a screen shot to get the free camera.My first order had an issue with the supplied camera and Amazon quickly sent me a replacement backup kit with free return shipping of the first camera kit. I highly recommend this camera kit.</span>

<span>Now i park in places i never would dare to park because of using mirrors to back out into heavy traffic.<br/>takes the stress out of backing up and i use it full time because my rear view mirror is blocked by the camper<br/>all of the time. at night the headlights glare and i expect its true w/ all cameras but in day light its great.<br/> S till useful at night but more glare than i like. It took 15 mins for me to install and i was rushing to get<br/>somewhere. It was Easy.</span>

<span>Two stars as the DVR never worked from day one, and the monitor quit after only 10 months of use.  Would buy a new monitor but can’t find out who sells or where to buy one.  Very poor service for the cost.</span>

<span>works decently and as expected with no problems. I do wish it was capable of viewing both cameras in reverse while mounted on each rear corners of the vehicle. I have a bucket truck and mounted them so i can see both corners of my rear bumper when backing up so I do not run over anything or anyone. The only way to have split screen with both cameras is to have them constantly on, as the reverse trigger switches to one camera mode. I only want to see them when backing up, not driving down the road.</span>

<span>Communication with seller not so good.  Yes, this system does record in Cab Audio. The menus for setup a bit confusing (what buttons to push)  Manual needs an English editor. Managed to format a standard size SD-Card.  Buy a good one.,. class 10 Pro.. Audio recording only plays through your PC.. Monitor has no speaker,, it dose play its videos.  Cables have no trigger wire. ;-(  update: 25 Feb........Also,  option of guide lines... has none....lol.  Remote " batteries not included"..  Takes a standard coin battery.. CR2032. I find getting used to the monitor buttons easier. Cheers !</span>

<span>It didn't come with any documentation, I asked for it and got one page of two sides.  First side was a picture of the products, side two was a diagram of the wiring.  No word on how to set up the camera recording or how to even access the setup features.  I am sure I can figure that out as I go.  The quality is unknown as I have not finished setting it up on my RV.  It will take a few weeks.</span>

The display is huge but the actual rearview picture is the size of a playing card, way too small. There's no adjustment and I've already had some issues with it going all-white on the display for several hours/restarts.  Give me the good old style mirror so I can look back instantly and actually see back there. You really can't see any detail in such a small picture. It's poorly designed in my opinion.

<span>The system is easy to install and seems to work well.  HOWEVER ... I began getting "TIre Pressure Monitoring System Sensor Failure" errors in my 2020 Ford E450 whenever the camera was activated. I was using it as a REAR VIEW MIRROR so it was constantly on. I contacted their support and was told unfortunately the wireless system uses the same frequency as my Ford's TPMS system. This would not be a problem if being used as a momentary back up camera, but that's not why I purchased it. This would be a problems with most any wireless system using that frequency (which seems to be most of them).</span>

<span>This item had a great price, and very straightforward installation.<br/><br/>I installed it in the 'Camera Ready' prep area on the back of my 17' RV.<br/><br/>I would advise against using the little connector clips that they include - they did NOT connect the wires together for my install. I had to pull everything back out and use traditional crimp-style connectors with heat shrink.<br/><br/>One knock on this item is the very poor picture quality. I have seen reviews boasting about how clear the picture is, but mine is VERY grainy. I couldn't ready a sign on the building directly behind where my RV is parked - it was about 8 feet away from the camera, with very large lettering, but was anything but clear on the picture.<br/><br/>All of that said, this is a decent, affordable alternative to something like a Furrion, which will run you several hundred dollars.<br/><br/>I think it is worth ~$80, which is the price I paid.</span>

<span> Works good not good for cars trucks suv has to be mounted high like top of an rv because of the camera view I put in in a honda accord camera is big and like I said needs to be mounted up high for a good view and same with the guide lines is not designed to be mounted low but since I already put thee holes in my trunk one for the wire which is pretty big and 2 holes for mounting hope this helps anyone wanting to install in a car truck or suv wish I would have known but for the price it's ok but I would of spent more if I would of know I disconnected the blue wire it's for the guide lines that are useless if not mounted high</span>

<span>Update: Seller contacted me and offered a half refund. Appreciated nice customer service. Wasn’t expecting that. Just be weary of what you need it for before purchasing to save you a hassle if one is REALLY needed. If it’s not daily use it’s suitable. But for daily use just save yourself the hassle and keep looking.<br/><br/>Installation was not easy. Once installed had to use gorilla double sided mounting tape to really get it to adhere securely. Night vision is in black and white and rather pointless but we won’t need it then anyhow for our use of it while camping to see the pop up camper behind us. The picture quality is stunning. It looks crystal clear during the day. That is the main pro to this. Tried to turn the directional lines off since we aren’t using it to actually reverse into a parking spot but after turning them off it still remains on. Weird. The screen also won’t power off when we don’t need to use it. Glad this isn’t for everyday use as a backup camera or I’d be irritated and returning. Decent enough for a visual though of the camper and will just unplug the screen when not being used.</span>

<span>The installation and kit are awesome. So many others include a huge cable. This beautiful design includes an extension cable that you can use if needed but if you just need a short run that is also possible. No need to hide 20ft of cable. The camera is firmly set in the mount so rotation and aiming are doable without worrying about it falling out of place. So why 3 star? The lens that is on the camera is curved, causing the image to be distorted. Also, the camera is good for an overall view, but if something is within 10-24 inches the image is not sharp. Very hard to make out details. I need a small camera like this but I need it to work up close and far away. Auto focus would be great. I would pay more.<br/><br/>9/2/2022 UPDATE - Seller contacted me and is sending me a different model that may be better suited. Raised from 3 to 4 stars for customer service.

<span>TL;DR: just buy this one, you won't get a better backup camera. An excellent piece of hardware that is very small, has tons of mounting options, and will therefore will look at home on just about on any car you install it on.<br/><br/>Been waiting for a small backup camera that won't look like a giant black wart on my car's butt. I installed this on my '99 4runner right in the license plate tailgate area and love it. The 210 degree FOV is HUGE, almost too wide for how I have it mounted.. but it does give me a very clear view of both ends of my car and what I'm backing up to. Also helpful when towing, so I'm glad I went with the wider one.<br/><br/>The camera itself is quite small and looks great on the car - is just about as good as OEM if you put the work into mounting it well. Feels super high-quality. There's plenty of wiring to get up to the head unit with length to spare, zip ties and a variety of mounting hardware is all included and of good quality. Picture quality is great and the image at night is solid w/ some decent backup lights installed (I have a couple AUXITO-branded LEDs in there - see photo of head unit. Note that those are not the camera's reverse lines - I disabled those and set mine up via a Sony head unit). Instructions are clear as day and the reverse trigger works great.<br/><br/>INSTALL TIP: if you install this in a tailgate and need to tap a reverse light in a different place, you can cut a slit in the cable at the appropriate place after routing it and cut+pull the trigger wire out wherever you can find 12v reverse-switched power. In my car I did this at the driver side rear light after routing out the top of the tailgate through the stock grommets. Just be careful when cutting open the cable so you don't sever the video/power cables in there too. Think about your cable routing, that's the hardest part since it's car-specific. Otherwise easy as pie to set up.</span>

<span>When traveling in my RV, I tow my Jeep Wrangler.  I am unable to see the Jeep while I am driving the RV and I like to know (often) it is still attached as I drive.  I have a Back-Up Camera on the RV, but it only displays the image when the RV is in Reverse and when the Emergency Lights are activated.  I want to be able to see the Jeep at ALL times.<br/><br/>This product is perfect for my needs.  Before I leave on a trip, I connect the camera to the back window inside the RV (to not worry about weather or the camera growing legs) and I mount the monitor next to my GPS on the front windshield.  My RV is 32 feet long and there has never been an issue with the wireless image being displayed on the monitor.<br/><br/>I did have an issue with the cord for the camera.  The wires became detached from a circuit board.  It was past the warrantee period (one year), so I contacted Auto-Vox via email for "Repair Advice".  The customer service rep, Gigi responded the same day offering two solutions:<br/><br/>1) Bypass the circuit board:  The circuit board in the box is a filter box for German-made vehicles<br/>if that did not work:<br/>2) She said: " I will send a new supply cable to you to solve the problem."<br/><br/>I was able to bypass the circuit board (solution #1) and the camera is working again.  It was really great to know that the Auto-Vox stood behind their product (even when I was out of the warrantee period).<br/><br/>The response/advise from Gigi was very timely, friendly, and definitely added to my brand loyalty for Auto-Vox.</span>

<span>I’ve had this for 14 months now (bought in August of ‘21). It has survived Hurricane Ida, plenty of rain and wind through the rest of the year, and nearly daily use. There has only been one issue that I’ve come across, and it just started recently. I believe my converter that allows the camera to be plugged into the car lighter has a short in it. For now, all I have to do is touch it and it’ll immediately work, but I’m not sure how long it’ll last. For what it’s priced at, this thing has been incredible and I’d recommend it to anybody needing a cheaper backup camera option. Don’t expect any high quality video feed, because it’s not the greatest. However, it gets the job done and has a great night time view. Setting it up is much more simple than most negative reviews make it out to be. I struggled with it for only a moment, and then was able to figure out my issue from YouTube. It really is a great device, and you can at least expect a year or more of zero issues.</span>

<span>Installed it in a 20 year old Accord. Watched plenty of videos and read the manual thoroughly before installing and so installation was without a hitch. The accord did not have any holes in the trunk lid through which I could pass the wire internally, so had to drill a small hole, no biggie.<br/><br/>A couple of things that can be improved<br/>- The tap supplied to hook into existing DC power cables are unconventional. Would've been better if they had given the T-taps.<br/>- The screen can only be powered using the  conventional 12-V power socket. It would've been better if they also given an option to power the screen by tapping into 12-V power cables directly, just like the camera.<br/>- Lastly, the screen holder can't be moved once installed. Would've loved the flexibility to move it.</span>

<span>A couple of issues; camera placement &amp; durability. I purchased for 2009 Ford E350 van for viewing boat trailer coupling to ball hitch.  The license plate holder of the van is recessed into the passenger rear cargo door. Camera would not fit using the license plate top screws. Camera is too large. It would fit on bottom screw but illegally obscure license plate. It is a box style camera.  I affixed the camera to the most lower left side of right cargo door using the "3m" adhedive backing that was on the camera mount.  This location was chosen to facilitate the best view of the trailer hitch; center of vehicle. Durability of adhesive backing is unknkown. I fished the camara wires under door weatherproofing strip into the vehicle then behind the  interior door panel  through body wiring plug into tail light back up light.  The camera has a single screw parallel to the back of the camera which attaches to the metal mount supplied &amp; designed to be used by mounting on license plate. It is unknown if the screw is stainless steel or not. The metal mount appears to be non-stainless steel, painted black. The metal is very thin. The durability of this matetial is unknown as it is exposed to outdoor weather. After completing installation i applied liquid tape over the exposed screws to help weatherproif it. I use liquid tape on my boat wiring.  Installation requires a simple 12v circuit probe to ID + &amp; - wires. My instalkation required removing interior door panel of cargo door, routing wires through soft plug harness to tail light which needs to be removed to wire to camera to back up + &amp; - wires.  I was not 100% satisfied with product, but it does the job.  KEY ISSUE: Is there enough room above the top license plate screws to facilitate attaching the camera? Every vehicle is different. I recommend Seller and/or manufacturer provide the minimum measurement from the top license plate screw hole to top of camera for mounting their product. This is very simple for them to provide. I will post follow- up on durability &amp; how it holds up in FL weather.</span>

<span>Camera was going strong for a couple months and then one day I noticed the wiring was falling apartment. Eventually the camera just separated from the cable and fell apart.

<span>Great set up for 4X4 as its not routing cables into the cab. Had problems when wired to the lights (backing and main) as the system would shut down when the engine started. Obviously some level of interference such as power surge with my vehicle (Ford Ranger). Would not work with engine running. But after wiring a USB outlet to the more stable canopy interior light the problem was solved. The horizontal and vertical fields of view are great and include the tow bar and rear traffic with the camera mounted just above the number plate. Placed the wifi transmitter in the back corner in direct line of sight through cab and canopy windows and it is strong, consistent and fires up in about 10 seconds once I start the Casoda app, and remains powered up until I unplug the camera/wifi. So good I've ordered another one for my SUV.</span>

<span>I bought camera in December...

So I ordered an extra cord to extend... It did not work (I returned it).<br/>When I emailed company for an extension so camera would reach front of truck they could not help me.<br/>I told the company if they could not help me, I would not give them a good review.

<span>I have ordered a few of these. I had one installed in my 98 4runner. Everything was fine and worked as it should. I rolled down the back and window BAM, broke the wires completely. I spliced it back together but I didn’t want to run the risk of something happening again so I ordered another one. The one that came in had HORRIBLE picture quality, I knew this wasn’t normal because I have others from this brand/company and they were fine. I purchased this a month or so, maybe more than that ago. But customer service was fantastic, gotta give them props. They didn’t have me hassle with having to pull everything out, they apologized for the issue and sent me out a new one right away. I installed the new one and looks just as good as the other ones. Obviously it was an issue with that one camera, maybe it was bad, whatever. But the seller/company took care of me and that is the only reason I am writing this review. With so much bad customer service out there these days it’s nice to find a company that will actually help you with little to no questions asked. Awesome experience.<br/><br/>Now on to the backup camera:<br/>My only issue with a lot of these backup cameras is they narrow the viewing angle in order to provide a better picture, I get that, but I’m not trying to read a newspaper behind me so I want the widest view  possible, 149° isn’t bad but it isn’t great. If you’re at the store backing up and somebody is JUST to the right or left if you bumper, you won’t see em, the viewing angle isn’t wide enough. So please be careful even using your backup camera. Otherwise, it’s been 4wheeling, through car washes, through mud, you name it, it’s been through it and it’s held up just fine. For the price you really can’t go wrong and the customer service is top notch. My ONLY complaint again, is the viewing angle. Otherwise I’d highly recommend this product for anyone looking to add a backup camera.</span>

<span>These cameras are so straighforward to install (in theory). You can and should test the camera prior to full installation (just sit in your front seat, wire it to the radio, and make sure it is working with your HU). I put this in a 2006 Toyota Sienna and my HU was a Boss Audio BE7ACP-FT. The most time consuming part was running the video cable all the way back, then into the lifting tailgate on my van and finding a good way out to the license plate frame.  The supplied cables were more than long enough (I installed along the headliner back to the tailgate from the passenger side)<br/><br/>My only legitimate complaint with this camera is the big thick plastic bracket that the camera is mounted in. It partially covers up my registration tags (both month and year), as well as obscures the state. Don't know if the local police will make a big deal of this or not. Slim down that bracket, reinforce with some metal if necessary, but no reason it has to be soooo thiccc.</span>

<span>The backup camera is easy to install. The only problem I had was my camera was powered all the time so that I could use it when towing just by turning on the monitor. Since this camera has lights, those white lights are on all the time. They are very bright. If your camera is powered all the time you may want to consider this.</span>
