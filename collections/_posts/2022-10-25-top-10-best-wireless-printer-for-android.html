<span>Most of the photo paper in the packs are just a hair too big so it brings up an error message and you cannot use them. It sometimes  randomly prints duplicates and also after printing more than 6 photos it gets pretty warm. I do like the pictures just a hit or Miss on some minor things</span>

<span>First off, I want to say as a printer that prints this printer does the job. If you're looking for just printing and a printer that is relatively small and compact, this is a decent option and cheapish.<br/><br/>My wife and I are planning to move abroad soon, so we were in search of a printer that would just do basic things-- for her it was mainly printing return labels for her online purchasing and misc things. What we found is that there are two no great things about this printer: the set up and the scanner.<br/><br/>In my mind the scanner should feed from the top, but it does not. It feeds from the bottom with no support, which leaves a big gap when scanning and/or the bottom section of the page to be missing entirely. This could be easily fixed by returning this and getting a better, potentially more expensive printer, but as I mentioned that would be a waste for us. There are scanning apps that work perfectly well out there for the few times we need that function.<br/><br/>As for the set up. I saw someone mention they were glad they had a PC for this set up because it made it easier, but from what we experienced, setting up the wireless printing for my wife's mac book was more easier than her PC. You simply activate the wifi on the printer, look up the wifi single on on your computer and connect. Was is super easy and intuitive? No. It actually took some fussing to get it to work but it was relatively "easy".</span>

<span>Printer works well although my wife had problems getting the printer to recognize her iPhone 8. Had to reboot a couple of times.</span>

<span>I love the small size and the clean, crisp printing.  However, setting up the wifi was a very difficult and involved many steps (unlike other wifi printers I have purchased).  Although I am a tech savvy average computer, printer user, it took me too much time and too many steps to figure out how to set up the wifi.  The instructions in the box and online were limited and not very helpful.</span>

<span>Once set up this printer worked great.  Though in a rural area it was clunky to download the HP app due to very slow Internet access.  However, once done it worked great in terms of print quality.  And the size is tremendous when traveling.  I did order a travel case separately (found on Amazon) and that enhances an already great product.<br/><br/>The only disappointment was when I attempted to print 6" x 9" catalog envelopes.  It did not recognize the size and I could not get it to print a mail merge.  However, that may have been operator error.<br/><br/>When my sister visited she loved the size due to space constraints she has in her home and is thinking about purchasing it as well.

<span>The picture quality is MUCH better than any of the printers that use the Zinc technology. For that I would give it 5 stars. The pictures are truly beautiful.  The rest of the design is problematic.<br/><br/>Noise- BUT THIS IS THE LOUDEST PRINTER I've ever owned. This my probably my 6th mini printer and I cannot stand the noise. I've tried to cover it with things, or put it in a drawer...you can hear the thing clear across a room. If you're right next to it's obnoxious.<br/><br/>Multiple Printing- the App gives you the option to print like 5 at a time. But you have to remove the picture from the slot after every print. It's very annoying. You can't just print a bunch of pictures and come back later. You have to come back and remove every.single.one.<br/><br/>Collages- Nope. This app does not allow you to print more than one photo on a sheet, unlike other apps. So if, for example, you want to print one sheet with two pictures (like a half and half) you'll have to do the edit in a completely different app and then reconfigure the size again.<br/><br/>Filters- the app has some but they are basic. There's no other edits you can do.<br/><br/>Connectivity- Unnecessary Extra Steps. Most printers will automatically connect with your phone when you turn them on. With this printer, you have to connect the Bluetooth manually every time, then open the app. If you open the app before connecting the bluetooth you have to start the process over.<br/><br/>***If I find a printer that gives me this photo quality but doesn't have the other downfalls, this is getting donated. Kodak has the money to do better.</span>

<span>Bought this for my mom for Christmas. She loves it! She has several small picture frames and hangars and this is perfect for printing the photos to go in those frames. The unit is small and ultra portable, easy to connect to an iPhone, the app used for printing (required) is pretty straight-forward. Instructions say to CHARGE PRIOR TO FIRST USE--charging seems to be pretty quick.<br/><br/>FYI: The unit is a 4 pass printer! When you print a photo, it puts the ink on in layers--the photo comes out with one layer, goes back in, gets another layer, and so on. Finishes up with a really nice glossy clear coat. That was weird for us the first time we used the printer--I had never seen a printer like that before. LoL!</span>

<span>This is great for taking on the go when you want to share a fun moment with someone, easily print it out!<br/><br/>The app Kodak uses is a bit antiquated, and it takes about a minute to print a photo fully, but then again I wouldn't expect a handheld printer to go any faster.<br/><br/>I wish the photo quality matched that of the image on the phone. The quality of the photos isn't bad, but not 10/10 either.<br/><br/>Worth it? Maybe. Depends on if you're the kind of person that likes to have/hold an actual photo... I am, and I enjoy this product a lot.</span>

<span>I got this under the premise that it would be way easier to use than a traditional keyboard included unit, and provide more options with fonts and icons. It didn't really live up to that. First off this thing is a chonker. Way larger than you'd expect, and not something you'd really want to carry around with you while labeling things. Its best thought of a desktop printer, which defeats many labeling scenarios. Yes it has batteries. 6 AAA. There is easily room in the compartment for them to have gone with easier to find and longer lasting AA batteries, or even a rechargeable lithium battery. Ideally it would have been rechargeable and the included AC adapter would have kept it topped off so you could pick it up and go. A belt loop would also have been welcome so you could carry this and still manipulate your phone. So portability gets a C- here.<br/><br/>Even when you're using it on the desktop its annoying. The Bluetooth constantly disconnects and you have to tell it what printer you want to use every time you have walked away from the machine. You can't plug this one into a PC either, which would make sense for a desktop printer. The software is mediocre at best. Even on a iphone 12 its a little laggy and setting up labels takes some work. It is possible to queue labels by saving them and then later selecting them and printing them all at once, but its not intuitive, and if you don't want to retain them more than the one print, its a bit of a hassle. I'd give the software a B-<br/><br/>In short its best to consider this a desktop printer, and if you like to move around and label on the go you should probably stick to one of the more traditional models. Also the print resolution is thoroughly unimpressive, no better than the all in ones that cost half what this does.</span>

<span>I was very glad I decided to read the App Store reviews for the app for this product before I invested too much in the Amazon reviews. The App Store reviews were steller, this unit was $60 at the time so I took a leap despite a lot of negative reviews here.<br/><br/>I had this set up and printing labels in 5 minutes and I didn't bother with reading any instructions. Some of the information on this product is outdated (as are a lot of the reviews I suspect), there is ONE app now for this - Brother Design &amp; Print 2 (just search "Brother P-Touch" and you'll find it) and Brother has done a great job with this app. It comes with a ton of easy to use templates to create your labels.<br/><br/>I had turned on my printer before I even downloaded the app, after installation the app instantly found the printer on Bluetooth and I was set to print in moments. I got this printer mainly to print FAA registration numbers for my drones and it did that very well.<br/><br/>Is there a little bit of tape wasted? Yes, yes there is. My guess would be this is because the printer laminates AFTER it does the thermal print job. The label looks to be separated with a base and laminate in the cartridge and laminates when it prints. Therefore, you can't just wind the tape back in so none is wasted as it's been laminated. Two seconds with scissors and your problem of extra space is solved.<br/><br/>Is larger text a bit fuzzy at some of the edges? Yes, yes it is, this is a thermal label printer, not some laser printer generating print copy. I found the label perfectly appealing and legible, if you want to stick your face in it to see some fuzziness, have at it, can't see the point.<br/><br/>I thought about getting the higher-end ones with the power cutter, it's completely unnecessary, quick push of the button and it cuts perfectly. This is a great little printer and was very easy to use in the app, much preferable to some big clunky device with a keyboard on it. For $60 it's also the same price if not less than most of them.<br/><br/>Great product, ignore the whining in a lot of these reviews, I found it to be super easy to use.</span>

No need to move the label maker from room to room!<br/>I agree with other reviews that there is a fair amount of label tape waste.

<span>The instructions that come with the printer are garbage, the only useful thing was the website to go to to set-up on your device. There is a website for computer users and QR codes for iPhone and Android users which take you to your designated app store to download the Canon PRINT application. Computer users will have to download the required software before connecting to the printer, following the link provided in the instruction manual takes you to download and installation instructions.<br/><br/>THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART<br/>The manual included with the printer wasn't helpful at all if you weren't able to connect per their instructions. If a light wasn't flashing for the network, instructions said to just go back to and earlier step and start over. THE WEBSITE however gave detailed instructions for what to do if your network lights weren't blinking or if there were other issues. I tried to summarize the entire process the best I could below.<br/><br/>Long story short - just go to the website and you will be so much happier. The quality of hte printing though is great, I'm very very happy with how the printer works after I was finally able to get it set up.<br/><br/>TO SUMMARIZE SETTING UP<br/>- unbox printer<br/>- remove all tape/plastic<br/>- plug in<br/>- power on<br/>- go to desktop website to download needed software for computer and/or download Canon Print app for phone<br/>- Once programs/apps installed successfully - look to see if the network light is blinking. FOR ME THIS WAS BLINKING AT FIRST BUT MY PHONE WASN'T ABLE TO FIND THE PRINTER - AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO FIND THE PRINTER WITH MY PHONE THE NETWORK LIGHT STOPPED BLINKING. The manual instructed me to go back to the instructions telling me to remove the tape after unpacking - useless.<br/>- IF NETWORK LIGHT NOT WORKING OR IF IT STOPS WORKING ----- PRESS AND HOLD THE DIRECT BUTTON FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN RELEASE - looks like a smart phone/tablet - NETWORK LIGHT SHOULD BEGIN BLINKING.<br/>- FOR ME I had issues setting up initially on just my phone so I went to the website and did the installation via my laptop. I was prompted to enter my printer's information to locate the right software to download right from the site.<br/>- Setting up software on MacBook Pro took moments<br/>- The computer couldn't locate the printer on the network so I was given alternative steps to what to try - this is where the suggestion of the direct button came.<br/>- PRESS/HOLD DIRECT BUTTON UNTIL NETWORK LIGHTS BLINKS<br/>- computer was able to locate the printer and connect to it<br/>- AFTER FULLY INSTALLED ON COMPUTER/LAPTOP THEN PUT IT ON YOUR PHONE VIA THE CANON PRINT APP</span>

<span>Seems like a pretty good basic printer to me.  I have not tried out all the functions but I almost sent it back because I couldn't get it added to my phone or laptop.  I shoved it in my closet two weeks ago due to mounting frustration.  I read the review left by howar1jd and the part about pushing the direct button to get the wireless light to flash did the trick! I was able to add it to my phone first and then my laptop.  I also turned wifi on and off for both my phone and the laptop which I think might have done the trick because both were able to discover the printer after that.  The instruction's are trash don't bother trying to follow them past step 5.  Thank the Gods for howar1jd !  I haven't tried many of the features so can't speak to that but it works for printing some work documents I need to print , is lightweight, compact and was delivered straight to my door with no need to wander around best buy or staples waiting for someone to answer questions just to get the I don't know look! Mission accomplished.</span>

<span>This is a cool idea. It works really well. It was easy to set up but the only thing is the picture quality. You have to adjust each photo to the paper size.  The colors could be brighter.  Overall it is pretty cool</span>

<span>Does what it says but poor print quality…. Pictures are not vibrant or vivid colors… but if you’re looking for vintage photos this would be PERFECT! Replacement paper will cost you a lot of pennies… printer alone not a bad price….

<span> I was just starting to wrap this as a gift for my girlfriend on Christmas and saw on the box that its made for iPhone. Even though it says on this description that its for both. I'm very upset, im still going to give it to her and if we can get it to work with her phone ill update this.<br/><br/>Update,  it did end up working with her phone. Quality isn't great but she's happy with it.</span>

<span>I needed an extra printer for home office use that is wireless and fits on the limited shelf space I have left! My wife and I are always getting in each others way when we 'share' the one wireless laser printer we have. This easily solved that problem! It also gave us additional features we often use; like two sided printing and quick copies. The setup was surprisingly easy. Been a while since I installed a new printer, so using my iphone was different, but 'good' different! The quality of print is almost laser level! The only 'problem' that might be manifesting is a 'low level' on the color cartridge that came with the printer. I haven't printed that many pages that used much color at all. We'll see what happens when I change the cartridge!</span>

<span>It does the job, although I’m still working on the color settings. On standard quality, pictures tend to print lighter than they should. High quality setting seems to print much richer color results. I still kinda miss my MG5200 series, but it crapped out and started printing blurry pictures and particularly anything with text. Even after a deep clean maintenance run. So we’ll see how it goes after a couple more months, but so far, I’m fairly pleased.</span>

<span>I wouldn't say set up was easy but it was doable. Android app (necessary to print) is not user friendly at all. No print quality (resolution) settings. Prints washed out right out of the box. Cleaned heads 2x, deep cleaned 2x - 2nd time after 24 hrs as instructed, replaced ink cartridges that came with the printer with brand new Canon cartridges and STILL get washed out prints. In the attached image the 4x6 was right out of the box &amp; the 8.5x11 is after all the above steps completed. Extremely disappointed. Today's Labor day so can't speak to a customer service rep until tomorrow. I'll update this review if &amp; when this gets resolved.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>Okay, returned 1st printer &amp; received replacement quickly (even before they received the 1st one back). Again the Canon print app is not user friendly for set-up. There is no "register product" or "set-up" option identified anywhere on the home screen.<br/>To register your printer:<br/>Tap the printer icon with the + in the upper left corner of the home screen then follow the instructions.<br/>To set-up the printer:<br/>Tap the printer icon at the bottom of the home screen then "check/change set-up." Follow instructions for "printer preparation" and then "network set-up."<br/>NOTE: I also found how to make the printer "identifiable" for setting up the network on the paper instructions included.<br/>Once you've done these steps the printer will remain connected even after turning it off and on again.<br/>At this point the actual printing process is a breeze. I've included an after photo of the same image.<br/>All said and done I gave 4 stars, it would have been 5 if the app was more user friendly.</span>

<span>It would’ve saved me a great deal of time to pair my iPad with the printer using the router connection (not direct connect), if directions EXPRESSLY stated that the printer uses only the 2.4ghz band. It does not work using 5ghz.<br/><br/>The Verizon wifi router also created issues. Had to turn off (disable) 5ghz on the primary wifi network to connect properly. Once paired and set up, I restored the 5ghz option on the router<br/><br/>Canon iOS app is excellent, though I had problem signing in to the admin interface using iPad with iOS version 15.6.1.<br/><br/>Ok button did not work after entering the admin password. Worked OK on my iPhone and another iPad with iOS 15.4.<br/><br/>Once configured well, you will be amazed at what it can do for such a small price. AirPrint, copy and scan seamlessly with Phone or tablet. And it prints double sided too!</span>

<span>I was able to connect my Windows 10 Pro and Android 11 cellphone right away to this printer.  However, I could not figure out how to connect this to my Samsung Galaxy Pro S7+ tablet.  I was only able to figure it out after I realized that the Canon app Selphy does not work on the Samsung.  The app to use with the Samsung Galaxy Pro S7+ is the Moprio.  This app was able to detect the tablet right away and I was able to print with no problem.  The problem with this printer is that the instructions do not offer solutions to problems like this.  You have to figure it out yourself and if you lose patience then you would think that you should just return this and get another printer.</span>

<span>I've used this adorable little printer for about a month and I'm very happy with it. I prefer toner printers to inkjets so I hesitated to buy. And like all inkjets it does burn through ink pretty fast so keep plenty on hand. IMO the other features offset that downside. So compact, so easy, no wifi needed, runs like a charm. Just perfect for my needs when traveling. The battery pack works very well too and - bonus - with my laptop plugged into AC and the printer USB cabled directly to the laptop, it keeps both batteries charged! Kudos to Canon on a great product.</span>

<span>The first thing I like about the printer is the easy setup. First you have to insert the print-head and the ink cartridges, but the design is so intelligent and straightforward that it's very easy to do that.<br/><br/>Wireless setup was as easy as pie. AS PIE, I tell you. When I compare it to my previous experience, struggling to set up my old color printer (which I acquired back when I was using Windows XP), it's a revolutionary advance. I haven't even bothered to use the Pixma with a USB cable. Wireless is so convenient.<br/><br/>I don't particularly like the paper handling, i.e., the panel that you unfold to hold the paper supply. I like the more traditional bed that holds the paper. But the unfolding panel definitely saves space, so it's OK.<br/><br/>I would say print quality is pretty good, not stellar, but good enough for my purposes. This is a good printer, well worth the money. I researched a lot of printers, and it seems there's something wrong with most of them -- some drawback or serious problem. The Pixma seemed cheap &amp; functional &amp; light &amp; small, and I'm quite satisfied with this printer.</span>
