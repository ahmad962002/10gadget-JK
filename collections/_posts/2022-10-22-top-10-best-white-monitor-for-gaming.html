<span>I wanted to wait at least 90 days before doing a review so here it goes.<br/><br/>This is the best monitor I have ever had. The picture quality is fantastic.  I have no screen tearing or flickering. I have my PC, Nintendo Switch and PS4 plugged into it and they are all crisp af on this monitor.<br/><br/>This was my 3rd attempt at a monitor for my new setup and my first monitor purchase in 5+ years. The first two monitors I got (from 2 very popular brands) were DOA and the other had dead pixels. I had almost given up until I got this Sceptre monitor and I'm considering getting another to have a dual setup.<br/><br/>I was really impressed with the packaging. They went the extra mile to ensure the monitor came without any damage. Also they included gloves for assembly! Nice touch.<br/><br/>P.S. Sceptre's Customer Service is top notch. They respond quickly and are very helpful.</span>

<span>Only had the monitor for a couple days, so can’t judge long term quality which is probably THE biggest factor with any monitor. My use case is for business - general office use with some advanced content review (like interactive video). I do not and will not use it for gaming, use it as a true creative, or any other use case that depends on a specific factor like refresh rate, brightness or color reproduction.<br/><br/>And... so far, so good!<br/><br/>The big plus here is the USB-C Thunderbolt 3 implementation with 85W output. Being able to charge my MacBook Pro 13 or Dell XPS 13 with perfect resolution video over a skinny USB-C cable is a game changer. A Thunderbolt 3 USB-C cable is included, which itself is a hundred-ish dollar item. So far, both laptops have worked exactly as expected with the Thunderbolt 3 cable.<br/><br/>The monitor itself is very bright and color reproduction seems relatively honest. I did download the color profile from the Samsung  website, which seems to have been a net plus as far as brightness and color.<br/><br/>My big negative here is the included stand. First, it’s highly angled front to back, so the monitor sits father forward on my desk by well over 6 inches compared to my last LG ultrawide. It’s actually too close to my face and I have the stand at the back edge of the desk. So have to think about some sort of third party stand.<br/><br/>Second, the stand is very susceptible to vibration. The single narrow center pole between base plate and monitor just doesn’t have enough bracing for something so wide. Samsung needs to think about adding more bracing points toward the edges of the monitor or redesign the skinny pole into more of a wide, flat plate that offers more stiffness at the edges of the monitor. As it is now, the monitor shakes with very tiny vibrations. Not like an earthquake or anything, but it’s FAR more noticeable than my old LG ultrawide. At this price point, a third party stand fix shouldn’t be necessary.<br/><br/>Lastly, the resolution is ok but not great. Smoothing of fonts could be a lot better - they look a lot more jagged than they should at native resolution. I mean like early 2000s jagged. That’s not all on Samsung, but there should be an easy solution for this. That said, it is hard going from a 4K 13 inch screen to a 1440p screen that is several times the size and closer to my face. Things just aren’t going to be as sharp and I have to remind myself of that frequently.<br/><br/>In all, you have to ask yourself if certain features on a curved ultrawide are worth a significant bump in price. With this monitor, you’re paying for the bump to 1440p from 1080p, you’re paying for the Thunderbolt 3 capability of charging plus video over USB-C. I feel like I got a decent deal. Not a great one, but a decent one. In the end, it really all is about how this thing performs 3-4 years from now. If nothing changes and it operates perfectly, it will be a really good value.</span>

<span>*** 2nd Update ***<br/><br/>This second monitor is now showing 8 dead pixels and counting. Something is obviously wrong with this second panel as well. And, judging by some of the other reviews, it would appear that Samsung has some serious QA issues with this model! Definitely will be returning this but now I'm doubting I will request a replacement but instead just ask for a refund and look elsewhere. Really disappointed as I love the design/aesthetics of this monitor along with many of its features.<br/><br/>*** Update ***<br/><br/>The second monitor I received is now showing 5 dead pixels which were not there originally. As I have done with any new monitor I have purchased in the past, upon first setting it up, I test it for dead pixels using software that checks for that sort of thing. Unlike the first monitor I received, I was not able to find a single dead pixel with this second one.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a day or so later while coding a website, I noticed a dead pixel. That dead pixel wasn't obvious so I figured I could probably live with it; however, a few days since noticing the first dead pixel, I now keep seeing more dead pixels popping up that were not there just days before.<br/><br/>This has me questioning whether or not I have received another defective monitor and/or if I will continue to experience more dead pixels over time. And because I am a web/mobile developer, I stare at lines of code on my monitor for hours each day, so dead pixels are perhaps more obvious and irritating to me than most users, who are not analyzing different areas of the screen they are looking at.<br/><br/>Looks like I am going to have to once again exchange another of these monitors which is a real pain as they are not easy to pack up and haul over to UPS. I'll once again exchange it for another of this same Samsung model and keep my fingers crossed that the third time is the charm. If I don't get lucky with the third one, then I'll sadly have to get a refund and move on to another brand other than Samsung, which is too bad as I really like the features, aesthetics, and picture quality of this model. Not to mention, I am a fan of Samsung as several other devices I own are Samsung including two other monitors, my mobile phone, and a 65-inch TV.<br/><br/>If I can simply receive one of these monitors that works the way it is supposed to with zero dead pixels, then I'll be a happy customer. I don't believe that's too much to ask for when paying this much for a monitor. Never before have I had such poor luck with purchasing a new monitor. I have never had two monitors in a row both turn out to be lemons like this. Hopefully, the third time will be different.<br/><br/>I'm curious to know if any others out there that have purchased this model have noticed pixels failing over time? Please comment on this review if you have. Thanks.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>*** Initial Review ***<br/><br/>The first monitor I received was a Christmas gift and unfortunately is definitely defective; however, there appears to be a panel lottery with these monitors as well.<br/><br/>The first monitor I received had 1 dead pixel and appeared ever so slightly darker on the right edge of the panel -- although most people less OCD than me might not have noticed. More importantly and worst of all, this monitor made a loud, annoying popping noise every so often that would literally scare the $#!% out of me!<br/><br/>I was well within my 30-day return window, so I put in for a replacement via the Amazon website. I was then told I'd receive an e-mail once my replacement monitor had been sent out. Unfortunately, later that night, I received an email telling me that Amazon could not send me a replacement, only give me a refund. Immediately, I questioned why as I had purchased the monitor directly from Amazon (rather than a 3rd party seller) and as I stated before, was well within my 30-day return window. Furthermore, I did not want to have to re-purchase the monitor as the monitor was originally purchased on Black Friday at a significant savings of more than $100 off the current price.<br/><br/>So, the next day I called Amazon customer service and spoke with a rep regarding this. She was definitely from an office located overseas as English was clearly not her native language and I had difficulty understanding her. I'm not sure she clearly understood what I was requesting as she seemed confused and then put me on hold without even telling me. After patiently waiting on hold for a few minutes, not sure if she was coming back, I decided to end the call. I then immediately called back and this time was connected to another rep who, once again, seemed to be from an office located in another country as her English was hard to understand.<br/><br/>As in the email that I received, this rep told me that she could not exchange the monitor for me but did offer me a refund. She explained that if I wanted the same monitor, she'd have to fill out a return for the current monitor and then I'd have to place another, new, separate order.<br/><br/>I then explained to the rep that I did not want to do this as the original monitor was purchased during Black Friday at significant savings and if I re-purchased, would have to pay an additional $100 plus dollars. She then told me that she would be willing to give me an Amazon gift card to make up the difference. Which I quickly replied that this was not acceptable and then asked to speak to a manager. She apologized but agreed to my request and re-directed my call.<br/><br/>A few minutes later, thankfully, a manager named Valerie that was either American or Canadian (and I'm assuming located in the states or Canada) took my call. She spoke perfect English and we could understand each other...hooray! I explained the situation to her and she replied that she did not understand why the previous person I spoke with could not simply send out a replacement as I was still within my 30-day return window and had purchased directly from Amazon rather than a 3rd party (which was why I was confused, to begin with). Within a matter of a few minutes, Valerie had a replacement ready to go and even offered to 1-day ship it for my inconvenience.<br/><br/>One day later, I have my replacement monitor, there are no dead pixels, the screen seems equally bright throughout and thankfully, there are no loud annoying popping noises!<br/><br/>Now, onto the lottery panel comment...<br/><br/>1. The second monitor seems far crisper looking than the first monitor I received. I noticed right out of the box and even after fidgeting with the Sharpness control and bringing both monitors to a Sharpness setting of 0. Not sure why this is.<br/><br/>2. The first monitor I received may have a slightly thicker anti-reflective coating on it than the second monitor. I noticed this in the graininess of the image as the first monitor had a "screen door" effect to it that this second monitor does not have. While the second monitor does appear to also have an anti-reflective coating, it has next to no screen door effect. This may also be what is contributing to the second monitor appearing to have a much clearer image.<br/><br/>3. Finally, what you've all been waiting for, the Calibration Report! Each of these monitors includes a short calibration report inside the monitor's menu settings, showing you what the monitor measured at as far as Gamma Response and Grayscale calibration (color accuracy).<br/><br/>Based on each report, the first monitor I received scored a 2.21 for gamma, while the second scored a 2.18 (acceptable standard is listed at 2.2 +- 10%.<br/><br/>For grayscale, the second monitor scored a max of 1.7 while the first monitor was close to 3 (lower is better)! Acceptable max is listed at a rating of 5.<br/><br/>As you can see, while both monitors passed each test, the second monitor is clearly the more accurate out of the box, before any calibration on the consumer end.<br/><br/>--- TL;DR ---<br/><br/>If you receive a defective monitor that was purchased directly from Amazon and customer service tells you that you can't exchange it even though you are within your 30-day return window, ask to speak to a manager.<br/><br/>The first monitor I received is defective, which may play a slight role in things; however, based on the two examples I received, there appears to be a noticeable difference in the quality of these panels from 1 monitor to the next. The second monitor I received has an image that is noticeably crisper than the first monitor. In addition, the calibration report found in the monitor's menu settings (for this model) shows how each monitor scores in both Gamma Response and Grayscale Rating. So have a look to see how the monitor you receive scored.<br/><br/>Finally, if you receive a monitor with a picture that looks less than satisfactory, you could have received a lesser panel. The first monitor I received had a picture quality that was "meh" while the second monitor looks great! Perhaps there is a "panel lottery" with this model, but need more consumers to confirm this.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Ultrawide...duh!<br/>- Fantastic VA panel contrast level, far better than IPS displays<br/>- 100 Hz refresh rate<br/>- Freesync<br/>- 1440p resolution rather than 1080p<br/>- Thunderbolt 3<br/>- QLED<br/>- Fantastic color range with sRGBcoverage of 125%<br/>- VA panel has deep inky blacks<br/>- Zero light bleed!<br/>- No flashlighting or blooming that I can see<br/>- The curve encompasses you and helps immersion when playing games<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- Not 4K<br/>- Monitor wobbles slightly if you bump your desk or have a desk that isn't very sturdy<br/>- No 144 Hz refresh rate<br/>- No G-Sync for Nvidia owners<br/>- Not a lot of media supports ultrawide resolutions (which means you'll have black bars on the left and right side of most of the movie/tv show content you watch)<br/>- Possible panel lottery (but need more consumers to help confirm this)</span>

<span>*Update 3*<br/>My replacement screen now has several dead pixels, and several pixels which wont unstick attempting several different methods. Not too pleased with the overall quality control on these.<br/><br/>Potential in this screen, but quality control issues would prevent a recommendation.<br/>Finally if you have two TB3 devices connected, you can switch between the two by powering one down fully while the other remains on, this will switch input and then you can power back on your other device.  Not the most convenient process, but I find it easier than removing cables.<br/>*** UPDATE 2 ***<br/>Some very important items if you are considering this monitor:<br/>#1 Bad item: YOU CANNOT SWITCH SOURCES BETWEEN THE 2 TB3 INPUTS.  If you have 2 TB3 devices plugged into the monitor.  You have to fully SHUT THE MONITOR DOWN as well as both devices, then power on the device you want to use and the monitor will pick up the correct TB3 input...repeat you cannot switch input sources between the two TB3 inputs...this stinks.<br/><br/>#2 Bad item: You can't just press the power button to turn it off.  You have to go through the OSD to turn off the monitor which makes it 3 clicks for a function that should be 1 click.  Really annoying and really terrible IMHO.<br/><br/>#3 Bad Item: The monitor will regularly fail to power your peripherals in which case you may have to power cycle the monitor, unplug the devices from this screen itself.  This is a real annoyance.<br/><br/>I still stand by the picture quality but this monitor has so many other flaws it may be best to wait until the next gen or a different brand has something similar (if your needing 2 TB3 inputs)<br/>***** UPDATE *****<br/>So after having the monitor for only 4 days, the joystick that operates the On Screen Display stopped working when being pressed a certain direction.  Calling amazon to hopefully get this exchanged right now.<br/><br/>Having been used to laptop screens primarily for the last decade, I had been wanting an ultrawide and it was a tough choice deciding which screen to go with.<br/><br/>I was between this monitor, the new LG 34gk950f which was eliminated because it is on backorder everywhere, and the old Alienware AW3418DW.  The Alienware I had seen in person several times and while gameplay is fantastic on the screen, the colors were not very vibrant and it seemed a little dull.  Since I will be using this for work, media and gaming I saw the samsung and the contrast compared to the Alienware is a good bit better.  So my choice was made, and I hoped for the best for gaming.  Now here are my thoughts after one brief day with it; I'll update this review down the road.<br/><br/>********NOTE********<br/>In windows with 100% scaling the text is clean and crisp looks great on websites and documents etc.<br/>On Mojave 10.14.3 the scaling is not perfect.  Pictures images still look great but the text is a little jagged.  You can mess with the settings and make it a little better but oddly it does look better in Windows 10.<br/><br/>Build Quality/VESA MOUNTING -<br/>So let me get the red herring out of the way and put it out there; I don't like the VESA Mount setup for this monitor at all.  Sure it's actually pretty easy to remove the pre-attached stand and install the mount, only 2 phillips screws, but the way it is designed it adds about 2" of depth to the monitor when depth is the area that I am already lacking.  This could have easily been solved by having a flat portion on the back of the monitor or having the vesa mount point on the monitor itself be vertically positioned against the rear of the monitor and having the adapter plate attach the same way.  Either way just know if you do plan on mounting this that the screen will end up 2" deeper than it should be.<br/>Build Quality of the frame and stand itself is fantastic. It's all plastic all around, but it doesn't reek of low quality, it definitely feels sturdy.  A 'joystick' on the rear of the display controls the OSD easily and when it is pushed it powers the screen on/off.  If you plan on using the stand, it has a removable panel for cable management but it doesn't look like it will fit more than 3-4 cables max.<br/>Last thing to note about the cables; they are NICE! Samsung stepped up and gave use some very high quality HDMI, and power cabling here make sure you account for the HUGE power brick.  They also included a 2m Thunderbolt 3 cable in which is high quality as well.<br/><br/>Screen Quality-<br/>So I don't have any professional tools but there are calibration results saved from the factory you can look at in the OSD and there is ability to do fine tuning.  Beside my 2018 Macbook Pro the colors have a little bit of a red tint to them but they are very very close, the blacks on this Samsung VA panel are far superior to the macbook's though. It's not perfect, the blue/green colors aren't as well defined on here, but again overall this is a fantastic picture on this panel and the 100hz refresh rate makes web browsing and videos playback very smoothly.<br/><br/>Features-<br/>Part of the reason the 21:9 34+ monitor decision is so difficult is because seeming no one monitor has everything, KVM, 1440p+ resolution, 120+ refresh rate, Speakers (i know they suck but I want them), gsync/freesync, Thunderbolt 3 connectionS.<br/>This Samsung does not have everything indeed, but the TWO TB3 connections (1 85w 1 15w), KVM functionality, and decent 100hz refresh rate sold me on the screen.  I use KVM lightly because this isn't a true KVM, BUT if you are using two machines with TB3 it works fine and you can simply select which machine will have control in the OSD...super easy and a great feature for me as I have the screen connected to my 2018 mac and 2019 Razer Blade 15 and I can switch which gets the KB/Mouse functionality, have the screen split or PIP.<br/><br/>Sound Quality-<br/>Not too much to say here. It gets loud enough to fill a small room, no real base or clean treble but its not the worst things I've ever heard and it's significantly better than 99.99999% of laptop speakers out there. Its acceptable for what it is no more no less.<br/><br/>Gaming -<br/>So being 100hz and coming from my 2019 15" Razer blade's 144hz screen I thought the step down would be very noticeable.  I can definitely tell it's not quite as smooth, but it's still a very smooth gameplay experience.  There is no Free/GSync so that can be a concern, but as a casual gamer while I noticed a difference it wasn't significant and I am happy to sacrifice that by upping the resolution and having a wider FOV (in most games).<br/>Besides the refresh rate, input lag was pretty good and shouldn't affect anyone outside of top pro gamer types.<br/>This kind of brings me to the next topic which isn't so much about the quality of the monitor but an idea of what you might need to run it.....<br/><br/>Horsepower-<br/>So gaming 'rig' wise my Razer Blade 15" has a 2060RTX, i7 8750h hexacore, 16GB DDR4 and a 512GB Samsung NVME.<br/>Two games I've been playing lately are Path of Exiles and Apex Legends here's a very brief breakdown of the frames:<br/>Apex Legends @ 1080p w/RTX 2060----------@3440x1440p<br/>------------------avg ~105-------------------------avg ~80<br/><br/>In apex settings are mostly maxed (no AA), still very playable at this resolution with a 2060 RTX and doesn't dip below 70fps (on mobile 2060 even mind you!)<br/><br/>Path of Exiles @ 1080p w/RTX 2060 -------------------- @ 3440x1440p<br/>------------------avg ~120fps --------------------------------avg ~90fps -------<br/> windows<br/>Not sure why but PoE took a much bigger frame hit going to the higher resolution but still averaged 90fps at native resolution with maxed settings.<br/><br/>So as far as horsepower and today's current games I would say a 1070/2060 would probably be the minimum you would want to have if you plan on gaming at the native res and getting framerates in the 60-100 range on MOST current AAA games.<br/><br/>So other than the design of the VESA mounting bracket I really enjoy this monitor.  It's bright, vibrant and contrasty and plays games smoothly with little to no motion blur.  The speakers are decent and with 2 TB3 ports KVM functionality its a great value @ $800 and below!</span>

<span>Love the monitor's appearance. Its probably a little larger than I need for my home office, but it will double as a video monitor so I'm happy.<br/><br/>Two comments/complaints<br/>1.

A lot of people posted 1 star reviews thinking they got a faulty product and the monitor wasnt assembled coreectly however it is supposed to come exactly how the picturs show it.

<span>Few bullet points regarding the advertised features:<br/>270hz:<br/>-Had a few times where the monitor flickered, but I think it was due to the DisplayPort cable being an issue.  I'm also using a dual monitor setup, this one and another with actual GSYNC module (PG27UQ). If I enabled Adaptive Sync on this monitor before turning on GSYNC in Nvidia's control panel, this monitor sometimes went completely black and wouldn't turn on unless I restarted the PC. But again, it's possible this could be related to my dual monitor setup. So what I do from now on is just enable GSYNC in the Nvidia Control panel first, then enable Adaptive Sync on my monitor.<br/><br/>Monitor design:<br/>-I really wished ASUS changed the design of the monitor ports for these monitors so the cables weren't so bent going in. It goes up vertically and if your displayport is too bulky, the wires will get really bent going in. I've had to purchase separate ones, ones labeled "DisplayPort 1.4" from Maxonar Store on Amazon.<br/>-Flickering @ 270hz stopped when I got the DisplayPort 1.4 cable. This is a different sort of screen-black-out that occurred without Adaptive sync turned on. Keep in mind there is a disclaimer when turning on 270hz that screen-flickering may occur. But so far, I've used it for 2 months now and havent had it happen after the week.<br/><br/>ELMB Sync<br/>-I don't use ELMB/GSYNC for competitive games, but I can confirm it does work fine. '<br/>Just keep in mind that the following occurs when ELMB Sync is enabled:<br/>-HDR can not be enabled<br/>-Screen brightness is also dimmed as a result<br/>-Overdrive setting is locked out when ONLY when ELMB Sync is enabled.. In other words, Adaptive Sync On + ELMB Sync off = Overdrive is unlocked. Adaptive Sync + ELMB Sync on = Overdrive is locked and cannot change.<br/><br/>You can technically also use only ELMB by turning on ELMB Sync on + Adaptive Sync Off. This is only advisable if the game is running at fixed FPS (120hz = game is constnatly 120fps, or 240hz = 240fps) If the game's FPS fluctuates during this mode, you'll experience double-images/artifacting.<br/><br/>Personally, I haven't noticed any flickering/eye-strain with ELMB Sync, but as with strobe-based motion blur reduction, some people may be sensitive to it. ELMB sync will turn off by itself if it reaches below 80fps, FYI. It will turn back on once it goes back up. Someone also mentioned increasing brightness before turning on ELMB but it didn't make a difference to me. The only thing you can change is Contrast and Shadow Boost levels with it on.<br/><br/>-I've used NVIDIA filters to increase the brightness to compensate, but again, I really only bought this to play competitive games at a high refresh rate. I switch to my PG27UQ 4K monitor for proper GSYNC/visual fidelity<br/><br/>HDR400:<br/>-In comparison to my PG27UQ HDR1000 certificiation, my PG27UQ blows it out of the water obviously.<br/>If this is your first HDR monitor, you'll still be impressed by the visuals in games that do support it. Just keep HDR disabled in Windows until you're ready to play a game.<br/><br/>-Windows 11 is also going to be changing how HDR looks when it's enabled by default so that it doesn't look washed out when you're not playing a game or not playing an HDR-capable video<br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/>+Buy it for competitive games, especially if you want ELMB. Buy it if your card can achieve 240fps+<br/><br/>-Don't buy this if you're looking for GSYNC compatible features. Most would argue native GSYNC monitors, while expensive, are worth it if you're a stickler for it. Otherwise, know that you are getting something that is "good" but not as good as actual GSYNC.<br/><br/>-For GSYNC Enthusiasts, look up PG279QM for an actual 1440p 240hz (not 270hz) GSYNC monitor with similar features). Keep in mind, the PG279QM does NOT have ULMB despite having a native GSYNC module. But most reviews seem to praise it despite it and looks good without it.<br/><br/>-Dont buy this for the HDR400. The lowest I recommend is HDR600 for any noticeable difference. It's still better than nothing, but if you can afford to buy something better, then buy something better.</span>

<span>PREVIOUS MONITOR<br/><br/>Since 2016 I've used the Acer XB271HU 1440p, 165Hz, IPS, G-SYNC Module, 27" monitor for everything I did. That includes gaming, 3D modeling (Rhino3D, Maya, ZBrush), 3D rendering (Maxwell, VRay), photo editing (Photoshop, Lightroom), 2D graphics (Illustrator), and it did great for everything. I never calibrated it and colors were still decently good (not perfect) when printing physical copies of my work. For gaming, it was great and I could not have chosen a better monitor when I did for the various things I needed it for.<br/><br/>NEW MONITOR (ASUS XG27AQM)<br/><br/>To preface this, I've also used the Acer XB273U GX and the ASUS TUF VG259QM for several months each and at separate times each. Purchased them at Micro Center just for testing purposes (to see which I liked more) and not for ownership. I know some people prefer 24" monitors for gaming, but I personally can switch between 24" and 27" monitors just fine.<br/><br/>It's only been one day since I received ASUS XG27AQM in the mail, but listed below are my PROS and CONS. Personally, it's worth the upgrade from my previous monitor (especially since I'll be looking to sell my XB271HU now). The ability to feel and play at frames higher than 165fps (especially if sustained and with a crisp frame time graph) is very noticeable and makes fast paced games much more enjoyable. I have not overclocked it to 270Hz because there's currently really no need to in my opinion (refer to CONS).<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE (UPDATED)<br/><br/>I'm also a bit cautious of the OC function because on my previous experience with the Acer XB273U GX and the ASUS TUF VG259QM. Both screens would go black for a few seconds and then the picture would come back. Granted, it also warns you when enabling the OC. I honestly didn't mind it, but it'd happen in the middle of a game which was annoying at times. I purchased an iVANKY DP1.4 cable (since the reviews were great) and the black screen still happened even when trying different ports on the monitors and graphics card. The OC function on my Acer XB271HU never caused the screen the go black, ever. Update: Since writing the review, I've overclocked the XG27AQM to 270Hz, and at least for my unit, the screen does not flicker or go black for a few seconds. Keeping it overclocked for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>- 1440p<br/>- 240Hz (270Hz OC)<br/>- Very Responsive (Slightly quicker input lag than my previous monitor, but that's probably due to the increase Hz)<br/>- Good colors (Will most certainly calibrate this monitor though)<br/>- Arrived with zero dead pixels<br/>- No perceptible overshoot at Overdrive Setting 4 (I tried OD-5 as well, but I visually preferred OD-4)<br/>- Motion clarity at OD-4 with ELMB disabled is noticeably improved from my previous monitor<br/>- I have G-SYNC Compatible enabled and it works great (I personally don't notice a difference from a physical G-SYNC Module, and many well documented reviews for monitors only show an input lag increase of &lt;1ms when enabling a Variable Refresh Rate technology) so it's worth it<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- When enabling ELMB, the brightness is too low for me even in a very dark room. Update: I've since enabled ELMB. What I did to combat the brightness drop is set it to 100% brightness first, then enabled ELMB, and finally set Shadow Boost to Level 2. It was plenty usable after that.<br/>- I don't have an RTX 3080 yet to push more frames haha :'( My RTX 2070 Super is great, but an upgrade is definitely needed for this type of monitor. Maybe I'll wait for an RTX 4080 to pair with my i9-10850K @ 5.0GHz.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS<br/><br/>If you haven't purchased a monitor in several years and have been looking for a proper upgrade, here is your monitor, the ASUS XG27AQM. These specs will not become obsolete any time soon. The 1440p resolution provides improved visual clarity from 1080p, the increased refresh rate of 240Hz Native/270Hz OC from 165Hz is noticeable, and the motion clarity improvement is great for the enjoyment of fast paced video games.<br/><br/>If I were asked, "Would you return your ASUS XG27AQM and instead purchase the Acer XB273U GX or ASUS TUF VG259QM?", my answer would be, "No."<br/><br/>But if I were asked, "In hindsight, which would you purchase, the ASUS XG27AQM, Acer XB273U GX or ASUS TUF VG259QM?", my answer would be, "The ASUS TUF VG259QM is 100% out of the question because of the noticeable decrease in resolution and visual clarity. For the ASUS XG27AQM and Acer XB273U GX it would depend on availability. Both 1440p 270Hz monitors are great each with their own pros and cons. The Acer XB273U GX has two usable Black Frame Insertion modes (Off, Normal, and Extreme) vs the ASUS XG27AQM's (On and Off). Colors, motion clarity, and input lag are all comparable. Ultimately, I'd be hard pressed to say one is better than the other, so I'd be happy purchasing either the ASUS XG27AQM or the Acer XB273U GX. But from my own personal experience, there was some noticeable overshoot on my copy of the Acer XB273U GX which is why I did not repurchase it and instead went for the ASUS XG27AQM. No overshoot to be seen on my copy of the ASUS XG27AQM which is why I will be keeping this monitor and not returning it."<br/><br/>Games I Play: Witcher 3, PUBG, Rocket League, Battlefield (4, V, 2042), Apex Legends, Risk of Rain 2, Dragon Quest XI, Ori Series, Trine Series, and Resident Evil 2 Remake.</span>

<span>So far so good. Incredibly easy to set up. Took it out of the box, removed my prior monitor from its mount, screwed this one in, plugged in the same HDMI cable, plugged in power and turned it on. Immediately hooked in. It's a bit heavy, but given the ease otherwise and the fact that I don't anticipate lifting it again, that's minimal concern. I'm not using this for gaming, just office work, but it sure is a relief on my tired old middle aged eyes. The resolution and colors look fantastic, minimal glare off the light through the windows. There's like a matted sense to the screen, which is just what I was looking for so that I didn't get too much reflection off of the window behind me (before, even with the shutters closed, the little light going through would impair the quality of the imaging off of my monitor.<br/><br/>I have a smaller ACER monitor mounted next to it, wanted to try this first before getting a second. Assuming that things continue to go well with this one, will be purchasing another soon.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> A 240Hz refresh rate is 4x faster than typical standard monitors and twice as fast as common 120Hz gaming monitors. More frames means smaller visual information Gaps, which means a faster reaction time for the Gamer. There's a 8.3 millisecond gap between frames at 120Hz, which is halved to 4.16ms between frames at 240Hz. This is incredibly important to gamers playing at breakneck speeds, and provides an edge over gamers less well-equipped. Combined with skill, get more wins by being able to react in real-time.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Amd Radeon free Sync technology synchronizes the GPU and monitor, displaying full frames only when the monitor is capable of displaying them. This minimizes graphic distortions such as tearing and artifacts from forming on screen, allowing you to experience native refresh rates up to 240Hz for rapid-fire, tear-free Graphics that don't require user adjustments.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> A wide-angle viewing range means that color coverage is consistent no matter which angle The screen is viewed from. This is thanks to the IPS technology that the monitor is built on.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Convenient monitor controls are easily reached on the right side of the monitor, with a new joystick for navigating menus quickly and intuitively. The individual buttons can be assigned as shortcuts for the gamer's preferred tools and settings.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The true 1ms response time blasts away motion blur. The pixels are able to change quickly and respond to the new image signal as it comes in. This is a new feature for IPS monitors, which have typically been considered too slow for gaming.  </span></li>

<span>Great display.  Crisp picture and the curved screen is great on the eyes with less strain after long hours staring at work documents.  I am also a fan of the Samsung "joystick" like power button on the back of the screen (after figuring out how to use it lol).<br/><br/>It would be the perfect monitor if it had built in speakers.  Despite no built in speakers I am giving it 5 stars; I knew it didn't have speakers when I bought it and cant hold that against the product. Besides, the picture and performance is so good, I don't want to knock it.  I don't understand why Samsung does not have more curved monitors with speakers, I have 2 of their 28" ones with speakers at the house and we love them too.  This 32' full HD is better though, and I can live with the need for an external speaker at work.<br/>Great dollar value for a great screen. Would highly recommend.</span>

<span>I game mostly on ps4 and xbox one on a 55" 4k. Wanted smaller for gaming. I havent tested my laptop on it but this monitor has clear picture. I purchased a viotek gn32c and was hoping for a good monitor, turns out to be blurry and no hdcp support which means no netflix etc if it is enabled on ps4. Read a lot about 1080p over a 32 inch not being so good. So I decided I'll just buy a cheaper 32inch monitor. I own a lot of Samsung products so I decided to just get Samsung. And I'm glad I made this purchase. There are 2 identical models cf391 and this cf397(cheaper). I can read text easily now no matter how small compared to viotek. No dead pixels and the colors is great!<br/>No tilt function or vesa mounting but doesnt bother me. I would definitely recommend buying this as a budget gaming monitor.</span>

<span>I don't game, but I'm on my computer all the time for work. Once I played with the settings a little bit, I figured out the best resolution for what I need. I think most of the negative reviews are from people who expected a plug and play setup. This one needed some adjustment. I don't know what others do, but I found a video online that walked me through the settings. Very helpful. It's so nice that I just ordered a second one. When I get it setup I might post a pic.</span>

<span>This monitor is absolutely gorgeous. The “eye-saver” mode is perfect for when I’m working long hours or gaming for an extended period of time.<br/><br/>There are times however when the monitor will just go black. I googled and haven’t found out why. I assume since it’s refurbished there may be some issues. It doesn’t always happen but when it does it is an extreme inconvenience.<br/><br/>Overall a great product but I find it irritating paying this much money for a product not to work properly and consistently.</span>

<span>Been using it for a few days now. No dead pixels, brilliant color. Gaming is actually a night and day difference and I couldn't go back to my 75Hz monitor that is now sitting to the side for other things as it's way too noted in the difference. Watched a few movies on it, played a few games (Insurgency: Sandstorm, Warzone, RDR2) and I am very, VERY, pleased.<br/><br/>The Amazon Deal came on today and I believe the 27" version is only $15 more than what I paid, but I've owned 34" monitors before and this is exactly what I need right now for where I'm at.<br/><br/>Oh, and the 165Hz, right out of the box with supplied DP cord and I haven't needed to turn on the AMD Freesync option as I'm running a 1070 Ti SC card anyway, but I can assure you, this is FAST and no blurry movement or need for V-Sync at all.<br/><br/>Fingers crossed that this thing is a 3-5 year keeper!<br/><br/>Update - September 7th, 2022 = All I can say is, I went back and forth on wanting to buy this and put it off for a full month. I wish I hadn't waited. Gaming is AMAZING... all else (watching movies, surfing the net, etc.) just as awesome. DP wire that was supplied works perfect and this never had a problem losing sync @ 165Hz. No tears in gaming, settings at full screen and not having to enable vsync has been spectacular.<br/><br/>HIGHLY recommend this monitor!!!<br/><br/>PS - No dead pixels, YAY!!!</span>

<span>This monitor has been a great addition to my gaming set up.  The picture quality is incredible.  It works well when connected to multiple devices.  The speaker is what could be expected from a monitor, but not bad by any means.  It checked all of my boxes and if I had the space, I'd buy a second.</span>
