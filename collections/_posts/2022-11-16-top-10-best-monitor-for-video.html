<span>Fantastic rack mount monitor at a great price, I use these for live events and broadcast. Is the color perfect, no. Is this the best value you are going to get in a rack mount dual monitor that does DVI and VGA with Loop absolutely.<br/><br/>Questions I had: Will it do 1080P/60, yes without issue<br/>Cal I switch the color space to use with HDSDI, no. You will need something else to do that.</span>

<span>I have enjoyed this monitor set on my rack. Very nice and functional.<br/><br/>We moved, and in the process I lost my power adapter. When I inquired on purchasing a replacement Viviteq quickly sent me out a replacement at no charge. You can't get better than that!<br/><br/>Highly recommended.</span>

<span>A very good value - this rack mount dual monitor system provides multiple loop through inputs.  I use this product in a tech boot at a church for DVD play back monitoring for two DVD players (DVI) as well as loop through monitor for a video  switcher (VGA) - I select the input for each display to show what needs to be monitored.</span>

<span>I bought this to monitor my security cameras but the image was terrible. The problem appeared to be some kind of sync issue but my "Feelworld" dual monitor looks great and it's just a tiny bit more in price. I think there is a reason this one is so inexpensive. If you order one be sure to check it out in your application before the return window closes, you might be sad.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this but it went right back in the box and got returned.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor because the previously recommended model was discontinued. With that leap of faith, I just hoped it would work well with the Glide Gear TMP-100 I bought simultaneously.<br/><br/>While waiting two extra days for the teleprompter to arrive I played with the monitor and my screaming streaming Legion Laptop.<br/><br/>Finding a USB port strong enough to handle the 4K capabilities of the monitor, I hooked it up and Voila, easy peasy there was my image. Although I could dink with settings galore as if I was a professional videographer who knows what he's doing, I kept all the defaults since I fear fixing something that isn't broken.<br/><br/>Whew! No Fears!<br/><br/>Setting this monitor onto the platform tray of the teleprompter and securing it down was a breeze.<br/><br/>And the bright screen is clear as day through the 70/30 glass of the Glide Gear TMP-100.<br/><br/>Oh yes, indeed, I recommend this little guy, and I may even buy his bigger sibling model, just to get 'the bigger picture' when doing Zoom meetings using my TMP-100. Gotta look my audience in the eye!</span>

<span>• Package: It came very well packaged in a sturdy box that came in a bigger box with other products purchased.<br/>• Product: The unit seems to work fine. The monitor, without the battery, is very light. Very sharp display and colors seem to be spot on. The screen has a glossy finish so I guess a protective matte film would be a good addition to it. Peaking function requires a very contrasty image/scene to offer some precision, but it is definitely a nice addition. It came with a Sony F-970 battery plate, but it can be replaced for the Canon LP-E6 plate (not included, unfortunately). The little ball head that comes with it is 100% metal, so it seems to be resistant. Lets see how it resists through time. The silicon protective skin is welcome and will probably save the unit from scratches and minor impacts. Its is also the only way you can attach the shade that comes with the package.<br/>• The seller: The seller has been attentive and answered my questions with a few hours delay. Understandable sine I'm in US and the seller is in China. God thing is that the unit is fulfilled by Amazon, so although the seller is in China, the stock seems to be already in US warehouses, meaning the delivery happened in 48h (with amazon prime).<br/>• Considerations - I: last time I bought a Lilliput monitor, a few years ago, it came with a nice little hard case that had space for all the little pieces and the screen itself, this one didn't. It would be nice if they did provide that again.<br/>• Considerations - II: For now I'm using the unit with a Canon 5DMKII and a Canon 60D. No problems so far.<br/><br/>I'll keep this review updated if something worth mentioning comes up.</span>

<span>The PD3220U is ideal for digital work, as BenQ is notably silent on its Adobe RGB performance but boasts its P3 performance. It's also an improved monitor over the PD3200U. It may lack variable refresh rates making it not gaming-focused.  Outside that particular omission, it has just about everything else you'd want: puck adjuster for controls, USB3.1c, KVM switch, multiple inputs, ability to hot-swap color profiles, and even display profiles two at once.<br/><br/>It's relatively performant, besting the other displays at this size. The best comparison of the displays I tried was a Dell U3219Q when I purchased it was $850, but now it is roughly half the price. In pretty much every measurable way, the BenQ is a better display (sans perhaps cost-to-performance).<br/><br/>It works great my MacBook Pro and Mac Pro (although under 10.13.6 with an NVidia GPU, it was registering as a 6k display, whereas my AMD Vega 56 reported it correctly). The only real complaints are the viewing angle could be a hair wider, but at the size, this is always going to be the cause.  Color shift is pretty minimal. The finish can be mildly glare reflective in direct sunlight as its not a full matte. There's the smallest of edge shadow due to the ultra-thin bezel at the bottom edge, least pronounced of the four 32 inch 4k displays I've tried.  The black uniformity is the best I've ever seen in a 32-inch display, which is just flatly ok. When the monitor is totally dark, you can see a bit of unevenness. Also, there are no backlighting zones. It gets dark; it's not like my aging plasma screen's ability to produce deep blacks. As a daily driver, though, this is an excellent display and better than most. The wide gamut is especially felt when working with Adobe RGB profiled images and RAW photos. The P3 covers Rec BT 709 (very similar to sRGB) but lacks in the greens compared to Rec BT2020, which is well beyond any current displays sans very expensive high-end color grading displays.<br/><br/>Embracing P3 as the wide gamut standard, which covers roughly 45% of the colors the human eye can see (it's nowhere near Rec BT2020 covers 75%), is a good move as it is similar to Adobe RGB in colors covered. Basically, downloading test 10bit vs. 8bit footage is notable as gradient banding pretty much nonexistent whereas 8 bit footage you can see the banding.<br/><br/>I don't live or die by color accuracy, but it is nice when doing UI work.<br/><br/>There's also a few eye-strain technologies tossed in, do they work? Unsure doesn't seem to affect my eyes.  Also, the charging isn't quite enough for the 15 inch MacBook.<br/><br/>Lastly, the UI for a display is well above average. There are two quick profile color swaps, and brightness is super easy to adjust.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>True 10 bit, not FRC.<br/>Wide color gamut and covers 96% of P3<br/>Easy to use UI and fast<br/>Multicolor profiles come included<br/>Didn't need to set up any color adjustments<br/>Despite the wide amount of features, sanely implemented<br/>Very low color shift.<br/>Fantastic pre-calibration.<br/>USB 3.1c<br/>More inputs than I'll ever need.<br/>Colorwise matches my MacBook 2017<br/><br/>The so-so:<br/>Matte isn't totally light sheeting.<br/>Viewing angles are pretty good but shy of smaller displays.<br/>Wattage is a bit low for 15 inch MacBooks running CPU intensive tasks, meaning still probably gotta use a power cable.<br/>GeForce 1060 thought the display was 6k under MacOS 10.13.6.<br/>No FRC, but MacOS doesn't support it.<br/>Slim bevels.<br/>Stand works nicely, no buttons or levels.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/>Backlighting could be more uniform<br/>Blacks look really good but still not as dark as my old plasma TV<br/>Somewhat pricey<br/>Internal speakers aren't any better than a Macbook's. Why bother?<br/><br/>Wishlist:<br/>I wish this was 5k or 6k; the size is fantastic.<br/>60+ Hz would be nice.<br/>Zoned backlighting for larger light/dark<br/><br/>/edit update:<br/><br/>Well covid hit and now this my main work display, and because of its input switching and ability to charge my laptop, has become even more valuable. I have a Thunderbolt 3 dock but this effectively eliminates the need. One cable connects me to my speakers, two displays and speakers, which are shared with my 2010 Mac Pro.</span>

<span>We have 3 of these and love them.  We use them in a dual monitor configuration where they are paired up with a much more expensive graphics monitor.  Except for very picky colors that we probably only see because we have a comparison, they are very similar quality to the high end monitors.</span>

<span>The BenQ PD3200U monitor was purchased after experimenting with others like the VIOTEK GN32DA 32-Inch which was dismal, yielding grainy text and ghosting even at 144Mhz. I needed a graphic design business monitor (Adobe and Office apps) that also could double as a game monitor for the Battlefield franchise, namely game "V" at the time of this post.<br/><br/>I use Windows 10, therefore, I will provide a few pointers on setup. Click Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Display and slide the "Make text bigger" to 120% which will increase the file names and menus throughout Windows to an easier to read size when in native 3840 x 2160 resolution. The Scale and layout will automatically adjust to 150% for text, apps and other items. With the BenQ PD3200U monitor set at full resolution, browsers will need to be changed to 120% for the best reading size. I use Firefox, so I added the extension "Fixed Zoom" and set at 120% for all pages. I also had to open Outlook, click View &gt; View Settings &gt; Other Settings changing fonts to 10 pt. Segoe UI. Outlook 2016 and 2019 will require folder by folder font adjustments mentioned above ( I would assume the same for 365). As far as color accuracy, the factory settings were just fine out of the box.<br/><br/>However, if you find the native 3840 x 2160 is just impossible to work with visually, which I did where I am not a CAD/CAM user, there is a solution. You will need to right mouse click on desktop and choose Nvidia &gt; Display &gt; Change resolution and select the BenQ monitor. Click the "Customize..." button and accept the risk warning. Click "Create Custom Resolution..." button and enter 16:9 safe aspect ration of Horizontal pixels: 2880 and Vertical lines: 1620 which will use the full wide of the screen. Click test and quickly click save settings. Scroll up to the Custom setting of 2880 x 1620 and select and then click apply. The reason for this is Nvidia drivers assume a 30" monitor, therefore it doesn't include the needed resolution. Once completed, the Firefox browser no longer needs the "fixed zoom". Reset to 100% and delete. Click Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Display and slide the "Make text bigger" to 120% and Make everything bigger, the size should be set to 125%.  The other setting was the Outlook font to 9 pt. instead of 10 pt. Segoe UI mentioned above. Your screen now views like a 1920 x 1080 monitor, only at a much better resolution.<br/><br/>Don't forget to adjust ClearType, a detail often overlooked. Type "ClearType" in Windows search and go through each selection panel to choose the easiest font to read after the above is completed. When done, you will have a crisp 1920 x 1080 legibility at 3840 x 2160 resolution for most of your desktop experience, except for Windows user panels like save files and transfer files. I also changed from 8bpc (24bits per pixel RGB 4:2:0) to 10bpc (30bits per pixel RGB 4:4:4) for maximum color control for the Adobe Suite. (With an AMD Radeon, their drivers limit 10bpc at YCbCr 4:2:2 in many cases). You can make this adjustment from the Nvidia Control Panel &gt; Display &gt; Change resolution &gt; Use NVIDIA color settings and Output color depth: dropdown. 10bpc and HDR are one and the same. This will not affect games, where anything DX9 compliant or later has to render pixels in 24-bit floating-point per channel.  Note: My screen showed a glowing bluish area on the right at 10bpc, so I reverted to 8bpc when creating the 2880 x 1620 resolution which helped.<br/><br/>About THE game challenge with this monitor, I purchased an EVGA GeForce RTX 2080 XC video card to first assure I had all the rendering capability as possible. You will want to buy a UV001 10ft Gold Plate 4K Resolution cable, where the cables that come with the monitor are baseline and short. The monitor's maximum 60Hz refresh rate is understandably a concern. Ideally, 144Hz is optimal for current games however, I have yet to find a monitor that provides crisp production text with 100% RGB colors, 144Hz refresh, and G-sync or FreeSync. Using NVIDIA’s 441.66 graphics drivers at the time of this test, I found Battlefield V played great at GeForce Experience using optimal settings which is mostly 'ultra' resolution overall, DXR Raytracing at medium. The details were insane, too much really where you could identify designer errors in the games wireframes. In the game, I maintained ultra settings but dropped the resolution to 1920 x 1080. Super sharp gameplay without any GPU strain :) All the other high demand games I tried played fine as well.<br/><br/>The menu puck is simply amazing when it comes to quick changes or user preference presets. The additional connector ports and the ability to connect two CPU's to the monitor is a big plus since I also repair laptops and desktops. I was able to remove my 8 port 3.0 USB hub and use the monitor ports for mouse and USB utility cables. The speakers that come with the monitor are located on the back and sound like large tin cans, meaning adding speakers or a headset is a must. Long story short, this monitor is super sharp and accurate for video and media production while providing all I need for weekend game nights. It is a very fussy monitor to set up correctly, but I am happy with it after all the effort!</span>

<span>I was really nervous about buying a different brand—I have always used an apple display for my graphic design work for the last 15 years, but I just didn't want to spend that much money this time. A photographer friend recommended this monitor to me and I read a lot of reviews online that were super positive. This monitor has gone above and beyond my expectations and I really can't tell a difference between my apple display and this one, at least for what I am doing. I highly recommend this for graphic designers.</span>

<span>I purchased this monitor without many Amazon reviews found, but did find YT videos on it. I received the item as used - like new and when it arrived, it did have finger prints on the monitor, but all in all it appeared to look new. I connected my main camera to it and got a great picture, then added two more gopro cameras to the monitor and switched it to display 4 quadrants. It was a nice experience to be able to setup all my cameras using just one camera. The only issue I had was it did not come with the battery to be able to use it in the field. But the seller was prompt and reached out to me to offer a battery and charger sent to me at no additional charge. Although I would have accepted this, I had already sent the monitor back. Customer Service at Viviteq was top not in my book. Oh and on a side note, this monitor is actually quite large. So using it in the field would be kind of hard, but all and all a good studio monitor if you need the capabilities of four cameras.</span>

It fits perfectly with one caveat (that is just a fitment issue and not an issue with the monitor). If you are using this in a glide gear then you probably want to be sure you have a right angle HDMI connector.

<span>I attempted to replace an old TCL television being used as a monitor, but since it lacked HDMI 2.0 inputs it could only support 4k @ 30 hz. This monitor definitely is capable of 4k @ 60 hz, but the picture quality is absolutely atrocious. When an old TCL television beats your image quality, you know you've done something wrong, Samsung.<br/><br/>The gamma is completely non-uniform between colors and tends to blow out highlights while crushing blacks--only the mid-tones are remotely viewable. The uniformity is so bad that is cannot be corrected by adjusting RGB gammas and would require complete color calibration to overcome, which I didn't bother to attempt.<br/><br/>The screen curvature was a nice touch, especially since I sit fairly close to the monitor, but the image quality was so bad that having better viewing geometry became a non-issue. The attachment of cables also leaves something to be desired, as the connectors are immediately behind the stand itself and face upwards, making for cramped and difficult connections.<br/><br/>Although I didn't even attempt to play games on it, I suspect that this monitor would do fairly well for that (at least), since I could notice very slight flickering in certain grey-patterned images even at 60 hz. No flickering was obvious on the television for such images, even at 30 hz, so I suspect that the monitor is quite responsive at higher frame rates. If only the picture was better, and that's more important to me.<br/><br/>I guess I'm going with a larger (50-inch, flat 😞) television with HDMI 2.0/2.1 inputs instead. What a disappointment.</span>

<span>First, the size of the box it comes in is huge. Obviously to hold the 32-inch monitor that is inside. Everything was well packaged to prevent any damage during shipping. The monitor has its own stand mount and cannot be used with any standard monitor mounts, which is a downside if you are wanting to mount it otherwise. When setting up your cables to run, the stand has a cable channel that allows you to hide the cables and not be sore eyesight. The monitor does come with an HDMI cable which is nice but not the other type of cable to utilize the PBP feature. The other video input is DisplayPort which you cannot use an HDMI cable on, so you'd have to do your own research on finding an Active DisplayPort adapter. Once I powered on the monitor the resolution was amazing, not because of the size and in your face. I could see more detail on a larger scale, which is nice for me since I do some design work on my CNC router and laser. This was a major reason why I wanted the 32-inch Samsung monitor. You control all the settings through a simple joypad style button like most Samsung products have, which can be a pain but convenient and out of the way. Along with using it for my CNC work, I use it to play my gaming console as well as I wait on projects to finish on my laser. I can either watch both my laptop and gaming console at the same time or I can choose to switch between them utilizing the DisplayPort. It has an eye saver mode built-in if you plan on using for extended hours at a time but I have not used that feature yet. Going through and adjusting the settings, most of the images or videos that play on the monitor look lifelike! The curve on the monitor is very nice to have especially if you are sitting so close to it using your computer. It definitely gives what you are looking at a better perspective for your eyes since it is about the same distance from the center to the edge of the monitor. So if you are looking for something huge, uses little desk space, amazing picture and resolution, hides cables, lets you use 2 video inputs at the same time or switch between the two. Then this is the monitor for you to get! I would really like to get another one to go side by side! </span>

<span>first off, once again, 1 star removed bcz the carriers you choose to use lie about delivery, then dont deliver to my actual address forcing me to walk heavy boxes up 3 flights of stairs. the carriers have dollies and stuff for that, i do not, so ill keep removing a star until you gain control over your carriers.<br/><br/>1 star removed bcz i tried to cancel this before it shipped but received an email saying it was too late to cancel, but it didnt actually ship until 30 hours later. good job people, keep it up.<br/><br/>1 star removed because you sent a 400.00 item in a giant box with not one piece of bubble wrap. if i had the energy i would box all this up and send it back. all my packages from amazon these past 2 weeks have come with little or no bubble and im buying up parts for a VR computer, so that about 3500.00 over 3 e-tailers and 4 different carriers, all arriving in busted boxes at the wrong location with no protection. this is your job. why is it hard?<br/><br/>so you just lost 60% of your rating for avoidable things that are persistent in your supply chain. amazon has been getting worse and worse and worse ever since it started being another e-bay with shady sellers and wildly fluctuating prices and shipping. your usefulness is coming to and end when prime video is no better than free youtube, your products are price matched , and your delivery methods are corrupted.<br/><br/>now for the monitor. i should keep taking stars away, but i would be left with negatives. first the bezel"less". there is a bottom branded bezel, along with 1/8" of dead space. the other 3 sides all have 1/4" dead space. so you effectively have an internal bezel of non-usable screen real estate that still takes up the space a monitor that doesnt shave off inches does.<br/><br/>next - display port. it does have 1 display port. ive read reviews where it did not, and that was the reason for my cancel request. well, that and no vesa, really, why would you not include that? seems intentionally cheap. anyway about the DP, i dont know if samsung updated this model to include it, or previous reviewers got bait and switched with a different model (this also happens here on amazon, just look at some "renewed" item listings), or simply didnt recognize the port as it looks like hdmi in the dark, and it is dark up in the cable attachment area. in any case you get one now. just one. version 1.2<br/><br/>no vesa. you know, this is disheartening as vesa compatibility has almost become ubiquitous. so this was a choice. a choice made by someone who is completely out of touch with todays home and soho computing. its one thing to not include the vesa if you are going to give us a stand with lots of motion, and stability, and good materials. instead you get a cheap tube frame and about 5 degress of motion up and down, no side to side. the frame is so cheap , i assume, bcz they engineered the weight and design of the monitor to hold it steady. in this it is marginally successful, but only by using a lot of desk space.<br/><br/>controls - are a joke. i do enjoy the joystick type navigation on the power button, serving double duty as the way to nav the menu. however, you get contrast, brightness, volume....oh yeah, thats it. why have a menu?<br/><br/>documentation/box contents - you get a lot of useless information, like a warning not to pour water on it, but no product spec sheet, which i immediately hunted for to put the display port thing to rest. no case badge, no stickers of any kind, no cleaning cloth, no display port cord. nothing. im sorry, you do get a cheap 6' hdmi cable and a typical power cable.<br/><br/>color. when i plugged it in, i had typical hd settings on my ben-q ips. so i immediately got a pop up warning for that. once i changed it to 4k settings, it filled up my screen but was washed out, grey. even now with brightness on 100, the top amazon blue nav bar looks muted and washed out. the white area where i am typing is kinda grimy grey. there are no controls to change this on the monitor. obviously you can use windows to calibrate, which i just took a time out from this review to do. setting brightness on 50 even though it looks like typing on a gym sock, i went through the process, only to find at the end, nothing changed at all. except my brightness control was reset to zero, giving me the ability to raise total brightness past the previous max. welcome because now i can see, but still washed out colors.<br/><br/>cyber monday had some ok deals and there are screens by AOC and even LG that i should have tried. but i own lots of samsung stuff and im typically happy, so i went with this one. at 500.00 original cost i would lol in your face while i packed it up and returned it. at the 399.00 i paid i feel raw by about 150.00. this is a 250.00 monitor tops. there is way too much competition, good competition, for samsung to release this giant box of pffft.<br/><br/>im going to keep it for either my 3rd or 4th favorite computer, but thats only bcz its here in my house already, but it wont ever be connected to any machine i use every day.<br/><br/>skip this. people will say its the cheapest 4k so get it. but washed out colors, no vesa, simplistic controls and giant footprint on your desk make it a sure pass. i havent even tried to watch anything in 4k yet bcz it cant make web browsing look good and im too tired to get more irritated at this junk.<br/><br/>oh, i forgot cable management. imagine the cheapest thinnest plastic ever, then make it thinner, and this is your backplate which covers the area where the stand screws to the screen and offers a hidden channel to run your pwr, dp, and hdmi cords down to the desk level. this demands careful thought as a previous reviewer ranted about the cables falling out. well, yes, the hdmi slot is too wide and it will fall out over time, as will the power cable, however you can coil and bend the wires to a point where you can make then exert upward pressure to keep them seated. no tape or glue needed. it takes time bcz you dont have alot of room to work in and you dont have a lot of room to coil up inches of cable in there. the fisher price backplate is not strong enough to hold it if you could. this was a design flaw and an obvious one that should have been caught and rectified during product testing. recessed, side facing ports with a usb 3.0 or 2 or 3 would have been a good addition, and one which most of the competition has included so once again im left scratching my head as to why samsung decided not to include these features.<br/><br/>after i finished writing this, i have to go back and take another star off for quality of product. i hate 1 star reviews, but samsung and amazon deserve it.</span>

<span>Many of the features of Lilliput monitors don't actually work. There are menu items to turn them off and on but they don't actually do anything. Contacting support only gets you an email saying they *MIGHT* fix it in a future firmware update, but they NEVER put out firmware updates. You can check their website to verify this. I would avoid buying any products from Lilliput.</span>

<span>Very happy with this investment. Love having both SDI and HDMI input/output. I DO very strongly wish they added audio INPUTS, and not just a headphone out. But I understand this wasn’t made to be an external recorder. But it would be cool to see clever engineering so that an audio input feed could be fed back to the camera somehow.<br/><br/>But if you’re just looking for a large and actual 4K monitor that is great for referencing and pulling accurate focus, this is it.</span>

<span>It's surprisingly lightweight and gives a very nice image, but I find 2 problems with it. The monitor cuts off the upper 3% of a camera's feed - which means it's not accurately rendering what's being recorded - and it lacks a zoom function which would would be very helpful in checking focus.</span>

<span>I have discovered that not all monitors are able to display the signal coming out of my video cameras. Specifically I have a Canon C300 mkii, URSA Mini Pro 4.6k G2 and Sony FS7 Mkii. I bought this monitor and got instant gratification. With an SDI and 4 HDMI inputs, along with the ability to quadview other cameras on HDMI this is a game changer tool. I use a adapter for the battery that hooks to the DTAP on my camera so cabling is secure. High recommend this.</span>

<span>I've had this monitor for almost 2 months now. It replaced a 27" flat screen which (I didn't realize until I made the change) was washing out the colors. It's important for you to know that for this review. After all, you jump from a 1997 car to a 2022 car, you're obviously going to be amazed, right?<br/><br/>My old computer died and I had to build a new computer. I figured while I was about it, I should get a sexy new monitor with it. One of my friends was going on, and on, and on, and onnnnnnn about how he was going to get a curved monitor, which I hadn't even heard about before. Well, new computer, worth searching 'curved monitor', and here I am.<br/><br/>I have a Radeon RX 6600 XT GPU. Don't scoff, I know it's not cutting or bleeding edge. I build my computers for affordability, and upgradeability. That USD $900 GPU card you're trying to hijack Amazon drivers for today will be dirt cheap relatively soon.<br/><br/>That said, almost everything I've put this monitor through has been amazing:<br/><br/>Colors: Again, the old monitor was apparently washed out, but seriously vibrant colors, black is suuuuuuuper black.<br/><br/>Resolution: Hit or miss. Sometimes content I'm streaming has black bars to the left and right. Sometimes I can't go full screen because it just zooms in on whatever portion of the screen it feels like. Maybe it's the graphics card, I don't know. However, every video game I've played has been truly full screen so far. Civ 6, Killing Floor, World of Tanks, Fallout 4. Though I don't use this for work, the monitor has worked amazingly for Word and Excel.<br/><br/>Sturdiness: This monitor is sitting on my desktop. Once, I bumped heavily into the desk and freaked out that the monitor would tumble off the back of it (no wall behind the desk). It didn't. The base is a sturdy metal, but it's a ring. I don't know if it would make a difference if it were solid, I think it would make a difference if that ring/ base went further behind the monitor than it does, but I don't detract a star for my clumsiness. I will instead find some way of securing the front of that ring to my desk, preferably without having to screw into the desk surface, but that option is not ruled out.<br/><br/>Price: I remember paying this much for my first, I think it was 20", flat screen. Not only am I happy about the price, I'm starting to give serious consideration to getting a second one of these monitors (and possibly having to secure them using screws, ugh).<br/><br/>Overall: Zero regrets. Perhaps I don't have the refined eyes of the many nay-sayers in these reviews. But it's amazing for gaming, it's excellent for streaming, and there are no issues with Word or Excel. Everything I need, in a very reasonably priced package!</span>

<span>Monitor is great, works perfectly fine. I like the colors. Watching video is not comfortable on this monitor because most streaming websites do not have high resolution. So your videos would be 1920 x 1080 resolution and black lines on the side. Most games can be set to 2560 x1080 so you are good on that. I’m happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>Next time I would appreciate if the product was put in a box or something. I live in an apartment and it was left at my door like this all day. Not completely sure if this is a problem for the seller or the post office but someone could’ve seen this and stolen it. Regarding the actual product I’m Overall satisfied with its performance. Perfect for doing office work and light gaming. Playing Apex Legends on it with no problems</span>

<span>The picture on this monitor is great but I wish the speakers were a bit louder. It just gets on my nerves since I watch a lot of You Tube and some videos are just too low to hear clearly with this monitor. I use a browser volume amplifier and that helps but I really need to get a set of speakers.</span>

<span>This monitor for the price can not be beat for every day use. The colors once put in gaming mode look great. As well in 75hertz the monitor is smooth. You can still notice a big difference between this and say a 165 hertz monitor. But If you are using this for just browsing the web or watching videos it is great. I have two of them!</span>

<span>It absolutely gets the job done and I'm happy with it so far for the past few months.<br/><br/>Nothing too special, just a monitor really. The speakers are located on the back, and it does kind of make headphones or alternative sound options necessary. That's why I'm giving it the 4 stars.</span>
