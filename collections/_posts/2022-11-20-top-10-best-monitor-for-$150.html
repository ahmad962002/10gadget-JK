<span>The monitor is great no doubt, although if you just bought a pc and need a monitor to start off with this is great. Some things I dislike about it though were the speakers aren’t the best but they do the job for example I can watch movies and YouTube on it no problem but if you want to listen to music somewhat loud with bass the monitor just won’t keep up with that. No hate though everything else like the quality I was really impressed with. The led’s are nice as well.</span>

<span>Been using it for a few days now. No dead pixels, brilliant color. Gaming is actually a night and day difference and I couldn't go back to my 75Hz monitor that is now sitting to the side for other things as it's way too noted in the difference. Watched a few movies on it, played a few games (Insurgency: Sandstorm, Warzone, RDR2) and I am very, VERY, pleased.<br/><br/>The Amazon Deal came on today and I believe the 27" version is only $15 more than what I paid, but I've owned 34" monitors before and this is exactly what I need right now for where I'm at.<br/><br/>Oh, and the 165Hz, right out of the box with supplied DP cord and I haven't needed to turn on the AMD Freesync option as I'm running a 1070 Ti SC card anyway, but I can assure you, this is FAST and no blurry movement or need for V-Sync at all.<br/><br/>Fingers crossed that this thing is a 3-5 year keeper!<br/><br/>Update - September 7th, 2022 = All I can say is, I went back and forth on wanting to buy this and put it off for a full month. I wish I hadn't waited. Gaming is AMAZING... all else (watching movies, surfing the net, etc.) just as awesome. DP wire that was supplied works perfect and this never had a problem losing sync @ 165Hz. No tears in gaming, settings at full screen and not having to enable vsync has been spectacular.<br/><br/>HIGHLY recommend this monitor!!!<br/><br/>PS - No dead pixels, YAY!!!</span>

<span>I bought this monitor strictly for gaming. The picture and the high refresh rates are great but occasionally the screen will flicker. It's very annoying. The only real fix is to do a memory recall and sometimes that will need done a couple times. This monitor is definitely not worth a 1000.00 bucks.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Update since release. I honestly think it lacks a lot of things, menu option is basic and frankly a bit frustrating to navigate. I was in a rush to get one before it became impossible to get or scalpers got everything. To be specific I liked having the refresh rate number on the corner of monitor which this doesn’t. Also the menu for gaming is so limited and very complicated……..Worked perfectly for the ps5. Unfortunately it only has 1 Hdmi 2.1 port. If you decide to connect via hdmi 2.0 port with a fire stick or Roku highly recommend using a a high speed hdmi as normal<br/>Ones won’t pick up Video only sound. Surprisingly monitor speakers are pretty good.</span>

<span>Loved the colors on this monitor. Very high range compared to my last HP Omen monitor. The contrast on this monitor is fantastic, but the brightness sort of bottlenecks that and it doesn't get as bright as you might want for the "best" colors.<br/>Still would very recommend this monitor in the 4k high refresh rate area.</span>

<span>Colors are amazing, HDR is barely noticeable, resolution is what I expected for 4k, controls are decent, customization is decent-ish (can't set RBG to one solid color)... The worst is black text on a light background. There really bad artifacting, like a red and blue border around the letters. It's reduced with HDR enabled but this should never happen, period. Pretty pissed I didn't get the return process going before it was too late. Looks great with anything that doesn't involve white.</span>

<span>I love the screen, it has great resolution. I wanted another curved msi screen to go with my other one, but I wanted it to be smaller for videos and stuff while im on games. Its awesome, but the only problem with this was the back has on 2 screws which are lateral from each other. I kind of made another hole on the back of my monitor mount and it seem to do the job pretty well, other than that it is great.</span>

<span>I am very pleased with this curved monitor. My monitor is paired with a Radeon RX 6600 gpu. Yes,  I'm obsessed with Stitch. the first image is my desktop background and the second is the movie. The 1ms refresh rate is great for gaming, and I have not seen any lag or tearing . AMD freesync is a nice feature as the system know the capabilities of the monitor without anything other than plugging it in to the graphics card. Overall happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>setup was easy.  the mount seems a little flimsy but once they are placed they shouldn't be bumped.  first curved monitor and after a few minutes i could feel the strain on my eyes.  I was told smaller curved monitors are known for this so i returned these for a set 3" bigger.  much better.<br/><br/>I think the monitors are great, but would recommend at least 27" if you get eye strain.  would have no problem buying MSI in a larger size.</span>

The base to the monitor is kind of wobbly so keep that in mind but as long as you're not slamming on your desk consistently you should be okay.

<span>I've only had the monitor for a day but I'm happy with the purchase. I initially tried to cancel the order but the seller had already shipped. I figured I would give it a try and send it back if it wasn't up to spec. I'm coming from a 12 year old Samsung T260HD monitor that is 25.5 inches, 1920x1200 @60hz. This was top of the line at the time and paid $329 while this was one was only $109. The old monitor had screen tearing in games (no g-sync or freesync) and FPS play wasn't ideal, especially in COD Warzone. If you've never played on a higher refresh rate monitor before, it makes a difference. I tried overclocking the monitor to 85hz and then 80hz but neither took so I tried out the rated spec of 75hz with freesync and let me say.. I could notice the difference right away and even picked up my first Warzone Solo victory. Aiming was much more smooth and I could keep my reticle glued on other players. If you're using this for light gaming and you're coming from a 60hz panel, you'll be pleasantly surprised. This appears to be a TN panel because the viewing angles are poor. They're completely fine when viewed straight ahead - since this is being used as a computer monitor, it's not a problem for me but buyer beware. No dead pixels or edge bleeding to speak of. Blacks aren't super dark but decent and the factory setting was ok as far as brightness and contrast was concerned. I configured to my liking and I'm satisfied. The stand is wobbly as others have stated and I didn't even bother with speakers, nor should you. I'm not expecting this thing to last but I'm hoping to get 2-3 years out of it. I was looking to get a higher refresh rate monitor (144-165hz) but after doing research, you can't take advantage of the higher refresh rate unless your frames per second average is just as high (144+fps). With a Ryzen 5 2600 and an aging Rx 570, I'm getting an average of 75fps in COD Warzone with the settings at high. In this case, the monitor is a perfect pairing for the 75hz refresh rate.<br/><br/>In order to take advantage of the higher refresh rate you will need to open up your AMD or Nvidia software and create a profile that is set @75hz. Once this is created, go into display settings on your computer -&gt; advanced settings -&gt; monitor and then select the new 75hz profile from the drop down. Last, you will need to enable freesync from the monitor control panel (it's in the menu options) and then enable it in the AMD software (not sure about Nvidia). If you're lucky, you may be able to overclock the monitor to a higher refresh rate. Just create a profile for 80 or 85hz, select it in display settings and see if it takes. If it doesn't, the monitor will revert back to the previous refresh rate in 10 seconds. From what I've read, this doesn't harm your monitor and it depends on the manufacturer as to how far you can overclock it. Don't expect much from this panel, however. All-in-all, it's an upgrade for me in just about every way. Some people say a 27" screen at 1080p for gaming isn't ideal. I beg to differ. The pixel density isn't superb by any means but I didn't notice any difference from a slightly smaller screen (25.5 vs 27) and less pixels (old monitor was 1920x1200). If I had to choose, I'd take the extra real-estate over pixel density which I think only amounts to 6ppi. There's pixel density calculators out there if you're curious. If you can afford it and your GPU/CPU can achieve 100+fps, I would go with a higher refresh rate monitor. For lower end specs, general use or a second monitor and for the low price, I don't see why not.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>After finally purchasing a couple MiniPC's for both business and personal use, and using an old LCD 21" Wide Screen Monitor I had, I was finding that I must be spoiled by my 4K TV because the picture on that monitor which I thought was wonderful, just seemed so dull and it did not support 4K which I have come to love to watch 4K videos etc.<br/><br/>I wasn't really sure what monitor to get, but I wanted something much larger, supported 4K, and that was at a very reasonable price. I did a lot of searching Amazon's product lists for monitors, and I came across this monitor, and I noticed that it was a curved screen. While I have never owned a curved screen anything, I had seen them at the local electronics store and was darn impressed. So I was very curious about this monitor because it had all the specs I was looking for, at least 27", Wide Screen, Support for 4K, Native Resolution of 1920 x 1080, LED, and had a curved screen. When I also noticed that it was a Samsung, I was pretty excited to learn more because I have always had very good luck with Samsung products and in fact, I have only had one Samsung product ever fail, and that was a mobile phone that should have stopped working years ago with what It went through.<br/><br/>Not knowing much about monitors these days, I started reading the reviews that were written on this monitor and I asked the community a couple questions. The answers I got back to my questions sealed the deal for me. Everyone who responded had nothing but great things to say about this monitor and provided me in info I needed. So I decided to go for it.<br/><br/>When it got here, unfortunately the first one had a broken screen. It appeared that it was packaged that way since the packaging was factory sealed but the packing was broken on the inside. Needless to say I returned it but Amazon really stepped up to the plate and sent me a replacement next day, so I was only delayed by 1 day getting to use it. Because the first monitor came with a broken screen, I am going to assume that the screen may be a bit on the frgile side as my old monitor has been dropped, and the LCD screen never had any issues, I don't know jf the screens on LED monitors are more easily broken, or If this was something that someone really dropped hard before packaging, for this reason I gave the durability 4 stars)<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze! Just had to put 1 screw to put the base stand together, and that was it. The stand is about the only thing I really don't like because the base that sits on the desk is an upside down chevron shape, which sticks out in front of the monitor a few inches. This makes putting it on a small desk where your keyboard would be in front of it a bit of a pain because the keyboard has to be pulled closer to me and just gets in the way to me. I managed to get around that by putting the monitor up on a little shelf I made out of a box and an old Laptop lap desk that I had. It perfectly raises the monitor by about 4-5 inches, and let's me push the keyboard further back to where I now have more room on my desk.  (Images added to show the base and how I worked around the chevron styled base to give me more room).<br/><br/>The monitor has one HDMI port and one Display Port. Now I am not familiar with the Display Port, but all my devices are HDMI, so plugging in a PC is simple. In fact, I have 3 MiniPC's that I need to connect to this monitor so I bought a 5 port HDMI switch. This allows me to easily switch between each MiniPC with just a click of a button.<br/><br/>The picture on this monitor is absolutely phenomenal!  Once I plugged in the HDMI plug, turned on the monitor, it automatically scanned for the signal which it found right away and WOW! What a gorgeous picture. The colors are very bright and vibrant. The dynamics between the Black and White colors are stunning and the color definition is very vivid. For never using a curved screen before on a computer monitor, I am very impressed. It almost immerses you in to the picture and almost gives it a extra dimensional view, almost 3D in nature... The thing I worried most about with a curved screen was is there going to be any distortion with a curved screen and I am happy to say. "Absolutely Not!". The images looks perfectly flat, but because of the curve, it pulls the outer edges our of your peripheral vision and closer to your focused view when looking straight forward.<br/><br/>Learning how to use the toggle button on the back for adjusting the settings van take a bit of getting used to, however, at this point, I haven't really needed to use any of the options other then Sleep and Shut Down as the defaults seem to be perfect for my setup.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this monitor does not have built in speakers however, if you have speakers connected to you computer or use a set of Bluetooth Speakers you will be just fine.<br/><br/>Overall my impression of this monitor is fantastic! The picture quality is stunning, and the size with the curves screen is awesome. I would recommend this monitor to anyone who wants an excellent monitor for home or office at a more then reasonable price. While I have not used the monitor for gaming, I have used a monitor that has the same 4ms refresh rate and that has the same native resolution  of1920 x 1080 and that monitor is over 10 years old and still holds up today, so I can only imagine that this monitor would be perfectly fine for today's games.  I am definitely glad that I went ahead and purchased this monitor, and should I need to replace the monitor that I amusing as  a secondary monitor, I will likely purchase another one of this model!  Again, Highly recommended and over all this monitor gets a full 5 Stars from me! ~</span>

<span>Does anyone remember walking around at grandma's house and there were NO little lights on? Nothing beeped, squeaked, or pulsated?

I rely on amazon reviews to make high quality, informed decisions. I had a super SCEPTRE at work, like $400-600. I bought this one after a lot of research and need a curved screen for programming.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought one of these C24 monitors back in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic for my home office setup.  I had an old desktop with dual monitors that I was using for personal use, so I didn't want to plug up my laptop to those as I needed a different setup to achieve a mental separation from work and play.<br/><br/>The 2020 version of this monitor is a bit different than the 2022 version, now that I have them both mounted side by side.  The most noticeable difference is the bezel, which is thicker on the new screen, though better.  Reason being on the 2020, the bezel stops way short, almost a CM short, of the actual display range.  It's just black screen.  The thin bezel, which a good idea, literally did nothing for the experience due to this dead zone between the viewable display and the bezel.  I measured and the 2022's bezel covers this zone.  That gives it a bit more strength, but not as good of a feel.  It also gets around a bit of the false advertising of a edgeless display.  While the 2020 was pretty edgeless, the display just didn't get all the way to the edge of the screen.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use these for gaming.  If you're a real PC gamer, get a 1ms, 144hz display.  That's far better than these, which on their best day in ideal conditions get 4-10ms and 75hz.  They say they are great for gaming because of course they do, it's for marketing.  But just save up and buy a $300-400 display that is designed to enhance your game play.  Running Age of Empires, sure, this monitor is fine.  Running Apex, CoD, or anything like that would just have tearing and clipping.  Those types of games really need faster refresh rates.<br/><br/>Speakers are straight up garbage...I'd rather they just stop putting speakers in monitors and just give us more edgelessness or invest that in a better power supply or something.  I couldn't care less about monitor speakers when Logi sells speakers that are far better for less than $30.<br/><br/>Another major difference was the addition of a second HDMI port.  The 2020 only has 1, where the 2022 has 2.  I'm not going to be using it, but it's definitely a feature some need when using multiple devices on a single monitor (in lieu of a KVM or something).<br/><br/>The 2020 also had a solid metal stand and mount, versus the 2022 which came with a black plastic stand and mount.  I mounted both to a VESA arm mount, so it's moot for me, but there is most definitely a visual difference as the metal one was silver and stronger.  Probably a cost swap due to them adding another HDMI and making the whole deal cheaper since 2020, when I believed I paid around $125.<br/><br/>The power cable on these are not standard...which kind of makes me mad.  Most monitors have the 2 or 3 prong power cables (like on a TV), which is ideal due to the universal nature of it.  I've got those cables for days around here, and at varying lengths depending on my needs.  These come with a proprietary plug and 3ft cable.  That won't work for a lot of set ups (especially for gamers who might have multi-display setups or a standing desk with a limited plug length).  You could always find another one online somewhere that is the same port and wattage, but why not just use the standard, Sceptre?  You aren't Apple...<br/><br/>The curve of these monitors is a bit of a gimmick as well.  I've got a 34" ultrawide curved by Gigabyte and that thing is most definitely curved.  These are slightly curved, but not enough to really have the effect.<br/><br/>Regardless of any shortcomings, these are $100 monitors that work well and look good for office work.  Definitely recommend for WFH warriors or start ups, as they seem to take a bit of abuse (I've used the 2020 daily, moved it all around my office, and haven't cleaned it much).</span>

<span>Bought 2 to start building a new gaming setup. The screens came in and work really well. The only downside to my order was that one of them wasn't curved but I'm not bothered by it to much to make a huge fuss over it. In the future if I decide to expand to a 3rd monitor I can get another actually curved one and use this one for a completely different reason with no hassle.<br/><br/>Great quality, and easy to set up!</span>

<span>I needed a monitor for my old xbox 360 for when I want to have a nostalgia trip.  Works great with minimal input delay for the price as far as I can tell, decent colors, and a good picture.  It's not going to wow you or anything but it impressed me with what it offered at its price point. The curved monitor is actually something I'm starting to like so that's a plus.  Other than that it's a very basic no-frills good quality budget monitor.<br/>Overall if you don't plan on using it for anything other than console gaming above 60hz or just need a work monitor, this one would be perfect imo.</span>

PHILIPS 271E1S 27" FRAMELESS MONITOR (E-LINE) SIMPLY STUNNING The Philips E-line monitors feature stunning visuals and elegant design for a stylish enhancement to your workspace. The 271E1S is a 24-inch Full HD monitor with superb picture quality and designed with your well-being in mind. The panel is wrapped with narrow borders for a seamless appearance in a multi-monitor setup. Experience crisp Full HD visuals and smooth action with AMD FreeSync technology. IPS TECHNOLOGY The Philips 271E1S utilizes IPS display technology, which gives you extra-wide viewing angles of 178/178 degrees, making it possible to view the display from almost any angle. Unlike standard TN panels, IPS displays give you remarkably sharp images with vivid colors, making it ideal for not only photos, movies, and web browsing, but also for professional applications, which demand color accuracy and consistent brightness at all times. SMART CONTRAST SmartContrast is a Philips technology that analyzes the contents you are displaying, automatically adjusting colors and controlling backlight intensity to dynamically enhance contrast for the best digital images and videos or when playing games where dark hues are displayed. When Economy mode is selected, contrast is adjusted and backlighting fine-tuned for just-right display of everyday office applications and lower power consumption. SMARTIMAGE GAME MODE The new Philips gaming display has quick access OSD fine-tuned for gamers, offering you multiple options. "FPS" mode (First person shooting) improves dark themes in games, allowing you to see hidden objects in dark areas. "Racing" mode adapts display with the fastest response time, high color, along with image adjustments. "RTS" mode (Real-time strategy) has a special SmartFrame mode which enables highlighting of a specific area and allows for size and image adjustments. Gamer 1 and Gamer 2 enable you to save personal customized settings based on different games, ensuring best performance. LOWBLUE MODE Studies have shown that not only ultra-violet rays can cause eye damage, but also short-wavelength blue light rays from LED displays can cause eye damage and affect vision over time. Developed for users’ well-being, Philips LowBlue Mode setting uses smart software technology to reduce harmful shortwave blue light. FLICKER-FREE TECHNOLOGY Due to the way brightness is controlled on LED-backlit screens, some users experience flicker on their screen, which causes eye fatigue. Philips Flicker-Free Technology applies a new solution to regulate brightness and reduce flicker for more comfortable viewing. AMD FREESYNC TECHNOLOGY Gaming shouldn't be a choice between choppy gameplay or broken frames. With the new Philips monitor, it doesn't have to be. Get fluid, artifact-free performance at any framerate with AMD FreeSync Technology. Smooth, quick refreshes and ultra-fast response times.

<span>I just received the monitor this afternoon.  It is exactly as advertised.  Attaching the stand takes mere seconds.  Tilting the screen is easy enough and stays where you place it.  It is true 4K as I tested it with my LG 4K/Blu-Ray player.  The basic buttons are at the bottom right of the bezel.<br/><br/>The speakers won't give you tons of "umph," but I knew that going in.  Connecting computer speakers is certainly the way to go here.  The colors and sharpness are fine.  For my basic purposes, this monitor is perfect.

<span>I bought three for a triple monitor setup and really like these monitors. They are bright and seem to have very good color. Big upgrade from what I was using though, so I don't know how they would be for hard core gamers, etc. Easy to put together and I love the height adjustability. I'm not a fan of the settings buttons being on the back--very hard to reach when you have monitors next to each other. I also wish it had a DVI/ VGA port just in case I needed backwards compatibility to old systems. The only other problem is they take a long time to resume from standby/low power/whatever mode, which is annoying when your computer use varies all through the day and every time you resume, you have to wait an extra few seconds. Also, there is still a stupid Windows 10 bug that over displayport in multimonitor, windows move to the non-displayport monitor everytime the system resumes. But this is not Philips fault. I also contacted their customer support about a question I had, and they did respond-eventually. Not fast, but satisfactory. Overall, glad to have these, especially at the sale price I got them at.</span>

<span>I’ve read others reviews before posting mine, I bought two of them replacing some old 1080p gaming monitors from Acer. Just in time for the Next Gen consoles. First thing I tested before I even put these on my desk was dead pixels. Went to a website to see solid colors I was inches away from the screen I didn’t notice any dead or stuck pixels at all on neither one which is great because I would have made Amazon replace them. Yeah they’re 5ms, but if you’re like me you’re a great player in any video game regardless of all that response time mumbo jumbo, a 1ms monitor will not make you good if you’re not good to begin with. The colors are fantastic, I’m using them both calibrated with Nvidias control panel and using them with 10 bpc opposed to 8 bpc like they were stock. Colors really pop and bleed to you. As for the monitors themselves I’m using the regular color setting. I tired every color setting that comes preconfigured FPS &amp; the 2 gaming settings look awful and oversharpenned, guess they made them like that for those blind people who shoot at the walls in FPS. Everything is extremely detailed &amp; fine. I even tried it on my PS4 Pro, even though PS4 pro doesn’t really natively support any games in 4K it does a checkerboard antialiasing which is super noticeable with this monitor and it does make a difference. Can’t wait to see how PS5 is going to look natively running 4K on these. Yeah the panels are only 60 hz so for all you sweaty try hards who think it’s a killer feature not for me, I’ve owned Asus ROG 144hz monitors everything just moves smoother and it feels faster at times. If you want this effect just drink a bunch of coffee and you’ll feel the same way lol. Another thing I didn’t like much was how reflective the screens are, I’m not talking about you can see yourself like a mirror no, I’m talking about light wise. If there’s a light on or a TV behind you, you can definitely see some glare you can notice it a bit in the 2nd picture. My phone had trouble capturing the monitor screens properly because of the glare. As for light bleed yeah there’s some (there always is on IPS monitors) and at $240 &amp; 4K you have no word to complain. Before these I bought the BenQ 4K EL28 1ms which are more expensive because of the sweaty 1ms marketing, colors were so awful. I just hate TN Panels yuck, if you’re so focused on response times &amp; bland colors keep your nasty TN panels. VA &amp; IPS are the way to go for an all round happy experience. Owned them for about a month, as far as I can tell I don’t think I’ll have issues for a while. All these negative reviews yeah you have to understand products are always a hit or miss for everyone. Some are not gonna be perfect at the assembly line some might have dead pixels or those pixel lines because the panel was damaged in transit or not properly installed. Don’t let these negative reviews draw you away from these monitors. You can always return them with Amazon’s policy if you don’t like them. But for $240 are you kidding me? They’re a steal. Yeah they don’t have HDR, but HDR on monitors are a joke. Let’s be realistic. If you wanted some real beautiful HDR you’d invest your money in a new LG or Samsung OLED/QLED tv which will set you back a grand or so. For gaming &amp; media consumption these are fantastic. Sorry the review was so long but it just annoys me how every monitor on amazon has the same negative reviews “dead pixels/pixel lines” it happens to every brand. You’d have to be extremely ignorant to think it only happens to one brand. Replace it or return it problem solved. Your bad experience doesn’t justify the 90% of the people who actually enjoy it.</span>
