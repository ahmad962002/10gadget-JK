<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>You are gamers like me. You are going to use it in full 4k and expect 144fps like me. Your only option is DisplayPort and that will not work... OBVIOUSLY.<br/><br/>First, UPDATE THE FIRMWARE. It's ages old and has a ton of problems.<br/>Second, CONNECT THE USB. It's used for some driver control or something. Even thou it's supposed to be only a passthrough. The armory crate use it and it help with the problems.<br/>Third, LEARN NEW CURSE WORDS. Yes, no way around it.<br/><br/>The big problem: Displayport HPD .<br/>What? It's a bug/feature that detects when the cable is connected and turns off your monitor. As if you didn't just connect it yourself and expect the thing to show an image. NOOOO it will just go to sleep.<br/>There is no solution and ASUS will not move a finger for it.<br/><br/>Expect to waste around 5 minutes every time you start your rig. The PC will not detect a monitor, so you manually turn the monitor on, then the PC is already not sending signal so you manually enable it, but the monitor is already asleep because of HPD and everything all over again. Until you get lucky and PC and monitor agree to work together and let you play.<br/><br/>What could asus do? disable HPD !!! or give it longer detection period, like, more than the 1 frikin' second that it has now.<br/>( Note, some genius is selling a hardware emulator that keeps the HPD alive and fixes the universe... it costs more than the monitor... )</span>

<span>I love this monitor and the ASUS TUF products. First off, I have a ASUS TUF 3080 Ti. I was having several petty problems with this monitor and couldn’t figure out why. The display would have trouble coming on after wake, power on, and any time the display would come on. It was even worse with multiple displays. G-Sync and the ability to Overclock stopped working after a couple of weeks. It was as if the HDMI 2.1 port stopped recognizing the HDMI 2.1 cable. I tried both HDMI 2.1 ports and multiple 2.1 cables and nothing changed. My other monitors worked fine with G-Sync, they used DisplayPort. I even tried my PS5 which uses HDMI 2.1 and the monitor still wouldn’t Overclock anymore. I assume the HDMI 2.1 ports malfunctioned some how. I used the DisplayPort 1.4 and because of the DSC, I could go back to using 10-bit, G-Sync, and 144hz again. It was also immediately flawless compared to the HDMI 2.1. I had bought this monitor a second time and the problems are consistent. I just can’t recommend HDMI 2.1. The DSC give you better results. Before I built a PC, I had no problems gaming on PS5 with it which again, used HDMI 2.1. I’m assuming using multiple displays is what shortens the life span of HDMI 2.1.</span>

<span>My first 4k monitor, the picture quality and framerate are both incredible and perfect for the price and once the system has properly booted it is an incredible monitor.  That being said, my rating stays low until ASUS can provide an update to solve the bootup issue. Just wiggling my mouse to wake my PC can take a whole minute of the monitor attempting to connect correctly, over time I have found this more and more frustrating. Please update! I know you can do it ASUS, maybe a setting to disable the auto source finding process of this monitor because I believe that has to do with the issue.</span>

<span>I'll keep it simple: I now know what PS5 games are supposed to look like.<br/><br/>I am happy to say this is one of the few outrageously expensive items that I am satisfied "the price was worth it". I am fortunate though to have a gaming budget and can save for these kinds of things. I game to offset the stress from my work. And if I am taking the time to game, I want it to be the best experience possible. For the crazy people out there who just want the best monitor (or TV &lt; 32") for whatever the cost, I think this is it for the PS5.<br/><br/>Pros: IMHO, Best monitor (or TV for that matter) for the PS5 at 28". My career is focused on cyber/technology type stuff, and I have plenty of references to have tried prior to ordering this. I put in a lot of research, and this monitor exceeds my expectations.<br/><br/>Cons: Expensive - I decided to get the warranty; I pretty much never do that since tech changes so fast. There will probably be more cons in the future, but ASUS has been good to me. If I'm using this in 5 years as a desktop monitor for work, then it was worth it for me.<br/><br/>NOTE: This review is specifically for the PS5 and does not include Xbox/PC gaming testing. For someone reading this review and wondering about how it looks for anything else, I suspect it will look great.</span>

<span>Update 2: Moving this update to the top, because Gigabyte actually came through. Gigabyte finally sent me a remote for this monitor, it should never have taken as long as it did to get it, but they came through and that deserves some credit.<br/><br/>Now here is my review for this monitor… hot damn this thing is amazing!! I did my research before buying and have made small changes to how I use it to minimize any burn in, and I have had no issues. I have played 7 hour sessions of elite dangerous, no burn in…. All day family Minecraft sessions, no burn in… All day 2K grinds, no burn in. I game for long hours. BUT!!! I never use this as a monitor to surf the web or do normal PC stuff, I use other monitors for that. I also turn it off if I’m not gaming on it, it’s a simple and effect way to minimize burn in. I have also changed the desktop back ground to friendly OLED images and cycle the background every minute to prevent burn in, and I hide the task bar. Small simple changes in behavior and they probably aren’t even needed, I’m just being cautious. This monitor has been a home run people, but it’s all in how you use it. The tech, the quality (minus amazons or gigabytes packaging), and the performance are just amazing. I’d buy it again.<br/><br/>I’m only giving 4 stars though because of the crap-tastic 30 days it took to get a remote and I had to buy my own cords, it’s not a reflection on the monitor.<br/><br/>Last thought, pretty sure some Amazon warehouse borrowed from Paul to pay Peter because either someone else’s package was shorted or the remote wasn’t working. I paid the price for someone else’s laziness, and then was treated like I was trying to scam Gigabyte for free stuff. Just the worst customer experience overall… And for the record, you can’t buy the remote separately on gigabytes website and Walmart was the only place that did sell it and it was out of stock and had been for about a year from what I could tell.<br/><br/>I still give the whole experience 1 star, but the monitor is solid.<br/><br/>First post: Haven’t even turned it on yet and I’m not happy, no remote… no display cable or hdmi cables… and the box is pretty beat up. I feel like I just got someone’s return. Kind of livid right now. Not sure if this is a seller issue or Gigabytes, but my whole experience is tainted now.<br/><br/>Update 1: Two weeks dealing with Gigabyte support and it’s just horrible, you can’t even register the monitor because it asks for a “check” number on the serial plate that doesn’t even exist. Still no remote, that is all I’m asking for, and I can’t even get them to respond to me. Worst customer support ever.</span>

<span>I have not tried any other monitors before ( i had an asus 24 inch 144 hz 1ms) and  I went I purchased this one in particular reading a lot of reviews and practically all of them concluded the same, the value and performance that you get with this curve monitor is superb for the price it is a affordable way to try a ultra wide screen, and regarding my experience i have no complains about the monitor, looks good on your desk and and the construction is really sturdy and minimalistic. Maybe the only downside is that you cannot rotate the screen but anyways the best position is to be right there in the middle for a more pleasing experience on a curve monitor. I would definitely buy this monitor again. It doesn't have any RGB for the ones interested in that, but in reality at the end you can purchase your own or set it up with custom lighting if that is really what you are looking for.<br/>AMD Freesync work perfectly (Gsync compatible).<br/>Color are great from start without any tweaking necessary for my taste in this instance.<br/>Although i set it up in Overdrive since started I have tried picture quality and Balance and all of them feel ok there's no complain in that matter.<br/>If you are interested in a triple monitor setup this would be the best price point to try first. with the price that currently has you can purchase 3 of this monitors for the price of one of the expensive and flashy ones.</span>

<span>I'm not going to go in-depth as there are already 'professional' reviews out there that one can go and read if they want full coverage. Some info:<br/><br/>Screen  / Display quality: It's great, I got no dead pixels as far as I can tell and the backlight bleed for me isn't bad at all. The picture quality for this price range is probably among the best if not the best out of the box. I don't think I've had to tweak any of the display settings other than brightness because of how good it looks as is. It's plenty bright to use on sunny days by the way, and this coming from a Californian.<br/><br/>Gaming: Of course it won't compete with good 200hz+ and 300+ hz monitors but it doesn't need to. For  being able to find this monitor as cheap as $130 when it goes on sale, it blows everything out of the water that it's supposed to compete with. Do not use Aim Stabilizer or Super Resolution and set OD to either Smart OD or Picture Quality for the best anti-ghosting, Balance will start to introduce notable ghosting but it's nothing terrible.<br/><br/>Features: I haven't used the OSD sidekick software because I figured out which settings I wanted to use early on and the hardware controller was more than good enough to use for that. It has everything you *need* in a gaming monitor (and more than most in this price range too). All the ports are easily accessible and I didn't know this at first but the stand has an opening that is supposed to help with cable management.<br/><br/>Build Quality: I suppose this is more for the stand than the display but it's good. It doesn't wobble and doesn't feel particularly cheap. It's nice that it's height adjustable and it tilts, however it cannot be used vertically for anyone that wants it setup that way.<br/><br/>So yeah, an unbeatable monitor for $130 and still a great deal for $160.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for $600, $200 cheaper than msrp and at least $200 below the competition for 4k 144hz monitors.  If you see it at this price, and are in the market for a 32 inch monitor for gaming, buy it immediately before stock runs out.  I didn't want to spend this much, but it's worth every penny.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- 4k at 32 inches is just perfect (see review below for details)<br/>- 144hz is excellent for gaming (although 4k requires a good computer or next gen console to drive)<br/>- Bright IPS panel looks stunning (I can't speak for color accuracy, but it looks fantastic to my eyes)<br/>- Hdmi 2.1 for next gen consoles (I use with a series x, it is amazing)<br/>- Good stand (It's plastic, but it has good adjustment and is very understated for a gaming monitor)<br/>- Usb hub (I thought I wouldn't care about this, but it is actually immensely useful)<br/>- Usb c input (Haven't tested this yet, but I plan to soon once I get the right cable)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Some backlight bleed (Not really noticeable unless HDR is on though, and most will not use HDR anyway)<br/><br/>Neither:<br/>- HDR - it exists, but with like 12 dimming zones, it's really a personal preference whether or not to use it.  I enjoy it with bright games as it makes the colors pop a bit more, but I don't think I'll use it for dark games or movies.  It's better than I expected, so it's not quite a con, but don't but this monitor for HDR.<br/><br/>I was in the market for a 32 inch monitor.  Having used different monitor sizes, I've found 32 inches to be the sweet spot for me in terms of screen real estate for desktop usage.  At the same time, it is also fantastic for more casual gaming.  If you are competitive, go 27 inches and 240 hz, but for the casual gamer 32 inches is much more immersive.  I was all set to purchase the Gigabyte M32Q, which is essentially the exact same monitor as this but with a 1440p resolution instead of 4k.  It retails for around $400 on sale, so about half the price of this M32U without a sale.  I was actually using a placeholder budget 1440p 32 inch office monitor with a VA panel before I purchased this.  So I experienced 1440p at 32 inches.  Then, I saw this monitor on sale for $600; it was such a good deal that I went for it.  I cannot go back.  4k looks so much better than 1440p at this screen size for desktop use it is hard to describe.  Text is so much sharper and the monitor is much more enjoyable to use.  Now, there is some backlight bleed, but this is unfortunately fairly typical for ips panels, and it is only obnoxious in HDR mode.  In all other circumstances, the monitor looks fantastic.  For gaming, it also looks insane, although it is extremely difficult to run games at 4k 144fps, so you will often have to rely on DLSS or running at non-native resolutions (that's what my series x usually does).  So in conclusion, if you want a 32 inch monitor for both productivity and gaming, get this.  Even at $700-$750, get it.  It is hard to describe how much better the pixel density is.  However, if you want a monitor exclusively for gaming, and you have anything less than a next gen console or rtx 3070, get the m32q.  But, for those who can afford it and utilize it properly, this monitor is amazing.</span>

<span>I know this monitor is only HDR400 without local dimming, but that should be an advantage because 8/16 zone dimming is terrible and you may not want that. The best option for HDR is OLED (if you do not care the OLED pixel burn-in) and I am waiting for microLED (I should say that is the future which has all advantage of OLED without burn-in issue), but I need a 4K monitor immediately so I choose this one.

<span>ill start with the many things this monitor nails:<br/>stunning color accuracy and HDR for gaming.  not the highest spec you usually see on creative panels, but still very sharp<br/>4k and high refresh under 1000!<br/>the monitor hood is far more useful than i thought.  cuts out glare and peripheral reflections<br/>speaking of glare, the IPS panel handles it very well, only really being bothered  mildly by direct and strong light<br/>the stand has all the swivel and tilt options you could want<br/>robust feature set<br/><br/>cons<br/>you have to choose ONE of the following three specs: 144hz with two DP cables (refresh rate is 120hz without this, which is fine for me), VRB low latency, or G Sync.  marketing lists them all but doesnt make it too clear you need to choose one.  i had a bit of a time tweaking settings around to get it right, but i ended up settling on g sync as i prioritize the smoothest and most consistent experience.  a competetive gamer may end up choosing the extra 24fps or reduced latency, but i mostly play RPG's.  overall, this isnt the hugest deal at this price point, but a little more clarity in the marketing would go a long way.  this is the main reason i had to take a star off an otherwise perfect monitor.  still extremely happy with my purchase, but misleading marketing, intentional or not, helps nobody.<br/>less of a con and more of a heads up, the panel had pretty atrocious IPS glow when i got it, with each corner really bleeding a lot of light when the screen was dark or black.  i decided not to return because of the hassle and hoped it would either adjust or become more tolerable.  i can say with certainty that after about 2 weeks that started fading and is now barely visible.  i think this has something to do with breaking in certain IPS panels.  so if you see this on your screen, take heart that it will most likely burn out pretty quickly<br/>last, i really like the functions of the stand, but the very long and angular metal arms are terror on desk space.  i far prefer that flat mount asus uses on many of their monitors, as it gets the same result for much less desk real estate.  the stand works very well and is stable as can be, so i cant get too upset about it, but its just another small detail that holds me back from saying this monitor is perfect.<br/><br/>overall, gripes considered, if you want high refresh 4k gaming with HDR and gsync OR low latency and want the best price for that, i absolutely recommend this monitory happily.  the issues i do have are more than balanced out and justified by the absurdly low (relative) cost of this monitor.  unless you have an extra 500 or more bucks in your pocket to get an even more premium one, this is your monitor</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I would like to mention that I have 34GP950G-B and a 32GP850-B that I use for a combination of gaming and work. I decided to pick this monitor up for the fact that it has HDMI 2.1 and I recently got a PS5. The 32GQ850-B.AUS was clearly designed around supporting gaming consoles as it shows most of the video features that current game consoles display on their video menus, for example, VRR setting. Of course, previous monitor versions with G-Sync are VRR capable it is just not shown on the display menu. I would say if I compare my last year 32GP850-B with the new 32GQ850-B the only differences I see are (not comprehensive):<br/><br/>1- Higher Refresh rate.<br/>2- More console centered Display menu showing the status of VRR. See attached pictures for detail.<br/>3- HDMI 2.1.<br/>4- DTS headphone Jack.<br/>5- Higher price.<br/>6- RGB-LED lighting at the back of the monitor.<br/><br/>That being said, in terms of day-by-day work and gaming I saw not much difference. During work the difference between 165Hz to 240Hz was not visible from my point of view. For PS5 gaming there is no difference due to the capabilities of the console itself. However, I must say that both of these monitors support 4K@60Hz on the PS5 which is quite awesome. I believe these monitors come with a 4k panel and limited by software to 2k resolution.<br/><br/>I used my 34GP950G-B to compare the RGB lighting with the 32GQ850-B and I have no say there is no comparison. The RGB on the new 32GQ850-B are quite lacking on features and flexibility, one main drawback is that you cannot really control the intensity of the light you can only turn them on or off. In addition, this can only be done thru the on-screen menu there is no hardware on the monitor do adjust the lights. The 34GP950G-B does have a dedicated dial to adjust the lights brightness. Do not get me wrong the lights looks amazing but could be quite bright if looking at them directly.<br/><br/>All of these 3 monitors suffer of the usual IPS issues, black not being pitch black and panel edge light bleeding. Of course, this will depend from panel to panel and I have been lucky enough not to have panels with light bleeding. To me these IPS issues are not a deal breaker and I enjoy all of these 3 monitors. HDR works great on all of them as long as you do not enable the response to the FASTEST this will cause a horrible halo effect when you scroll.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you own a 32GP850-B I do not see the need for an upgrade to the new 32GQ850-B. If you are in the market for an excellent overall monitor then the 32GQ850-B could be the one you are looking for as it checks all the boxes for gaming and work.  Now if you do not care about the extra 80Hz of refresh rate and VRR being displayed on the menu or HDMI 2.1 then you can save yourself tons of money if you go for the 32GP850-B. I would recommend the 32GQ850-B only if it is on sale otherwise, I would still pick 32GP850-B.</span>

<span> I am changing my 5 star review to 2 stars why? look at the new pictures I posted, ON PC when playing fullscreen mode it is stuck to 120 hz, While in borderless mode it is 240 hz, This monitor thinks I'm playing 4k 120 hz when this is clearly a 240 hz 1440p monitor. Apparently Fullscreen 240 hz works when having adaptive sync on extended. This should not happen on a very expensive monitor. Everything else is amazing on this monitor from colors to quality and VRR, but this tech flaw makes games play weird, In certain games lie Apex I'm getting double imaging, I thought I was getting 300 hz according to in game steam fps, but it was actually 120 hz. I will change my review once this has been fixed and acknowledged.<br/><br/>Again it is 240 hz on borderless mode, and 120 hz on fullscreen mode. This is not the LG32gq950-b it is the 850 version, so when switching to 4k it looks blurry. Why does it even have this option on PC in the nvidia control panel. This also messes with games scaling because it thinks I have a 4k monitor.</span>

<span>Works perfect with my pc and ps5. The ppi is 92 which looks just fine I promise if you’re reading this and worried about 1440p 32inch don’t be. It’s a beautiful monitor and the controls are great. In fullscreen modes in games it does set my screen to 4k but just switch the game to borderless and it fixes it. Long story short I was nervous but pulled the trigger while it was 599 and I couldn’t be happier.

<span> Best gaming monitor for gaming and low input lag.I have tried it on my ps5 and it’ does support 120hz on 4K and 1440p. However, for HDR gaming when it comes to dimming features it’s not that good if you are looking to play game with full hdr experience but if there no black screen won’t even notice that.</span>

In competitive gaming, every frame matters. Introducing Acer's XV282K gaming monitor - the UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution monitor that can keep up with your game play. Through AMD Radeon technology, the game’s frame rate is determined by your graphics card, not the fixed refresh rate of the monitor, giving you a serious competitive edge. Plus, users can enjoy comfortable viewing experience while gaming via flicker-less, low dimming and ComfyView display. The design saves space on your desk and lets you place multiple monitors side by side to build a seamless big-screen display. (UM.PX2AA.V01).

<span>No USB, but that's ok because this one has the latest firmware for brightness. I tried duplicating this monitor along with my 27gn750 and it won't go above 1080p which is  the 750's native resolution. You can extend the displays and get 1440p. I did get some crazy washout while trying to get it to duplicate. So basically you can't duplicate with a 1080p display unless you downgrade your resolution to match lowest monitor resolution...still looks awesome but I bought this for 1440p gaming so I'm running it solo. If you run it on hdr you can't adjust a lot of things, but you don't need to as it looks great! No regrets at all buying this. I don't play shooters. I play rpgs like witcher 3 and it made a huge difference with my 3080 ftw3.</span>

<span>Here's what you need to know:<br/>-HDR mode looks BEAUTIFUL. HDR is great for this monitor in fact. With HDR enabled, Dark Blacks, very opaque, accurate colors - most of all increased brightness and contrast, which is almost necessary with this monitor. The factory settings are a little bit dark for my tastes. Increasing brightness manually may also increase backlight bleed. Some reviewers say HDR doesn't make much difference, but it does. I bet some people do custom color adjustments, including increasing brightness, and in that case that would make HDR "LESS" noticeable, but that makes the blacks less dark. Both adjusting brightness/color settings or enabling HDR  are good options, if you don't want to mess with HDR, but I prefer the HDR as I think it gives the best overall picture on this and I don't have to mess with factory settings.<br/>-GSync Capable with 144Hz refresh rates. Some users say G-Sync and HDR don't work together on this monitor... but they do. I have HDR enabled with GSync and have my frame rate max capped to 120 FPS in Nvidia Control panel. I can see that I am getting 120 FPS in games and can FEEL the difference between when GSync is on or off, so I know it works with HDR, which I NEVER turn off on this.<br/>- Crisp pictures. You can SEE the difference between 1080p and 2K. Very obvious improvement, especially with gaming.<br/>- Great viewing angles, virtually zero washout effect when viewing even from extreme angles<br/>-Solid refresh rates, to the average person, you will perceive no visible ghosting or screen-tearing in games with lots of action even with HDR enabled (which lowers response times... I don't know how low the response times are but the advertised &lt;1ms does not apply to when any mode other that gaming/action mode are enabled.<br/><br/>BE AWARE: Windows10 has HDR as a built in feature and it is BUGGY as heck, especially paired with NVidia cards, apparently. What will happen is that you will see the monitor colors get "washed out" and blacks will get "grayish". It will look like a cheap TN panel. With only ONE of these monitors, I didn't have much issue, but having two of these 2K monitors hooked up to my RTX 3080 and suddenly I'd have a monitor suddenly change to "washed out" when starting certain games or apps.  IT IS NOT THE MONITOR if this happens to you. I believe some viewers complaining about picture quality caught the Windows HDR bug and didn't know about it or how to fix it.<br/>-Here's what I did to minimize it:<br/>1) Enable HDR in Windows, and on the monitor<br/>2) NVidia Control Panel &gt; Color options... choose the option for limited and go with YCBCR 4.2.2... This is because Windows supports the HDR10 standard and you can ONLY get 8-bit option unless you enable this and go to limited mode. You will notice a small change in colors when enabling this. Everything gets slightly brighter and less subtle.<br/><br/>In some games, you have to TURN OFF Windows HDR for it to work in the game (Red Dead Redemption 2) for example. If a monitor suddenly becomes washed out, while opening/closing apps you can toggle HDR on or off for that screen in display settings in Windows OR you can power the monitor on/off and it usually comes back to it's full HDR glory. AGAIN be aware it is NOT a monitor issue. HDR is still Buggy and half-baked in Windows and googling Windows10 HDR will give you TONS of input (some different than mine) on how to deal with this. My advice is<br/><br/>The cool thing about this monitor is that you have the empirically superior picture that ONLY and IPS panel can offer, and you can do it with features like 144Hz refresh rates and GSync enabled. To have the IPS panel benefits, you have to enable HDR. What is also cool is that if your graphics card can't push the frames high enough in competive shooters, so you are worried about ghosting in competitive shooters with fast action and abrupt screen movements, you can have TN-panel like performance with blazing fast response times, 144Hz freesync/GSync capable refresh rates, just by hitting a button to switch modes (Action mode) (disabling HDR). The result is that it loses some brightness and contrast. This is where a person would probably want to increase Contrast and brightness, and this would make your blacks become more dark gray... ie it will look like a budget gaming VA panel, or a TN panel with better color and viewing angles.<br/><br/>That is essentially what this monitor is: It is a very good blend of lots of well-executed compromises. It is a cheap IPS panel with great picture, but HDR is MANDATORY to get that perfect IPS experience. That is perfectly fine. It also has some moderate, usually not noticeable, backlight bleed. Again, it is a compromise in exchange for not paying $2K for this 2K IPS monitor with fast refresh rates, backlight bleed is ~50% more than a top-of-the line IPS panel.<br/>If you are a competitive gamer who just HAS to have 1ms response times and 144Hz GSync, then this monitor will do that too, but the compromise is that HDR has to be disabled (action-mode), but it will require giving up the IPS eye-candy while I play that game.<br/><br/>Personally I just accept that I mainly play Planet Coaster and RDR2 and I don't need to ever turn off HDR in those titles with my RTX 3080.<br/><br/>Cons (which are NOT really cons if you know about monitor tech)<br/>- SOME backlight bleed (ie when the monitor is on a black loading screen -you can see  where light bleeds through the bezel in a few spots, like someone has a flashlight behind your screen and some of that brightness actually bleeds through. Backlight bleed is basically a guarantee with EVERY IPS monitor ever made. The only question is HOW MUCH backlight bleed will you get. This model is middle of the road for backlight bleed, and I have 2 of these and both bleed a little differently. I would categorize backlight bleed as noticeable, but not noticeable when gaming unless you are gaming in a dark room, crawling through a dark dungeon.<br/><br/>- Refresh rates go UP with HDR enabled (even though you can still get 144Hz refresh rate and GSync at the same time as HDR, to get the &lt;1 ms response times you have to change to non-HDR modes, which is something I would NEVER want to do. For these users, who just want the fastest refresh rates while having deep blacks and bright whites, you want to purchase an at least equally, if not more expensive TN panel instead. HOWEVER, TN panels will GUARANTEE relatively washed out viewing angles, poor washed-out colors compared to IPS.<br/><br/>Here's the pros and cons of the different panel types:<br/><br/>IPS (this monitor)<br/>Great color accuracy and look. HDR. Black blacks, white whites. Good Refresh rates. PERFECT viewing angles.<br/>Con- backlight Bleed is noticeable in a dark room on a dark game.<br/><br/>VA Panel<br/>Can have decent color accuracy and "OK" refresh rates / response times.. Viewing angles are not great, but usually OK. Wash-out occurs when viewing from angles, but not nearly as bad as TN panels. Contrast ratios are usually between TN and IPS. Usually backlight bleed not a problem. This is the ultimate "master-of-none" panel and usually exist marketed as gaming panels at 1080p only. Nothing wrong with a VA panel if it is a good one.<br/><br/>TN Panel<br/>Best Contrast Ratios (Black Blacks, whitest Whites). NO noticeable backlight bleed. Tied with the latest IPS panel breakthroughs for having the fastest response times and highest refresh-rates for competive gaming. You basically can't beat a TN panel for having a combination of contrast ratios and refresh-rates/response-times<br/>The CONS however, are not insignificant. The best most expensive TN panels still suffer from poor viewing angles. If you are straight in front of it, the edges and your peripherals in the screen are subtly and more progressively "washed out". This is the reason that the ideal screen for pro-gaming is usually a 24-inch TN panel because keeping the screen small keeps all the screen action in front of them, and reduces the washout that happens as the edge of the screen gets further away. The color accuracy is considered "poor" and would never be used by creative professionals, and make terrible screens for viewing movies and Netflix and such, due to the lesser color/ picture quality.<br/>These are screens just for the most die-hard competitive gamer. It is a "tool" really.<br/><br/>This monitor looks (and acts) a lot like a TN panel (with better color/ viewing angles, worse contrast ratio) when in "action mode". The rest of the time you get all those benefits of the IPS panel listed above<br/><br/>So just a really cool monitor. A monitor is a very personal thing, so there is no right answer to user-preference, but I personally would NEVER do anything but IPS at this point now that they have overcome the refresh-rate limits of yesteryear. It is clearly the most advanced monitor tech out right now. This is a GREAT budget entry into the 144Hz 2K IPS world.</span>

<span>ASUS ROG Swift PG32UQR<br/><br/>If shopping for a new monitor, you might have noticed ASUS ROG Swift PG32UQ -- minus the 'R' of this revised model. This revised model has a better color gamut than the previous version.<br/><br/>Unboxing: monitor was a pleasure to unbox. It came with a strap to keep the styrofoam together. Included was a little box with manuals, warranty card, and a bunch of ROG stickers. I consider ROG to be a great brand, so the stickers will be placed on various items.<br/><br/>Calibration: The monitor comes with a slip inside a plastic ziplock bag showing factory calibration results. This is a nice touch and a measure of Asus's commitment to quality assurance. No stuck or broken pixels.<br/>On this note, you will have to fiddle with the monitor, adjust it, adjust setting through NVidia app, to get it to your liking. It could take a couple of hours, there are high performance techy terms to research. Try them all, turn them off and on. See what you like.<br/><br/>Performance: although this monitor is GSYNC capable, it is GSYNC compatible, meaning it does not have a GSYNC module built in. Therefore, if your frame rate drops too far below 48 fps, or if you are getting 28fps while the monitor is set for 120fps, the GSYNC compatible will not help you. You need a graphics card that is very powerful to do this monitor justice. I have a liquid-cooled 4090. I suggest a 3080 or above. Regarding colors and brightness, I have this monitor set to permanent HDR mode. Games, Visual Studio, doesn't matter. HDR. Looks great and is brighter than you will expect. Without HDR, the monitor is still VERY bright. Colors POP. You will see details in games that you've never seen before. Given these positives, contrast ratio is a little weak, but no stars deducted as it is an IPS monitor and that's the trade off.<br/><br/>Again, do not buy this monitor unless you have a very serious graphics card to support it. Why buy a Ferrari with a four cylinder engine? Same thing.<br/><br/>My primary computer's specs (I have four rigs and ten 4k monitors):<br/><br/>Corsair 1000D case with twenty Corsair QL led fans.<br/>EVGA 1600 watt platinum power supply.<br/>So much RGB, it looks like Star Wars or Tron.<br/>Two 480mm radiators.<br/>Liquid cooled I9 12900k with copper IHC and liquid metal. 5.2 ghz, never passes 75 celsius even under the most rigorous benchmark tests.<br/>4x2TB Samsung 980 pros (gen 4)<br/>128 gigabytes of 3600mhx DDR4 ram<br/>A special card to add tons of ultra fast USB ports, have about 14 usb ports in total<br/>MSI 4090 Suprim Liquid (got very very lucky, first day of release)</span>

<span>Wasn't able to connect with their cable neither with another screen cable, my setup is tricky with vertical watercooled GPU, then took a long new cable from the drawer I bought from amazon years ago and it worked right away at 144hz, just my 3080TI won't jump above 100 in AA titles so 144 or 155 at 4k achievable maybe is simple games but not Rockstar stuff or FS2020.<br/><br/>I was impressed with no dead dead pixel, very uniform gray, I couldn't see a backlight.<br/><br/>The colors is where you will spend your time, the screen has 3 profiles sRGB DCI and Adobe RGB, none of them will give you a normal screen colors right away, the good thing is this screen has lot of adjustment options to tweak the colors as you like.<br/><br/>I tried the sRGB and got brown reds, the only way to solve that is adjusting the six axis RGB values, I fiddled a lot and didn't get a perfectly natural color, the Adobe RGB is way oversaturated and not natural, the gaming profiles are either dull or oversaturated.<br/><br/>i need to spend some more on the color adjustment to get a natural looking RGB visual, but since 100% of adjustment options are there Im not going to complain, I cool with that.</span>

<span>I love this monitor it's an absolute beast with amazing picture and pretty much a small TV. It does black screen everytime you switch apps or games though for about 2 seconds which doesn't bother me enough to complain but could annoy some people. For actual gaming etc I love it.</span>
