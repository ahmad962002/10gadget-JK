<span>Takes decent pictures but the video quality and especially the sound quality is awful. The battery life is pretty disappointing as well. The macro lens on my phone is much better than the one that comes with this. It's probably worth the $100 but you'd do better to save for something much better.</span>

<span>We purchased 14 of these cameras for a kid's camp. We are on the second day, and the SD card slots are jamming. The picture quality is pretty good. The kids are ages 10-13, and these have simple functions for small hands. I wish we had not removed the SD cards - we lost two cameras today. Also, the cameras do not record sound on the videos - you need to attach an external mic.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This camera is passable if you use it on a tripod and there isn’t a lot of movement in the frame. I tried walking around with it and the video was extremely bouncy and choppy. I set it up on a tripod it gave me a fairly crisp video but if the movement was too quick then it looks choppy. At the end of the day it’s a $100 camera and it performs like it.<br/>A single battery lasted about an hour for me, which is perfectly acceptable. I was hoping for more but it does well enough I will keep using it.</span>

<span> So the camera comes with everything including SD card and SD transfer card. It delivers on what it promises which is 44 pixels and the truth is we're just used to more. There may be 3-year-olds that are okay with this quality. But to be very honest our children are so used to a higher quality they may actually get mad at you and throw this camera at you. But I get it five stars because it delivered. And it came with you know everything that you would want a camera to come with. But it delivers on being 44 pixels it's just very our cake for today's technology. I found it connected to my computer easily and I was able to get the pictures and video that I taken with it off with ease. So it's a good for exactly as described. You can see picture quality for yourself in my video.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The quality is not that great, this camera is not your traditional point and shoot, more like a knock off. The lenses don’t come out at all like normal cameras. It did come with 2 batteries and a 32gb of storage. I’m just not happy with it because it’s so cheap.</span>

<span>I bought this on some sort of 12% sale to take on a trip to Grand Tetons and Yellowstone just for fun. So for around $30 this is obviously not the most expensive film camera.<br/><br/>If you are looking into getting into film I would say this could be a great start since all you need to do is get a battery, load a film and you are all auto.<br/><br/>But then if you are pretty serious then there are better options of old cameras for even cheaper value in facebook markets or thrift stores.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish this camera had was to be a lot smaller size and not feel so plastic feel. I have a Rollei 35T and that is smaller than this camera.</span>

<span>Just to give some background, I was looking for an inexpensive video to do vlogging type stuff and take some videos with my dog. I don't have much experience with more expensive camcorders or what kind of technology and features you can expect if you paid 150 200 dollars, but TL;DR this is neat for the price and gives you a compact HD picture that is pretty good and it is cool that it has the video screen and an extra battery. The menus are fairly easy to figure out after a couple of minutes of poking around.<br/><br/>So anyways my criticisms, you have to buy an SD card which is not that big of a deal but you want to be aware of it before you start to use it. Apparently it only holds up to 32gb which is not that big especially with how fast video file sizes add up, so it's probably better to make small clips and not expect to make a huge 2 hours video. With that being said I don't know about how other cameras and their storage work so it might not be too bad.<br/><br/>The USB technology seems kind of old but also it charges the battery pretty good so not really any complaints. I was not expecting USB C connections or anything for the price. I have not used it as a webcam, but you will probably want to get an inexpensive tripod to do that which is more extra money you have to add on depending on the reasons you bought it to begin with.<br/><br/>My major complaints and the reason for the 3 stars is it consistently freezes on me and I have to reset it. It might be because the battery connection comes apart for a second or just because the software quality, but it may be an issue you have that costs you when trying to record at the perfect moment. Also, the sound quality / microphone is pretty bad. One annoying thing is when pressing the zoom buttons on the top you hear it on the video very loudly so you will definitely want to edit the final product or have your zoom level figured out before you start recording. Also because it is so small I found it more difficult to keep it steady and smaller movements show up more. Anyways I still recommend it but if you need more than the bare minimum to record videos there are probably way better options for 50-100 dollars more.</span>

<span>Keeping this one - tested 6 cameras all under $150. Some said FHD and 4K. All had issues. Some froze in PC Cam mode in sunny scenes (yes, weird). Some did not zoom in PC Cam mode. So test immediately for your purpose and return if fails.<br/><br/>This Camera: says 1080 15fps. In PC Cam mode does 720p. If streaming, 720p uses less bandwidth/data and is good enough for most 'amateur' uses. The attached photo is from the .avi video file. Not bad.<br/>This camera's zoom works in PC Cam mode and worked well doing YT live tests for intended purpose of simple backyard or youth activities so friends and relatives could be a part of the activity. Used the default settings and was pleased with results, may play later with the options.<br/><br/>Note: A good 720p is going to beat a mediocre upscaled 4K or 1080p. Most of these cameras do NOT have native resolution cmos sensors, but use software to upscale. So don't be fooled by the hype. A 48MP or 56MP camera is the upscale, not the native resolution. Its the native resolution that determines actual picture quality.<br/><br/>Recommended for 'pretty good' (not professional) YT live and similar uses.</span>

<span>I love photography and got this to have a variety of shots.  The camera takes 4k videos at 60fps, which is really high quality. I like the stabilizer and the auto focus on this camera. It help produce much cleaner videos compared to the videos capture from my smart phone. It also came with a nice macro lens and it screws in securely. I can add filtering to the lens too. Two batteries is included and a usb charger. They seems to last pretty long and the screen shows the battery capacity remaining so I know when I need to swap. There is also a 32GB SD card included. I would recommend getting a larger one if you plan to do a lot of videos since 4k@60hz can fill up the space fast.  Overall I’m happy with this camera. Take way better video than the latest smartphone.</span>

<span>I got this camera for my little cousin to replace her 12 year old panisonic luminex I thought maybe being a newer camera it would be better, its pretty much the same picture but much lighter and made of all plastic, I mean it feels like it would be one of those fake toys for tottlers, but it works and functions like it says she loves it though the blue color is awesome very easy to use</span>

<span>This camera is advertised for kids.  I had a previous HP small camera almost identical that was easy to operate, excellent menu, date time set up, video  or still, zoom, etc.  THIS one does all those but the buttons are really not intuitive, the menu is terrible, and there are way too many little icons on the screen that are supposed to tell you what you have selected!  (flash on/off, resolution, 'face detect'? ,smile capture?, self timer, scene mode? exposure, white balance?,sharpness?)  it goes crazy with icons you need the manual to decipher!<br/>It does have video mode, still photo mode, and even an audio recording mode.  Who would use audio on the camera when darn near every smart cell phone does the same much easier?<br/>The User manual is OK, but far too much complication.  Not even the nerd sharp kids of today would like it.</span>

<span>This is the perfect camera for beginners and children alike. It is very lightweight, fully charged and includes 2 batteries (750mAh), lanyard charger, memory card, and other necessary accessories. No need to buy batteries, use USB to charge, and comes with your matching adapter. I'm very surprised how many options it costs! The 2.88" screen is the right size for great photos and videos (can be paused)! Zoom is a great add-on option as well as auto flash. Shipping is fast and the camera comes in a very secure packaging!! You can buy a point and shoot bag But if you are a professional photographer, this camera is not for you. In short, buy it with confidence~ strongly recommend this great little camera!!!</span>

<span> Excellent camcorder! The UHD quality and resolution are great for recording/taking pictures. I bought this camcorder for Vlogging acrylic painting with my daughters. We have played with it for a week now, and I really can say it’s very easy to use for beginners like me. I have read the features&amp;details carefully to explore more fun, and it well stands for what it advertised. The sound quality is great, and the quality of the picture is clear. The mic and LED light are exceptional to meet the higher requirements. I intentionally chose a middle price camcorder to avoid mistakes, now I'm very impressed with the quality of the camera that came for a great price.</span>

<span> I hate it when someone compares a fifty-dollar watch with a five-hundred dollar watch. Compare what you paid for and how it works for that price range. I make commercials and usually hire professional camera men with high-dollar cameras to shoot my stuff and then I edit it on my computer. I was curious in doing some online stuff for myself and not spending a fortune, so I thought I would give this camera a try. I knew this was not a big-time camera.<br/><br/>I did apply a filter to the video to enhance the color some, but did not spend a lot of time lighting or editing, just quickly playing, and for indoors I was somewhat impressed. Again, it is a $400 camera, not a high-dollar professional camera.<br/><br/>I did not like the camera mics, they try to drop the background noise and it just didn't work for me. I used a wireless mic and it sounded much better. Also, outside video was too hot, the brights just blowout, and it's too "shaky" trying to move the camera around. It has a stabilizer, but I was not impressed.<br/><br/>If you are not wanting to spend a fortune and are looking to shoot a podcast, this might be a good camera to try. Again, I would think about using a different mic, but try it and see if it might work for you.</span>
