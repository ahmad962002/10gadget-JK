<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>In the noisy city where i live, taking public transit to work often makes it hard for me to hear my music, often needing to put my music on Max volume for me to be able to hear my music the way i want, and even then i still hear the noises of the city. These do such a good job of isolating the sound of my music so that it's the only thing I hear, which is perfect for me. I don't want to hear the noises of the city, and with these on, I don't have to<br/><br/>I know there are better ANC options in the form of on-ear/over-ear headphones, but those are too big and usually make my ears feel clammy &amp; sweaty. So I went with these, since I've used Bose wired earbuds before and love Bose headphones that I STILL have (it's 5 been years, maybe more)<br/><br/>In the box<br/>It comes with 3 swappable ear tips so that you can have the best fit for your ears (the medium size comes on the earbuds by default). And charging case, which houses the earbuds themselves. As well as a USB to USB-C cable to charge the case with.<br/><br/>Let's get the bad stuff out of the way:<br/>The charging case, I saw the reviews saying the case was big, and then I saw the customer pictures and thought that it wasn't so big. I was wrong, this thing is HUGE. You can't really tell just how tall the charging case actually is. Don't expect to put this case in ANY kind of pocket, be prepared to carry the case in a bag. This wasnt a huge deal for me since I carry a bookbag everywhere I go. The case itself opens with the push of a button, not with a magnetic lid. I don't think this is a pro or con, i didn't mind it when I got used to it.<br/><br/>Lack of touch control features, with the touch controls you can swap between three levels of ANC (0%, 50%, and 100% by default, but you can change thee presets on their app), skip to the next track, raise the volume, pause/play music and answer/end calls. You can also bring up your phone's voice assistant (for me it was the Google assistant). This is it... You CANNOT go to a previous track to repeat it, or turn the volume down. I do wish I had the ability to change what the touch controls do, since personally, I do not use the Google assistant feature or swap noise cancellation levels at all. Which would have freed up those gestures for volume down and previous track. On top of the fact that this next feature makes the swappable ANC levels obsolete<br/><br/>Other:<br/>When you take one earbud off, it pauses your media (assuming you have music playing) and turns off active noise cancellation, which is nice when you are trying to have a conversation.<br/><br/>Putting on the headphones so that they 'seal' against your inner ears is actually very easy. Their app shows you how to properly put on the headphones, for a perfect seal every time (i know it seems trivial, you should just put them in your ear right? Nah there's a technique to it lol)<br/><br/>The battery life is nothing to write home about, but i didn't feel like they died too quickly. I only needed then to commute to and from work, and during my lunch break, which is only 3 hours a day, and i charge them every night. They don't have the best battery life but they don't die on me every hour either. At the end of an hour ii am usually at around 80% battery on each earbud. I also place them in their charging case between use and that is enough to get me through the day.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>The sound quality and noise cancellation is top notch. Which is no surprise, since that is what Bose does best. I seriously cannot put into words just how amazing these sound, and how well they isolate my music from the world around me. I played around with turning the ANC on and off in the app and i was honestly shocked at how much noise was being cancelled by the earbuds. it almost seems criminal to talk so much about the few features i didn't care too much about, and talk so little about what i bought these earbuds for, which they do an amazing job at, but honestly there's not much i can say other than they are amazing in both sound and ANC.<br/><br/>TLDR; If all you care about is sound quality and  ANC, and want them in an earbud form factor, look no further. Get these.<br/><br/>If the quality of life features such as gesture controls and portability are the primary reasons you are looking wireless earbuds, i think you can find more affordable options.</span>

<span>I've only had these earbuds for 4 days, so I don't know much about battery life, but everything else about them has made me happy.<br/>I have 3 air conditioners and 2 fans running in my apartment, and the ANC cuts the noise down to a whisper allowing me to only hear the music. And the music sounds crisp and clear with good bass (for ear buds, anyway).<br/>The buds rest on the outside of your ear canals instead of jamming down inside, which makes them more comfortable for extended periods of time and the rubber fins hold them in place well. I've owned the Bose Sport earbuds for around a year, and they have the same fins. They've never once fallen out. (I've lost every other earbud that I've used at one time or another.) The QC buds feel just as secure and just as comfortable as the Sport buds.<br/>They are fairly large compared to other earbuds, but it's not noticable when I'm using them. Also, the case is pretty big, but I don't carry the case around in my pocket, so that doesn't bother me either.<br/>Call quality is pretty good. Everyone says they can hear me well.<br/>If you're trying to decide between the Sport or QC earbuds, I think the QC have only slightly better sound when listening to music, but the noise cancelling makes a big difference. You can hear everything better without the background noise, even at lower volume. The call quality, however, is significantly better with the QC.<br/>Right now, it's tempting to leave these on from the time I get home from work until I go to bed. They're very comfortable, and the noise isolation is quite peaceful. Hopefully I'll still like them this much in a month or 2.<br/><br/>Update for the QC2:<br/>I've always been a function over form kind of person, so I didn't really care what the original QC buds looked like (the extra large size that everyone complains about), and maybe I'm showing my age, and I might be the only person on the planet that says this, but I think the first generation QC buds were more comfortable. The QC2s go farther into my ear canal, and my ears get sore a lot more quickly. Yes, they do look a significantly  more stylish. I would also trade the new, smaller case for the first gen case that has a row of indicator lights that show how much charge is remaining. The new case has one solitary light that flashes different colors to tell me something 🤷🏼‍♂️ in some sort of indiscernible Morse code. The older, larger buds are also easier for me to handle. The new ones are like slippery, squirrelly jumping beans that never go where I'm trying to put them.<br/>But..... These new buds sound really good. I mean, they sound good enough that I'm not even considering returning them. The ANC is unbelievable, and the bass has even more punch than the first gen. They have a nice clean sound, like every other Bose product, and my ears are gradually tolerating them longer each time I use them. I'm keeping the first generation buds for when my ears get sore, or when the battery dies because I couldn't decipher the inscrutable case light, but I'm using the new ones most of the time.<br/>For me, the sound quality negates all other quibbles. Still 5⭐s.</span>

<span>Background: I’m an audiophile who is about $4.5k deep in his stereo setup so it is surprising to say this but I really dig these earbuds. Bose usually targets non-audiophiles as their sound signature is a “sculpted” V shape whereas audiophiles look for neutrality or a straight line across the frequency spectrum.<br/><br/>The Value Proposition: With that in mind, I think people overestimate the ability of more expensive wireless options like the Sony and Senhesier to deliver that neutrality, regardless of earbud/over-ear design. Most of us use iPhones as music players which don’t accept hi-res wireless codes and are a PIA to use with wired headphones without carrying around a radio shack/dongle city. These Bose look like a comparatively good value: at $200 they undercut the companies mentioned above that have ANC earbuds which are $280 and $250. That it just more than I want to spend on a pair of earbuds, which typically have a short shelf life anyway due to loss, poor build quality, depleting battery life, and rapidly changing tech…<br/><br/>Sound: these are a far cry from the first Bose I owned, the OG quiet comforts in middle school with the battery box built into the 3.5mm cable. Dynamic range, note-to-note distinction, and tonal accuracy are improved significantly. They’re much more musical even if detail retrieval isn’t top of the line. But how could it be with standard AAC, SBC codecs? Moreover, even if they did have more advanced codecs like APT-X HD and LDAC, my iPhone is my mobile music player and doesn’t accept them anyway. So really unless you’re on Android, paying for them is a waste of money. You’re not getting the data. Overall; sound signature is controlled, bass heavy, and musical if not neutral. I can live with it for a mobile solution because I do critical listening at home due to the inherent compromises of mobile, which leads to my next point nicely.<br/><br/>Active Noise Cancellation: This is where these earbuds shine. Whether you’re living in the city, commuting to work by train, dealing with construction, trying to mow the lawn, whatever: these babies block out the world with the best ANC I’ve heard in an earbud and you are immersed in your music. I accidentally turned on my 1100W stereo in the next room to 50% volume with a butt dial and had no idea it was playing while wearing these. Without this quiet space, you’re wasting your time trying to hear the music in detail. That is why I think these are an incredible value proposition that make sense for a mobile solution.<br/><br/>Battery: It’s fine, expected 6 hours without the charging case. That is better than Apple by several hours. I expect to have these for 3 years and then upgrade to something with longer battery life as technology improves and lithium ion depletes with age.<br/><br/>Calls: They’re great, I use them for Zoom calls almost every day. If they could connect to multiple devices at once that would be cool, but it is no dealbreaker.<br/><br/>Build Quality: Last but not least, audiophiles know that with consistent use wear and tear happens so we prioritize a robust build that will hold up with thousands of hours of listening. These things deliver. I’ll take the bulkier case with a stronger hinge. The slightly bigger earbuds are fine because they’re built solidly.  I just can’t get on board with the chintzy Apple/Beats products that look like they’re built from dollar store plastics, like they’re going to fall apart in 6 months. Same thing for cheap alternatives from Anker and similar budget brands (you get what you pay for).<br/><br/>Wrap Up: mobile music listening is full of compromises and I think Bose has created an excellent product that delivers where it counts. If you want to do critical listening, do yourself a favor and invest in a pair of open-back headphones and amp at home or better yet a stereo setup you can enjoy with others. What Hi-Fi is a good, accessible place to start for recommendations and Stereofile is more advanced. For everything else, when I’m running around doing errands, on the plane next to a screaming baby, or just trying to cut down the noise of traffic/construction while working, these will deliver nicely. Plan to keep, will update in 1, 6, 12 months<br/><br/>*************************************************************************************************************<br/><br/>Updated 10/2022: I’m happy other buyers found this review useful. Forgot to update this sooner, needless to say, still love these babies - the version 1’s - and they would still be the wireless buds I would spend my money on today inclusive of new models.</span>

<span>I've had these Bose QuietComfort earbuds for almost a year and they've been great!<br/><br/>I used to have a pair of regular non ANC earbuds, but I found myself always increasing the volume to try to block out the excessive ambient noise at the gym. However, at night, I could hear my ears ringing. I became very concerned about this, so I looked into ANC earbuds and ordered these Bose QuietComfort and the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds.<br/><br/>After trying both of them for a week, the Bose QuietComfort earbuds were noticeably quieter and better at handling ambient noise and thus listening at lower volume than the Sony WF-1000XM4. The Sony WF-1000XM4's audio quality was about the same as Bose, perhaps a bit better, but what good is this if it isn't very effective at blocking ambient noise and you have to raise the volume to appreciate it, which is precisely what I do not want?<br/><br/>So, I returned the Sony WF-1000XM4 and kept the Bose QuietComfort earbuds, which also sound very good and fantastic when you're streaming Master quality tracks. I was blown away by the audio quality when listening to Master quality tracks vs the regular tracks, what a huge difference!<br/><br/>I also compared them with my daughters' Air Pods Pro and what a joke. The Apple Air Pods Pro ANC paled in comparison to the Bose and the audio quality was worse, it was awful. There is simply no comparison.<br/><br/>These earbuds are so good at blocking ambient noise, that I no longer carry the Bose ANC 700 headphones when I travel! Yes folks, they are that good and much easier to carry! I've set many times on the wing area of airplanes and these earbuds work their magic all the time!<br/><br/>They are very comfortable to wear and stay on once in place, the touch controls are very accurate, the voice assistant is great, answering and making calls is very good, no complaints from the other party, well built, as I've dropped them several times and they continue working without any issues.<br/><br/>Battery life is also great! I workout on average for 90 minutes, if the gym is too busy I'll easily clock in 120 minutes, without any low battery warning. I wipe them, put them back in their case, and they're ready to go the following day. I workout 5 times a week, and I will not recharge the case for almost a month!<br/><br/>And the best part about them is that these earbuds have saved my hearing, since I listen to them at about 1/3 the volume I was listening to with the other non ANC earbuds I had, and I no longer hear any ringing in my ears at night!<br/><br/>Now, recently I had the opportunity to acquire the Bowers &amp; Wilkins PI7 earbuds.<br/><br/>And yes they do sound better than the Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds, in fact noticeably better than all of the earbuds I tried, but they are after all much pricier, and despite this, their ANC and especially the battery life, is not as good as the Bose QuietComfort earbuds.<br/><br/>So for the office, I use my Bowers &amp; Wilkins PI7's, because of their outstanding audio quality, but outside of it, Bose takes the prize for checking all the boxes!<br/><br/>I therefore highly recommend these Bose QuietComfort earbuds, because you may not know it, but they'll save your hearing!</span>

Introducing Bose Sleepbuds II — tiny, comfortable earbuds with sleep technology that’s clinically proven to help you fall asleep faster. They work with the Bose Sleep app to deliver relaxing sounds that help you fall asleep, and use Bose noise-masking technology to cover unwanted nighttime disturbances that may otherwise wake you. So you get your best sleep ever. From wind down to wake up, this is your easy solution to better sleep. Sleepbuds play content only from the app. Explore the Sound Library’s curated relaxation content — including tranquil tonal environments and sounds from nature and beyond — and Bose-engineered noise-masking sounds designed to cover nighttime disturbances like snoring, outside traffic, and next-door conversation. Download your favorites directly onto the earbuds to customize your nighttime routine. The app also lets you set an alarm only you’ll hear, and access other features including Phone-free Mode, which allows you to program your settings ahead of time so you can leave your phone in another room. In addition to optimized sleep sounds, Bose noise-masking technology also uses the noise-blocking design of proprietary soft silicone ear tips. A pliable fin fits snugly in the ridge of your ear, while an umbrella shape gently seals off your ear canal to passively block noise. Three sizes are included so you can find a secure, comfortable fit. Sleep on your back or your side, toss and turn, or roll over during the night, Sleepbuds will stay put. A nickel-metal hydride battery provides up to 10 hours per charge, enough for a full night’s sleep, while the included charging/storage case gives you up to three additional full charges. Experience Sleepbuds for yourself.

<span>If you’re lying in bed and can’t get to sleep because you hear all the little sounds that always sound so much louder when you’re trying to sleep, this is the product for you. We installed a new awning to our deck that bolted to the house right under our bedroom window, but when then wind comes it makes a slight thumping noise all night when the fabric flutters which drove me to sleep in a guest room. I ordered these out of desperation after a fan and white noise machine didn’t fix the issue…these fixed it. They disappear into your ears (slightly challenging to get them out, but that’s what makes them good because they don’t fall out and you can easily sleep on your side) and completely block out noise. My neighbors could be throwing a rager until 5am and I’ll wake up having slept like a baby. If you don’t sleep, these literally change your life. I’ve told everyone I know about these - yes they are expensive but what is your quality of life worth?</span>

<span>I've always been a terrible sleeper and have tried noise machines/speakers in the past but the low audio quality/mono sound approach was always distracting. I tried these on a whim and they do a fantastic job of sealing out background noise. The audio quality is fantastic as well and I loved the variety of sounds that they offer.<br/>A personal favorite is "Portal" which sounds sort of sci-fi like you're in on a spaceship listening to the hum of an engine. Bose also has a selection of sounds that are a little more musical (like 'Ode') that seem fit for meditation but I did not use them for that purpose.<br/><br/>An impact on my sleep was definitely immediately noticeable as the sounds seemed to keep me tied (for lack of a better word?) to my sleepy state so when I woke up to readjust I was fast asleep again in seconds/minutes rather than watching the time tick by like I used to.<br/><br/>Some cons:<br/>If you move the case around at all it seems easy to dislodge one of the earbuds and end up with it not being charged when you go to sleep. Easy to remedy by being diligent and checking them if you relocated/are traveling.<br/><br/>Like others have mentioned here, battery life and audio volume did seem to wane a bit after a number of months. I did find myself increasing the volume a bit to match the same isolation I had previously.<br/><br/>Lastly, a little over a year after purchase, the right earbud has suddenly stopped working. I've tried following the troubleshooting steps from Bose but have had no luck. Sadly, the only remedy is now purchasing a new pair, purchasing a refurbished pair from Bose, or going in a different direction. Bose does not offer repairs or the ability to just replace one bud.</span>

<span>I wanted to provide my experience with the product given some of the one star reviews I have recently read. I think they are somewhat unfair and misleading to people.<br/><br/>I have had and used this product nightly for the past year. I have a partner that snores, sometimes very loudly, and this is the product that helps the most. Ear plugs didn't quite do the trick and were pretty painful upon waking, not to mention compacted earwax. I am confused by some of the people's reviews on here that say it hurt their eardrum more so than ear plugs as ear plugs go in your ear a lot further than this product should.<br/><br/>Some people also complained that "This product is not for side sleepers" or "if you are a side sleeper, it is painful in your ear." I actually found them to be quite comfortable enough to sleep any any position and I sleep in most positions but mainly on my side. I didn't have much of any problem with pain and They usually stay in my ear. I may have had 4 or 5 nights in the last year where one popped out but nothing is perfect. These also come with 3 different sized silicone covers to help with different sized ears. On some of the reviews that complained about it not staying in their ear or had pain, they didn't mention trying the other 2 sizes. Plus, it is unfair and misleading to say "if you are a side sleeper, it is painful in your ear." Just because this is the experience this one person had, doesn't mean it will be that way for the vast majority of people. One persons' experience shouldn't be extrapolated to the general population. That is a little too self absorbed.<br/><br/>For the reviews that are upset that it is not "noise cancelling", it is not marketed as "noise cancelling." It is marketed as "noise-masking" for which it does quite well. One shouldn't imply, simply because it is made by Bose, that it will be "noise cancelling." Read the description of the product you are purchasing and don't blame Bose. Yes, it would be nice if it had some better "noise cancelling" qualities but that is not what you are buying. That is not to say that it does not block out some noise as it does.<br/><br/>Another person had an issue that "the charge on these lasts for a single night sleep. You need to recharge them after that. That means you have to travel with their annoying travel case even for an overnight trip".  First of all, it comes with a travel case which is nice. The charging case can go in the travel case. Otherwise You don't HAVE to use the travel case. The charging case is about the size of a hockey puck...maybe a little smaller. It is a great place to store the earbuds for any travel occasion. You are going to have to put the earbuds in something so they don't get lost when you travel. So I guess I just don't get how this is that big of a deal. Pop the earbuds in the charger and put the charger in your bag. Wow, that's hard. As far as the charging goes. The charge lasts the whole night and I have never had issues with it not lasting the whole night even if I was in bed for 10 hours for which we shouldn't be in bed that long anyways.<br/><br/>I give 4 stars because after about 10 months of use, one of the earbuds sound output has diminished gradually and is now to the point that I can barely get any noise out of my right earbud. Left still works fine. With that said, I called Bose today and they are replacing my earbuds for free. I am lucky in that if I waited much longer to call them, the warranty would have expired (it is for 1 year). What also brings down the score is the price. Seems a little too expensive for what it does; plays sound. These sounds are also preselected from their app and you can not download or play any of your own. With that said, their selection is pretty decent.<br/><br/>With the decent return policy (I think it was at least 30 days but don't take my word on this), it is worth a try to see if they are for you.</span>

<span>It's Bose. So it's well made, smartly designed, and super comfortable in the ears. It's functionality is limited and I found it didn't help me an more than a using my Amazon Echo as a sound machine at night. But I don't have noise issues where I live that I need to drown out. It's very expensive for something with limited capabilities, but sleep is important. And if it had worked for me, it would have been well worth the price.</span>

<span>The sound quality of these ear buds is excellent, as with other Beats products the bass response is superb, which is lacking in the AirPods, IMO. Understandably, it's difficult to pack a lot of bass amplification into a tiny set of wireless ear buds, but Beats managed to do so. They also work with my iPhone 12 Pro Max as seamlessly as the AirPods.<br/><br/>The fit is nice and they stay in my ears better than AirPods; however, I do NOT like the physical buttons being directly on the outside of the buds, opposite your ear canals. I often have to adjust my ear buds and push them back in my eyes to optimize sound because they tend to move around, and this pauses the sound every time - SUPER annoying and dated design flaw. Also, the noise cancellation is pretty lame - not nearly as good as the AirPod Pros. I can hardly tell the difference with it on/off. Lastly, I'm not a fan of the lack of magnetic charging - it is USB-C only. As much as I would love for everything to switch to USB-C, Apple seemingly refuses to let go of their Lightning port, so I still have mostly Lightning cables and thus it would be nice to have magnetic charging instead of just USB-C.<br/><br/>All in all, this a great product at a good price, but if noise cancellation is important to you, you might want to spend the extra $ on the AirPod Pros.</span>

<span>I bought these after initially buying and returning the ‘beats pro fit’ which advertised basically everything these do with the addition of the silicon piece to better secure the earbuds in your ear.<br/><br/>I returned those because that piece made them uncomfortable to wear for more than half an hour or so but their sound quality and especially their noise cancellation were phenomenal—they sounded a bit better than these do. Not by an extremely large margin but especially in regards to the active noise cancellation, the Pro Fit did it better and I’m not sure why since they’re nearly the same product but perhaps they have more differences internally than I realized.<br/><br/>I’m tempted to return these and re-order the Pro Fit and just trying to find a way to make them tolerable to wear because I miss the level of noise cancellation they achieved.<br/><br/>Alas, these are still great earbuds and I’ll need more time with them to make the decision of whether or not to keep them. From only a day’s use I can say that they’re far more comfortable to wear for extended periods and the charging case they come with is of better quality than that of the Pro Fit’s (which isn’t saying too much to be fair).<br/><br/>I’ll update this after I’ve had a chance to use them at the gym a few times.</span>

<span>I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:<br/><br/>Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.<br/>Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.<br/><br/>Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.<br/>Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.<br/>Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.<br/><br/>Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.<br/>Cons – Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.<br/><br/>Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details<br/>Pros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.<br/>Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.<br/><br/>My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.</span>

<span>I use my ear buds mainly at the gym to get lost in my workout. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but love my music. In my opinion the sound quality is excellent with deep bass and clarity. I have been buying cheaper ear buds ($35 range) for years not wanting to spend the money that higher quality ear buds demand but I have to buy a couple pair each year with nothing but issues. These were on sale for $90 so it was a no brainer. I can't compare these to air pods or any expensive ear buds but the difference from the cheaper ones is unmistakable. Should have done it years ago.</span>

<span>Have a noisy spouse? Kids driving you up the wall? Neighbor mowing the lawn at odd hours? Use these to tune them all out!<br/><br/>I have used other brands in the past and even used the Bose Noise canceling earbuds, but the Bose 700 headphones are hands down the best I have ever used. Combine the top quality sound of Bose speakers and the noise cancelation tech, you can retreat into whatever auditory world you want to with no interruptions. The headphones have a firm but comfortable fit and I have worn them for 5+ hours and they never felt too heavy or uncomfortable. The battery life is also very good, I have yet to drain the headphones in my normal usage (5-6 hours) in the office or when traveling.<br/><br/>I only have a couple minor complaints. When I first started using these, I wished the ear cups were bigger as I was not  used to using over the ear headphones vs in ear buds, I have gotten used to this but something to be aware of. Second, I find it annoying to have to collapse the headphones to get it to fit into the provided case. This means you need to readjust them every time you use them. Not a deal breaker, but again, something to be aware of.<br/><br/>Overall I really like these headphones. I feel both the sound quality and noise cancelation is better then other offerings I have tried and even defeat the Bose earbuds.</span>

<span>I've owned these for half a day so far and have decided to keep them around. I'm an audiophile who spends money on kickstarter earbuds, custom-made preamps, and (in general) quality hardware which reduces my audio experience as little as possible. Trying these cans in-store at BestBuy allowed me to appreciate the hardware quality of the exterior... quality matte plastic moulding, amazing comfortable faux-leather surfaces on your skin, and a synthesized voice and audible feedback to assist with your navigation of the three hardware buttons and touch controls make these headphones easy to wear during work sessions, public transit commutes, or in a crowded home with loud kids. As a brand new product, the tension on the cans over your ears and on your head can become uncomfortable within an hour of use. Subjectively, I don't consider my head to be particularly large or larger-than-average and will need to play around with adjusting the cups to sit lower or higher on the band which also release/tighten the tension respectively to see if this becomes a long term problem with use. Taking short breaks with the headphones off (10-15 minutes) helps and gives a good excuse/reminder to take a break from work to relax the body/eyes/ears.<br/><br/>The sound quality is reasonable for the headphones. When using the headphones with noise cancellation off, ambient noise seems to lack a very strong low end frequency response (sub ~250Hz, not measured) and might reduce your meatspace experience in some cases where mixed ambient and input audio are desired. That said, direct input still seems to perform quite well with solid frequency response all around which lets the very highs and very lows to be pretty well-balanced.<br/><br/>A test using the headset for phone conversation over bluetooth yielded very nice results. The setup involved the cans paired with my laptop streaming music and my Project Fi Pixel 3 phone on standby. Using the Google voice assistant to start the call resulted in some clumsy voice detection/understanding problems ("I'm sorry, I didn't get that, who would you like to call? I don't know that name, who would you like to call? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Dialing..." _sigh_) which I don't believe are the fault of the cans at all. The test included loud ambient music in the room with the person wearing the headphones and found the other user to experience practically none of the ambient noise through the call with a very clear bead on the callee's voice despite close proximity to the music source playing at a moderate volume (such that the ambient music was leaking through the room walls and making it hard to isolate whether the headphones were leaking the ambient noise into the call...which it seemed _not_ to do with this casual test setup). Noticeable was the (300-700ms) delay from the user on the headphones which seemed to not be present from the non-headphone user. It was hardly a concern and either due to the latency in the network transmitting the audio (which, again, was a local wifi call between handsets.... though I am unsure if the handsets route audio locally or not) or possibly in the audio processing from the headset. This latency was par for most mobile calls and should be completely unnoticeable in a remote environment when you're not there to hear to source before the transmitted audio through the headset.<br/><br/>A few gripes about the design and ergonomics of the device:<br/>- the button placement: very easy to accidentally active these buttons which adjusting the placement of these cans if not aware/careful.<br/>- the direction of earcup rotation: when placing the cans around the neck/shoulders, the earcups rotate up (into the air) rather than down (onto your chest). Questionable choice here as it makes the headphones somewhat uncomfortable to hold there, but perhaps Bose never expects you to remove the phones... unsure if that's a reasonable expectation or not.<br/>- the synthetic leather matte black surface inside the top of the headset and on the earcups attract oil and will certainly show for those of us with that sort of skin. This may require some extra TLC and upkeep to keep as pristine as one might like. The white set might fair better in this regard.<br/><br/>Overall summary:<br/>A pricey purchase that I would have trouble justifying as a personal expense (these were expensed by my employer and intended for daily voice conference usage and isolation during work hours in busy coffee shops) and really comes down to the longevity of the product over time. If these headphones end up lasting me longer than 5 years, I would be VERY satisfied with the purchase. At a price point closer to $250-300, this would be a much easier personal purchase to make.<br/><br/>As a user which "babies" their hardware, I am eager to see whether this will stand the test of time. Direct input (from a bluetooth source that is not ambient noise) has a very solid frequency response which does not noticeably detract from the music experience. Longterm use may be uncomfortable depending on your head size. The noise cancellation works wonderfully and almost too well, leaving me at a "5" setting more often than a "10" as complete cancellation feels too isolating and uncomfortable to feeling the lack of "air" around me. BLE connection to multiple devices (two) at once allows for seemless transitions between either input. This is also a first time purchase of a Bose product. Looking forward to seeing how the device matures and support is handled over time. Firmware updates are provided automatically to the headset through their app. Battery life "appears" long but I have yet to complete a full discharge cycle to be sure. I was pleasantly surprised to find the phones report +5 hours of use remaining at 20% battery charge and +20 hours at full charge (the audio assistant delivers the charge level as "hours of use" remaining, not battery level...which is still viewable in the Bose Music app. Nice touch, Bose).</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>This review is my personal experience using both headphones.  I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones.  Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.<br/><br/>Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic).  Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.<br/><br/>PERSONAL USAGE<br/>I use these headphones primarily for work.  I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development.  I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work.  We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication.  Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.<br/><br/>PERSONAL PREFERENCES<br/>I really don’t like using in the ear headphones.  They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution.  Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me.  This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.<br/><br/>BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEAD<br/>My first pair of headphones were Beats Solo.  I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general.  Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3.  These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.<br/><br/>The functionality is about the same between the two.  With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements.  Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.<br/><br/>• Pros – Lots of colors.  Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity.  Useful when sweating or outdoor use.<br/>• Cons – Quality.  Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution.  Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general.  Feel cheap.<br/><br/>FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3<br/>I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member.  I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted.  I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.<br/><br/>There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality.  Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more.  My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time.  The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.<br/><br/>Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s.  One big thing I would like to see is app integration.  Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature.  Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.<br/><br/>The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two.  I found I used it a couple of times.<br/><br/>Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1.  These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.<br/><br/>• Pros –Very durable and well built.  Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work.  Slept with these on a bus trip.  That was my last memory.  Cheaper than the Bose.  Foldable, smaller case.<br/>• Cons – Less features than the Bose.  Misses on some sweet spots.  Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.<br/><br/>SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700<br/><br/>Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible.  Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t.  The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute.  When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up.  Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.<br/><br/>I’ve only had these for a month.  Was it worth paying up for it?  Honestly, I don’t know yet.  There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.<br/>So based on a month, here’s what I found<br/>• Pros – Seems like better sound quality.  More features and possible mute integration.<br/>• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.<br/><br/>TLDR / OVERALL REVIEW<br/>I won’t even compare the Beats headphones.  Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.<br/>METRICS<br/>• Sound Quality – Bose slightly.  My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be.  Spotify is what I listen to primarily.  The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.<br/>• Mute / Unmute – Bose.  The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.<br/>• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose.  There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10.  Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.<br/>• Microphone – Sony.  Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”.  Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.<br/>• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about.  Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy.  I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony.  It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary.  If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.<br/>• Headset Features, Bose wins.  Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them.  The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.<br/>• Headset Quality – Sony.  I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head.  Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t.  An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.<br/>• In the box – Sony slightly.  Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not.  I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.<br/>• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony.  Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.<br/>• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively.  Bluetooth location hasn’t changed.  Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.<br/>• Companion Application – Bose.  Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.<br/><br/>WINNER – Sony<br/><br/>I’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.<br/>With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone.  Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective.  So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.<br/><br/>Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.<br/><br/>I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again.  Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that.  Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire.  That’s something that’s a no-go for me.  I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement.  Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.<br/><br/>Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.<br/><br/>As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it.  I can see it both ways.  For me, these headphones are for basic usage.  The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade.  Defective products happen.  I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better.  Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.<br/><br/>I hope this helped someone.  Sorry for too much text.</span>

<span>This is a very expensive set of earphones, but if you care about audio quality, there is nothing better than this! The driver size alone (9.2mm) should tell you Bang and Olufsen are serious about audio quality. I have the Beoplay E8 2.0 (4.7mm drivers) and this blows that out of the water.<br/><br/>Regarding the details of the sound signature, the most obvious difference is the bass. As the drivers are double in size, and due to the excellent design, you can definitely FEEL the base vs just hearing it. The bass is so crisp and balanced. It is not like a cheap earphone that just cranks up the bass, but more like adding a balanced subwoofer to an otherwise great sound system. That extra bass adds a layer of richness that would not be possible without that subwoofer.<br/><br/>The mids and highs are very clear, in line with B&amp;O's classic sound signature, but what's also amazing is the wide soundstage these earphones possess. It feels more 3 dimensional, and doing side by side comparisons vs my E8 2.0 and airpods pro just make them sound flat with a narrow soundstage.<br/><br/>The balance of the mids and highs is well done also. I do not hear any scratchiness or sibilance with  vocals or classical instruments. Rap, rock and pop come alive due to the punchy bass.<br/><br/>The design and look of the earphones match the price. It is easy to setup and adjust the EQ with the b&amp;o app. The only downside is the ANC is not as good as the competition. Vs apple airpods pro, the B&amp;O ex is definitely lacking. Don't get me wrong, its still an excellent ANC, but just lacking when comparing side by side.<br/><br/>Finally, the price is very exclusive at 399. If you have the money, i would say buy it immediately, you won't regret it. However, I can see this dropping to 299 or 349 once the holiday season start. At that price, it would be a no brainer. You will not be disappointed!</span>

<span>The noise canceling was ok not as good as Bose, Apple, Sony. However, the sound is AMAZING. The bass is so rich and deep I prefer wearing these when I go to the gym. I listen to a lot of EDM and I’m just blown away. I’ve been trying to find headphones that are able to reach my qualifications in deep bass sounding in ear headphones and these are just it.</span>

<span>Coming from the Sony XM4's I splurged for what should be a significant upgrade at 1.5x the cost. The XM4's are not perfect but they are great and their ANC is another world scary. I put the B&amp;O EX's through their paces for a week before deciding to send them back and return to my trusty XM4 buds.<br/><br/>First the good, yes the sound quality on the EX's is great, exceptional even. Details you've been missing suddenly pop, string plucks, reverb of the room, the warmth of the bass... it's subtle but it's all there.<br/>These are meant to compete with the AirPod Pros so similar q-tip/ pencil styling is provided for already accustomed iPhone users. Android users who prefer more subtle and elegant round buds may still find the EX acceptable in its styling.<br/>Premium materials abound from glass in the  touch sensors to comply foam tips included to an excellent case that feels sturdy and solid. I really like the easy "boop boop" noise they make when connecting to your device vs announcing "bluetooth connected" every time. ANC is good, nowhere near as good as the XM4's but better than most. There are 3 modes here that you can cycle through, from full transparent to active ANC.<br/><br/>This is really where the positives stop and the problems begin. The B&amp;O app is fine, nothing special and you are annoyingly required to create an account before you can do anything. Location tracking is REQUIRED or the app will not connect to your buds, this is egregious as there isn't a single location related feature here, just greedy data grabbing by B&amp;O. Customization is extremely minimalistic and provides only the basics for ANC and listening mode, which is their non-traditional EQ. Here they give you a round dial that you can slide a button around to find your personal sweet spot be that "warm" or "energetic"; A bit of a disappointing dumb down though you will be able to find what you like.<br/><br/>I experienced strange random disconnects while listening to music with the phone in my pocket, similar to when you've walked out of bluetooth range. I've never experienced this on any other earbud and here it happened repeatedly.<br/>Call quality is decent but the initial connection can be really buggy. For example, call comes in, you answer and put on phone speaker, you then decide you want to switch to your new $400 EX buds so pop one in. Instead of the call transferring seamlessly and instantly, like on the XM4's (or literally any other bud), you get a few seconds of limbo where the buds appear to connect yet you can't hear anything, switch back to speaker, apologize to your caller, then magically they connect and your call continues on the EX's. I really hate this and it happens over and over again. These 2 things alone are deal breakers and enough reason to return.<br/><br/>Multipoint, while a cool feature, is nothing but pain here. If you connect, say, to both your phone and laptop or PC via bluetooth, the EX's will connect to both and then play the audio of whichever device is broadcasting at any particular moment. The problem then is that if the other device issues a notification you will get sound drop silence on the EX's interrupting the primary audio and you won't hear the notification either. Just a moment of dead air until the primary stream picks up again. The only way around this is to disable bluetooth on either device or manually disconnect from bluetooth which defeats the purpose entirely!<br/><br/>Another problem is the touch sensors via the glass circles. You have to press precisely and exactly in these little circles or nothing happens. I hate touch sensors generally, on the XM4's as well, and much prefer a haptic button like on the Jabra buds. Double presses go missed most often where I try to skip a track yet it pauses instead. So you wind up in play/ pause, no, play/pause, no, skip... arg, finally!<br/><br/>Something else worth noting is that I found the EX's to provide no greater comfort than any other earbud I've owned. After a long session your ears will ache and this isn't due to the tips either, it's the round plastic bits shrouding the drivers that press against your ear cartilage.<br/><br/>So the EX's fail at most pretty basic operational features which is unacceptable at the highest price in this segment. These should be near perfect, but they are not. I found using my XM4's more enjoyable, more predictable and while also not perfect, they just work better at the basics like calls and seamless audio.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Excellent musical sound quality<br/>-Premium materials and construction<br/>-High quality wireless charge case with good battery life<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-High cost that should provide perfection, yet falls WAY short<br/>-The app has 2 options: ANC and listening mode, very limited customization<br/>-Account creation and location access required before you can even connect to your earbuds<br/>-Random music drops/ disconnects with phone in pocket<br/>-Problematic BT connection during calls<br/>-Multipoint works but is basically a gimmick that provides more problems than benefits<br/>-Touch sensors are finnicky and require very careful &amp; exact touches<br/>-Long sessions are as uncomfortable as any other earbud, no improvement here</span>

<span>I compared these Beoplay EX against the Sennheiser Momentum 3 and Sony WF-1000XM4.  One of the songs I tested all earbuds on was "BASS OUTLAWS - ILLEGAL BASS".  These Beoplay EX are phenomenal in the bass department.  Truthfully, they are phenomenal in every department except one, in ear fit.  I enjoy my buds feeling absolutely secure in my ear.  For $400 I expect a factory option of extended length memory foam tips.  These do not have that option.  If you do manage to get some extended length tips installed you'll find that the charging case will prevent you from charging your earbuds because they did not factor in enough space in the charging case for longer tips.  This is a monumental oversight on the part of B&amp;O.  1 star for in ear fit and complications of installing your own extended length tips.  10 stars for everything else.<br/><br/>Photos: 1. Beoplay EX with compy tips installed next to factory foam tips. 2. Tip inner diameter comparison.  3. Comply tip on tapered rod to expand the inner diameter.<br/><br/>To add comply tips:  Using tapered rod, expand comply inner rubber core to necessary diameter.  Let tips remain on rod for a while to ensure the rubber is good and expanded.  Remove comply tips from rod and immediately install tip onto Beoplay EX.<br/><br/>The comply tips do somewhat diminish the overall loudness of the earbuds.  This is good and bad.  Good because you can turn your songs up another notch and really feel the drivers pumping the music.  Bad because I think the mids and highs  lose a small amount of fidelity.  Overall I strongly prefer the longer tips.</span>

<span>Like many, I have been hesitant to spend the kind if money quality headphones demand. So settling for lower quality has always resulted in disappointment. I suffer from hearing loss, specifically higher frequencies. Persons who don't, believe that all you have to do is raise the volume. What they fail to realize is that devices that  amplify sound also amplify background noise. Here is where noise canceling technology makes the difference. As a cameraman for a production team, I need to hear the production manager. The Bose QC-45 reduces the background noise from the band enough for me to hear important instructions. To be clear, noise reduction is not 100%, but it is far superior than any other headphones i have owned and worth the money!</span>

<span>I finally bit the bullet and decided to buy these after reading the reviews. I was desperate for a pair of noise cancelling headphones when I was trying to finish my college thesis in a house with 6 rowdy roommates. These were a lifesaver. I finally was able to focus. Additionally. It helped me not feel as overstimulated when I went to somewhere like the grocery store, or dulling traffic noises when I went on a walk. I would always be so surprised when I took the headphones off at how loud the ambient noise around me was, even though I didn’t pay any mind to it before. It’s not perfect, for example when riding the bus it would dull out most of the engine noises, but when we hit a bump I would hear some popping noises as it would be quite Loud and very close. Still much better than without the headphones. It was also really important to me to have comfort, since I have multiple ear piercings and the beats headphones I tried earlier would press into them which would be pretty painful. Even if I found a good position for it, it would still hurt my head after a few hours. With these, I don’t have that problem! They fit completely over my ears, so I never have to worry about my piercings, and the cushioning is very soft so I’ve worn these bad boys for hours and hours and never felt any discomfort! Unfortunately I lost my pair at a bar a few months ago, and I was bummed because they were great headphones, but so expensive. I finally decided to repurchase them after catching a flash sale because I do truly think these are worth the money. I’m not an audiophile, but i do really love the sound quality as well. I hear new things in songs I’ve always loved by listening to them with these. The cons of this product are the following: 1. I wish these headphones worked with the Findmy feature or at least had some other way of tracking their location when lost. I know other Bose products do, and I think that for $300+, it’s not unreasonable to ask for a locating feature so I don’t lose these (again). Especially since these headphones already have their own app. The other con is that these headphones are not water resistant. I don’t think it’s a huge deal breaker for me as I don’t plan on wearing them swimming, but sometimes I worry about walking in a light drizzle with them on. Nothing has actually happened so far when I have done this, (usually I can just put my hood up or something)  but the booklet it comes with specifies that any water is something to avoid, so it does loom in the back of my mind. All In all though.</span>

<span>The Bose Quiet Comfort 45 noise cancelling headphones are quite good - for the most part. They seem to keep external noise from being heard by folks on the other end of my calls, and definitely reduce the external noise that I hear as well. My only issue is that sometimes the mic doesn't seem to work or connect. I've been on a few calls, Teams and Zoom, in which the other parties can't hear me at all - even though all controls show that I'm not muted. I've never had that issue before using these headphones, so presumably, it's an issue with the headphones. Ultimately, they're far better than worse.</span>

<span>I got the Sony headphones before, it’s been 3 years and it still works fine.

The only thing I haven’t used is the ambient sound feature. The only problems I have is that that these days I sound garbled and broken during phone calls, it would randomly disconnect and reconnect, and years of wear caused the leather/cushion(?) to rip and you can see the insides.

Crazy right, so I thought well the headphones probably aren't that good and that's why, they're probably just desperate, and sure enough i look through reviews and people are saying stuff like "these headphones are good but not worth 150 dollars". So at this point I'm just like alright I'm not a headphones enthusiast I just need something that has Bluetooth and decent sound so why not. I even bought my pair used for 70 dollars, (a complete deal to me). I was a little scared that they would break or not be dependable because of it being used but to my surprise they are AMAZING, it's been a few months of me owning them and they're in great shape, I use them everyday, the sound, battery last, comfort, are to die for, I love these headphones and they genuinely are one of my best purchases yet, definitely worth it!</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>very very very comfortable. It (5 driver IEM) feels even smaller than a share 215 (1 driver). It’s light, thin, and really wont put any pressure on any part of my ear ( except of the tips, of course). The cable is really fancy, thinner than a fishing line but so strong. Be reminded that you might even forget that you have the cable connected and might accidentally dropped your player/computer. Well made, the built quality is worth the price if you ask me. Sound wise, it has very good definition (for some parts) and wide stage.<br/><br/>Con: muffled and, forgive me for using this overused word, “muddy” sound. I couldn’t find any reliable frequency graphic for Pro X50, but my ear is telling me there is a big bump around 500Hz. This signature makes the male voice sounds like singing with a stuffy nose - (not that exaggerated but still quite) muffled voice. Also, high frequency is comparably weak, I find it but hard to track hats from drums. Due to the emphasized mid frequency and weak high frequency, instrument isolation is unsatisfactory too, especially for guitars on the few lowest frets  and male voice.<br/><br/>I can imaging this will be a very useful IEM for on-stage vocalists-you don’t have to track down your voice, because voice is emphasized as the center of the center. But for any other uses, including listen to music or producing, it’s over emphasized.</span>

<span>So far.<br/><br/>I splurged a bit on myself and bought these headphones and I really quite enjoy them.<br/>They are quite loud and have an option to turn the noise-cancelation on or off.<br/>You can tell a difference in the sound and I can hear anything outside of the music when it's on.<br/><br/>Over-the-ear headphones usually hurt my ears after wearing them for an hour but so far, I haven't had any discomfort. I wear glasses as well and the don't interfere too much with me adjusting them nor does it crush it against my head.<br/><br/>If you have the money and are kind of on the fence about spending 200+ on these. I would say, do it.<br/>It's worth it and I don't regret buying them.</span>

<span>After a few good years, my Beats Solo died on me. I thought that I'd try the Studio version because I travel a lot and I figured the noise cancellation would make flying more enjoyable. I also thought that the larger earpieces would make them more comfortable than their predecessor's.  I'd say that I was one of two on my wish list: the noise cancellation works great. My wife talks to me and unless I'm looking at her, I can barely hear her, lol! The ear pieces, though larger, still sit on the outside parts of my ear which actually makes them a little less comfortable than my Solos. I find that I have to take them off at times to give my ears a break.<br/><br/>The battery life is not nearly as good as the Solos but it is still impressive and will easily get you through a full day of planes, trains, and automobiles. Also, the battery charges insanely fast so on the off chance that you run out of juice or forget to charge them before you go, you can get a quick boost in just 15 minutes. I'd buy them again because the music sounds great when you use them but I do wish they were a tad more comefortable.</span>

<span>I own Studio Wireless 1's. The speakers I use in my home audio system are Totems with a Yamaha receiver. I mostly listen to hip-hop, jazz, classical, and deep house. My review is mostly around upgrading from Studio Wireless 1's.<br/><br/>Is it my imagination or do these 3's don't hit as hard as the wireless 1's? It doesn't feel like it. Something new I discovered is that the low freq are present-more than in my 1's. It's nice-it's that rumbling bass. I'm just not happy that the 808s don't hit as hard as expected. Same sound stage as 1's which isn't much but there is some. They're not as open as some headphone/amp combos I've tried (I'm listening via Studio 3 and iPhone). I WANT to see my music and feel each musician in front of me to the left or right, close or farther away. But I had to replace my Wireless 1's cuz the ear pads were chewed up from being old (the old leather was breaking up in to annoying small bits). New ear pads off Amazon were $46. So $199 for Studio 3's, I just decided to upgrade. Apple AirPods Max were on my list, but the price of those were putting me off. I would have liked to try spatial audio and the fit. In the end with the genres of music I listen to and the fact I want to support Dre led me to pull the trigger on Studio 3's.<br/><br/>If you're deciding on headphones, know that my 1's would slip from my ears. A girl I saw using AirPods Max said that wasn't happening to her. Studios are comfortable to wear. For colors, I'm missing matte grey. I got mine in black.<br/><br/>Very well worth it and on sale. It was easy to pull the trigger on these.</span>

<span>If you can get these on sale, buy. Bought these for $150 and think at that price, these headphones are near perfect.<br/><br/>Bass seems to be a hot topic. If you listen to dance/EDM, EDM influenced pop, or hip hop/rap, bass levels are very good. I tried listening to other genres, and bass is barely there.<br/><br/>I thought about Sony, but for $150+ extra and no Siri support, they were a no go.<br/><br/>Battery life is amazing. Definitely live up to claim.<br/><br/>Cushions are comfy. I’ve listened to music nonstop for 3+ hours and my ears didn’t hurt.</span>

<span>Had a very nice pair of Bose that got "borrowed" from me on an international flight, decided I wasn't going to spend that much on another temporary set of NC earphones, I found this model by Sony.  It was about $50 at the time, which was only a quarter of my first (now traveling somewhere without me) NC headset.  I really like the simplicity and affordability of them, haven't lost these because they look so plain :-)<br/><br/>Sound is clear, sound reduction is decent, have recommended them to several cabin crew and fellow passengers, even bought a couple sets to give my parents when they retired and took the 'round the world' dream trip they'd been saving and planning for, having NC headsets was equally appreciated by them!<br/><br/>They do not come with any sort of stowage bag included, so recommend you grab something appropriate to keep the kit (headset and cord, it's included legacy airline twin-plug adapter, and a spare battery) neatly contained, rather than tossed loosely in your carry-on bag.  I found a very simple cloth "cosmetic brush" bag that fits the bill perfectly, YMMV.<br/><br/>I mention these have a couple minor drawbacks...<br/><br/>First, if you're looking for Bluetooth or wireless, these are wired use only.  On the other hand, their cord and simple appearance also makes these look to be an ordinary set of headphones and not a desired theft item.<br/><br/>Second, these are not rechargeable, and it is easy to forget about powering down after a flight, so good idea to carry an extra AAA battery in your kit.  On the other hand, the power switch is not easily bumped, so you won't accidentally turn them on in your bag, and the battery drain is rather low so that even after a couple days sitting "ON" in my bag, they were still working.<br/><br/>Overall, a very worthy purchase, and an item I recommend to others, though I think Sony could have stepped them up a notch by giving them rechargeable capability, via USB cable or such, and knock off a star for that reason in hopes they consider this feedback as a suggestion of how to improve an already decent product -- sometimes the little bits of customer input is all it takes to effect change, right?  This whole BT trend, not a huge fan myself, but point it out for those that want BT connectivity on everything.</span>

<span>Bought these for lawn mowing. Best pair I've found for under $50 that will actually keep the mower sound to a minimum. Would buy again</span>
