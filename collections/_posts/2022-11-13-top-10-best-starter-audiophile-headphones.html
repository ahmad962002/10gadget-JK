<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>When I grew up I often listened to my father's Stax electrostatic headphones. I've always compared headphones against them and none have measured up until now. The Sennheiser 560 S comes extremely close. They will reveal everything about the recording you are listening to in a fantastically neutral but highly accurate way. The soundstage and imaging are marvelous. So the good is they will reveal everything. The intricate details of an instrument, voice, or sound effects will be reproduced in full detail, imaging, and clarity. Pretty much if it's in the recording, you will hear it, neutrally and naturally. The bad is they will reveal everything. For example, if you play analog recordings, you will likely hear every possible flaw, including any hiss, distortion, or saturation.<br/><br/>As to powering them. They work perfectly with an iPad hooked using an Apple USB-C to 3.5mm adapter with the built-in DAC. I suggest getting the Kingston Nucleum USB C Hub, 7-In-1 Type-C-Adapter Hub to power the iPad and use the Apple headphone adapter at the same time.<br/><br/>They work perfectly with an iPhone 12 Pro with the Apple lightning to 3.5 mm adapter with built-in DAC.<br/><br/>A tip. If you find the sound too low, check the following:<br/><br/>Settings -&gt; Sound &amp; Haptics -&gt; Headphone Safety<br/><br/>Change / adjust - Reduce Loud Sounds<br/><br/>I suggest getting Apple's official headphone adapter/dongles. They are rated the best for a super low price.<br/><br/>They also work perfectly with a NAD - D 3020 v2 Hybrid Digital Integrated Amplifier. For that, I use an Airport Express 2nd generation to play Apple Music (aux input) or the digital input of the NAD for compact discs.<br/><br/>For this inexpensive price, you will hear what would typically cost a few thousand dollars to achieve with electrostatic headphones or several thousand for a decently amplified stereo speaker system. Well worth it.</span>

<span>You can find a million reviews for these phones and they are very well thought of  and they mostly met my expectation. I'll give a few places there they did not.<br/><br/>(of course just my opinion, we all have a different 'sound' we are looking for, but I found them a bit... neutral. No matter how I EQ them I find them a bit "cold", lacking a certain musical quality. I dunno, maybe it takes $300 to get that, or a DAC maybe.<br/><br/>The bass is not quite as tight/resolving as I wanted. I could not quite distinguish between the bass guitar and kick drum that way I was hoping. But I had high hopes and maybe too high for $150 cans.<br/><br/>I have had very high-end speakers in the past and got used to details like hearing the tip of the drumstick on the cymbals, the click of a tongue on certain sung notes, etc. These don't quite reach that point. But you can hear David Gilmour shifting in his seat and clearing his throat before starting the intro on Wish You Were Here.<br/><br/>Comfort is OK, I don't have much to compare them to but the first night I wore them for 3 hours. But the pads feel hard and the headband bugs me. I can see myself shopping for different pads.<br/><br/>My system is modest compared to some. I'm running this off a PC with about as good a DAC chip as you can get on a motherboard. An external DAC might be in my future. Maybe I can find one that sweetens them up a bit.<br/><br/>I like them, but just can't quite give them 5 stars and might keep shopping.</span>

<span>Great detailed, wide sound stage for gaming. I could hear details in VALORANT and Apex Legends that I could have never gotten before with my previous A40s. I was able to also pinpoint how far of a distance that footsteps were coming from. Amazing for picking up on subtle footsteps/audio that could give you the edge in-game. The headphones are really comfortable and I could wear them for hours. They're good for music listening, but don't expect a lot of bass. It sounds very basic in terms of music listening and that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Some nitpicking, the earcups have already begun to build up dust. The headphones do take a couple of days to break in because they are a little tight. The included wire is very long.</span>

<span>A little background on my experiences with studio headphones in general: I've really struggled to find a good pair over the years that accomplished exactly what I was looking for and gave me a good way to monitor mixes when I don't have access to full studio monitors (which is, most of the time.) I've tried both closed-backed and open-backed variants of reference headphones and had mixed results with pretty much every one of them. These however, I haven't found a single issue with in terms of sound and results. They're extremely natural to my ears, and are very crisp and clear. To me, they don't have this huge, binaural-eseque soundstage to them compared to some other open-backed sets I've tried, but their openness does lend to everything sounding more clear and separate compared to the closed sets I've used, for sure. And I'd venture to say they are the most comfortable variant of open back sets I've worn as well. Ever since I purchased these I've noticed subtle mixing choice differences I have made in recent projects that have really elevated how consistent my tracks sound on various devices, in my experience - if I can get something to sound good on these, they'll sound great on everything else I try, and phenomenal on my listening sets of choice! I wouldn't say these offer anything spicy in terms of sound, or lean at all in the "fun" side of things. But for analytical use? These rock.</span>

                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>First, let me start out by saying I'm a professional audio engineer with a focus on Jazz, Classical, Pop, and Americana genres. I own/use the following headphones currently: AKG K701, Audeze Sine, Audio Technica ATH-M50x, Beyerdynamic DT 1350-80, Beyerdynamic DT 880 Pro (250 Ohm), SONY MDR-V6, and a few more lower-end consumer grade headphones.<br/><br/>Second, let me share something important in the HD 660S owner manual that some might miss:<br/>"These open dynamic headphones have been designed for home use with high-quality audio systems". Such system components display the "Hi-Res Audio Certificate" on their packaging and are thus meant to reproduce high quality audio recordings made to the "Hi-Res" standard.<br/><br/>Numerous blind studies confirm trained listeners agree that what makes a headphone sound "good" is neutral, natural, balanced sound that replicates the audio quality of good speakers playing well recorded music in a good home acoustic environment. The HD 660S has been so designed; but if you want to hear how great the HD 660S sounds, you need to play music that already sounds great.<br/><br/>So for those having no particular interest in superior high fidelity audio reproduction, then money spent on the HD 660S will be wasted. The HD 660S while somewhat forgiving, will make very obvious every flaw in music that has not been well recorded; and the lower quality of lossy audio formats such as MP3 will not allow the HD 660S to shine. The Audio Technica ATH-M50x, the SONY MDR-V6 or MDR-7506, or other cans of comparable quality, will get you a much better bang for your buck.<br/><br/>For the rest, in my estimation, the HD 660S design goal has been well achieved, such that my HD 660S reproduces closely the dynamics, fidelity, sound stage and imaging of my studio reference speaker system. The HD 660S is a very musical headphone and worth considering for its intended purpose: enjoying Hi-Res music to the point one can get completely immersed in the experience.<br/><br/>I would not use the HD 660S for tracking, mixing, or mastering. However, it *is* my go-to headphone for  enjoying the results while relaxing in my easy chair at home. One more comment in that regard: Some reviewers are disappointed with the "width of the sound stage", accustomed as they are to the exaggerated sound stage width of most open-ended headphones. The HD 660S replicates the sound stage of my stereo masters *as they sound over my studio reference speaker system*.<br/><br/>Sennheiser has in fact achieved with the HD 660S *not* the unnaturally wide stereo spread of most open headphones, but instead the "neutral, natural, balanced sound of good speakers in a good room". That, IMO, is a great accomplishment, and one of the main reasons I'm a big fan of the HD 660S.<br/><br/>Writing this review in the Fall of 2022, I've not experienced any of the very few negatives some have mentioned in prior reviews of the HD 660S, and would purchase this headphone again in a New York minute.<br/><br/>BTW, ignore the audiofools: there's no such thing as headphone "burn-in". Enjoy these right out of the box by giving your psycho-acoustic system (i.e. your ear/brain interaction) the opportunity to adjust as soon as possible to the audio signature of these very fine headphones.</span>

<span>So off the bat, they sound better than the HiFiMan Sundaras i have but only in the low end.  Planars sound great on vocals/high hats, so maybe a bit better in the highs.  They are 150 ohm so kind of easy to drive BUT youd benefit from a dedicated headphone amp.  the actual feel is very nice and comfy, weight is very light overall good build.  kinda a mix between true open and closed back headphones, its odd at first but nice after awhile.  EDIT:  I have been listening to them for about 2 hrs, they are super light and comfortable compared to the other headphones and headsets i have used.... Happy buyer</span>

<span>I loved this headphone. It sounds amazing and I highly recommend if you can tolerate wearing a headphone. I can't myself, I get a headache 10 minutes after wearing it because headphones push on my facial pressure points. That is partly why I returned, because it was just painful to wear. The clamp force is high but loosens up after a couple days. Overall I don't think I'm going back to headphones anytime soon. I'll stick to IEMs. Recently got the moondrop blessing 2s and love them. Definitely different sound from these warmer boys though.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I own around 8-10 different headphones and earphones that range in brands, price, styles, etc...  I’ve tried Klipsch, Bose, Sennheiser, V-Moda, Audio Technica, Beats, Apple, AKG, Samsung, Sony, Skullcandy, etc...  I do enjoy listening to a large variety of music and I do like premium headphones but I am in no way an audiophile. The brand I always seem to go back to for more has always been Sennheiser.  It all started with the HD558 open back headphones. It was my first experience with open back headphones and I really liked it. I found myself hearing so much more than I had ever heard in my favorite music.  Now after using the HD650 for a while I feel I can offer a decent impression for someone considering purchasing these headphones.<br/><br/>While many people will surely disagree(audiophiles I’m looking at you), you can technically drive these headphones with your phone or mobile music device.  It does have 300ohm impedance, but the sensitivity of the drivers is such that you can get enough volume to “hear” music. It is almost loud enough and I imagine for many people it will be enough. However, the HD650 may as well be a cheaper pair of headphones if all you’re going to do is plug these into your phones because the listening experience takes off when these cans are driven properly.  Whereas you can hear music through them on your phone you can actually listen to music when you have these driven.<br/><br/>My setup is fairly simple and somewhat low end still. In fact I imagine that I haven’t had a chance to fully appreciate my headphones yet. I am using the Schiit Fulla 2 DAC/Amp and plugging in my iPhone 7 Plus with the camera adapter through usb into the Fulla 2 and have listened to lower quality music files, Apple Music 256kbps, and Tidal lossless 1.4Mbps files.  While there are a lot of entry level DAC/Amp or Amp solutions I think the Fulla 2 is excellent in its quality, power, ease of use, and options.<br/><br/>The build quality is good and while it does use a lot of plastic it feels durable. What I really appreciate about Sennheiser and specifically these headphones is that while everything feels durable it is also all replaceable. You can replace the headband, the head cushion, the ear pads, the cable, and you can order it all from Sennheiser directly.  I like owning a product that I know I can maintain and I appreciate not having to send it to Sennheiser to fix every little thing.  I have owned a lot of headphones that use cheap plastic that cracks, pleather that flakes and peels, and rubber coatings that wear and get sticky. Then you call the companies and they either don’t make the parts at all or used to but don’t anymore because they don’t make the product any longer.  The design of the HD650 has been used from at least the HD600 and longer than most millennials have been alive. In fact they kept the tried an true design for their new HD660s so they’ll have parts for years to come.<br/><br/>Speaking of tried and true, they are that way because for one the design has worked acoustically for them but also the design has led to one of the most comfortable headphones ever made. They can take an adjustment period and for people with big heads like myself, I recommend fully extending the earpieces and flexing the metal band the relax the clamp force on your head. There are instructions online for how to do this safely or you could always stretch them out over a box to loosen them up a bit.  If the clamp is too strong or not either way you’ll end up with a very nice and comfortable fit.  The ear pads are a nice velour material and the foam is appropriately soft and spongy. The head cushion is a very silky material and the foam is very soft.  I really like that it has a small gap right at the top of your head to prevent that from being a hot spot of discomfort right on all of the blood flow in that area.  After working my set in I find them easily wearable for hours and hours without discomfort although the ear pads can get a little warm if you’re in a hot area.  After putting them on your head I recommend just tweaking the rotation of the ear cups until they feel right.<br/><br/>In my experience with these headphones I have been very impressed.  In fact it may be the most enjoyable music listening experience I’ve ever had. The HD650 is described as the most colorful in the HD6 line but compared to most of the headphones I have used before, it comes off as pretty neutral and well balanced. The mids are a bit forward compared to the lows and highs but it feels natural to my ears. It is a warmer, darker, slower, and thicker experience but it’s smooth and rich. I know it sounds like I’m describing eating dark chocolate but it is a bit like Dark chocolate for your ears.  The level of detail is great and it is just very easy on the ears. I enjoy listening to music on my HD650’s and I actually do so more than anything else so far.  If you’re looking for bass, I’d keep looking. These are open back headphones and while the bass is very nice and well defined they are not gonna punch you in the face like a bass head would like.<br/><br/>Comparing them to my HD700’s I would recommend getting these because while the HD700 is maybe technically a better headphone it is sometimes too analytical and the spikes in the high end can make listening to them a little tiring. If you just wanted to listen to classical music then the HD700’s are amazing and better than the HD650 in my opinion but overall the HD650’s feel more versatile and more enjoyable for all types of music.<br/><br/>If I had to make any complaints about the HD650 it would have to be the wire connections and the stiffness of the adjustment on the ear cups. The headphones were nice enough to put the Braille letter L on the left side but the cable has no such thing.  The connection point is a two prong termination that has to go a specific way on a specific side. They do have a small raised L and R respectively on each side and the raised letters are meant to face outward. The problem is seeing and feeling the raised letters to tell which is which. If you’re in good light and have decent vision then it is easy enough to see. However if lighting isn’t great and/or your vision isn’t perfect you’ll have a hard time telling which is which. To make matters worse you can potentially damage the cable termination or the headphones if you plug them in incorrectly.  The three bump Braille “L” on the left side would have been an easy solution to this, especially considering they’ve already used it on the ear cups.<br/><br/>Another issue is the stiffness of the adjustment band. Sizing these headphones perfectly is required for maximum comfort. You ideally want both sides to be more or less equal lengths and to the right position so the headband isn’t putting too much pressure on your head and the ear cups sit well over your ears.  Trying to adjust the headband is a bit of an inconvenience because to start with it is stiff and hard to pull out one click at a time. The best way to do this is to grab the metal portion towards the ear cup and pull away from the headband. Also there are no markers indicating the adjustment so you can’t be quite sure if both sides are equal or in the right spot until you put them on and then resize them.  Another minor gripe but something that seems easy to address.<br/><br/>I feel the HD650 is around or just past entry level audiophile headphones.  If you’re looking to upgrade to these from something like a HD558 or 598 I would say go to an audio store that can provide you with a burned in set of headphones with good quality DAC/Amp and the listen to the kind of music you like. Considering these really only come alive with the right equipment driving them I think testing these out beforehand is the only way to go.  Also, if you really do like these headphones the HD6XX from Massdrop have come around 3 times or so for $200. They are basically the HD650 rebranded and selling for $200 and I think that’s a steal.<br/><br/>The HD650’s might change the way you feel about music. They might allow you to explore songs you’ve heard hundreds of times but in ways you never knew.  They also may not do any of that for you, but if you appreciate music I think you just might appreciate these too.</span>

<span>I’ve been using Audio Technica AT50’s since 2004 and MSR7’s for about 3 years. The 50’s are great for bass heavy music and the MSR7’s are (I thought) great for detailed acoustic, vocal, percussion and other 1khz and higher audio.<br/>I don’t know what my expectations were with the Sennheiser HD650’s. All I knew for sure is that I have read countless reviews and articles where they are used as reference headphones. Whether as the focus of the written material, or in passing as the gear reviewers use when auditing or reviewing other equipment and music/media. The HD650’s are universally accepted as a reference headphone.<br/>So over the last several years they have sparked my curiosity.<br/>I ordered them and received them within 2 days. I am a classic rock aficionado, and have my own set of reference tracks that I use when trying out new equipment in my home studio. I’ve played guitar and drums for 35 years (not expertly, but passable?). I have a nice Roland Kit, a couple of nice Fender and Mesa Boogie Tube Amps, Fractal Axe FX III guitar processor and run it all through various digital I/O and microphones into an RME UFX+ Audio Interface.<br/>The RME interface has an excellent ADC/DAC configuration, with a very clean sound at the headphone jack that matches the outputs on the other analog outputs on the interface, but is also amplified. They didn’t cut corners.<br/>All of this is to say that I have great reference hardware, knowledge of good source media, and the headphone amplifier and DAC section from my audio interface surpasses most high end audio AVR’s.<br/>Now generally, like most folks these days, I listen to rather low end compressed MP3 audio. It’s readily available and doesn’t take up storage space.<br/>As storage space has become less expensive, I’ve started to record and save my audio in the highest quality format my interface will allow. Generally that is a minimum of 16bit 320kbps compressed, or as high as 24bit 96khz, with maximum playback capability of 24 bit/192kHz. All the detail. The things that you didn't even know were buried in the mix. The 3 second harmonies, the double tracks that are barely distinguishable, the finite exquisite breath of the vocalist as they prepare for the next line of the verse. All laid out in stunning depth and form. Strange things that you didn’t even know were in the mix, that add depth and character to the music, that are underneath the main harmony and melody of the music. Things that only an explorative and creative genius of a producer would include in the mix and final mastering. Dark Side of the Moon takes on a new landscape. Steely Dan Aja highlights perfection of studio recording at it's finest. You can get lost for hours in old recordings and hear the things that you didn't even know made the music that you enjoy so enjoyable.<br/>Edit: As an aside, I need to include something extra ordinary. Something that I would presume that maybe 1/10th of 1% of folks who actually purchased these headphones would pursue. An opportunity to audit the HD650’s via an RME ADI-2 PRO FS BE AD/DA.<br/>The RME unit is in the Top 3, or arguably is the best, mastering quality DAC and by far the best headphone amp that money can buy. Period. No exceptions. Numbers don’t lie and RME’s audio engineering team is among the finest on the planet and can back them up. The UFX+, as I mentioned, is no slouch at all. They perform tremendously in the studio, and the quality of the gear DOES shine through during headphone testing. Blissful.<br/>But….<br/>When you listen to anything through the ADI-2, it’s clichéd to say, but it really is not just “next level”. It’s the very “top level”.<br/>That said. You have now reached a level of clarity that some people might actually find slightly uncomfortable believe it or not. The lack of distortion is unfamiliar and with poorly recorded or or media compressed with a bad encoder, the flaws shine. Too much so occasionally.<br/>On the other hand. With good to exceptional media, and phones like the HD650 that can convey expertly produced media, you will be sitting at the control desk, where the mastering engineer was sitting. Hearing everything (and maybe more) than they were hearing as they put the final touches on the song or album. I have yet to audition what are considered to be be “better” headphones. Maybe someday I’ll get a chance to A/B the HD650’s against another premium set. Until then I remain blown away by the Sennheisers.  If you’re here trying to decide if you should pull the trigger on these. It is simply a resounding YES!<br/>Keep in mind that these are 300 Ohm headphones. They will require more power than your iPhone, or Android phone to fully appreciate their capabilities. You do not need a $1000 headphone amp to enjoy them. Their are several headphone amps/Pro level DAC’s from $200 to several thousand dollars that will all do the job. I highly recommend that you are able to drive them with an output of greater than 100mW minimum. Just my opinion. Do what you will. But you will not be able drive any kind of realistic bass below that threshold. Yes, people around you will hear them. But you are buying open back headphones for a reason. Your listening enjoyment. Find a place to disappear and enjoy them and turn it up.<br/>I highly recommend these headphones. They are simply incredible.</span>

<span>Oh, one of the most beloved and well known headphones in the audiophile community. These were my 'dream' headphone since the beginning of my audiophile journey. One I never thought I'd ever buy back then. It's also one of the few headphones that after I learned what sonic quality I wanted in a headphone, didn't think I would personally like. If I had bought them months or years ago, I'm not sure I would've liked them. I tend to prefer a bright, aggressive, bass and treble-centric headphone. The HD650 is known to be the opposite. Dark/warm, relaxed, and smooth, with dulled treble response. You can see why I was very adamant about not ever giving these a chance.<br/><br/>It wasn't until recently that I wanted to venture out and look for something a little different from my normal preferences. An alternative that I'd use whenever I wanted to sit back, and enjoy a soothing sound, with forward mids/vocals that I could watch my TV shows, movies, anime with. Ironically, my secondary can is considerably more expensive than my main can (DT990s) at the time. Lol, Head-fi logic. Well, I went and took the plunge, hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I thought I would hate them. Really. It was an experiment that would cost me, but one I needed to do at some point, as the HD650 was always that ONE headphone I was always curious about (more than any other).<br/><br/>So what happened? Did I like them? Hate them? To my surprise... I loved them for music, movies, TV, and anime, and liked but wasn't thrilled by them for gaming. Let's get into the sound.<br/><br/>Bass: The lows. Well, this is surprising. They are actually pretty bassy. Not DT990 bassy, but they have a nice, full, bassy sound. I'd say it's between the DT880 and 990 in presence. It's a warm bass, with medium speed. Pretty much ideal for all-rounder headphones with good bass that would please those that like balance and a fun signature. The bass quantity is enjoyable for all crowds, unless you're a pure neutral-head or pure bass-head. I didn't find myself wanting more bass, though they do roll off in the sub-bass, which is typical of most dynamic headphones, something the HE-400 has no problems with.<br/><br/>If I could score the bass, it'd be; Quantity: 7.5, Quality: 8. Just really pleasing bass all around.<br/><br/>Mids: This is the star of the show. And when I say star... I mean, it is absolutely one of the best interpretation of mids/vocals I have EVER heard on any headphone...EVER. I'm usually fine with mid recession as I tend to prefer bass and treble emphasis, but MAN... once I heard the HD650... it made me see mids in a whole new light. The vocals are so sweet, so upfront, so rich, so haunting! Based on mids alone, I recommend this headphone to ANYONE looking for a headphone that does vocals some amazing justice. The only other headphone that provides really sweet mids that I've heard is the Audio Technica ESW9, but the ESW9 is a closed on ear, with a considerably smaller soundstage, and overly smooth treble, and stuffy sound signature in comparison. The ESW9 is good, but not HD650 good.<br/><br/>The HD598 also has very forward mids, but I felt the lean bass, and thinner sound, made the mids sound unnaturally forward and shouty. The warmth and fullness of the HD650 basically destroyed any chance the HD598 had in a direct comparison. There was no competition. The HD650's mids demolish the HD598's in tone, realism, and richness. The HE400 is often compared to the HD650, and despite my preference for the HE400, the HD650 is clearly the king of mids here. The HE400 has great, INTEGRATED mids, that don't sound pushed back or forward with a realistic tone. That being said, the HD650's forward mids are special. The HD650 clearly wins here. As far as Q701 and HD650's mids, the HD650 wins again. The Q701 has forward mids, but they aren't nearly as full sounding, or as rich.<br/><br/>Long story shot, the mids are godly. If I had to score them: Quantity: 10, Quality: 10. That is perfection, because that's how I feel about the HD650's mids.<br/><br/>Treble: Oh the treble. This is single-handedly the ONLY reason I have put off getting the HD650 for so long. If you read about the HD650, the treble will always be discussed and debated on. Are they too smooth, rolled off, undetailed... veiled? This is a debate that will never end on Head-fi. As a fan of treble sparkle and some emphasis, I was absolutely mortified about hearing what people said of the HD650's smooth, laid back, dull, treble.<br/><br/>So how did they sound to me? Surprisingly, I REALLY liked the treble! I didn't LOVE it. I still do prefer some more sparkle, but as the relaxing alternative to my typical treble emphasized headphones, I didn't find the treble overly smooth or dull on the HD650. Trust me, when your main can is the DT990 which is known for it's SUPER treble emphasis, and compare it directly to the much more reserved and rolled off treble of the HD650, you would tend to notice a huge difference. In all honestly, I really thought the treble on the HD650s was right where it should be for the type of headphone that the HD650 is. Without that treble, I think the HD650 wouldn't sound as rich and 'creamy' as they do. Would I use the HD650s as my ONLY headphone? To be frank, no. They performed well in absolutely everything except genres that desired an aggressive signature. Stuff like metal, and EDM just didn't have the energy on the HD650s. So no, they aren't the perfect all rounders. However, through some vocal dependent tracks, and stuff like movies, TV, and most non-music needs (even gaming), the HD650s are indeed in a very good place. Unfortunately, I tend to listen to EDM and metal more than anything, so the HD650 lost a few points.<br/><br/>To score the treble; Quality: 7, Quantity: 7. If the treble is boosted by a bit, these could be what I'd consider very natural to neutral with a slight emphasis towards bass. I think they'd be less rich overall though, so I personally wouldn't want to touch what makes the HD650 what they are.<br/><br/>Amping: I have the HD650 paired up with the Audio-GD SA-31 which is much more powerful than pretty much any amp most of you use, or would use, so I'm not exactly sure how they'd sound with less power, but I personally felt that they aren't as hard to drive as people make them out to be. They need considerably less power than the DT990/600, and possibly even the DT990/250. I'd say they'd need about as much as the DT990/32 for at LEAST volume level. We know power =/= volume, but it helps. To be clear: they do not need a lot to be driven LOUDLY. I tested them with the Mixamp only, and they can be driven off it loud enough. I didn't test it enough to see how well they're actually driven, but they sounded good. They may be a little thinner sounding, which could actually be a good thing for gaming, as it makes pinpointing sounds a bit easier than the very rich, thick signature the HD650s have with the SA-31.<br/><br/>Okay, so how did they perform for gaming?<br/><br/>---START GAMER SECTION---<br/><br/>Soundstage: I haven't gotten to the specifics of gaming with the HD650s yet, but I'll mention the soundstage first. With and without extra amping the Mixamp, I felt the HD650's soundstage to be medium sized. Not big, and not little. However, I didn't find them to be stellar in terms of depth, so the sense of space for gaming, wasn't as good as I would have hoped. I was always expecting the HD650 to not be the greatest pairing for Dolby Headphone, and my fears were slightly warranted. The front/back depth isn't great. Let's get that out of the way. The width is good, but not close to being the best. The DT990 destroys the HD650 in both depth and width. So how's the air within the soundstage? Well, the problem with the HD650, is that it's a very full sounding headphone. Thick, warm tone tends to make the soundstage seems less airy and smaller. This is one of those times where a thinner/leaner sounding headphone has the advantage, like the AD700/HD598/K701. The HD650 isn't STUFFY like say the ESW9, but that rich tonality doesn't help gamers.<br/><br/>Positioning: Positioning and soundstage tend to go hand in hand, so if the soundstage isn't great, the positional cues will suffer. How did the HD650 fare positional-wise? Well, they were good. Not great, and could obviously be better, but they do their job. I could play something like Black Ops without any problems, though having used headphones much better for soundstage/positioning, I could tell they lacked a bit. I'd put the HD650 just ever so slightly above the DT880 positional wise, but they aren't that much better.<br/><br/>Clarity: You need clarity for soundwhoring in competitive gaming. Despite the laid back treble, I found the natural tone of the HD650 to be very detailed. The forward mids came off very clean and clear, and I felt I didn't miss any sounds. I've heard better overall (even the 990's are better for soundwhoring). The problem is that the HD650 is a very thick sounding headphone. Basically, the issues I explained in the soundstage section is what hurts clarity for gaming purposes.<br/><br/>---END GAMER SECTION---<br/><br/>Comfort: I mentioned that Sennheiser likes their clamp. The HD201, HD280 Pro (!), PC360, and HD598 all have some form of clamp. The HD650 is no different. They do clamp a bit more than I'd personally like, but it's a minor gripe overall. I find the HD650 to be very comfortable overall, and over extending the arms a little, to wear the HD650 slightly loose alleviates the clamp a bit. I've felt better, but not much better. The velours are great. Not too firm, and not too soft. The cups are huge and will fit ears very comfortably. I like the oval shape, which makes them easier to use while laying down compared to circular cups.<br/><br/>Value: The Sennheiser HD650 is a considerably expensive headphone. If your main purpose for getting a headphone is gaming, there are considerably better options for less. If pure audio fidelity, and non-gaming purposes is your main purpose, the HD650 is incredibly hard to beat. Their sound signature is just stellar for most things, save for a few genres, and they're competent for gaming, just not stellar. I personally can't justify owning both the HD650 and HE-400, so I stuck with the HE-400 which is a more energetic, and better equipped for gaming use.<br/><br/>Final Impressions: The HD650 has a very special place in my heart. It took years to finally take the plunge, but I'm VERY glad I did. They have quickly become one of my very favorite headphones. Though their gaming performance isn't as stellar as I would have hoped, it's better than I expected. I absolutely love the HD650 overall, and they have made me see the importance of mids, if even for just non-gaming, non-music use. Movies and TV shows are made for the HD650. Their incredible tonality, rich/full sound, perfect mids are an absolute blessing. Treble is definitely it's weakest aspect of sound, but they aren't veiled, just...reserved.<br/><br/>For gamers looking for all-rounders, these do put up a fight. They're better than the vast majority of headphones I mentioned on this guide in terms of audio fidelity, but in raw performance for gaming, they're outclassed by others costing considerably less.</span>

<span>These headphones are slightly colored.  Most people prefer that, but if you're using them for studio monitors, you won't find better than the HD800's.  Trust me.  But for everyday use, these can't be beat for dynamic open headphones.  Combine them with a full tube amp and I highly doubt you'll find a better "stuck on an island the rest of your life" headphones.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  After having owned these for over a year now, let me elaborate on my thoughts on these INCREDIBLE headphones.<br/><br/>Value:  This is tough.  If you like open headphones, and love lower model Sennheisers, like the HD595, HD598, HD600, etc, then you'll surely LOVE these.  I owned a pair of HD595's for several years before I accidentally broken them due to the stupid long cable.  These sound very similar to those, only with a slightly darker top end, and much much much better bass.  And, they're just better overall, in soundstage, speed, bass depth, bass extension, resolution, etc.  Some people just don't like the open headphone sound.  That's perfectly fine, and if that's the case, you probably won't like these.  But if you've owned open headphones and like the open airy spacious natural sound... then you'll ADORE these.<br/><br/>Comfort:  4.5 stars.  They're Sennheisers.  Pretty much all Sennheisers are extremely comfortable.  They're light.  The pads are usually comfortable soft velour.  They usually have medium light to light clamping force.  They have really large oval cups that fit the largest of ears.  If comfort is high on your list, these might fit your bill.<br/><br/>Value: 5 stars.  These headphones bat outside their league.  Outside their price range.  I've seem MANY people go from these headphones to new headphones in the 4 digit range, then go back to these.  LOTS OF TIMES.  It's for a good reason.  These headphones are going to be a future classic.  You can quote me on that.  If you've never owned "audiophile" quality headphones before, this price might seem high, but trust me, to upgrade from these, you usually have to buy Planar Magnetic headphones like the Audeze LCD-2, LCD-3, LCD-X headphones or similar.  Those are all $1500+.  If you've never had good quality headphones, these might not be your best first choice.  Not because they don't sound good.  These sound incredible.  It's because these headphones are 300 ohms and require a pretty decent amp.  They scale well with good hardware upstream, so a good DAC helps a lot too.  (and source audio, you'll want 320 KB/s mp3's and FLAC if possible)<br/><br/>Soundstage: 5 stars.  Do these have the best soundstage ever?  No.  HD800's have that title.  Why do I give it 5 stars then?  Because these headphones have a better soundstage than 98% of the headphones out there.<br/><br/>Resolution:  4.5 stars.  Great, but not to the level of Planar/Ortho headphones.  If you've never heard $1500+ ortho headphones, you won't even know what I'm talking about anyways.<br/><br/>Treble: 4.5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars, but the treble on these headphones are rolled a tiny bit.  You may hear them described as "dark" or "veiled".  That's relative.  To me, I prefer darker headphones anyways.  Bright headphones are fatiguing and give me a headache after a few minutes.  These roll the highs just enough to make them easy to listen to for hours, yet leave enough treble there to leave the top end nice and sharp.  No sparkle.  Sparkle bad.  (depends on who you ask lol)<br/><br/>Mids:  5 stars.  Sennheisers' bread and butter.  These have incredible mids.  Through tube amps, or hybrid tube amps, the mids are lush.  Liquidy.  Warm.  Female vocals will give you the chills.  The warmth of the mids on these cans will make you smile in aural ecstacy.<br/><br/>Bass:  4.5 stars.  These headphones are probably the only headphones from Sennheiser with really good bass.  The bass isn't as tight or deep as on Ortho headphones, but for open cans, it's incredibly impressive.  I give the bottom end a tiny tiny bit of EQ to boost the bass, but other than that, it's the best bass I've heard from open headphones yet.  The punch is pretty solid.  I'd rate punch 3.5 stars.  Bass extension is really good.  I'd rate it 4 stars.  Overall though, I give it 4.5 stars considering these are open headphones.<br/><br/>Scalability:  5 stars.  These cans scale like crazy.  Upgrade your DAC: you'll heard the difference.  Upgrade your amp: you'll hear a difference.  Upgrade your tubes: you'll hear a difference.  These headphones just keep giving.<br/><br/>I used to own HD595's.  They blew my mind.  The bass on those sucked.  Worse than Bose Tri-Ports, which were aweful themselves in bass.  But you know what?  I loved the lush mids so much, as well as the airy soundstage, I didn't care about the lack of bass.  Those headphones broke later (my fault, not theirs), and I was forced to upgrade.  These headphones are an improvement in every way.  (other than weight and clamping force, the HD595 was lighter in weight and clamped lighter, but not by a whole lot)<br/><br/>What's the best amp to drive these?  EASY.  Bottlehead Crack with Speedball upgrade.  They're hands down the best amp for these headphones.  Ask around.  You'll get the same answer.  Any full tube amp will do.  Even the hybrids sound good, but for some reason, these headphones come alive with a full tube amp like the Crack.<br/><br/>DAC?  Any external DAC will suffice.  The $99 one from Schiit is fine.  Bifrost Uber even better if you can afford it.  O2.  Lots of choices.  Just don't drive these from the on-board audio on your motherboard.  That's just wrong.<br/><br/>The best part about these headphones?  The headphones two to three times its price are only a marginal 10-20% better, if that.  And those usually require another 4 digits worth of gear to be worth getting.  These headphones are at that bang for buck price point where you really start to get diminishing returns when you try to upgrade from these.<br/><br/>Pros:  Lots.  Value.  Soundstage.  Lush mids.  Soft highs for long listening session with no fatigue.  Awesome bass, in headphones that have open airy sound.  Removable cable.  Scalability.<br/><br/>Cons:  ONLY con: You will have one HELL of a time finding headphones to upgrade to from these headphones.  Be warned!  These are so awesome for their price that you'll have a really hard time finding headphones you'll like better.  That's not really a con though, but since I can't think of any cons, I'll list it as one anyways!<br/><br/>If you've heard other open headphones and like the huge soundstage and open sound, and want to upgrade: GET THESE.  Don't even hesitate.  You'll be blown away.  Just make sure you have good source files (320 mp3's or FLAC) and a full tube amp like the Bottlehead Crack amp.  Thank me later!  Enjoy!</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.<br/><br/>I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.<br/><br/>CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.<br/><br/>APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.<br/><br/>PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would "let go". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.<br/><br/>RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.<br/><br/>CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.<br/><br/>CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is "clear hands-free calling", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.<br/><br/>Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.<br/><br/>I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.</span>

<span>A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program.  While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review.  Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Excellent noise cancelling<br/>Very good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)<br/>Battery life<br/>Excellent Bluetooth range<br/>Automatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency mode<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Touch controls are simply awful!<br/>Dual Bluetooth device support<br/>Constant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabled<br/>Voice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make.  A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.<br/>Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left ear<br/>Somewhat complex set up process<br/><br/>Overall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones.  The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent.  This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available.  The Bluetooth range is also exceptional.  Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone.  They have long battery life and charge quickly.  They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful.  There are many other features with a range of benefit.<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush.  However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.)  If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.<br/><br/>They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses.  They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.<br/><br/>Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:<br/>These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously.  The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time.  I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones.  I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app.  I was then able to play music from the MacBook.  I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something.  It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky.  Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch.  Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device.  Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.<br/>This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where.  This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35.  I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.<br/><br/>While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device.  It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device.  Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2.  The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.<br/><br/>I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app.  This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices.  It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices.  You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device.  You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected.  You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.<br/><br/>Bluetooth range is excellent.  It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another.  The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent.  For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones.  Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.<br/>The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable.  Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response.  More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep.  You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight.  The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies.  Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified.  Male and female vocals sound good and natural.<br/>The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment.  These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment.  High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.<br/>The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences.  I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.<br/><br/>If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones.  They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier.  That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.<br/><br/>I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth.  The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth.  I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones.  They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing.  The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound.  Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good.  Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.<br/><br/>I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet.  This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS.  You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it.  You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play.  I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better.  To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.<br/><br/>I did try the DSEE Extreme feature.  This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content.  I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music.  It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better.  At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies.  It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable.  This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used.  The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.<br/><br/>The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal.  I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup.  I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic.  There was some front/rear placement depth.  It was interesting to play with for a while.  What I found though is that it just sounded strange.  I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical.  Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable.  It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above.  Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks.  Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical.  By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.<br/><br/>Phone calls<br/>The audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations.  With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls.  They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.<br/>Phone call microphone:<br/>Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with.  Most people said I sounded fine.  I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone.  They said I sounded “far away.”  On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.<br/>They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19.  This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.<br/><br/>Noise cancellation<br/>These are fantastic at noise cancellation.  I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35.  At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call.  My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these.  I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these.  I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring!  Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music.  I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane.  Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice.  They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.<br/><br/>One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls).  These definitely exceed the rated battery life.  With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use.  I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge.  Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable.  On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic.  It is more than enough though.  It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use.  Almost any other use it should be more than enough.  I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.<br/><br/>Charging:<br/>These charge with a USB-C connector.  They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply.  They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it).  You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging.  I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity.  They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power.  In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick.  It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.<br/><br/>User interface:<br/>This is the worst aspect of these headphones.  The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable.  Simple buttons would have been much better.  Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing.  You try and turn the volume down and track changes.  To be fair, they do have a volume control.  The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.<br/>Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right.  Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume.  Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume.  Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that.  I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times.  Simple buttons would have been SO much better.<br/><br/>Voice assistant:<br/>Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device.  It will then want to pair with Bluetooth.  I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt.  If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.<br/><br/>Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app).  You could just say Alexa and it worked.  You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would.  It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app.  The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though.  This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content.  It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume.  Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems.  This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better.  It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google).  I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.<br/><br/>The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying.  At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard.  This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode.  While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode.  This mostly works.  In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it.  Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode.  There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet.  You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while.  Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.<br/><br/>Another feature is adaptive sound control.  This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions.  This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc.  I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.<br/><br/>As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying.  It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions.  This can be disabled in the app.  If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well.  (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!)<br/><br/> App<br/><br/>The app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones.  Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual.  The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more.  You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears.  I went through the whole process.<br/>There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK.  It can be a bit confusing.<br/><br/>The app does provide a lot of control and information.  It shows battery level, and the current codec in use.  This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details.  Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.<br/><br/>Case, accessories<br/>A nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35.  It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.<br/><br/>A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system.  The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling.  It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.<br/><br/>While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.<br/><br/>Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.</span>

<span>UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out.  Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars.  Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about).  I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.<br/><br/>I now believe the "bluetooth stopping for no reason" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better.  As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes.  As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off.  I've wound up disabling this feature.<br/><br/>Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable.  The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)<br/><br/>UPDATED:  I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy.  Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all).  At other times, there are skips or pops.  While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.<br/><br/>These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose.  They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file.  When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world.  I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing.  A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have.  It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a "feature" of ANC headphones.<br/><br/>2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used.  The ear pieces in particular are outstanding.  I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable.  However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable.  These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on.  I can comfortably wear these for hours.<br/><br/>3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.<br/><br/>4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well.  I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either).  The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music.  Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue.  I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file.  I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it.  It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason.  For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.<br/><br/>2) Phone call quality -- meh.  Some calls are good, others not so much.  Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality.  However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc.  Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better.  I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.<br/><br/>3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on.  However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.).  It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.<br/><br/>Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones.  However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have.  I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.</span>

<span>I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.<br/>Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in  the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.<br/>Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.<br/>I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.</span>

<span>I purchased this for games, movies and general use. I will be using these at home for my PC pretty much exclusively.<br/><br/>I did a lot of research to find what would be the best headphone at the best price for my own personal needs, and this is what I wound up picking.<br/><br/>These are open backed headphones which have a large soundstage and accurate sound. They will leak noise because that's what open backs do, but in return they will give you a great soundstage and will also sound more like speakers rather than sound being pumped directly into your head. This was important to me because I plan on using them for long sessions, and did now want fatigue from listening. I also, although I'm not certain if it's medically true, believe that it's better for your hearing not to have that sound pumped right into your head and isolated. You still shouldn't put sound too high, but this helps.<br/><br/>The headphones are extremely comfortable. It doesn't really say it, but they are indeed circumaural, they fit around your ears. Your ears might very slightly touch the outer edge of the pads, but you won't really notice it and it's a good fit.<br/><br/>The fit is also in general very nice. You don't need to adjust anything, you just put it on and it automatically rests on your head. Now you may have read that these will fall off your head if you have a smaller head. I do not think this is the case if you simply aren't gyrating and slamming your head around. If you are someone that spazzes around while having headphones on, I can see that it might fall off. I would assume lots of headphones would fall off. When I run with headphones on they fall off too, even if they're very secure regularly. However when I am listening I generally make only small regular motions with my head, and it's secure. It's comfortable. There isn't pressure, but for me that's a positive. I don't like pressure on my head, because then it starts to hurt after awhile and you certainly are very aware you're wearing headphones. With the way it is, while you know they're there, you don't feel them there really and can just be immersed in whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The materials on the earpads are very nice. They're soft cloth, not leather or pleather or anything like that.<br/><br/>To me comfort and ease of putting it on were huge factors, as well as the soundstage and accuracy. If they are for you as well, maybe these will be good for you too.<br/><br/>There are multiple models for this. They are fairly similar, pretty much identical outside of max input power. Now depending on your level of audiophileness, that may or may not matter to you. For me these are more than good enough. I doubt I will ever try the higher end models, as I don't even actually know what input power would do. The impedence is low enough that I don't need an amp, in fact it's very similar to any other cheap headphone in terms of power needed to drive it. Except the quality is much higher.<br/><br/>The sound quality will really strike you. I have equalizer inputs and surround sound off of my soundcard. With proper equalizer you can pretty much adjust any headphone to what you want really. However, these are so accurate and already so good I don't see the point for that. Also surround side is completely unnecessary with this soundstage, it's really just a gimmick that I'd suggest passing on for headphones in general. With the proper speaker setup surround sound can be great, but for mere headphones it's kind of a gimmick.<br/><br/>These drivers are very large. 53mm, and for a good price too. I was amazed at the sounds I was catching that I wasn't before. With proper equalizer and cheap headphones you can get to a certain level, but I noticed this went beyond that, and fiddling around it was clear where the sound was artificial with the equalizer and surround sound. I could hear signs swinging in games, windmills turning. I'd look around and I'd see these things that I don't remember noticing before like that.<br/><br/>I know after a week or so the sound will be even better. But right now I'm already happy and think it's 5 star.<br/><br/>Now a quick note on sound cards: if you have a mid or upper tier motherboard you probably have about as good sound or better than a cheap dedicated soundcard. The Asus Xonar is a popular card at a cheap price, but I don't think you need to actually get it if your onboard is good. My onboard can actually sample higher than that card and besides that the specs are quite similar. Chances are yours are too if you care enough to pay this much for a good pair of headphones.<br/><br/>If you need a mic you're better off getting a stand alone mic too. But since I play single player games there's really no need.<br/><br/>Mostly I wanted something comfortable, with accurate sound and good soundstage, that wouldn't get too hot because they're closed. These might get a little hot after very long periods of time, but it's going to be less than pretty much anything other than the ear bud or internal around the ear type styles, which are all going to have much worse sound and also will be putting sound directly into your ears which I don't really like, and certainly won't give you much in the way of soundstage as a result.<br/><br/>I don't write too many reviews, but I liked this so much that I really wanted to, and I hope it helps someone else out. If the price drops even more I'd say to really jump on it. I got mine for just under $100 and am happy with that price. The other set that I was really considering were the AKG K 240 Studios at around $68. But those are semi-open, with higher impedance and much smaller drivers. I think these are better for my purposes. Also, I got mine from Beach Camera, who were super quick on shipping. Whereas when I tried getting the AKGs the seller hadn't shipped it for several days. In retrospect I am very happy they lagged so much, as these are far better and worth the extra money.</span>

<span>I admit, I am an absolute sound snob. I am so picky it isn't funny. But these headphones... they check ALL the boxes.<br/><br/>I knew I would be happy, Audio-Technica is such a respected name, but it goes beyond my expectations.<br/><br/>To start, I don't go for bass heavy headphones. I prefer studio quality to hear all the sounds. Heavy bass cancels out some of the mid range.  So if your expecting ground shaking (or, I guess, ear shaking) bass, never buy studio quality. I simply use an equalizer on my computer to pop up the bass a bit (you should always use an equalizer or you miss out) . I listen to a lot of darkwave and aggrotech so you need a bit of bass on that.<br/><br/>However, I did my first test in Valheim. My computer decided it was going to be a pain and not use my headset mic, regardless of what I told it, instead use my MXL condenser. Well, it is a good mic. Instead of fighting it, I just pushed my headset mic out of the way... and it would just get in my way (mostly sit right in front of my left eye), so it was time for headphones instead of a headset. My headset has some pretty good surround sound, so I knew what to listen for. But wow! Just on the game loading screen I was hearing sound effects I never noticed before.<br/><br/>Once in game I was hearing what I can only think is the way the sound team intended the game to sound like. Footsteps sounded real now, birds I never noticed before, all the little chirps, wind, chittering of the MOBs, all totally more realistic.<br/><br/>Tested the surround by hunting for some deer, and it exceeded expectations there too. I could accurately track the sounds of deer: right rear, left front, dead left, moving, I could hear the sounds moving naturally (which my headset did too, but the cans have a more vibrant sound).<br/><br/>Then I loaded Spotify and put on a song by a band I've seen many times live. Now that.. was gorgeous as well. It sounded natural, like I was there live, hearing all the nuance and all the sound.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the huge bass isn't there, that's okay with me. The bass is very solid, not disappointing me at all. The human voice should not sound flat, and I was totally hearing all the range in the vocals. Just like being there. But the bass is good. I really love the bass I'm getting out of it (listening to some darkwave right now, so it's really got bass, I'm not disappointed).<br/><br/>As for noise cancelling.... well, they are open back. That being said, I actually didn't hear much outside noise while playing music. And while in game, I pretended not to so to drive my kids crazy (it's a mother's job to driver her kids crazy). But yes, in game I heard outside noise pretty well. In my situation, though, it's not a big deal. I have a fairly quiet office space where I play, and well, when I'm in the living room, being able to hear outside noises is usually good, I'm down there to be around the fam, after all.<br/><br/>But if you want no outside noise, I recommend a closed back headphone. As I mentioned, when the music was on, I wasn't hearing much, even when the kids started talking. They could hear my music pretty well, but I couldn't really hear them.<br/><br/>The comfort level... that too is great. I was hesitant of the way the headband was designed. However, it fits great. I got spoiled by self adjusting headbands as it always seems I can't find the right click on other ones. This one self adjusted perfectly.<br/><br/>At first it felt loose, I shook my head quite a bit and they stayed perfectly in place. The ear pieces fit well over the ear, I put on my glasses and they felt great with the glasses on. The "looseness" really seems to help with not feeling squished while wearing glasses. I've been wearing them for a couple hours now (once headphones on, its hard to get them off of me) and it's not hot and sticky, still feel comfortable, and I don't feel like my head is in a vice. I could totally wear them all day if I had to.<br/><br/>I would totally, 100%, recommend these headphones for anyone who want quality sound. Of course I'm a person who thinks ear buds should be outlawed on the basis they deliver inferior sound (I told you I am sound snob).<br/><br/>They are ..<br/><br/>worth.<br/><br/>every.<br/><br/>penny.<br/><br/>Totally worth it.</span>

<span>These headphones are fantastic. I got the 500x model. This might be kinda long so buckle up..<br/><br/>First off,<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>The one thing I heard the most in nearly every single review and unboxing etc etc I could find about these (which was a lot, I researched for a few days) is that the bass is very low so "if you're a bass head they're not for you". This is simply not true. The bass is just fine. It is very slightly light on the lowest end of the spectrum but that's only because of the open back letting out some of the rumble. I have an equalizer program (DFX) where I even set the high mids and full high ends up for FPS games (which is why I got these) and the bass is still very present. So yeah myth busted I guess.<br/><br/>Next thing to note is how crystal clear the sound is. It's a beautiful thing. Music sounds so crisp and all the layers are presented very very well. The highs can be a little too high if there are any shrill noises in what you're listening to. But they never distort in any of the tests I've given them.<br/><br/>Next, positional audio or the sound stage is absolutely legendary. Like I said I bought these primarily to use for combat games (CS:GO, Fortnite, Paladins, etc) where hearing the enemy is very important. These headphones are practically cheating. The direction of sound is so clear that I get confused by all the clearly separate directions the sounds come from. It will take getting used to hearing the in game sounds as if my ears are actually in the game. In fact it's so realistic that I have turned my head to look at the sound multiple times now because I thought someone was actually behind me. It's fantastic.<br/><br/>As for sound leakage, it's not too bad. If whatever you're listening to is very loud it can be heard from a few feet away. But any medium volume stuff can only be heard if somone is directly next to you. High tones tend to be louder in general for these and those always carry more than low tones so usually that is all people will hear if they're nearby. And then for sound coming into the headphones, when nothing is playing you can hear your surroundings just as well as you could wearing no headphones at all. When something is playing though it almost entirely blocks outside noise. It would have to be pretty dang loud around you to be able to drown out whatever you're listening to. But still I probably wouldn't recommend these as ideal for public transportation, classrooms, libraries, or other quiet environments where it might bother people.<br/><br/>Build Quality/Comfort:<br/><br/>These are extremely comfortable. The cloth covered memory foam pads are great. They still get a little warm even though they are so breathable but my head runs pretty hot so I don't think the pads are to blame.<br/>The clamping force is very minimal and fairly evenly distributed around the pads. Slightly more pressure on the bottom under the ear which isn't exactly pleasant but it's not bad enough to care. Just worth noting. Also people said that their ears pressed against the drivers inside the cups and they must have huge ears because mine are pretty big and there's plenty of space in there for me. I have a fairly large head so the pads create a good seal around my ears. I dunno if a smaller noggin would have any issues with the cups laying flush since they don't move at all. I know one of the reviewers I saw had a complaint about that.<br/>Oh and the wings or head flap adjuster things. I was worried a bit that I might hate them and it almost prevented me from even trying them out. But they're awesome. Not having pressure on the crown of my head feels so nice. These things are easy to almost forget about.<br/><br/>As for the build quality, they seem very sturdy. Not like super rugged but they could take a few drops and some bending and twisting and still be perfectly fine. The top bars creak a little if you squeeze them together but never during normal use. The metal mesh looks cool to me and feels nice and sturdy. The cord is thick and feels like it would take a few years worth of normal bending to put a kink in it, and it doesn't feel like normal rubber wire wraps that will fray. It does want to stay coiled a bit like it comes in the package but stretching it into a straight line for a few hours has already made a difference.<br/><br/>The only part that feels moderately weak are the flaps. But they're not flimsy. Just weaker than the rest of the headphones.<br/><br/>So, yeah. I think that's all the stuff.<br/><br/>TL:DR they're effin amazing. Buy them!</span>

<span>The sound decent for what they are. Very flat response - would be perfect to hook up to something with an adjustable EQ and then tune to your liking.<br/><br/>Few issues I noticed right away:<br/><br/>-They constantly feel like they're sliding off your head, the winglet things are simply not strong enough and need the rubber band mod to make them sit on your head right. I shouldn't have to 'mod' my headphones that are brand new so they sit on my head - you'd think sitting right on your head would be the first priority when designing a set of headphones.<br/><br/>-Sony MDR's 1/8" to 1/4" adapter for example screws on the end of the headphone wire. This one just slides on - so if you ever take it out from the amp or whatever it's plugged into, the headphones come out of the adapter. Not a big deal but annoying and feels cheap.<br/><br/>-The wire coiling is a huge pain. Not sure why you need 10 ft of wire for a desk set of headphones. Seems very excessive and the fact it constantly wants to coil back up on itself is super annoying. They should have went with a heavier outer casing so it lays straight and flat and made the cord detachable from the headphones themselves so you could add a shorter one.<br/><br/>Overall for the price, not worth it in my opinion.</span>

<span>This is a fantastic value. Just, that's all. These aren't bass-head cans, and they're open-backed, so they don't really isolate. They also don't have a mounted microphone. That's where the cons end; the rest is pure, liquid pros.<br/><br/>Versus Sony MDR-V6, these go lower, and they have a much better lows-to-mids transition. They don't have the same presence notch, so they might technically be more fatiguing, but the comfort factor is way better, so you'd never know. The highs aren't as forward, but most of the V6's energy is concentrated in a wideband hump in the 9-11khz area, whereas these have a mostly linear and unmodified sound. Hands down, these are more pleasant for string or woodwind production. Further, that unaffected sound and the open structure make the soundstage way more coherent. I can't use the V6's for positional audio, but these are some of the best I've ever used in that regard.<br/><br/>Versus the Beyerdynamic DT770 and the very similar-sounding HyperX Cloud, these are...probably smoother? I think it just comes down to a win on the soundstage, but given that the HyperX Cloud's mic is utter trash, I think it would come down to whether soundstage is more important than isolation.<br/><br/>Versus the Beyerdynamic DT880 headphones, these don't have the same shelved high-end, and they render the bottom-end very differently, but both have otherwise extremely linear presentation with very few narrowband artifacts. They're both great, but where the DT880's are quite clinical, these are somehow every bit as refined, but still intensely fun.<br/><br/>Versus the Denon D1001 or Creative Aurvana Live! headphones, the main difference is that the noise floor from distortion is lower with these, and the highs are more extended. With music, these just have more energy and get me head-bobbing and foot-tapping in no time at all, where the CAL's are much more dependent on what you're playing. For the life of me, I can't put my finger on why that is. Both are fantastic for everything from orchestral music to e-sports, but I'm reaching for these first, every time.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend these headphones.</span>

<span>First of all, who decides that an amazing set of planar headphones should be sold for $108.... That is ridiculous. Hifidelity headphones for budget price. I've owned a series of closed back dynamic cans including Sennheiser, Meze and AKM and have enjoyed the sound, but I needed a new set after an unfortunate accident damaged my Sennheisers.. I've always gone with closed back as I like the sound isolation and not everyone wants to hear my music... Currently I have my music setup on my PC in my office, where I have a Fiio K5 Pro feeding my headphones and I listen to lossless Flacs using MusicBee and the WASAPI exclusive driver, Spotify and Amazon Music. Even without any EQ, these headphones were comfortable and the sound sublime. Especially the mids and treble. Soundstage was well defined and vocals sounded better than ever. Adele, Lana Del Ray shone, as did Radiohead.... I have Peace and Equalizer installed on my PC and found some Parametric EQ settings online via Crinkle and Audio science Review that boosted the bass a little. These headphones do need a decent dac/amp to bring out the best in them, my K5Pro was up to the task, but I have a Topping DX3 Pro + that I can't wait to install and listen with. Much recommended.</span>

<span>The HIFIMAN HE400se  planar headphones have a smooth, detailed, and spacious sound.  The bass was stronger  than I expected for an open back design. According to Audio Science Review measurements, the 400se has low distortion at loud volumes.<br/><br/>The padded headband became more comfortable after a while. The HE400se headphones are a little heavy, but fit well on my head.<br/><br/>The magnets are easy to touch by poking a finger into the ear cup. So the magnets could be broken by careless or rough handling. These headphones should not be  thrown around.<br/><br/>Part of the foam in the shipping box  is shaped  so that it can be used as a headphone stand.  It even has a black weighted plastic bottom to keep it upright with the headphones on the stand. This is very convenient for people with no headphone stand. A thoughtful touch by Hifiman.<br/><br/>A headphone amplifier or a receiver  is needed to get good  loud undistorted sound, and to make the HE400se “come alive”. When connected to my cell phones, these headphones did not play loudly enough, nor did they have good dynamics.  With a headphone amp or receiver, they can play loud enough (undistorted) to hurt my ears. I did not try them with a balanced headphone amp.<br/><br/>The first day I had them, the headphones sounded clear and clean, but bland and dull. I set them aside and played a bass heavy CD on auto repeat through them for a day.<br/>The next time I used them, they sounded better in every way: bass, imaging, dynamics, treble, midrange, spaciousness.<br/><br/>The impedance listed on the box is 32 ohms, not 25 ohms as advertised on HiFi Man’s site, or as measured at various audio sites. A black  headphone cord, and a headphone plug adapter were included.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for people who want to try planar headphones without breaking the bank.</span>

<span>So as a preface I've had a pair of Sennheiser HD 598s for about 4 or 5 years now. They've been superb and my favorite pair of headphones to date. I could wear them all day without any ear fatigue and could even forget I was wearing them while also sounding amazing. I guess I was spoiled. I started reading about Planar headphones and how amazing they are for electronic music which is the main genre I listen to. So I figured I'd give these a go after a ton of research on which pair to start with.<br/><br/>The sound is AMAZING, seriously for $109 these are absolutely amazing. You DO need an amp however I've been using one from Fiio for the past year and it's worked great with these. What they say about Planars is absolutely true.<br/><br/>The #1 issue I have with these headphones is the comfort. Unfortunately, it ended up being the exact situation I was dreading. I got so used to my lightweight comfy Sennheiser's that the moment I put these on it was a significant difference in ear pressure and weight. More than I was ready for. The reality is most headphones will have this same amount of pressure I'm sure. Unfortunately within an hour my ears start to hurt from the pressure and I have to take them off.<br/><br/>I'm actually looking into either a more comfortable planar headphone now or simply an upgrade to my 598 Senns. If you're used to heavier headphones or non-Sennheiser line of headphones you probably won't notice anything unusual about these.<br/><br/>I put off making this review for several months as I really love these headphones and it's sad that the weight/comfort on my ears is the deal breaker.</span>

<span>I just got these, and am breaking them in. They sounds excellent. I have a pair of ported headphones that are also very good, but I want to start doing some home production. I love both sets of headphones. These do not cancel or block noise at all, but I didn't buy them for that. My ported headphones have a little more punch on the bottom end (very little), but these have a wider sound stage. I'm really enjoying them.</span>

<span>If you're reading this, you're deep enough into the audio hobby to have realized an important psychological truth about yourself: you can't leave well enough alone. Neither can I. That's why, even after falling head over heels in love with the sound of the HD650, I ordered the HD600. I just had to know.<br/><br/>The verdict? It's almost too close to call, but for my preferences the 650 is the better headphone. The two have been compared to death online, but if you have the capacity to think for yourself, audio review sites and forums are usually an unsavory if fascinating combination of shilling, self-justification, and "follow the leader" parroting of received opinions. Many self-proclaimed "audiophiles" have strong opinions about equipment they've never actually heard, which I can't accept.<br/><br/>Given that, I decided the only way to compare the two headphones honestly was to listen to both myself for hours, going back and forth on a wide variety of recordings. The difference between a good recording and a bad recording dwarfs the difference between lossy and lossless, and the HD600 (more so than the HD650) may end up changing your taste in music because it makes good recordings sound SO GOOD and bad recordings sound SO BAD. In other words, it reveals the "truth" of the recording, and sometimes the truth hurts—it's really hard to enjoy The Killers now.<br/><br/>The fact is that the 600 and 650 are ultimately more alike than different, and the popular insistence that they sound completely different has more to do with what Freud called "the narcissism of small differences" than the headphones themselves. If you Google some variation on "HD650 vs HD600," you'll hear over and over that the 650 is "bassier" or "darker." Not really. There's actually very little difference across this parameter. Piano music presents an exception, but this is rarely what people think of as a bassy genre.<br/><br/>There are two significant differences. The first is soundstage. The HD650's soundstage is wider, but that doesn't mean it can make a cramped recording sound airy. The HD600's soundstage is more intimate; there's less space between left and right channels, but it's not a huge difference, and I could see people preferring (or at least not minding) the HD600's tighter spacing.<br/><br/>The most striking difference between the two headphones is in what I'd call "smoothness." The best analogy I can think of comes from digital photography. As an image sensor increases its sensitivity, it also increases its noise because you can't amplify a signal without also amplifying noise. There are two rival philosophies for dealing with noise: leave it as "grain" or smooth it out. Grain has its devotees, and the advantage of grain is that it preserves fine detail. The disadvantage is that past a certain point it becomes a distraction. The advantage of smoothness, meanwhile, is that it looks superficially nicer. The disadvantage is that when you look closely you won't see all the fine details. Like all things, it's a continuum of compromise. The 600 is the headphone to get if you value detail at the cost of an occasionally unpleasant grainy and even metallic quality to the sound. The 650 is the one to get if you care more about music than sound and don't care if your headphones sand down the sharp edges of your music a bit.<br/><br/>Going back and forth between the two, it quickly becomes clear that the 650 is the stronger all-around performer: it sounds nicer on more recordings and across more genres. The 600, meanwhile, is the champion of a particular niche: good recordings with lots of micro detail. Want to be able to count how many times the skin of a drum reverberates after it's struck? Want to hear such fine vocal gradations you'll know how a singer felt during recording? The 600 is for you.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: at its best, the 600 produces the most astonishingly detailed sound I've ever heard. Unfortunately, at its worst it sounds grainy, jumbled, and not particularly musical. I'm sorry to report that piano music sounds particularly off on the 600: low frequencies disappear and take the fullness of the keys with them. Vocals can sound oddly recessed, even far away. In general, the 600 seems to fare better with female vocals than male ones, and with strings over pianos. It's absolutely glorious for acoustic guitar, but then, so is the 650.<br/><br/>The 650's great advantage lies in its ability to bring out vocals like a spotlight. They stand out so clearly and powerfully from the instrumentation that you'll feel like you're hearing your favorite songs for the first time. The effect is really quite incredible: it's like there's a special sonic space reserved for vocals and unpolluted by other sounds. Based on Sennheiser's own specs, the 650 has lower distortion than the 600 and it's clearly a more refined driver unit. Whatever the technical reason, the 650's background is pitch black: sounds rise from and fall back into a sea of silence. Be forewarned: a well-recorded vocal track through the 650 may bring tears to your eyes, and that's why I kept the 650 and returned the 600.<br/><br/>Finally, let's talk about measurements. While there's a valid SUBJECTIVE argument for preferring the sound of the 600, the 650 has an objectively better driver that improves on its predecessor in every way: higher sensitivity, lower distortion, and better power handling. Here are the figures straight from Sennheiser's manuals, which you can find for yourself on the product pages for both headphones at bhphotovideo[dot]com. The terminology used isn't consistent from one manual to the other, but the parameters in question are the same. I've noted these variations where applicable.<br/><br/>Frequency response (-10db): 12 – 38,000 Hz (HD600), 10 – 39,500 Hz (HD650)<br/>Impedance: 300 ohms (same for both)<br/>Sensitivity/"Loudness" (Sennheiser also calls this "Sound pressure level at 1 kHz"): 97 dB (HD600), 103 dB (HD650)<br/>Load rating (Sennheiser also calls this "Long-term max. input power"): 0.2W aka 200mW (HD600), 500mW (HD650)<br/>THD (Total Harmonic Distortion): ≤0.1% (HD600), ≤0.05% (HD650)<br/><br/>In short, the HD650 will get louder than the 600 because it has higher sensitivity at the same resistance. The fact that it can handle almost twice as much INPUT power is a positive, not a negative; if you turned a decent amp ALL THE WAY UP with the HD600 connected, you could damage or even destroy the drivers. The 650 has enough headroom for more than twice as much input power, but there's little point in driving your headphones loud enough for permanent hearing loss.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, headphone preference, like any preference, is primarily subjective, and I can't seriously imagine anyone being unhappy with the HD600.</span>

<span>Well this is the first real pair of headphones I've owned. Previously I wasn't too serious about headphones and had purchased some SOL Republics over-the-ear headphones. There was a customer service guy that recommended them among others like Skullcandy and other sub $150 non-audiophile headphones saying that "All these headphones are pretty good, just don't buy Beats or your just paying for the name". Well at the time I thought the Republics sounded good for music like Rage Against the Machine. But after I purchased some quality NHT Superzero bookshelf speakers for my office I noticed that the headphones were completely missing the higher frequencies. Boosting the Highs on an Equalizer helped but it still had a muddy sound to them. So I decided to try some more serious higher priced headphones and see what happens.<br/><br/>I already had a decent Peachtree Audio Integrated Amp/DAC with headphone amp to test them. So as I sat in front of my bookshelf speakers, I plugged them into the headphone amp. I wasn't that blown away thinking the HD 600s sounded slightly better than my other headphones but certainly not worth the extra $250 Dollars. However I noticed right away details in music that I'd never noticed before. Like clearly hearing the squeaking chair of a producer at the beginning of The WHO's 'Don't get Fooled Again'.  I let them keep playing music and burn themselves in while I did something else for about 4 hours. When I came back the bass response was noticeably better and sound was slightly improved but still felt it was not that great of an improvement.<br/><br/>Then I had an major facepalm moment when I realized I was comparing these headphones to my bookshelf speakers. They sounded so much like them that I didn't even realize that I had the memory of the bookshelves sound in my head and not the other headphones. I had been listening allot to my main speakers and not much to my other headphones so that must be why. Needless to say I was pretty impressed when I realized my error. Kind of hate to admit that they sound a little better than my main speakers. The bookshelfs have a slightly darker sound and have a somewhat boosted bass by default that I don't care for. So then I compared the actual other headphones and as I expected muddy bass, missing highs and mediocre at best sound. The other headphones also had a very noticeable noise floor. On the HD 600s there is absolutely NONE! Any background noise you notice through the headphones is either due to the recording itself or the source your hooking it up to. This is great because you can listen to music at low volumes and still clearly hear the music without fuzzy noise interfering.<br/><br/>I was surprised also that my phone was even able to drive these headphones to a respectable medium volume. I expected the volume to be allot lower considering the 300 Ohms rating. However you need an amp to get loud enough to get the full details of the music and the phones amp doesn't have the separation of instruments like my home headphone amp. The Bass and Treble don't fully emerge until you get to a loud volume and I mean LOUD. These can be fatiguing if you want to hear all the details of the music because I find the volume has to be fairly loud to reach 100% potential. Just listen to these at medium volumes compared to loud volumes and you will be shocked. There is a sweet-spot with these headphones for sure. It is great for easy listening 'classical' music, acoustic with vocals, symphonies, light rock etc. People saying the bass is too light on these have got to be kidding. I use a Peachtree Audio Amp and DAC which is considered to be neutral by many and at louds volumes it can be a little overbearing on bass-heavy songs. At low volumes I'd agree that the bass is a little light but so is the treble. It has a good punch without taking over and overwhelming your ears. Not flat in anyway whatsoever.<br/><br/>Definitely find Open headphones to sound better without the boxed-in sound of a closed headphone. Yes you can't use them in a quiet room when someone is sitting next to you. But what I like is that you can still somewhat hear what is going on around you if you are not listening at too loud of a volume. I'm a mail carrier that cases mail for hours a day before delivering. So at work I can listen to music at low volumes without someone having to throw something at me to get my attention. I much prefer it to closed headphones in situations like these where you are not concerned about critically listening and just want some background music to pass the time. These headphones are also very comfortable and feels like your wearing earmuffs when they are on. My entire ear fits in the headphone without touching the sides of the enclosure, so rarely get soar even after several hours of use. They clamp a bit tight on your head at first but eventually get stretched out and loosen up over time.<br/><br/>Not a fan of the headphone cable that comes with the HD600. After only one week of use and trying to be careful, the headphone signal was cutting out when I flexed the cable. The cable is so thin and cheap and not deserving of these high quality cans. I'm not one of those people that says cable will change the audio quality but it has to at least be built well enough to withstand normal wear and tear. I upgraded to the HD 650 cables which are almost twice as thick and much more respectable. Although it has a 1/4" plug instead of the 3.5mm plug from the original cable, so you need an adapter for that too. Be prepared to spend about another $25 dollars though on top of your $400 dollar investment(Much cheaper now I guess). I almost wanted to dock a star just for the poor cable but ultimately it's one speedbump in a field of positives.<br/><br/>These headphones can't match the physical feeling of sound vibrations hitting your body from big speakers. However the big speakers can't match the detail the HD 600s give you being right next to your ears either. Unlike stereo systems with subwoofers needing room equalization and treatment, all you have to do it is put these headphones on for near perfect sound. There is no boominess to the bass and it's very fast and tight. The bass is not overpowering and just right. While the Highs sound very crisp and detailed. Vocals are very lifelike. Nora Jones has never sounded better.<br/><br/>Last but not least these are made in Ireland! Good to know there are still SOME electronics not being made in China. I have no problem paying a premium for something that wasn't made in a sweatshop. You don't need to spend $1,000+ dollars on an Amp/Dac to reach these phones potential despite what people tell you. I use an Objective2Amp/DAC Combo that has really low distortion and doesn't color the sound like many Amps Do and it sounds brilliant. I'm not someone that buys new headphones every month and was looking for a great headphone that would last several years. Hopefully this is the one. :)<br/><br/>1/26 Update: I've discovered after listening to these for awhile that I was actually pushing these headphones too loud. Apparently these headphones are EQed for a more distant mellower sound instead of being loud and in-your-face like headphones I was used to in the past. The bass was not strong until I had the volume very loud and then the treble was almost ear piercing. But if I listen at more moderate volumes the bass is not quite as present but blends with with treble perfectly. There seems to be a pretty small window for the volume not being loud enough, to being to loud to get a full clear sound. The default flat settings are not really suited for music with electric guitar as it sounds a bit faint. It's more for relaxed listening when your browsing webpages on your computer or just listening to musical instruments/vocals. Which is Ok with me but thought I'd tell others so they should know what to expect. You'll just need to change Equalizer settings if you want a more aggressive neutral sound. I like switching between the default warm sound and more bright sound depending on the music.</span>

<span>These are pretty darn wonderful, but you should know, this is my first upgrade from earbud style headphones and that is my only point of comparison. But if you are tiptoeing into the more expensive world of fancier headphones to get your audio thrills like me, I can say that I am super happy with this investment.<br/><br/>My setup: I paired these headphones with DragonFly Cobalt DAC, Amazon Music Hi Def streaming, iPhone to USB camera adapter. The first night I had these, I couldn't stop listening to music, because it was like I was hearing my favorite albums for the first time again. Constant goosebumps and visceral sensations from just being able to hear more in the music and with a stronger sense of space and left/right channel movement. The improvement in my listening experience is pretty astounding. I am not exaggerating to say at one point, listening to Jacob Collier, I heard some glorious new pretty that made me think I was feeling a tear welling up in my eye!<br/><br/>I ordered this pair specifically because the price was greatly reduced on a pair of  headphones listed as "used, like new", which arrived with a "refurbished" sticker on the box.  The excellent deal pretty much was the decision maker on my model choice and alleviated some of the financial pain of also needing to invest in a headphone DAC/Amp + iPhone adapter to make this step up in my listening experience. I agree that the "like new" assessment was accurate. I see no signs of wear or any signs that these are not just new headphones. My only complaint is that they smell like they've been sprayed with some kind of household deodorizer (I won't mention brand names, but you find it in the cleaning aisle, not in the perfume aisle - so it's not someone's personal fragrance left behind on the soft materials). It's pretty much the exact same smell that all of amazon's blue and white bubble plastic shipping bags smell like. I don't know where the fragrance fairies are in this process -at sennheiser refurbishing?, at the shipping warehouses? in my local delivery trucks?  but I spent my first hour listening with utmost joy to my music while also fighting off an asthma attack from the fragrance. That's how good these sound, I was willing to endure asthma to keep listening, but really, can the fragrance fairies stop this business? You might literally kill someone. For what I saved on these headphones though, I'm willing to air them out for a few weeks. And other than the asthma, they are otherwise very comfortable to wear , even after a day of wearing a mask that rubs the back of my ears raw. I've felt teddy bears less soft than these ear cushions. They're pretty sweet.<br/><br/>If you are like me and new to this process, I do want to confirm that open back headphones are truly audible to those around you, even at "save your hearing" volumes. So these are definitely "at home" headphones. Since I was aiming to give myself a tool for inducing happy-brain sensations and deep relaxation after a stressful workday, these suit my needs perfectly. My intention was to use these someplace quiet and private. If you need something for travel, or to drown out outside noises, these aren't going to be well matched to that need. If you want a music goosebumps and can match these with a Hi-Def music source and headphone amp/DAC, then these should make you very happy.</span>

<span>Me likey:<br/>+ Sound quality is great<br/>+ Very comfortable<br/>+ Not gaudy like other sets<br/>+ Super reliable<br/><br/>Me no likey:<br/>- They’re very pricey<br/><br/>Wireless seems like the way to go these days, and maybe it is. But I’m in the position where I don’t have to have a wireless set so, if I don’t need it, I’ll go with the reliability of wired phones any day.<br/><br/>These Sennheisers sound terrific and they work as advertised. I own two sets and never had to worry about them working. No interference whatsoever, and they’re super comfortable to wear. I can wear these for hours on end without discomfort. What’s more, they’re narrow at the ear pieces, so I don’t look like an alien or robot while wearing them.<br/><br/>These headphones come at a price; a hefty one. At the time of this writing, the price has been reduced, but I paid $200 a piece for my sets. Sure, they’re comfortable and they sound great, but that’s still a hefty chunk of change. Only consider paying for these if you’re serious about your audio.</span>

<span>So this year I really wanted to try open back headphones, it was a new world I found out about.  I have bluetooth aukey and anker earbuds, Sony XB900N, HyperX Cloud PS4 (same as pc,xbox versions), and other wired earbuds.  A big plus is I can hear my surroundings with open-back.  This fall I did research, and learned so much about audio that I didn't care for before, but now fascinated.  I'm still not doing the amp thing.  SO I hope this review helps someone.<br/><br/>My ultimate two choices came down to Sennheiser HD599se and Philips X2HR.  These two are so opposite when it comes to available information on the web.  Tons of X2HR forums, reviews, videos, etc., and HD599se not so much.  I wanted an open back headphone, for primarily games, and secondary music and movies.<br/><br/>I almost decided to keep both headphones because it was so hard to choose.  Here are the differences first:<br/>- X2HR too heavy for me. I thought it wouldn't matter.  Very comfy but gets heavy soon after and too noticeable.<br/>- X2HR definitely a boomier bass.  Think deep rich smooth.<br/>- HD599se, super comfy, probably my most comfy headphone.  Ears don't get hot or sweaty like my Sony ANC headphones.  Can wear for hours which others I kind of need to take breaks.<br/><br/>The first headphone I opened was X2HR.  First song was a Paul Taylor's Push to Start.  I almost cried, I don't think I've experienced a wide sound stage before.  Deep bass and open audio experience like no other.  It was like listening to song you knew but in a different way.  Everything sounded great.  Then I listened to more Paul Taylor, then Tobu, Axero, etc.  Yeah there's awesome bass.<br/><br/>Then I couldn't contain myself I had to try the HD599se.  First I was underwhelmed.  Not wide, actually felt almost like closed back headphones.  But I was surprised to hear bass, I was worried it would be non-existent.  There was bass, but not as much as X2HR.  Then I tried both on my PS4 controller.  Both can were loud enough so no issues here.<br/><br/>Two days later I tried them again, but put on the HD599se first and listened.  They were actually really good, not as bad as I remembered.  Then I put on X2HR.  Now I noticed the differences clearer.  In Jazz, the sax was so much more clearer and cleaner.  Guitars sounds beautiful.  So much more balanced, not neutral, but everything is presented well.  X2HR, bass does cloud the instruments, as its more pronounced I feel.<br/><br/>Ultimately, after listening to more music from tobu, axero, gramatik, jack johnson, nora jones, paul taylor, haywyre, etc., and playing ps4, I really wanted to keep both for different purpose.  But in the end I chose one because I knew I'd only use one most of the time.  Here's why I chose the Sennheiser HD599se:<br/><br/>- Audio is very balanced, and easy to listen to most genres.  I like the bass doesn't overwhelm everything.  Everything is pretty much at the same level.  The instruments sounds much clearer.  Its like if the artist wants more bass in the song, you'll definitely notice it.  Its seems more a match for what the artist probably wanted you to hear.<br/>- I don't know if burn-in happened, or what exactly that is, but over time I feel like the bass and audio quality of HD599se got significantly better.  Or maybe its that it sounds better on my PC than phone, and that's when I notice it.<br/>- Hip hop, jazz, blues, etc was a pleasure.  Only edm sounded better on X2hr to me.<br/>- Gaming was much more enjoyable on HD599se. In FPS like call of duty, I could hear my surroundings better and anticipate people around me.  In sports games, I felt like crowd noise was overwhelming on X2hr, such as FIFA.<br/>- Super comfortable and light.<br/>- I spend alot of time already listening to music on the HD599se because its really good.  I appreciate these more and more as I listen to music.  I'm not analyzing, just listening and doing my thing.<br/><br/>In closing, I wish I could keep both.  But won't.  I wish Sennheiser had a little more bass, but its enough.  You will hear the boom, bass hum, the usual, but just not as much or rich as X2HR.  I wish HD599se had wider soundstage, which the X2hr had.  Really like that openness... alot.  If you like lots of bass and don't mind to sacrifice some of the audio of the instruments such as sax, piano, guitar, and ok with heavier headphone, then X2HR is amazing.  I went back and forth so much between the two, and was hard to pick.  I had to really listen alot.  In the end I'm really happy with my decision and awesome black friday price. Maybe next year we'll see what options are available in the market.</span>

<span>I used to be a budding audiophile, learned a lot about sound, music, and the art of equipment. Was a great time in my life, but damn expensive, lol, so that was that. Anyway, I upgraded from cheap earbuds to something more dynamic, and the Sennheiser HD 599 SE gave me that for a fair price. First music I went to was Faure's Requiem (DG), one of my favorites and covers plenty of range and it was.. Beautiful. Next I went for the epic experience of LOTR, Fellowship; and it was exciting to say the least. All the detail was there, I even heard things I don't recall hearing before, the lows were great, firm and punchy, big and smooth where needed. It had no problem bringing everything to life, so I am plenty satisfied with these. Audiophile or not, these are keepers and I will enjoy every minute of them.</span>

<span>Have a noisy spouse? Kids driving you up the wall? Neighbor mowing the lawn at odd hours? Use these to tune them all out!<br/><br/>I have used other brands in the past and even used the Bose Noise canceling earbuds, but the Bose 700 headphones are hands down the best I have ever used. Combine the top quality sound of Bose speakers and the noise cancelation tech, you can retreat into whatever auditory world you want to with no interruptions. The headphones have a firm but comfortable fit and I have worn them for 5+ hours and they never felt too heavy or uncomfortable. The battery life is also very good, I have yet to drain the headphones in my normal usage (5-6 hours) in the office or when traveling.<br/><br/>I only have a couple minor complaints. When I first started using these, I wished the ear cups were bigger as I was not  used to using over the ear headphones vs in ear buds, I have gotten used to this but something to be aware of. Second, I find it annoying to have to collapse the headphones to get it to fit into the provided case. This means you need to readjust them every time you use them. Not a deal breaker, but again, something to be aware of.<br/><br/>Overall I really like these headphones. I feel both the sound quality and noise cancelation is better then other offerings I have tried and even defeat the Bose earbuds.</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>This review is my personal experience using both headphones.  I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones.  Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.<br/><br/>Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic).  Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.<br/><br/>PERSONAL USAGE<br/>I use these headphones primarily for work.  I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development.  I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work.  We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication.  Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.<br/><br/>PERSONAL PREFERENCES<br/>I really don’t like using in the ear headphones.  They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution.  Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me.  This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.<br/><br/>BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEAD<br/>My first pair of headphones were Beats Solo.  I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general.  Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3.  These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.<br/><br/>The functionality is about the same between the two.  With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements.  Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.<br/><br/>• Pros – Lots of colors.  Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity.  Useful when sweating or outdoor use.<br/>• Cons – Quality.  Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution.  Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general.  Feel cheap.<br/><br/>FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3<br/>I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member.  I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted.  I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.<br/><br/>There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality.  Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more.  My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time.  The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.<br/><br/>Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s.  One big thing I would like to see is app integration.  Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature.  Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.<br/><br/>The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two.  I found I used it a couple of times.<br/><br/>Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1.  These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.<br/><br/>• Pros –Very durable and well built.  Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work.  Slept with these on a bus trip.  That was my last memory.  Cheaper than the Bose.  Foldable, smaller case.<br/>• Cons – Less features than the Bose.  Misses on some sweet spots.  Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.<br/><br/>SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700<br/><br/>Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible.  Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t.  The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute.  When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up.  Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.<br/><br/>I’ve only had these for a month.  Was it worth paying up for it?  Honestly, I don’t know yet.  There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.<br/>So based on a month, here’s what I found<br/>• Pros – Seems like better sound quality.  More features and possible mute integration.<br/>• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.<br/><br/>TLDR / OVERALL REVIEW<br/>I won’t even compare the Beats headphones.  Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.<br/>METRICS<br/>• Sound Quality – Bose slightly.  My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be.  Spotify is what I listen to primarily.  The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.<br/>• Mute / Unmute – Bose.  The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.<br/>• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose.  There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10.  Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.<br/>• Microphone – Sony.  Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”.  Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.<br/>• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about.  Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy.  I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony.  It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary.  If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.<br/>• Headset Features, Bose wins.  Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them.  The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.<br/>• Headset Quality – Sony.  I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head.  Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t.  An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.<br/>• In the box – Sony slightly.  Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not.  I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.<br/>• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony.  Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.<br/>• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively.  Bluetooth location hasn’t changed.  Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.<br/>• Companion Application – Bose.  Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.<br/><br/>WINNER – Sony<br/><br/>I’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.<br/>With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone.  Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective.  So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.<br/><br/>Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.<br/><br/>I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again.  Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that.  Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire.  That’s something that’s a no-go for me.  I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement.  Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.<br/><br/>Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.<br/><br/>As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it.  I can see it both ways.  For me, these headphones are for basic usage.  The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade.  Defective products happen.  I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better.  Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.<br/><br/>I hope this helped someone.  Sorry for too much text.</span>

<span>These are my work headphones I use in the office and while traveling. I've had them just under 2 months and I am already looking to spend my own money on new headphones to replace these. The sound is fine, the noise cancelling is really nice, the mic isn't good, but better than my previous set. They fit loose but very comfortable when sitting/standing upright and the ascetic style of this headset is pleasing. However, there are big issues that really degrade the experience.<br/><br/>Because of how the earcups rotate and how you have to place headset on your head, you cannot use these headphones lying down on your back. The ear cups fold off your head and there is not enough resistance or a locking mechanism to hold them in place. I also mentioned that the headset is loose. For me personally, the band does not provide enough compression to sit snug on the head so when you move around, they tend to slip about too easily. As such, the seal of the earpads is tenuous, causing interruptions of the noise cancelling effect simply by turning your head too quick or you jog a bit to catch a train before the doors close.<br/><br/>The touch controls on the headset are not the most responsive, but OK to use from time to time when needed. The buttons are terrible. They give very easily, meaning the slightest touch or even a brush against your coat collar can trigger it. The power button is a single press and not a press-and-hold, which leads to constant accidental power ons and offs when: handling them to put them on/away, while jostling in their case, and when adjusting the cups on your head. A dedicated power switch with some resistance to prevent accidental power on/offs would be much better. The problem here is the headset has an auto off function and you can change the time the headset stays on for. Some might utilize this feature, but I never do; personally, it's a hindrance. The mute button is right next to the power button so reaching for mute is a 70/30 chance you hit the right button. The only way you can tell you are muted/un-muted is a voice notification right when it happens, there are no LED or physical switch orientations to tell you otherwise.<br/><br/>With there being two buttons, one on the left cup and one on the right cup, and having the touch zone on the earcup, you would think the required phone app would allow you a lot of customization...NOPE. You can customize one button and you have two options for it. That's it. The app is terrible and a huge contributor to why I dislike this headset. In order to connect the headset, you have to go through the app and I never know when it's actually connected. It will say I'm connected, but I get no audio and no mic. I can't simply disconnect and reconnect the headset through the phone settings, you have to use the app too. Then the headphones won't go into pairing mode and the app can't find them. It's incredibly annoying, especially when you need to connect for a meeting and the required software is impeding the hardware.<br/><br/>You can name your headphones something to be identifiable in your device settings through the Bose app, which is nice when you have a big list of connected Bluetooth devices. However, you can't rename or give nicknames to the devices you are connected to in the Bose app. Every time I connect to my work computer, it spells out the long random PC name I can't change because my work controls. It also mutes the audio for everything you are connected to whenever the little notification voice pops up, so if something connects/disconnects or I mute my mic, I'm forced out of my conversation for a time, causing me to ask people to repeat themselves. I'm not 100% sure how it operates, but the headset can go into a sleep mode of sorts and a small beep tells you when it reconnects. Well some sites or programs I use cause it to ping almost non-stop which leads me to just turn the headset off.<br/><br/>Also, does the battery last an 8hr workday? Yes. Does it last All-Day (14-16hrs)? Barely. It's about 20% battery for 2-3 hours, which will get worse with time. And you can't charge the headset while using it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's just a frustrating experience that has room for improvement in a future model and some app updates. Once I find something that better suits my needs, I will shift the use of this headset to be only for desk duty, if not placed on a shelf or given to a co-worker.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> Acoustically Invisible Stealth Magnet: Unlike the sound waves created by a conventional magnet, the special shape of Stealth Magnets enables the waves to pass through the magnets without generating interference. HIFIMAN’s advanced magnet design is acoustically transparent, dramatically reducing wave diffraction turbulence that degrades the integrity of the sound waves. The reduced distortion yields pure sonic output that is accurate and full-range.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Nanometer Thickness Diaphragm A breakthrough core technology developed by HIFIMAN and first of its kind in headphone application. Working with this advanced material is extremely challenging yet the successful incorporation of this film as the Arya’s planar driver is the cornerstone of its remarkable sound.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Metal and High-Grade Plastic Construction: HIFIMAN designed the Arya's high-quality metal headband with extra strength and a special high-grade plastic for lightweight comfort and rugged durability. Sturdy 3.5mm User-replaceable Connector Design allows easy cable swapping, giving both maximum durability and enhanced customizability.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Patented “Window Shade” System: Created to meet the need for driver protection and an optimized open-back design. Asymmetrical Ear Cups: Follows the natural shape of the human ear. Cable: The Arya keeps things simple with a single Crystalline Copper cable. Featuring a 6.35mm plug and a jet black woven exterior finish it’s the perfect complement to the sound and sight of the Arya.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Bold Black Aesthetic: With its classic HE1000-style shape combined and striking good looks of its all-black exterior, glossy black headband, and eye-catching matte-black cups and grill, the Arya is a statement of both aesthetic and sonic excellence.  </span></li>

<span>Nice packaging - get the the headphones unpacked and have to spend a 20 minutes getting the glue stringer’s off the phones ear pads et al. So far so good- tonal quality is a-ok for this old man with tin pan ears. Quick swaps between my Baer Dynamic’s, Senhieser’s, and Klipsch tells me I made a good tonal purchase - even for an old audiophile with aged hearing. Fit takes a moment to get used to relative to other headphones but really not an issue unless one has a small hat size head. All in all I believe my purchase is more than justified but rather disappointed with the out of box fit and finish, particularly with the glue stringers. Quite a high price for QC not to catch that bit of nuisance.</span>

<span>….as will the cost of course! But CAUTION: This review is NOT for the Stealth version (update 1/24/22) but the first iteration that I purchased in 2019. I don not believe they are the same however, I would contact HiFiman directly to ascertain same. All that being said, here is my original review:  In terms of sheer OVERALL aural pleasure, I doubt that you will find anything better for the price in this universe at least! Nonetheless, I am concerned with the build quality which is a little shoddy! Don't get me wrong, I've had them since early December 2019 and I AM putting them through their paces. A 50 hour burn-in is MY normal burn in time (I know many people think this is pure hogwash, but I've gone down the "big-rig stereo" and "headphone" setups rabbit holes since I was a young fellow, having been in a "basement-band" {not too many garages in Bushwick, Brooklyn in the late 1960's} ) ….having a good sound system was almost mandatory!<br/>But, I digressed. Suffice to say that over the years I noticed distinct differences in sound quality after a piece of stereo (even moreso with speakers, headphones and tube amplifiers) equipment had been used for a certain amount of time. Now the ARYA sounded great right out of the box, despite the squeaking headband hinge, but once they are on your head and you've sat down and listening to whatever your pleasure is with them (and TRUST me, ALL genres sound immersive, involving and not TOO resolving- wherein, BTW, lay their true talents)….the squeaking, cheaply made hinge sound goes away and like some transcendent magic you are transported to Alice Tully Hall or The Met or an intimate East Grenwich Village music night spot listening to some great improvisational Jazz, some hot Electric Blues or a lush, mellifluous, Mozart symphony!<br/>Now, I have the HiFiman edition X V2 as well and though they are built a TAD better (that's still NOT saying much for Dr. Fang) than the Arya's they don't sound as good. I suppose an extra 4 or 500 dollars gets you that much more quality of music reproduction. BTW,...you will need to upgrade your cable, I have Periapt's that are terminated balanced XLR. I am also using a Monolith Alex Cavalli Liquid Platinum hybrid tube amp., and this combination seems to be extremely well suited towards one another,... with all of my different sets of cans but, even more with the Arya!<br/>Once or IF you can get over the build quality issues (I treat all my equipment, especially headphones as if they are delicately made out of 24k gold),...I don't believe there really is any need for more searching. I've spent far too much already "down this hole"{if my wife really knew, I'd probably be sleeping in the basement....told ya, no garages here in Brooklyn.} and I consider this setup END GAME, if you will but, I caution the build quality issue again. Unless you treat these with kid gloves they will break easily, and see what hifiman service department will charge after the 1 year warranty expires!<br/>To sum up, I have many sets of headphones (many in the four figure category) that I have acquired "on the journey down the hole!" Wish, I had found the chance to grab the ARYA earlier because they seem to be all I listen to lately,...they really do sound that good. Plenty of soundstage,...(not Giants Stadium soundstage width from the 50 yard line) with a very immersive, intimate, and personal sounding experience with just the right amount of bass. BTW,...you get fantastic detail retrieval, NOT resolution sibilance to the point of fingernails on a blackboard . Every instrument is heard (if the recording is good, obviously), there is plenty of room for each instrument to bloom and have a great deal of air however, sonically, my only gripe is that the Arya's (in some cases anyway) seem to put certain vocalists {noticed more with male than female} further in the background than with other sets of cans. BUT, I suppose it is in order to give more space to all the other instrumentation.<br/>I love all genres of music however, in order to give a reference I will use Pink Floyd's "Division Bell" which is a recording I know so well and could rote recite every note and NOW can understand every lyric and sound effect that I never heard or at least never understood before! Even the fly buzzing around in the beginning of the title track has more "prescence" than it ever had before!<br/>So, am I happy with them,....yes! Am I happy that I had to pay $1700 for such delicious sounding, cheaply Chinese made FLOTSAM,.....NO,....Not on your life!<br/>Nonetheless,.....anybody want to buy some of my other well cared for, gently used headphones? I can use the money!<br/>BTW, I do hope this review was HELPFUL?!<br/>UPDATE: 5/27/20.....they sound even better as they have matured! Frankly, (because they do leak more than most open backs), unless someone is in the room and they don't mind listening to what I'm enjoying, they are ALL I use now! They are still incredible for the coin spent!</span>

<span>Returned- due to fitment and style---the sound is not enough to cut it for me.<br/><br/>Hat size 71/4... HIFIMAN needs to offer a different headband size as an option for the Arya, if you have a small head you will look crazy with these on!<br/><br/>“It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it.” Benjamin Franklin<br/><br/>my translation<br/><br/>You can do as much good to provide a product and one bad feature can diminish your product line.<br/><br/>(*****)<br/>Price: *** (I would not pay over $1300 for these and I did not)<br/>Presentation** (Compare to five star Sony or Focal price range)<br/>Accessories -* (Bad audio cable and only one; no replacement ear pads)<br/>Quality *** (Seem well built but the plastic and cheap looking headband does not match the price)<br/>Weight ***( On the heavy side, lighter than LCD-X and Focal)<br/>Comfort **** (DT1990 are the best)<br/>Fitment *(These are not a one size fit all)<br/>Protection ** (No carrying case)<br/>Sources ***** (PC Gaming, Mobile, DAC, AMP)<br/>Balance ***** (no sound advantage)<br/>Unbalance ***** (no sound advantage)<br/>Sound***** (Away- full- surrounding, not up in your face)<br/>Burn in (N/A, they may get better overtime )<br/><br/>My dislike, these are huge in size, to the point where the sound is hard to justify me keeping them. With that being said the sound is incredible. I had the Sundara and returned them the same day due to the fitment and the sound did not meet my expectations. When I ordered the Arya I already had bias on HIFIMAN products. So I took a chance on Arya and was blown away to say the least about the sound.<br/><br/>When they are on my head it does not "sound" like a single note or sound would come out, until it does...... and WOW.<br/><br/>They have a very transparent sound, everything can be heard from both sides of the earcups, nothing is enclosed. You would think this would have an effect on bass and mid....nope. This joker punches.<br/><br/>I returned HD800s/HD8XX....as there was no comparison, whoever gave the HD800 series the crown must have hearing problems. HD800s are very thin sounding without boost. The fitment of the HD800s are horrible, comfortable but horrible and the sound does not excuse them to be kept.<br/><br/>I kept the HD650 just for sport, there is no comparison as well. Other than that the fitment is perfect against the HD800, Arya and Z1R.<br/><br/>Here is the problem...if you pay $800~$1500+ for headphones and then you are told you need to pay another $400-$2000 more to unlock the potential of the headphones, for bass, mid or terrible via DAC or AMP. I recommend you return them ASAP. The juice is not worth the squeeze<br/><br/>The Arya out of the box works well on my Sony Xperia 1 III, well the truth is it does lack boost volume. But every note was heard without struggle...just low in volume.<br/><br/>I am a performance arts music major and elite gamer. So I would not try to get in the realm of audiophiles. But I have a very good ear...so I do not need to run headphones through sound equipment to determine its tolerance. And I am not one to say a higher price headphone would make it the "Endgame."<br/><br/>Example: I have Sony Z1R and SonyZ7 m1......one costs 3x more than other.. but the cheaper one is built better and sounds better. Go figure....<br/><br/>I would only recommend these at a lower price point $1100-$1250 or HIFIMAN make improvements like:<br/>Headband sizing<br/>Headband Leather<br/>Aluminum Parts (yoke, cans)<br/>Audio cable(s) 7n OFC (At this price should not even have to be suggested)<br/>Carrying case (At this price should not even have to be suggested)</span>

<span>Sound is incredible. If you need that punch or slam to the bass, then these might not be for you.<br/><br/>Build quality is bad. There is a glitch in the sewing on one ear pad, cosmetic so not a huge complaint. Squeak in the hinge, also not something that matters once you have them on your head so not a huge complaint. However, the seams on the ear pads are not comfortable and that is something I would complain about.<br/><br/>If you care about the box and presentation in how you unbox it, these come in a cardboard box. Far different from what you get in the Ananda which cost half as much from the same company. I don't personally care about any of that.<br/><br/>The cable they come with is not very good. I was already planning on an after market cable because I usually do for all the headphones I buy, so not a huge complaint.<br/><br/>So, these are true to every video review I've seen. Poor build quality but incredible sound quality. Plan on buying a new cable and to replace the ear pads and you might have found that Endgame set of headphones.</span>
