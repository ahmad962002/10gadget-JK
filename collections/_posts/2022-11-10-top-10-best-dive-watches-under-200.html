<span>I really wanted to like this watch more than I actually do right now. As a daylight watch it is great. Simple, classic look, and it's waterproof to depths deep enough to qualify as a Diving Watch. The problem is with the luminescence. You just cannot see this in the dark. This watch is quite underpriced for what you get, except for the luminescence of the hand and the numbers. Had they invested a bit more $$ in the make and quality of the materials I would have gladly paid a few more $$ for it if this one feature was improved. What good is a watch you cannot wear 24 Hrs/Day ?</span>

<span>Nothing much I can add about this legend that hasn’t already been said.<br/>I can’t get over how many amazing watches Casio produces at a sub $100 price point, it is amazing if you think about it.<br/>It’s a Casio Duro, it’s a beautiful blue, and it’s a legend, well known for it’s durability, accuracy, and low price.<br/>I’m not much of a diver watch fan, in fact this is my first diver watch. It’s big and has a good heft to it, you know when it’s on your wrist.<br/>The only criticism I have is the bezel, it works great, but I wish it was uni-directional. I know, it’s a divers watch, but how many actually use this watch to do serious diving. I have the Casio MRW200H(I think that’s correct) with the uni-directional bezel and I use it A LOT.<br/> But, hey it’s a very minor complaint and something that won’t sway my decision if I decide to buy another!!!</span>

<span>This is another winner in my book by Casio. The watch that Bill Gates wears. If it is good enough for Bill, then it is good enough for me. All kidding aside, this watch is heavy and large. It barely fits by small wrist, but I like the large dial and white hour and minute hands. The blue dial is special and it even has a sunburst effect. Quartz accuracy is on point. You can't go wrong with this watch. My only disappointment is with Amazon. I am a Prime member and Amazon keeps shipping my stuff in plastic bags. I first ordered this watch and the Casio box came all dinged up. I ordered a replacement and the replacement came the same way. All dinged up. Shipped the same way, in a plastic bag. I am now buying watches somewhere else because of the bad shipping quality from Amazon.</span>

<span>Context. Two months ago, my Timex Ironman died. I like to go sailing, so I needed a new watch. That sent me on an unexpectedly enjoyable journey, exploring my options. After visiting numerous websites run by 'watchies' and reading countless reviews, I settled on the blue Casio Duro. Why?<br/><br/>I had these criteria:<br/>1. Waterproof. Sailing makes this non-negotiable. 200M is just fine.<br/>2. Analog. I'm done with digital watches, that just show me numbers. I find it boring. Call me old fashioned.<br/>3. Accuracy. When I buy a watch, I want it to tell me exactly what time it is. This doesn't go without saying. A watch with an automatic movement easily loses or gains 2 minutes per week. This means that you have to adjust it very regularly (and still manually wind it at least twice a month). Quartz watches are highly accurate, i.e. they lose or gain one to two minutes per year. AND they are much less expensive. So why do people opt for an automatic? What they say is: loving the intricacies of the mechanism, the tradition, and the longevity, passing their watches on to the next generation. Well, my next generation looks at her fitbit or smartphone if she wants to know what time it is, so good luck with that. I suspect the real reason is ......love. True watchies are not satisfied with just looking at their watches; they want to touch them, work on them, play with them. And that is what you HAVE to do with an automatic.<br/>4. Looks. I wanted a fairly large 'dive watch' in my old age. Why? It just appeals to me. I also wanted a simple, uncluttered dial and bezel. The colors of the Duro blue are absolutely gorgeous and always changing. Hues of dark blue early and later in the day, bright royal blue in the sunshine, and black in low light.<br/>5. Price. I needed  a 'beater' watch, i.e. cheap enough that it's OK if it gets badly scratched or lost. To me, that means a max of $100 (although I could be tempted into paying $150, maybe even $200).<br/><br/>After my research, the blue Casio Duro is a clear winner, at an incredibly low price of under $50, with the Orient Kamasu as a more expensive ($176) runner-up. And I look at her fondly at least 80 times per day. Love after all...</span>

<span>I had previously purchased the “black-out “ version of this watch, however, being of the boomer generation, I could not see the dial very well in the daytime. The watch is the only watch I own that I can tell time on at 0300 with one eye. With this watch I can see it in the daytime and at night! Very happy old man.</span>

<span>First, I would like to say that as a certified law enforcement employee, I was attracted to this watch due to all the advertisement of it on Police magazines, word of mouth, and the Tritium gas tubes that Luminox is most famous for (The Tritium used for our issued firearms' sight illumination). That being said, I found a black with white numerical Luminox 3050/3950 Series watch on Amazon priced fairly low, so I ordered it.<br/><br/>  Two days later, I received the watch, which was packaged very well and opened it up. The case was very wonderfully made, definitely one of those cases that you don't toss away! So, after unzipping the case, I found my Luminox watch as described, with an informational booklet.<br/><br/>  The watches' band is made of a rubberish material (a "must" in my line of work since a metal band would just break off with physical contact) and the watch contains small Tritium gas tubes on all numericals and the watches' arms. In the dark, the Tritium on the numericals and second hand glow a dark blueish color (except for the '12' numerical) and the hour/minute arms glow a greenish color. Even though you can see the Tritium easily in complete darkness, it isn't as bright as one would expect during the dusk hours...however, this can be seen as a positive to the watch because for being a 'tactical' type watch, the LAST thing you want is bright illumination coming from your wrist! Speaking of which, I LOVE the way the Tritium and numericals are "deep" underneath the upper glass portion of the watch so that the illumination can only be seen by looking straight at the watch, and not from the sides (Another good tactical point).<br/><br/>  The only complaint I have of this watch is that when I received it, the second hand kept "freezing" every now and then, causing the time to always be off when I needed it (There are many, MANY complaints about this all over the internet!). At first, I was pissed, thinking I received a returned non-functional watch, but after some common sense (Alot of the people on the internet apparently haven't thought about this yet) and confirmation on the instructional booklet about the battery dying after about a year, I prayed that this was only a battery problem and took the watch to Walmart for a new battery...Six dollars later, my watch has not skipped a second at all!<br/><br/>  So that being said, I am overall happy and excited about this watch and hope my review has helped you decide on whether or not this watch is for you. I am ending my review with a Good/Bad Points on the watch for quick reviewing pleasure. Thank you...<br/><br/>GOOD POINT<br/>- Extremely light-weight Carbon casing<br/>- Mineral Crystak glass (Mostly scratch resistant)<br/>- Alleged 200 meter water resistant (Cannot prove this, since I don't dive, but I have taken showers with the watch on and have not had any problems)<br/>- Swiss made<br/>- Navy Seals logo on the back of the watch (Showing your U.S. Pride and respect for the elite Seals)<br/>- Dual colored (blue and green) Tritium illumination (up to 25 year glow illumination life!)<br/>- Easy to read numericals<br/><br/>BAD POINT<br/>- Recieved the watch with low battery power (Not Luminox' fault)<br/>- Thickness (the watch's comes up about half an inch off your wrist). But some people prefer "big watches" anyways.<br/>- Price Tag (I wouldn't pay $250+ for this watch)</span>

<span>I own several TAGs, Breitlings, Omega, Citizen, Torgoen, and Tissot.  This is my first Luminox, and I bought it mainly for the novelty of the Tritium illumination vials - everyone should have at least one H3 watch in their collection.<br/><br/>All markings are *very* high contrast white.  The tritium 5-minute marker vials are BLUE, the second hand marker vial is BLUE, with GREEN vials on the hour/minute hands, a GREEN vial on the 12 hour marker and a small GREEN bezel marker. The tritium illumination isn't as bright as perhaps some marketing material and pictures would make it out to be - however it is very good and certainly does the job in low light or darkness.<br/><br/>The watch is large which is my preference, about the same size as a TAG Formula One Grande.  The bezel turns in one direction, a safety feature for divers so they cannot accidentally bump the bezel and 'add time' to their tank supply after aligning the zero to the minute hand just before diving - a one way bezel can only subtract time if you bump it. The bezel has a nice, solid ratchet feel when rotating. The numbers on the bezel are in fact countersunk/engraved, not just painted on the top surface of the bezel - so it would seem to be difficult to 'wipe or rub off' the paint as some have suggested.<br/><br/>The watch case, case back, and bezel are made from a polycarbonate &amp; carbon composite material.  This makes the watch light, but some may think it feels cheap.  However these materials are very strong, and give the watch a low magnetic signature - important if you are working near explosives/mines (EOD) or navigating with a handheld compass.  It probably makes the trip through airport metal detectors a little easier too :-)  The case back has a large engraved Special Warfare insignia (aka Navy SEAL Trident, aka "The Budweiser").  The case back is secured to the case by 4 screws.<br/><br/>The crown seems to be plastic or perhaps composite, and it does not screw down. If the crown was a screw down, eventually users would strip the plastic screw threads.  So this crown pushes in and pulls out.  This could be a concern for preventing moisture entering the watch, however Luminox rates the watch good to a 200M depth.  Be sure your crown is pushed in well before you take to water or even wash your hands.<br/><br/>The band is a typical Polyurethane strap that seems well made and offers plenty of adjustment for wrists large or small. Be careful though - I have seen these types of straps be destroyed by some bug sprays/bug lotions.  The north strap has a Luminox logo molded in. The buckle is stainless steel, has a stamped Luminox logo, and has double tangs of stainless steel.<br/><br/>Once concern is that the strap is 23mm.  This will make finding replacement straps difficult, as 23mm is not a popular size for watch straps.  The AMAZON ID for the replacement strap is B001BQNWBQ or B001MV2J7S.<br/><br/>The mineral crystal is very clear, but it sure would be nice (and more expensive) if the watch had the harder sapphire crystal.<br/><br/>This is a nice knockaround watch, made better if you catch it on sale. I paid $157 direct from Amazon.</span>

<span>I've owned 7 of these over the past 25 years and I have never had one fail on me.  Why so many then?  A couple of times I was just stepping up to a larger dial size as they were released, once because I was too lazy to take it in and have the battery changed, and a few times because I'd beaten them up so relentlessly they were starting to look a bit scruffy.  I've also given 2 more as gifts.  The only downside I have found is that the paint on the bezel numbers tends to wear off over time.  But then I wear mine 24 hours a day - sleeping, showering, swim workouts, trail running, hiking in rocky terrain, doing rough and dirty house and yard projects - and not one of my Luminox watches has ever missed a beat.  No wonder practically the only thing anyone can ever find to complain about is that, yes, a watchband does indeed wear-out over time.  Even a nuclear power plant wears-out eventually.  In this case who cares?  Watch bands are cheap and easy to replace.</span>

<span>It seems to be a good watch for the price. My purchase price made it comparable to the Casio Duro/Marlin. Compared to that model, there are a few things missing: 200m water resist with a screw-down crown (Fossil is only 100m w/ non screw-down crown) and a rotating bezel (Fossil is fixed). You do however gain a metal bracelet (Current Duro/Marlins seems to be all resin bands), date magnifier, and a bigger effective watch face in its place. Build quality seems to be comparable. The lume charge even seems to last about the same amount of time. Just as a point of data, my watch's second hand is hitting all the indicies exactly on the mark. I just recieved my watch, but I'll update if there are any issues with the reliability of the movement.</span>

<span>I'd read a lot of good things about this watch and decided to get one and see if it's worth all the hype. Sadly, it turns out that "good for an Invicta watch" is not the same as "good watch". Which, of course, I knew going in.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>The watch is attractive. However, that's because of Rolex, not Invicta.<br/><br/>The screwdown crown is a nice touch for a cheap knockoff diver, and works smoothly. The 200 meter rating is nice, although I haven't actually tested the waterproof aspect.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>The lume is extremely mediocre and fades very quickly, even after a 5 minute burst of high intensity light to activate it. Don't expect to check your watch throughout a movie at the theater.<br/><br/>As usual, Invicta is obsessive about over-branding. In addition to the obnoxious "INVICTA" etched into the side of the case that everyone mocks, there are three reminders on the dial/hands that this is an Invicta and two on the back. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>The cyclops date magnifier is incorrectly placed and looks out of sync with the rest of the dial. It's too far down the date window, for one thing. Looking at the watch straight on guarantees that the whole date window will not be visible and that the date number will look warped. The cyclops also is visibly slanted downwards from left to right. So Invicta really dropped the ball there.<br/><br/>The "rotating" bezel may indeed rotate, but I sure as heck can't do it with my bare hands. The bezel edge is just too smooth and slick, and the scalloped grip points are absolutely useless. So, no one in their right mind should actually go scuba diving with this watch.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The watch keeps terrible time, even for an automatic. It lost 20 seconds within 8 hours of the start of my test (using an atomic clock app as a reference). That's completely unacceptable for a watch with a Seiko movement. None of my other automatics come close to being this bad, even the ones with the same movement. Apparently I got a lemon movement. In any case, FAIL.<br/><br/>I have several Invictas in my collection. I wear them because they're often visually interesting and goofy, even though I know the whole Invicta story. I know they're far from "great" watches, but have recommended them in the past because of the "fun factor". But I simply cannot recommend this one, because it tries to present itself as a serious dive watch. This watch may have Invicta fans in a tizzy and even make die-hard Invicta haters take a second look. But I'm here to say that overall, this is just another rather shoddy Invicta. 2.5 out of 5 for me, and I'm rounding it down because this piece is so disappointing. In my opinion this is a cheap beater watch, little more.</span>

<span>Bought this for my kid, taking the ACT exam.  The dial is clear, high contrast, highly readable. The bezel is not like a real dive watch, it doesn't click into minutes, and it moves both directions, but whatever, this isn't a dive watch, and the bezel is firm and doesn't loose it's position casually on your wrist, or desk for the exam. :)<br/><br/>This looks good on my kid's wrist. It isn't too small, it isn't too big, which seems to be an ugly trend. It is sizable, but not ridiculous.  If you have tree trunks for wrists... MAYBE this watch face would be too small for you, but, brother, I'd like to see those wrists, maybe you could bend hardened steel bars?<br/><br/>Seems to be pretty accurate, pretty easy to set. Keep the instructions/manual, so your date flips at midnight and not noon...<br/><br/>Think the strap is plastic and not silicone, so a little less than perfectly comfortable, at least for a first time watch wearer... these kids these days don't even wear watches! Think it is fine to use their phone as a watch, but I ask my kid for the time all the time now, and he's like, boom, tells me the time instantly! He's a bit fidgety with the watch, never having worn one, and being a sensitive kid to start with, but he's been wearing it pretty consistently, and he seems to be getting over the feeling of the strap and the metal watch back.<br/><br/>Thanks to Casio for making a fine watch that is very readable, AND has the day and date, is quiet, is relatively accurate, and is very affordable! Cheers to you Casio. I'd definitely recommend the purchase of this watch, in fact, I was hoping he wouldn't like it, so I could wear it! :O<br/><br/>Also, the "crystal" is pretty soft, it scratches fairly easily, but I think that is the norm in this price category.</span>

<span>Took a while to arrive.  I needed a watch with a sweep hand for an EMT type class so waiting was problematic.  The watch appearance is okay (at least new) but it's clearly a lightweight not terribly durable looking, i.e. light duty plastic.  The band is the cheapest of any watch I've owned but should last a little while.  That said, it's about what I expected, maybe a little lower quality and less durable but I'll make it work.  It is pretty easy to read and yeah, the day and date seem mismatched which is annoying.  I think there's a way to adjust it but not sure how it can stay in synch if its not calendar driven.

Casio MRW200H-3BV Casio With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market. Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

  The new MRW200H series has many wonderful features. A luminous coating provides long-term illumination in the dark after only a short exposure to light. The current day and date are both displayed. The battery supplies the watch with sufficient energy for approx. three years. Perfect for swimming and snorkeling: the watch is water resistant to 10 bar / 100 meters. The meters value does not relate to a diving depth but to the air pressure used in the course of the water resistance test.   See more

<span>I've looked long and hard for an affordable watch that offers a depth gauge. This one is simple to use, gives me exactly what I was looking for in terms of functionality - depth, max depth, time, temperature - and does so at a great price. Another selling point is its size. I do not have large wrists, so the bezel size is perfect. A great little feature is the band's 'locking' feaure. It securely fastens the loose end of the strap so you can be sure it will not be coming off.<br/><br/>I've used this watch several times freediving and have found the depth gauge to be accurate. The temperature seems less reliable, but I haven't given it a true accuracy test yet.<br/><br/>EDIT: The temperature gauge seems to consistently read 4° Fahrenheit BELOW real temp. I have confirmed this with a number of sources. I'm not sure how this relates to other watches of this brand or type, but this is how my particular watch reads.</span>

<span>So, This is adequate if absolutely all you want is a log of your dive.  As others have mentioned, the fact that it resets with no delay when you surface is annoying.  I.e. you surface for 10 seconds to locate the boat and go back down and it counts as a whole new dive.  However,  I quickly found this watch didn't allow for any of the planning that you would want a dive device to do.  I.e.  my first dive was 22 minutes at 80 ft.  2nd dive is 50 ft,  how long can I stay down?  Nope this watch doesn't do that.  Now I'm going to step up to a dive computer.  Also,  I don't think the looks are so bad, but my family thinks it is ugly as sin.<br/>Update:  After about six months the watch got stuck in dive mode.  I had to remove battery to get it working again.  It could be it sat on the shelf for a long time, but six months is a really short time to replace a battery.</span>

<span>I was pleasantly surprised when this dive watch arrived. In my opinion the picture doesn't do it justice.  I haven't used it in the water as yet but from a cosmetic and "build quality" overview the product looks and feels like something that costs 5 times as much.  I will update this review after I do some diving with it.<br/>  The case is solid stainless steel and the battery change compartment is screw down with a built in recess to use a coin to unscrew and change the battery while maintaining water resistance. I bought this as an everyday wear watch with built in depth measurements while free diving and as a backup depth gauge during my SCUBA diving.  The large digits look like they will have great visibility in poor water conditions. The form factor is a perfect fit for my wrist since the included strap seems of high quality with the right amount of pliability vs resistance along with many holes placed closely together to get the perfect fit around my wrist.<br/> Another reviewer mentioned the color did not match the picture but I got the exact color as the picture (blue with red accent in the 12 to 3 o'clock position). I am so pleased with the watch itself from a cosmetic/ergonomic standpoint that I would buy it again even if the depth feature didn't work as planned. I'm a bit of a watch guy with many more expensive units that have failed to impress as much as this one has. In my opinion the watch has just the perfect amount of weight to give the feeling of being substantial while not being  too bulky. The profile is slightly higher than a normal high quality digital watch but it is not too much so. If it works as advertised this watch is a much better deal than many costing 5 times as much. If Pyle could fit a decent full dive computer into this exact form factor I would buy it in a heartbeat and then it would compare to true dive computer watches costing 10 times as much!<br/> The dives will be the final test! I really hope it works as advertised because IMO dive watches are ridiculously priced and it is about time a manufacturer came in and shook up the playing field! I hope to dive with it very soon.<br/><br/>---Updated 4th of August, 2014-- Post Multiple Dives<br/>Well I've had a chance to dive with the watch on two separate occasions and my 5 stars still stand. The watch is excellent as a free dive computer and as a backup depth gauge. The accuracy is perfect. One of the things that kept me from getting this watch sooner was a review that talked about the "5 second sample time" read somewhere in the manual. I wanted a watch that gave near real time updates. After diving with the watch and conducting experiments I can attest the depth response of the watch is near instantaneous. The 5 second time may be in reference to when the depth sensor first engages the depth function. Once the watch is in depth mode it registers changes immediately with depth change as little as two inches. I've tested this on free dives where I held on to an object and moved up and down the water column. As I have moved the depth has accurately moved up and down. So 20 free dives later and I have to say this watch is a real winner. This is exactly what I was looking for, just many hundreds less than the competition.</span>

<span>I have mixed feelings about this watch...I like the look, and appreciate the information it provides; but it definitely has its quirks.  I had planned on returning it; but I am reconsidering that option.<br/>Problem 1 - the band is too small.  I had great difficulty fastening it over my wetsuit; and, once fastened, any wrist flex resulted in the mode button being pressed.  This was problematic because I couldn't, at a glance, check my time, depth, etc.  I subsequently fastened it on my BC; but then viewing was inconvenient.  **I should point out that the watch fits great, with plenty of room for adjustment, when I'm not wearing a wetsuit; so it would probably be fine if I was wearing a thinner suit...but, with hitting water temperatures of 48 degrees (at 40 ft) in July, I like the insulation of the thicker wetsuit.<br/>Problem 2 - I used this watch for my open water certification.  The automatic switch into dive mode is convenient; but it sporadically switched out and back...turning 4 dives into 20 (and, no, I did not surface to cause most of those switches).  It seemed to reset itself most times that I changed depth after pausing - so if ascended 6-8 ft, it became a new dive...likewise, if I spent a few minutes at one depth, then descended more than a few feet, it often counted that as a separate dive.  This makes logging dive time tedious.  If it only happened when I came within 3-5 ft of the surface, it would be more acceptable/tolerable.<br/>**edited to add**<br/>About 25 dives later....<br/>Temperature is fairly accurate at 20-25 ft; but about 12 degrees low at 40-45 ft.  Also,  it occasionally goes a little crazy,  logging depths of 250+ ft (for dives that were under 60 ft.<br/>Something must have been interfering with a sensor initially, as it rarely restarts dives without me getting close to the surface, now.  I'm wearing it on a different spot; and the improvement seems to match with when I switched.<br/>Luckily,  I have a dive computer; so I wear this for convenience and backup.  I'm leaving the rating at 3 because of the inaccuracies I've experienced.</span>
