<span>I have had another 3d printer (Monoprice Maker Select Plus) for 2-3 years. I've enjoyed printing, but have always had SO many problems with getting prints to turn out consistently. Over the past few months I have had a need to be printing parts as much as possible. Parts have started to go bad on my MP printer, so I decided it was time for me to upgrade because my time in messing around with the old priner was valuable enough to justify the upgrade.<br/><br/>I received the 3d45, placed it on my desk, and was up and working in just a few minutes. No assembly required. Connect the printer to WiFi, link it to the Dremel PrintCloud, and sent a print. It worked perfectly!<br/><br/>As compared to my old printer which lacked any such feature, I LOVE the leveling assist bed. That was a problem 90% of the time - having the bed just perfect. This takes all the guesswork out of it. The removable glass bed is also great. Two clips to pull it out, wash it, or remove stuck parts. I do not use the included glue sticks for adhesion - too messy for me. I use AquaNet and it works great. The removable bed makes this nice - when you need to re-apply, you can remove the bed, clean it off, spray it, then pop it back in and re-level with the wizard.<br/><br/>I also really like the auto-filament processing feature.The printer identifies what filament you are using via RFID (or you can tell it) and it will automatically set the settings required for that filament. If you use "custom" filament setting, it will give you a warning that if something breaks, it's on you. I really like the filament settings being on the printer, because with the previous printer some filaments require different temperatures and the temps were coded in the GCODE files. Now it's no longer an issue - I can set the temp on the printer for the filament that's currently in it and prints come out how I want. Just a note that you are able to turn this feature off if you prefer to use the temp settings in GCODE.<br/><br/>The Dremel filament seems to work really well. I have done prints using the included Nylon and Eco-ABS (which is NOT ABS - it is a modified PLA, FYI.) They both came out perfect and the printer set the appropriate temps for the filament. The PLA also works well. The filaments seem to have a nice shine to them, but are not as deeply colored as previous manufacturers I've used (Hatchbox.) I have had VERY few failures using Dremel brand filament.<br/><br/>The filament does have its' downsides. It is EXPENSIVE! $29 for a half kg spool is well over double other brands. I have been watching Amazon and stocking up when it is cheap - just recently orange, green, and blue dropped to $16 and I bought several rolls of each. I like using the branded filament when possible, because I have had better results with it. The color selection is terrible, though! They do not currently sell yellow filament (really?) I do need to print yellow for my applications, and this almost prevented me from buying the printer. Pre-purchase I contacted support to inquire of using non-Dremel PLA and got a bit of a snarky answer on using non-branded filament, something to the nature of "if you use a premium product you'll get a premium result." All well and good, but if you don't sell the color I need, I don't really have another option. I decided to go ahead with it figuring I would use third party filament for that color and take my chances.<br/><br/>I've had mixed successes with non-Dremel filaments. In many cases they are working good - I am printing Hatchbox wood filament and I did a few jobs with TPU and both worked good. One time I had a stuck nozzle with the wood filament but otherwise it has been really good. I used the included 'ramrod' unclogging tool and pushed the filament through when it got stuck and it was good again. Using cheaper PLA I have had more issues. I could usually get one good print after changing a roll and then something would go wrong. I haven't used it recently...but I'm hoping that was just a fluke because I really don't want to go through that every time I have to print yellow.<br/><br/>I did have some issues off the bat with the bed not leveling correctly. I worked with support for around an hour on it, and they walked me through a 'hard reset' of the printer (turn it off, unplug the power for a while, turn the power switch ON for like 15 seconds with the power off, turn the switch back off, plug the printer in, turn it back on.) We also updated the firmware and set an extruder offset of .1mm in the settings. Every once in a while, I will see this happen after I level the bed and I'll just do a hard reset of the printer and re-level. Initially I leveled much more often, but now I do it less often and have less issues. I'll only change level after changing filaments or removing the bed.<br/><br/>It was REALLY NICE to be able to actually talk to US based support when I had an issue. Good luck with that with a cheaper no-brand printer. This was one of the main reasons I chose this printer...and it had worked out really well for me.<br/><br/>After constantly having to tweak my bed and fiddle with slicing to get my old printer to work, this thing is a dream and really does feel like cheating. It has been SO hands off and I have have so few issues I hardly know what to do with all of my time. You get what you pay for!</span>

<span>I recently purchased the Dremel 3D45 primarily because of its claim to be a 3D printer for new to advanced users. I did not want to begin with an entry level printer only having to upgrade to a more advanced one down the road.<br/>I am new 3D printing. So new that I wasn’t even aware of the fact that printing and designing software are two different things all together. That being said, this review is likely only useful to someone that is in a similar position. Dremel claimed that you could be printing out of the box in 20 minutes. Although I elected not to print the trinkets they provided gcode for. I am certain that claim is true.<br/>Set up of the printer was easy. I spent most of my efforts the first few days, obtaining design software and learning how to use it. There is a plethora of information on design software and how to use it available on the internet. I began with Tinkercad which is an amazing little program that is free to use. But that is another review. Suffice it to say I was printing what I consider to be fairly complex designs in a couple of days.<br/>To date, I have only used the Dremel brand of filament. I’ve made prints in Nylon, PETG and ECO ABS. The printer can use other brands of filament because the printer allows you to adjust settings to meet the specifications of the other brand filaments. I will continue using the brand name filament until my warranty runs out. This will allow me to get adequate run time under my belt so I am able to know what good looks. If you choose to use another brand of filament, you will have to make a minor modification to use an external spool or manually load it on to a spare Dremel spool.<br/>I am quite impressed with the ease of use of the printer and the quality of the prints. You can select the quality of prints and to date, I have only used the low and medium quality options. I was surprised at the time it takes to make prints. Which is determined by the size, complexity, and the quality of prints you are making. Some of my prints using the medium quality print option have taken over 10 hours.<br/>I am using the printer to make components that must fit and work when assembled together. This was achievable after adjusting some of the dimensions of my design to allow for clearances I need to maintain within the assembly components. For an example, if you are printing a component that has a hole that needs to be a certain diameter, you must account for the nozzle diameter of the printer and adjust for it in the dimension you specify for the hole diameter. Given that, the printer prints with enough accuracy for my needs and prints reliably consistent.<br/>Because of the duration of some print times, the built-in camera is a nice feature that provides an adequate picture quality to determine if your printing has completed or more importantly, gone awry. It would be nice if the remaining print time is provided while monitoring remotely.<br/>The printer has an option to print remotely but I  have not used it and cannot comment on that only to say I am not sure if I will ever use it because based on the limited experience, it seems the most critical time in the printing process seems to be in the initial stages so I like to be there so I can abort the print if there is a problem. Plus, you have to periodically prepare the build plate.<br/>So far, I have experienced very few misprints and I attribute them to poor design of prints on my part and trying to squeeze out one more print before taking the time to clean the build plate and apply another application of glue. If you are new to 3D printing, this sounds like a hassle but it is really quite simple. When you remove the build plate and reinsert it which is really quite simple as well, you should level it. The printer walks you through it and it takes less than a minute.<br/>I cannot speak about other printers and cannot make any comparisons but this one is amazingly easy to use. I am incredibly pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone who is new to 3D printing and plans on eventually becoming an experienced printer.<br/>My only criticisms are relatively minor and do not impact the functionality of the printer but perhaps Dremel can account for these on future models.<br/>1) The front access door sags a bit when it is opened requiring you to lift up on it slightly when you close and latch it in place. No biggie but sadly it is noticeable every time you open and close the door and takes away from the otherwise nice design of the enclosure.<br/>2) The touch screen is nice except that it displays 4 files at a time which  results in the file names being truncated in the display. When you are naming your files keep this in mind and avoid similarly named files.<br/>3) After time, the enclosure collects dust and printing debris so I like to wipe it out with a damp paper towel. At the point where the floor of the printer meets the front access door, there is a raised lip preventing you from easily wiping the dust out of the enclosure.<br/>As I said these are very minor criticisms. The only noteworthy complaint I have about this printer is the size of the build volume but I knew how big it was before purchasing it so I really cannot complain about it.</span>

<span>I've had my 3D45 for a couple weeks and have been printing pretty much 15-24 hours a day with no issues.<br/><br/>The unit itself is built with quality materials. Nothing seems cheap. I was really impressed with the Operating Instructions manual. If you've ever owned Bosch or other high quality power tools, you will definitely appreciate the level of detail included in the 3D45 manual.<br/><br/>The online reviews for this unit all agree, it's a high quality consistent machine. Knowing that schools regularly purchase the unit enough that Dremel markets an educational version, says a lot. It's safe and durable for around children.<br/><br/>I especially like the design of the filament spool loader. My first 3D printer had the spool floating above the unit on a flimsy plastic rod but this unit's design is built into the unit and completely hidden from exterior.<br/><br/>The unit also just looks cool with the ambient lighting.<br/><br/>I have only had one issue so far and that was getting the cloud based website to allow registration. I've only been able to use the supplied USB stick to transfer files. I assume that was a website issue and had nothing to do with the machine itself. Just while writing this review, I checked again and it worked, so there. No more issues.<br/><br/>One minor issue I see on the touchscreen is that the way the files are listed in big letters, it makes it difficult to differentiate files with similar long names. It's best to label files differently in the first few characters or else have to wonder which file you're building. This may only be an issue with using the USB drive and not printing from the cloud.<br/><br/>I also found the Digilab slicer to work very well. It takes a little bit to learn the controls but all the pre-sets seem to work perfectly.<br/><br/>If it's your first printer, you're going to have difficulty swallowing the price on this unit but I can attest after having tried cheaper units (&lt;$800), I think the extra money is well spent.<br/><br/>A few other points:<br/>Leveling system is dummy-proof. You''ll like it.<br/>I really like the glass build plate after having another machine with a gritty plastic removable pad. Prying material off the glass build plate (when using glue stick) can be a little difficult but I tend to rinse the plate with water and soap and then use the supplied "spackling knife" to wedge the material off. The first time I got pushy with it the blade slid into my opposing palm and cut it so I learned to push away from my hand from then on. I would've thought using glue every time would be a hassle, but it's not. The glue washes off very easily and then you're back to work again in less than a minute. Taking the plate on and off is very easy. One catch on the build volume is to remember that even though your build may technically fit on the glass, it may not work when you include the required skirt. Read up on skirts if you're new to printing, since it affects the overall dimensions of the build volume.<br/><br/>The front door is a bit flimsy since it has not frame. I would appreciate a surrounding frame to give it a little more strength. I will eventually break that door, I'm sure. Otherwise, it opens and closes very nicely.<br/><br/>You may find the noise a bit loud even with machine doors closed. I moved mine into a spare room so I can close the bedroom door. If you're using it in your home office, you'll quickly become annoyed by the buzzing and fan.<br/><br/>My top deciding factors in my selection were: price, build volume, material options, connection to computer (usb/cord/wifi/etc.)<br/><br/>I hope this helps your decision. I would recommend the purchase if you can afford it.</span>

<span>When the corona virus hit in March 2020, my wife, son and I were stuck at home (five months later we still are).  We had never done 3D printing before, but we thought that it would be a great project while waiting for school and work to ramp back up.  After a lot of reading and talking with colleagues who do a lot of 3D printing, we selected the Dremel 3D45.<br/><br/>Being new to 3D printing, I needed a bit of help getting started, and the customer support was fantastic.  Five months and countless projects later, the 3D45 is still running perfectly.<br/><br/>If we use the "Mac versus PC" analogy, this printer is definitely on the "Mac" side of the spectrum.  It is very user friendly and works great for almost all beginner and intermediate 3D printer users.  And they have AMAZING customer support.  Seriously, the customer support phenomenal.  I think that the superior customer support is something that comes along with buying a product backed by an industry giant like Bosch, who owns Dremel.<br/><br/>That being said, like a Mac, it is difficult to make the Dremel 3D45 do something that is outside of its comfort zone.  I think that advanced and/or professional users may find that frustrating.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1.) High quality components and very well built.<br/>2.) AMAZING customer service!<br/>3.) Super easy to use right out of the box.<br/>4.) Very good quality prints using the Dremel-brand filament materials.<br/>5.) Although it will likely invalidate your warranty, you can definitely print with non-OEM filaments and even some materials that Dremel will cautiously tell you "we have not been tested yet".  There are sufficient advanced settings that allow you to customize the printer for other filament materials such as the very flexible TPU, or "real" ABS.  I have successfully printed both on my 3d45 with no issues.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1.) The Dremel DigiLab 3D Slicer software does not work on many Macs.  I have been told by several customer support experts that the DigiLab software works on "some" Macs, but they have a lot of issues with getting it to work on all.  The software definitely does not work on my Mac. The work around is using the Dremel print cloud and the web based Dremel 3D Idea Builder, which is easy to use and works fine for me.  However, if I wanted to use some of the more advanced features of the DigiLab software, I would be out of luck on my Mac.<br/><br/>2.) Dremel really pushes you to use their OEM filaments, which are more expensive and can be quite limiting when it comes to color and material selection.  For example, their "ECO-ABS" filament is not really ABS, but a modified PLA filament.  So if you want to print something out of ABS that will withstand higher temperatures and/or use an Acetone vapor bath to smooth the surface, or you want to print something out of TPU that is much more flexible and "rubber-like", you are not going to get help from customer support.  You are going to have to figure that out on your own (but both are definitely doable on this printer in my experience).<br/><br/>3.) You cannot change the print settings in the middle of a print.  After five months, I am starting to see why someone might want this option, but it is simply not possible with this printer.  Again, not something that a beginner or intermediate level user is likely going to care about, but advanced users will probably be frustrated by this.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that I am very happy with this purchase.  If you are new to 3D printing, this is a very high quality printer that is guaranteed to please with a minimal learning curve and great customer support.  That being said, it is expensive, and the Dremel OEM filament material is much more expensive compared to other brand filaments.  You absolutely can use non-OEM filaments, but you will need to set the print conditions manually and this may void your warranty (but eventually you are going to do it anyway...trust me!)<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>TMQ</span>

<span>After beginning with 3D printing using Makerbot Replicator 5th generation and finding them essentially useless for large prints, I purchased the Flashforge Creator Pro. My decision was based on fairly extensive internet research on printers in this price range, and on the experience of the San Diego Public Library 3D printer lab which has had two of these for a couple of years and has had other printers (their comments were very positive).<br/><br/>Immediately after purchase I was pleased and surprised to get an email from Tang, the Flashforge Amazon manager, telling me that he would be my support contact. I had subsequent occasion to get help from Tang and that help has been quick and effective.<br/><br/>I probably should have given this four stars, because there are a couple of issues I'll list below, but the positives, especially in this price bracket, far outweigh the issues.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/>Print quality: so far I've printed only in ABS. It's outstanding, especially when I compare it with the results I got on the Makerbot machines with PLA. Hole size and post accuracy seems to be around 0.01" or better. Separation needed for print-in-place moving things is about 0.3mm. For both, these results are without doing filament diameter and filament density calibrations so I'm expecting I can improve these. The 20mm calibration cube came out at better than 0.15mm accuracy. This is SO much better than I was getting previously. Vertical wall surface finish is nearly flawless; horizontal walls are as good as can be with a 3D printer and require sanding/filling to make perfectly smooth.<br/><br/>This is my first experience with a heated print bed, and what a joy compared with the Makerbot glass print bed. I've used no tape or glue or hairspray. Once or twice it was particularly hard to get a print off the bed, or the material didn't stick initially. The fix for either was to clean the bed surface with denatured alcohol and level it. For leveling, make sure there is no plastic below the bottom of the nozzle, because any plastic there will screw up your leveling results. Before leveling I wipe the extruder tip with a small piece of cloth dampened in acetone, being careful that the acetone doesn't get on anything else. I found it much easier to get a good result using the leveling sheet supplied with the printer than with a piece of paper.<br/><br/>I still find that some prints need a raft to prevent any edge curling, but most do not.<br/><br/>For other positive comments, I would just echo the positives in other Amazon reviews. I do want to give six stars to the customer support. Tang has been mentioned in other reviews. I don’t know what Flashforge factory support is like, but Tang (who is with Flashforge Amazon) may be the reason to buy from Amazon. He has been super responsive and while I was working on the nozzle scraping we were exchanging emails almost in real time. I’ve never purchased anything else with such excellent support.<br/><br/>It's probably too early to comment on operational reliability as I've only had this for a few weeks, but I've experienced no jams or other issues. Once carefully leveled, the build plate seems to be staying level.<br/><br/>Now I’ll turn to the issues I’ve encountered so far:<br/><br/>Out of box: There was one loose cable clamp floating around inside the cabinet. I haven’t found where it might belong, so I’ve concluded it is just a random part that got into the cabinet at the factory. Also, in one place the packing foam was hard stuck to the extruder carriage and it was very difficult to remove.<br/><br/>Assembly: some assembly was required. Most was quite easy and obvious, but I stumbled a bit on getting the side fan into place. The supplied documentation wasn't great, but after a couple of tries and looking at internet pictures, I got it in.<br/><br/>Filament guides: should be replaced with a guide from Thingiverse that moves the filament centerline more towards the reel centerline.The factory design has the filament centerline up against the case.<br/><br/>Initial print quality: Initially I went through boo rah cycles. On some parts I got great results, on others there was nozzle scraping that messed up both vertical and horizontal wall quality. It was frustrating because the supplied x3g test files always printed great. I had to conclude the problem was in the settings, not in the printer, I tried ReplicatorG, Slic3r and Makerbot Desktop, without any improvement. Tang offered to slice one of my problem designs with Simplify3d and the results were perfect, so I purchased that and have been using it exclusively with reliable and repeatable great results. I still haven't sorted out the issues I encountered with the other slicers, but I've found Simplify3D a great tool and will just stay with it. So I can't say this was a FFCP problem.<br/><br/>Nozzle scraping: the main issue with nozzle scraping was solved in comments above. One remains: I get a 'ghost' of the unused nozzle in the print. For instance, if I have a post rising out of a flat surface, I'll see a minor surface defect that has the shape of that post outline spaced away from the post by the nozzle separation. I get the same thing no matter which nozzle is doing the printing. For now, my fix was to remove one of the nozzles for single extruder prints, and I still need to work on this one to see if I can make it go away.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m very satisfied with this purchase. 3D printing requires a significant investment in time to understand the best settings for a machine and for a design, and I still have a ways to go. But, so far so good. After my initial few weeks of nearly constant use, my conclusion is that the Flashforge Creator Pro is a great machine for the price.</span>

<span>After quite a bit of comparison shopping and research I purchased one of these for work. It was my first experience with a 3D printer, so I was starting from an absolute newbie perspective.  The printer arrives in a very plain brown box, and other than the size and weight (and the fact that you're expecting it), you'd never know what was inside until you open the box.<br/><br/>Setup is a breeze, but be sure to look at the owners manual before you begin trying to get the packing foam out of the interior.  It will make things much easier.  Setup, leveling the print bed, loading of the filament (comes with two spools of ABS), and test print (the little traffic cone) is very easy.  You'll be surprised at how well it prints and the quality of the finished product.  I've seen 3D printed models (both online and in person) in the past, and they were not very good.  I have to say that after using this printer and seeing the quality of the output, I have been very impressed.<br/><br/>After a few weeks of using this at work I liked it so much that I purchased one for my home.  Since then we have printed everything from bird houses to doorstops and many other things.  I'm now printing a drone.  Besides ABS (which I use most of the time), I've also purchased and printed with PLA and PETG.  PETG would be what you'd want to use if you intend to make and use something that comes in contact with food or liquids (I used it for a bird feeder).<br/><br/>Since I had to learn all of this the hard way, I'll give you a few pointers that hopefully will save you some time.  For what I was doing at work I needed to create my own 3D models.  After looking at all the options I went with Blender.  It's open source, free, and has a huge support community so you can find answers quickly.  Blender is not intuitive, but it is very much worth learning.  Search YouTube for Blender and you'll find plenty of tutorials.  The first few days are frustrating, but after you begin to figure out how to use Blender, you'll be hooked.  I've made some amazing things after learning Blender.<br/><br/>The next software I would recommend is Simplify3D.  It works great and is very easy to learn and use.  Why do you need this?  Whether you download a model (.stl file) from Thingiverse or create a model in something like Blender (which you would then export as an STL file), you need a way to get that STL file converted to gcode for the printer.  The printer comes with some software for this, but in my opinion the included software is nowhere near as powerful or complete as Simplify3D.<br/><br/>Simplify3D does all the work and makes it super easy to go from STL to printer.  You basically open an STL file, view it in Preview Mode, and then export it (save it) to the SD card that goes in the Flashforge Creator Pro.  That's it.  Simplify3D has a lot of options you can play with if needed (most of the time you don't).  This software costs $149, but I would recommend purchasing it.  It will save you tons of headaches and you'll be printing very quickly and easily.<br/><br/>Before I forget, this is the 2016 model of Flashforge Creator Pro.  I didn't know they had a different model before 2016, so if you download and print an add-on (see below) for the printer, be sure you're downloading something for the 2016 model, otherwise it may not fit after you print it (I found that out the hard way)<br/><br/>Once you are printing, I would suggest downloading and printing two "add-on" parts for the Flashforge printer (neither of these are my designs, I just found them on Thingiverse):<br/><br/>1. Filament Feeder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1582238).  This makes it much easier to load/unload the filament, and keeps it better aligned with the center of the filament reel.<br/><br/>2. Universal Filament Holder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641112).  You'll need one of these because not all filament spools are the same width, and many will not fit on the hubs supplied with the printer.  These are simple to use and can be swapped for the ones that come with the printer in about 10 seconds.  They mount exactly like the ones supplied (requiring no tools... simply hangs on the back like the factory ones).<br/><br/>There are many variants of both of these add-ons on Thingiverse.  I personally have printed and use these, so I can vouch for them.  They work just fine, but I'm sure others would work equally well.<br/><br/>The last thing that I would highly recommend is replacing the blue print bed platform sticker that comes with the printer with a glass plate. After having used the blue sticker for about a month, and then switching to glass, I still can't figure out why they wouldn't ship the printer from the factory without a glass print bed.  In my opinion glass is far superior.  I don't need a scraper of any kind to remove a print.  It simply cools and pops right off.  I use a light coating of Aqua Net hairspray on the glass (wiped off with a paper towel after spraying) before printing.  This makes the glass sticky so the plastic will stick while it is printing.  As soon as it prints and cools, however, the part will pop right off without even prying. The glass bed kit that I purchased (from Amazon) is borosilicate glass that is cut to the right size for this printer (220mm x 150mm x 5mm high). The kit I purchased was from Makersome.  There are two corner brackets (part of the kit) that mount on opposite corners of the print bed and the glass plate simply sits on there.  The beauty of this design is that as soon as I print something I can lift the glass plate out (usually with a pot holder because it is hot), and set the glass on the granite counter top.  It cools very quickly (1-2 min) and the part literally unsticks itself.<br/><br/>Instead of hairspray I have also used an ABS slurry by mixing ABS scraps with some acetone (must use a polypropylene spray bottle for that) and spraying and wiping it off the glass.  I've done both, but I get the same results with hairspray with the bonus that it is much more convenient and it is clear so it works with any color ABS I'm printing.<br/><br/>I clean the glass between printings with just dish soap and warm water.  When I'm ready to print something else, I simply spray on (and wipe off) the hairspray and print again.<br/><br/>Hope this helps, and enjoy printing.  The Flashforge Creator Pro is a great printer.</span>

<span>Update 7-31-16: Received replacement printer on 7/28.  Nothing has been fixed.  Still uses all the cheapest chinese components.  The left extruder clogged on the first use.  3 trashed jobs and counting.  Obviously there was some printing done, according to the meter, but was it successful?  Print jobs may get part way through, then just may a big blob.  The top of print jobs looks like it came from an ice cream dispenser.  I've tried a different heated print bed.  I've removed the left noizzle.  I've tried different filaments, different temps, different speeds, lots of included test prints.  I hope the 2 provided spools of filament are enough to get this thing dialed in.<br/><br/>Update 8-3-16:  It isn't looking good.  The heated bed never gets more than warm to the touch, although the display shows 100C, which should be the boiling point of water.  No screech, yet, but the pulleys are clearly slipping.  The left extruder is jammed, AGAIN!  Rrgh!  I may try some different parts on it.  Sometimes, the display shows gibberish in the middle of a job, and the job ends.  After this, the printer must be power cycled to be usable again.  Other times, the print job just stops.  Twice I've had the feed stop.  I say it stopped, because the filament wasn't broken, or jammed.  If I went to load filament, it would load, or I could cancel the job and start another job.  Prints are coming out very rough.  The jobs print a few lines, then there is a gap, then a few more lines.  Little pieces of filament stick up all over.<br/><br/>Update 8-6-16: Well, I have a few successes.  The white filament supplied seems to be the only one that works.  The red has lots of issues, given the same job and parameters.  I tried changine the temp, changing the speed.  Still bad.  I've used up both included spools printing the same job over and over.  In the process, I've found that choosing to print another copy doesn't print the exact same thing; one could be warped badly, another could have gaps, another could get knocked off the plate, etc. I found that, although this printer has a flat build plate, the gantry is crooked.  It's racked, and as it prints it raises up in one corner.  The feed mechanism has lots of issues.  The buttons are often unresponsive.  Acceleration shows as an option, but does nothing.  The annoying interior strobe lighting is unhelpful.  I've been unable to get the left extruder to work for more than a few meters of filament.  The auto-level for the build plate is humorous.  Since this isn't possible on this printer, why is is mentioned?  I don't know which is more frustrating: the 3D printers that are total junk, the 3D printers with terrible support, the 3D printers that are close, but need better support, or the 3D printers that are great, but could be awesome.  If you're wondering about support for this printer, see their (lack of) response.<br/><br/>I compared this printer side by side with my aging 3D printer.  My old printer wins on successes (fewer failures that this printer's successes), quality (the jobs are almost perfect on the other printer), speed (I can print the same job at 1.00 on the other printer, vs 0.20 on the flashforge), runtime (I have thousands of hours on the other printer, vs the flashforge that dies after a few hundred hours' use), parts availability (all local on the other printer), support (the flashforge support is people who don't know and couldn't care less), and usability (the constant crashing of the flashforge is irritating, as is the interior strobe lighting).  Bottom line, if you never use this printer, it's great.  If you do use it, use only the white filament provided.  Once you've printed a few spools, this printer is done.<br/><br/>Update 8-11-16: No reponse whatsoever from support.  The printer died.  Print kept stopping, and the display would go blank.  I could power cycle and feed filament, but the feed would stop when the job started.  This last time, power cycling did not restore functionality.  Nothing comes up on the display.  When powering on, the backlighting comes on, then dims, and a few seconds later everything goes dark.  Returning this piece of junk.  It didn't even last for 400 hours.<br/><br/>Original 6-20-16: First impressions are good.  This is my 7th 3D printer.  Although the enclosure is plastic, it is a quality enclosure, with more design and fewer screws.  The sides are solid, but the acryllic for the door and hood feels good.  The hood is one piece, and fits securely.  The side handles are built into the enclosure.  Nothing flimsy.  The door handle is similarly built into the door, where it vents out waves of heat.  Throughout, the design was preferred to excess screws.  This means easier maintenance.  The unit feels solid, and does not rack.  There are metal grates over the extruder fans.  The wiring coming up the back has a nice channel built into the enclosure.  The guide tubes are too long for the hood, which does have a big hole that lets the heat out.  The guide tubes fit into a thick plate above the extruders, and extend well below the plate.  This design prevents the tubes from popping out while printing.  On the spool end, space is at a premium, but the guide tubes snap firmly into place, and there is a stop to prevent unwanted winding up on the spools.  Unfortunately, the spool holder design fails here, in that the spools are too far from the enclosure where the tubes pull the filament, which causes the filament to get between the spool and the enclosure.  No matter how tight the belts are, they slip terribly, because the pulleys are all plastic.  In addition, warping seems to be an issue.  The tilted display is nice, but the location of the SD card slot is such that lose filament can get into the slot.  Also, the buttons aren't very responsive.  The lighting is annoying, in that it is never really the right color or brightness.  Printing must be done VERY slowly to prevent the belts from slipping (40 at 50%)  At the start of every print job, there is a loud screeching noise.  Nothing sticks to the blue pad on the build plate.  The extruders are, thankfully, both at the same height, but they don't seem to be calibrated correctly, because the left side never matches up, when changing colors.  The OS seems stable, thus far, and the info available (such as build statistics) is nice, as is the fact that many of the visible options work.  One option I miss is the option to control the lighting.  The first print job, the bed and extruders heated simultaneously, but they've never done that since, and it takes forever, either way.  It is nice that the OS can read folders on the SD card.  Acceleration does not appear to work, nor ditto.  The unit does not waste filament with building those waste fences, but instead drops excess filament by wiping it on your print job.  The extruder nozzles leak terribly.  The tools come in a flimsy ziploc bag.  Basically, you get 4 allen wrenches in a bag.  As far as assembly, attatch the exteuders with 2 screws, attatch the inlet duct for the filament fan, remove the plastic wrap from the front door, put the hood in place, snap in the guide tubes and spool holders, and you're ready to go.  Other than unpacking, removing the plastic wrap is the longest thing.  Mine came with 2 spools of ABS filament.  Be aware that the filament is on proprietary spools, and that their spool holders are not designed to be compatible with other spools.  I'm at 16 failed jobs, zero successes, so far.  I've contacted support concerning these issues.<br/><br/>Update 6-25-16:  Nothing but failures, so far.  No response from support.  Lots more issues have arisen.  Dual extrusion is a no-go.  Both extruders extrude simultaneously--even if your jobs only uses 1 extruder.<br/><br/>Update 6-27-16: Still no response from support.  I have 1 success to show for a whole spool of filament.  The biggest problem that has arisen is that the profiles are uneditable.  No matter what I choose during the make process, the printer applies its own settings.  This wouldn't so bad if the settings were correct. Unfortunately, the offsets and temps are wrong.  There are lots of excess noises when trying to print.  The annoying lighting is terrible.<br/><br/>Update 6-29-16: Still only 1 success, but many failures.  1800 meters of filament used, so far.  Support replied.  I've provided pics &amp; videos of the problems.  We're starting with the belt slippage, but in the meantime, the left extruder quit working.<br/><br/>Update 7-11-16: There are some good features; unfortunately, none of them are related to the purpose of the printer.  ”Cheap junk” is the best way to describe this unit.<br/><br/>There are many issues, which haven't been resolved.  I've sent the requested videos and pictures to support.  I've spent numerous hours trying to fix the issues, and wasted spools of filament with test prints.<br/>1. The belts slip terribly<br/>2. There is a horrible screeching noise at the start of every print job.<br/>3. There is a sound like shaken marbles while printing<br/>4. I'm unable to turn of the multi-colored strobe light.  That purple, pink, and blue light is obnoxious<br/>5. No manual provided, electronic or otherwise.<br/>6. The heads are out of alignment<br/>7. Both heads just constantly extrude<br/>8. The spool holders are the wrong size<br/>9. The filament slips between the spool and the back of the device<br/>10. The filament guide tubes are too long<br/>11. The blue bed pad doesn't sit flat, and doesn't make a good print surface<br/>12. The profiles have the wrong temp settings, but won't let me change them<br/>13. It won't let me edit the print settings<br/>14.  Support doesn't seem to understand English<br/>15.  Print jobs warp terribly<br/>16. The duct for the filament fan broke off when a job got messed up<br/>17. The print bed doesn't heat properly (display shows 100C, but the bed is only warm to the touch)<br/>18. The instructions on the display don't match the buttons<br/>19.  The buttons barely work at all.  Even after multiple attempts of press and hold, no response from the buttons.<br/>20. 2300 meters of filament, and only 1 successful print job<br/>21. Even the samples on the SD card failed to print properly<br/>22. The screws that mount the extruders to the gantry, and the screws for the motors come loose every few hours<br/>23. Parts come from China, in 7-10 days<br/>24. The filament guide tubes break after a few hundred hours of use.<br/>25.  The pulleys are made of cheap plastic<br/>26. After 400 hours' use, the belts wore through or broke, and the unit basically fell apart.<br/>27.  The unit started shorting out<br/>28.  Power supply problems developed<br/>29. I have probably 2 spools' worth of 3-inch pieces of filament in the trash can from just filament load failures.<br/>30.  I have more than 100 hours into trying to make this printer print.  Perhaps that's too much to ask.<br/><br/>I considered replacing all the cheap/bad parts, until I realized that the parts would cost almost as much as the printer itself, and I had already paid for those parts as part of the printer purchase.  For this much money, I expected something that worked.<br/><br/>Print jobs that print great on a makerbot are just trash on this printer.</span>

<span>Executive summary: This is a great printer and the seller (Tang) provides great support! I knew nothing about 3D printing when I bought it and found it very easy to set up and use. I was printing well under an hour after I opened the box. The seller included a sticker right on the front of the machine with his name and email, and he is extremely responsive. He answers questions clearly, promptly in excellent english. By the way, no one paid or even asked me to write this review. I was impressed with the support I received and decided to do it. I have been using this machine a lot for nearly two weeks now and I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>Details:<br/><br/>I needed a 3D printer not as a hobby, but because I need to prototype enclosures for electronic devices. As such, I wanted something reliable, that would work right out of the box with minimal fussing. I also wanted to be able to print using ABS and be able to print supports with soluble material.  Of course I didn't want to spend thousands. This printer is fully enclosed (helpful for ABS) and dual extruder for well under $1,000. It arrived very well packaged with an excellent getting started guide (I recommend you read it and follow the directions - the english is excellent, no decryption required). It's sturdy and solid. The machine needed some assembly, including one screw that was a bit tricky to get in, but if you follow the guide assembly is straightforward. All tools needed were supplied. I was super careful and had it assembled in about 40 minutes. One thing that's easy to miss is the correct way to feed the filament from the spools. I posted a pic, notice how the filament crosses and feeds into the tube furthest away from it. This is counter-intuitive and important.<br/><br/>Before you can print, you have to manually level the bed. There are three knobs below the bed, and the machine came with a cardboard card that's used to level. You just stick the card between the left nozzle and the bed and adjust the knobs until there is a little friction when you slide the card. What's nice is the card has a diagram to tell you which way to turn the knobs to raise or lower. It's the little things like this that make a difference. Again, follow the instructions and it's easy.<br/><br/>It also came with an SD card that has several test prints on it; two cylinders and a traffic cone. In the attached pic, each cylinder was printed with a different nozzle and the traffic cone was, of course, printed with both. It printed these nicely on the very first try, so the first 3D prints I ever made came out near perfectly.  I say "near" because each of them has a very slight vertical line. I was initially concerned, but other prints do not have that, including the "benchy" boat test print. The benchy boat in the pics was printed on the highest quality settings, and it's noticeably smoother than the "standard" settings in the slicer program. The standard looks good as well, but the "hyper" profile looks great. The bottom half of the enclosure pictures was printed using the lowest quality profile, because I wanted it fast, not pretty, but it still looks great. That was printed directly on the bed that came with the printer, no tape, no hairspray or glue or anything like that that I have read people do (have I mentioned that I don't want to tinker with this?).<br/><br/>Of course, these profiles are in the "FlashPrint" slicer program, which is supplied by FlashForge.  The "slicer" converts your STL file to gcode that the printer then reads to make your print. FlashPrint is very easy to use and seemd to do a fine job. In "expert" mode there are about a bazillion settings, most of which I have no idea about and just don't change. There are, however, many slicer programs available, most free.<br/><br/>All that said, the printer is not completely perfect. One of the concerns I had about this printer before I ordered it is that it's an older model, with an 8 bit control board. The printer does lack WiFi connectivity and a 32bit control board. Turns out, I don't have a problem with this. My laptop makes all the gcode, which I just put onto an SD card. I insert the SD card into the machine and use the display and buttons to tell it to print my file. One very minor annoyance is that the machine will initially say "can't read SD card" or something like that, but each time it works fine on the second try. Also, this machine has a great support community on Facebook, very helpful people there. Also, I don't have other machines to compare to but it does make a bit of fan noise, and also when printing sounds a bit like R2D2. I can't hear it in the next room, so not a problem for me. The last inconvenience I noticed is that the print bed is not removable, so you have to remove your print from the bed while it's still in the machine. Except for the fan noise, these can all be fixed with addons and such, but again, this is not my hobby.<br/><br/>Also, the printer will work with lower temp filaments like PLA and ABS and such, but the nozzles can't get hot enough to print Nylon and other more interesting materials. It can however, be upgraded with an "all metal hot end" so that it can do that. The heater in the extruder can get hot enough, but there are some plastic tubes in there that can not. For hotter filaments you need to replace these parts, and for abrasive filaments like carbon fiber and wood you need a hardened nozzle. These are available for this machine, and not very expensive, so I'll probably make that change. This is not my hobby, but I do want to make my enclosures from carbon fiber reinforced nylon.<br/><br/>Finally, and perhaps most important for someone who is not interested in endless tinkering, is the excellent support from this seller. The machine arrived with a sticker affixed, that listed the name of the seller (Tang) and his email address and a note that says to contact him with any issues or questions. I had a small issue where a larger enclosure printed a bit lopsided. I emailed Tang and within an hour he replied with what he thought was the issue, and two videos demonstrating how to correct it. He then quickly replied to follow up questions. Overall he made it a super easy fix and I'm glad I don't have to return the machine.<br/><br/>So I'm pretty happy with this printer. It's been easy and fun to use, and I can even deduct it from my taxes!</span>

<span> I am brand new to the world of 3D printing and this is my first 3D printer. After doing a lot of research into different printers, and reading many reviews I decided on the JGAurora A5S as many reviews indicated that it was good for beginners while also providing a good quality print. From what I can tell in the short amount of time that I've had it, the following are my observations and experiences.<br/><br/>The printer arrived packaged well, in a sturdy box encapsulated in form fitting foam. Everything was well protected and in good shape when I opened the box. All of the parts were there and there was a sheet included to walk me through the process of putting it together.<br/><br/>The assembly was not difficult and I had it put together and turned on within 30 minutes. There was an SD card and USB stick included, which I was then able to use to install the JGcreat slicing software and look through a user manual (although, the user's manual only covers assembly - it does not actually give any guidance for actually using the printer, which at this point is my biggest complaint and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - coupled with the additional difficulty I've had in operating the printer).<br/><br/>While installing their software on my computer I was asked to select my printer model from a dropbox so that it could auto fill some parameters for slicing and printing, however there was no option for the A5S and I instead had to select the older A5 model. I'm not sure if this is leading to some of my printing issues or not, as I'm so new to this hobby and admittedly don't understand yet what all of the parameters mean or what settings should be used.<br/><br/>I was able to print the included test piece from the included SD card within about 12 minutes and was very impressed with how it turned out. I was excited to try printing additional pieces, but unfortunately, I have not been able to get the machine to print anything other than the test piece from that original SD card.<br/><br/>I tried downloading multiple (4) different files from Thingiverse that seemed to be pretty simple prints (2 different filament clips and 2 different playing card holders). I downloaded them with the JGcreat software, sliced them and saved them to the SD card as .gcode files and attempted to print. This is where things went wrong. The printer recognized the files, allowed me to select them to print, but then wouldn't print. The bed and nozzle heated up, the print progress went through from 0% to 100% and said print complete, but it had not moved at all or actually printed anything. This happened with each file that I tried. Sometimes, instead of the previous issue, the printer would not heat up at all and would just continuously count up as if it were in the process of getting ready to print, but would never do anything beyond count up until I finally pressed cancel (I waited as much as 30 minutes). It's certainly possible that I'm missing a step as, like I've admitted, I'm completely new to this, or it could be an issue with the software (I don't know if having to select A5 instead of A5S is causing an issue) but I have no way to troubleshoot or know what is wrong since there is no user manual to give me any guidance.<br/><br/>Additionally, I downloaded Cura version 4.0 and attempted to print each file using that software instead of the JGcreat, and received the same results. Overall, although the printer was easy to assemble and get the test print going, I would argue the point of it being good for beginners. It seems that you are expected to already have a great deal of knowledge on both the process of 3D printing and the mechanics of how these machines work and the software required. I expected that I should be able to print ready made files and then learn the process of creating my own over time, but it seems that there is a lot to learn before you can even really get started on a novice level.<br/><br/>I will say, their tech support is very responsive. I found a facebook page for users of JGAurora printers and explained my problem, asking for guidance and received replies both from other users and from a member of tech support at JGAurora. I will try to go through the suggestions I've received and do lots more research on the process until I am able to get it going.<br/><br/>Overall, I do think this is a good printer, I just wish it were a bit more user friendly for beginners and included a user guide to explain the settings and walk you through actually using the printer and software that's included. I'm optimistic that I'll get it figured out with the help of tech support and still would recommend this printer, with the caveat that you really need to be willing to do a lot of research on your own and have a solid understand of the 3D printing process before getting started.</span>

<span>I'm not a beginner at 3D printer and certainly not an expert but here are  my thoughts. General construction quality is very good. It has a nice stable frame and the LCD panel mounted in the front lessens the number of wires I'm used to seeing but it still has several dragging around during the printing process. The instructions were a little confusing because a number of the construction steps had already been done at the factory (a good thing) but confusing nonetheless.<br/>The position of the Z end stop switch has to be adjusted so the extruder  nozzle doesn't jam into the bed. I found this out the hard way and there are no cautions in the instructions on how to avoid this. A simple line such as "Mount bracket 1/8" above lower frame" would have been nice or words tp that effect.<br/>The SD card came in a smashed holder/case that someone at the factory taped up with shipping tape. Too cheap to give me one that wasn't  wrecked? I guess so,<br/>If you watch some of the videos on YouTube on unboxing and building this printer, there many differences that will become apparent when YOU build it but nothing to get in a dither about.<br/>I really HATE the build plate platform. If you are going to print relatively thin prints (like 3mm or so) as I do, removing them is impossible. Even the 'sample' recipe that came on the SD chip was destroyed when I tried to remove it with Vice Grips! Though the printing surface can be removed from the aluminum base and flexed, my prints stayed put. I ended up ruining it in my attempts to get my prints off in one piece so I ordered a more standard build plate material.<br/>The owner's manual is included on the SD chip (though some YouTube videos show hard copies included with the machine (mine didn't) as a PDF file along with an ancient version of Cura ( a slicing program to you need to make files or recipes that the printer can make) which is probably better left alone. Download the latest version which is free. Again, YouTube has dozens of videos explaining how this slicer works and the tweaks you can use to improve your prints.</span>

<span>Revision: I was very enthusiastic at the beginning of this venture. Not so much anymore. This printer uses proprietary parts. That means you can only get replacement parts from them. GOOD LUCK! No response after ordering and paying for new parts. The table bearings are shot after 1 roll of pla. The hotend died. If I want to completely rewire the printer I can get another brand hotend. But why? I gave up after a month of waiting for their special parts and got a name brand printer to replace it.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to try out 3D printing for quite some time. Well, a Prime Day Flash Sale knocked me off the fence and I pulled the trigger. I should have done this a long time ago! So I watched a few YouTube videos that showed the assembly and reviewed this unit. I also looked up the owners manual to get a feel for what I was in store for. It looked simple enough.<br/><br/>As always, Amazon delivered quite rapidly. After the delivery driver handed me the box it took me about an hour to assemble this unit. This is my first exposure to 3D printing. I've been around CNC machines for quite some time. But 3D printing is completely new territory. Being the way I am, I didn't do any test printing. I went directly to TinkerCAD and designed a small part for a project that I couldn't get exactly what I wanted commercially. TinkerCAD is free software used to design parts. There are a lot of different options when it comes to computer aided design (CAD) software. They range from very free to VERY expensive. I use a very expensive software package (PowerMill) at work. It would be overkill for this application. The free software packages available will be more than sufficient for my 3D printing needs.<br/><br/>It took probably a half of an hour to figure out this web based TinkerCAD software and complete my first design. Now the 3D model needed to be "sliced" to be able to print it. The software to slice the finished model into printable layers came on the SD card included in the package. After loading that onto my Windows 10 laptop, sending the "sliced" G-Code file back to the SD card and inserting it into the printers SD slot, I had a part in my hand in 8 minutes! This thing is AWESOME!<br/><br/>There are a couple review videos that point out problems they had with this machine. Obviously the manufacturer saw these and has, at least with the one I got, taken care of all the important issues. One problem pointed out was play in the Z axis stepper motor. Mine had none. This would greatly affect the performance of the machine. Another issue was the printed manual used to be only in Chinese. Mine was Chinese on one side and English on the other. There is also a manual on the included SD card and another on their website. Another review said the X axis carriage didn't ride well on the vertical uprights. Mine is perfect. Everything runs smooth with no binding. A couple reviews complain about how loud the stepper motors are. I guess in my old age I can't hear very well because it sounds like a machine should to me. I set it up next to my television and can watch without increasing the volume! The heated bed was another issue. I didn't know I wanted a heated bed. But I guess I do. The heating elements on this used to go all the way to the edges and the clips used to hold the flexible plate on top could short out the bed elements. On the one I got the elements have been moved so that the clips can't reach them no matter where they are attached. But why did I need a heated bed in the first place? After some reading I found out it makes the first few layers stick. Nice! Then, apparently, I would have to put blue painters tape or some other crazy tape or glue on the bed so I could get it unstuck if it hadn't come with a flexible, removable plate that clips on top of the heated bed. I unclip it, flex it, and the parts pop off! I'm glad this came with what I didn't know I wanted! With a lot of the complaints I think the reviewers are basing their opinions off of other printers that are exponentially more expensive.<br/><br/>The only thing I see lacking with this machine is it doesn't come with very much filament. At the price point it's at, I can't see how it could! The review videos that I found on YouTube made me aware of this in advance and along with this printer I ordered a 1KG (2.2 pound) roll of black PLA filament (Also a Prime Day Flash Sale item). I wanted to be able to dive in right away.<br/><br/>I don't know how accurate it is yet, but the slicing software that came with this also tells me how much filament it will use to make a project as well as how long it will take. I input the price and size of the filament roll and it tells me what it will cost to print it! How cool is that?<br/><br/>So if you're thinking about a 3D printer like I was, this one sure does a good job at a good price! However, I think it'll be a lot like a fishing pole. Sure, I can fish with just a pole. But then I need the extras. A big tackle box, a cool hat, waders, maybe a new net. Then a boat......</span>

<span>Updates:  See the end.  It is a pretty good unit.<br/>In short, bed sucks, you have to put down blue painters tape, once the bed is HOT.<br/>Once you get over that, and you level it properly, and you DON'T screw up the model while editing, it prints quite well.<br/>From my testing, it will print a 30 degree overhang VERY well, PERFECT with sanding.<br/>40 degree overhang, start with a file...<br/>Other than that, for the price, it's a buy!<br/>GREAT learner piece, but you will HAVE TO LEARN.<br/>This is NOT an OOB printer for dumb people.<br/>If you do NOT have a lot of mechanical experience, wait or spend more money.<br/>OH, the slicer!<br/>It comes with Cura, PAY ATTENTION to the "Platform Adhesion Type"  THIS IS CRITICAL!!<br/>( you get warped corners in some cases. )<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>FYI, this is a beginner unit, but you had BETTER NOT be a beginner at troubleshooting physical mechanisms.<br/>Also, it is this inexpensive because it is SLOWER than my kids.<br/>You want speed?  go buy something expensive, I think.<br/>You want to LEARN? ( and be frustrated, maybe... ) buy this.<br/><br/>If you can deal with this unit, you will be fine.<br/><br/>The sucker is pretty damn solid, build-wise.<br/><br/>On my unit, i leveled the print bed according to instructions, but the first layer will not adhere across the entire surface.  75% adheres, the rest rubs off.  (EDIT, see update 1 )<br/>This is with the PLA sample it came with.<br/>After leveling, I printed the sample gcode it came with.  it looks and printed terribly.  layer separation, all around a horrible print.<br/><br/>Also, warm or cold, the PLA would not come off the base.  Even with an insanely sharp blade.<br/><br/>So far, I cannot get consistent first layer adhesion no matter what was tried.<br/><br/>I already bought 3 spools of good PLA, so I will continue testing, but I'm thinking the old saying, you get what you pay for, is true.<br/><br/>This appears to be a $100 3d printer.<br/><br/>If anything changes with the better PLA, I will update this.<br/><br/>On the + side, it assembled quite easily, functioned the very first time, and the video instructions were decent enough to follow easily, broken English notwithstanding.<br/><br/>It just won't print well.<br/><br/>Update 0:<br/>Use blue tape to start with on the bed.<br/><br/>Update 1:<br/>The Feed mechanism didn't feed well.  I don't know if I missed this, or if it is a design flaw.  On the servo that does the feeding, there are 3 screws holding the mechanism to the servo. (you'll understand once you've built it. )<br/>One screw controls how freely the gear and roller engage/spring return tension.  I had mine WAY too tight, so it could not feed.  if you are getting what looks like starved prints, you ARE getting starved prints.  Loosen the fulcrum screw.<br/>(If you can push/pull the line, you have the screw too tight.)  Leave the two outfeed-port-screws tight.<br/><br/>Update 2:<br/>After much experimentation and learning, use blue tape.<br/>Be VERY certain your model is correct.  Somehow I twisted my model by 1 degree left-to-right, so the printer was dutifully printing the left half on the plate, and then trying to print the right half .1 mm in the air.<br/><br/>Being stupid does not work well.<br/><br/>If you are having weird problems, before blaming the printer, make sure YOU are not the problem.<br/><br/>15 prints in, simple boxes for emergency lights and such, the machine has loosened up a bit on the printhead arm, but this has made no difference.<br/><br/>Manually heat it, wait until it is hot, THEN lay down your blue painters tape ( I use 3M, I recommend it.  it's not that much more. )<br/>Once the print is done, let everything cool completely, or take it off while still hot, and you can probably re-use the tape.<br/>If it all gets cold, take the item and the tape off.<br/>Heat the unit first, THEN try re-using the tape.<br/>I can get 2-3 uses out of a piece or 3 of tape.<br/><br/>Remember, save the old tape for labeling boxes/whatever.<br/>It's good freezer tape for freezer paper!</span>

<span>I have ZERO experience with these printers but bought this for the positive reviews as I am a beginner. VERY easy set up. The prints are very detailed and so easy to do. My objects are usually 1 x 1.5 inches and I get about 6 on a plate. It takes about 3 hours to run. Easy clean up. I strongly suggest using Elgoo resin as its much easier and made for these printers. I have used another brand and it was not as good. You cannot go wrong with a bundle. The wash station is much easier than poking around with alcohol and having things messy. The curing station is amazing. My 6 small characters take 3 minutes til done. Beats the sun!</span>
