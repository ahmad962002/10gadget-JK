V4K PRO is an Ultra HD document camera with a multi-jointed arm, which allows any position and orientation of its lens. Its 8 MP sensor, allows capturing physical materials in great detail and delivers video feed in up to 30 fps at 3264 x 2448p, with exceptional clarity and color reproduction. For usage in low light conditions, V4K PRO is equipped with an LED light on its camera head. The onboard microphone comes together with an innovative AI-Enhanced Voice technology, which reduces background noise during communication, leaving your voice natural, undisturbed, and easy to hear. This noise reduction filter focuses on voice recognition instead of targeting the noise itself. It is utilizing AI, which was trained with over 500 million distinct data. As a result, it can better maintain the natural sound of the human voice while removing the noise with high accuracy. V4K PRO's multi-jointed arm allows quick changes of the height and position of the camera's lens, for easy viewpoint adjustments. In the case of loosening joints, it is possible to simply tighten the bolts at connecting joints clockwise with a coin. V4K PRO is plug & play and compatible with Mac, Windows, or Chromebooks with a USB Type-A port. Works with applications that use computer cameras, like online conferencing apps or video recording software.

<span>This sure beats the built-in webcams on my laptop and desktop computers (high-resolution, no barrel distortion, digital zoom, auto-focus, built-in microphone with AI noise-reduction, built-in light for document imaging and fill lighting when used as a webcam, sturdy adjustable stand, portable, great multi-platform apps).  This is not just for document imaging and educational presentations.  It is so well designed.  The company is even environmentally responsible.  The unit comes bare in a padded, portable  storage box with a carrying handle.  There is not even any plastic wrap or any literature to throw away.  All you need to know is printed on the outside of the box.  Great after-purchase, personalized customer support.  Two thumbs up.</span>

<span>I have used IPEVO cameras since Covid hit, to teach online. The V4k PRO is the most compact and easy to set up camera and has all the features you need for teaching online, especially in a noisy room.<br/><br/>If you do not mind plugging it in to your computer, this model is perfect. It is small, compact, takes "in focus " shots from 10 feet away easily when I am standing up at an easel and takes close up shots on the desk when I am demonstrating, or drawing up close.  It is heavy enough to NOT to get vibration, but light enough to clip on a ladder, which I use for my home studio. And it is cheaper and better than the previous models. It works well for anyone without tech experience, for instance church services, and broadcasts live on zoom, and anyone can use it easily without training. It even has a very good light which shines on your writing, drawing, science experiment, or whatever you are trying to show or sell.<br/><br/>Ipevo works seemlessly. Download and use the free Visualizer Ap on IPEVO website. The AP is very easy to figure out, and is constantly being upgraded to be user friendly; it works perfectly with Zoom. I can run the camera, zoom in and out, focus, and adjust all kinds of settings in the AP while I am teaching live. This is a solid product by a reputable, honorable company which believes in making innovative products teachers can buy themselves.<br/><br/>If you are a tutor, or have meetings, you can do demonstrations with this without tech training. If you have to carry the camera, this one folds down easily too.  (If you need a wi fi camera for walking around a wi fi classroom, get the big green  VZX Ipevo,,,,but it is alot more expensive. The wi fi Ipevo is the green one in the photo on the desk) Ipevo also has a cheaper model without the fancy mic, that goes in your backpack, but the mic is a HUGE improvement. The v4Kpro one is perfect for most everyone and the camera and mic are fantastic.<br/><br/>My first IPEVO camera saved my career when COVID hit, and I had to switch to online teaching overnight. I am loyal to this brand because they work. Frequently, the Visualizer month get's better and keeps up with other broadcasting, and also allows you to take photos from books, or make movies. The company is always ahead of the pack.  My greatest thanks to IPEVO for creatively and unselfishly creating tools that teachers can afford to buy, and their unrelenting commitment to those of us that are 'boots on the ground' in  education.</span>

<span>My laptop camera color corrects. I currently have a windows but my mac color corrected too. If I have harsh light my face is normal. If I have warm light, it turns warm. The problem is that the camera keeps changing its mind when i have a flashlight, turn on my desk lamp, the sun comes out, i move a little so the light balance is different. IDK it drives me crazy to see me go from pale to warm to pale to warm sometimes several times in a minute.<br/><br/>This camera does NOT alleviate the problem, as it seems to be a software issue??? And this camera has no software. Also, it cannot focus properly, and again, the computer software is indecisive on what to focus on. This camera did NOTHING to improve my camera experience (other than be external). Not worth the time, money, effort, to setup or tinker. There just is no way to make this work better. I need to get a camera with its own software maybe. IDK.</span>

<span>So I read some of the comments and thoughts on myself that maybe it would be a bad idea but then again being that free returns are allowed on this product I went head and took the chance and I’m happy to say it is not bad as some may say. And it was compatible with my Mac from 2019 so I would recommend it.</span>

<span>As a teacher who had to pivot to distance learning because of the pandemic, I searched for ways to be able to see what students were doing.

A student places a notebook on the keyboard and the teacher can watch as the student writes or draws or solves a problem.

<span>Aside from the flaw (which I will get to), the camera is pretty awesome.  I think the most impressive part of it for me is the battery life. I wish there were a 4K option, but it's a small sacrifice given the price point.  Now, the flaw...<br/><br/>You cannot change the aspect ratio of the camera.  It is always 16:9 which means that streaming on popular platforms like TikTok and Instagram shouldn't be a thing since these apps work best using 9:16 ratio. Now, if you're ok with simply recording versus livestreaming, you can lay the camera over to achieve 9:16.  Then, during the editing process, rotate the image.  Aside from that issue, the Mevo Start is a flawless budget camera.</span>

<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>I plugged this USB camera into my Windows 10 machine and it worked right away in Zoom. The quality looks fine. The one downside as others have mentioned here is that it really is zoomed in close to your face. I am sitting about 3-4 feet from the camera and I wish it would zoom out some more. Zoom does have an option to keep the aspect ratio which slightly helps, but it still is zoomed in pretty close to my face.</span>

<span>Copped this camera for the wife to do streaming on Twitch. Some of the shots were streamed up-close, some of it was at a distance. Both performed well visually, and created sweet visuals for the stream.<br/>The audio is straight trash tho. The noise cancelling is SO good, that you get "dim" audio.<br/>So, great camera for the bread. If you have 20 more bucks, tho, get the C920x.

<span>I got the webcam used for under five bucks. At that price I cannot really complain, however at the $30 retail there is better options. The webcam is listed as being 180P at 30 FPS however it is actually 25 FPS. This is not a big difference, but is worth pointing out. If you need a webcam, this works, but it definitely won't exceed your expectations.</span>
