<span>I just use my watches as time keepers, step counters, and for text notifications.  I don't use all the cute bells and whistles that most come with.  For my uses, it does exactly what I need it to do.  That said, this watch has outlasted any Apple watch I have had and a Fossil.  I'm really hard on my watches.  I work with my hands, and I work hard.  It's got welding pock marks all over the face, a few scratches, and has just taken a beating.  It's been stuck and crushed more times than I can remember.  The touch screen still works flawlessly.  The band broke a few months ago so I replaced it.  Still no problems with the watch itself.  Given the kind of life it's had, it is far better than any watch at 4x+ the price.  The app is decent too.  I have no complaints there.  I will buy another Amazfit when this one goes.</span>

<span>In terms of functions, features for the price - with the exception of Alexa integration - the Amazfit GTS 2e Smart Watch for Men performs as advertised.  As far as Alexa integration is concerned, didn't have a chance to try it.<br/><br/>Paired with the Zepp fitness app (it's preferred app), the device will satisfy the needs of people who need primarily basic to moderate levels of fitness info/data to monitor activity/workouts .  After five days of continuous use, the Amazfit GTS 2e device I currently have still had a 33% charge.<br/><br/>DOCUMENTATION - INSTALLATION AND USE<br/>Documentation on how to initially download and install the Zepp app onto a smartphone, then pair the device with the Zepp app and a smartphone is sparse.<br/><br/>To download and install the app on a smartphone, just scan the QR code contained on the first or second page of the booklet that comes with the watch.<br/><br/>Then, to pair the watch to the downloaded and installed Zepp app, power on the watch and scan the QR code on the watch with a smartphone camera, and let the Zepp app guide you through the pairing process.  Or, go into the Zepp app, select profile, My devices and follow the instructions to pair the watch to the app.<br/><br/>Learning to navigate through the device and utilize its features is better described through a series of screens on the watch when first using the device.  At its heart, the device is easy and intuitive to use.<br/><br/>ISSUE<br/>The overriding issue with the device is hardware quality.  In the course of two weeks, I had to return two of the devices.<br/><br/>The first device failed after about six days when swimming in a pool.  It appears the device flooded and would no longer power on.  Recall that the device is supposed to be water resistant to 5ATM (about 165ft or 50m).<br/><br/>In addition, the first device's battery had a low performance rate.  It required recharging on a nightly basis.  Again, recall that according to advertisements, the device should last up to about 14 days on a full charge.<br/><br/>The second device worked well for several days and had a good performing battery. That second device failed, though, after about five days when the touch screen stopped functioning.<br/><br/>AMAZON RETURN - REFUND - FULFILLMENT<br/>What, however, made the above experiences bearable and manageable - Amazon's return/refund/fulfillment process.  After reporting the first device failure, Amazon had a replacement device delivered within 24 hours.  When the second device failed, Amazon offered a full refund (they did not offer to replace the failed device with another GTS 2e).<br/><br/>The above transactions occurred online and each took less than 10 minutes to complete.<br/><br/>GOING FORWARD<br/>Given the features and functions of the device family, the price point, and the fast and efficient way in which Amazon handled the deliveries, returns, and refunds.  I'm willing try another version of the GTS; this time, the Amazfit Bip 3.  That device is scheduled to arrive within a day.  If the Amazon return/refund/delivery process were not as efficient as previously noted, odds are the next step would be to search for a different brand of fitness tracker.<br/><br/>OVERALL TAKEAWAYS:<br/>  1. Good fitness features and functions for both the device and it's associated app for the price.<br/>  2. Sparse instructions on how to pair watch to Zepp app on a smartphone.<br/>  3. Satisfactory screen instructions showing user how to navigate and use features on watch.<br/>  4. Variable device hardware quality.<br/>  3. Good and timely Amazon return/replacement/refund process.</span>

<span>05/22/22 - I have had this watch for a little over a week (using with a Pixel 6 Pro). My summary take is: lots of good with a few rough spots.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Price: For the cost and what it does, this thing is a great value.<br/>* Battery life: As I am writing this, it has been seven days since I took it off the charger and I am sitting at 37% batter. Pretty outstanding.<br/>* Comfort: This thing is comfortable. Numerous times I have caught myself looking down at my wrist the make sure I am still wearing it. I literally can't tell that I am still wearing it at times. It is so lightweight. Also, I don't feel compelled to remove it when I get sweaty, as I have for other smart watches I own. Even when it gets sweaty, it is easy to wipe clean.<br/>* Sleep tracking: I am certainly not a sleep tracking nut, so I can not speak to the nitty gritty of things like REM tracking and such. But I will say that this has accurately tracked my general sleep duration every night this past week. And it is automatic! I previously used an app on my phone to track my sleep duration, but I would have to manually start it and stop it each night/morning. But with this watch, I just go to sleep and it automatically tracks it.<br/>* Music control: This is an important feature to me because I like to be able to play/pause my phone's music without needing to pull my phone out of my pocket. The music controls are not quite as convenient as what you'll find on Wear OS, but it certainly gets the job done.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Google Fit integration: This is hit and miss. It does seem to accurately track my daily steps to Google Fit. Exercise activity is a different story. The only two exercise types I have explicitly done on the Amazfit are indoor biking and outdoor biking. In both cases, the Zepp app syncs those to Google Fit as "Others", not as their actual exercise types. Not a huge deal, but I wish those were synced to Google Fit as what they actually are.<br/>* Voice assistants: The watch comes with Alexa support built in. I have not tested this yet because I am not an Alexa user at all. My house and other devices are 100% Google Assistant driven. Coming from a primarily Wear OS smartwatch life, it would be nice if I could set Google Assistant up on the Amazfit as opposed to Alexa, but I am pretty sure that Alexa is the only option here.</span>

<span>After going through three Fitbits that have died on me after a year, I decided to try another brand of smart watch.  While I would love an Apple Watch, the need to charge every day is not ideal.  I don't want to have to add charging my watch each day to the many other things I have to remember to do.  So, I decided to try this Amazfit GTS 2 Mini. It is among the thinnest and lightest of smart watches, and I didn't want anything bulky on my arm.<br/><br/>I'm really happy with it so far!  It has taken about four days to really play with it and understand all that it can do.  For instance, today, i just discovered that I can create customized watch faces.  I thought I was stuck with the pre-made ones in their watch store.  This really makes me feel like I can make the watch very personalized to me.<br/><br/>I really like the long battery life.  I also like how immediately and quickly it syncs.  It used to take my old fitbits FOREVER to sync. I love that I can customize the shortcuts to only see the features I want in the order I want.  I love that I could customize the app to hide the features I won't use and put the features I will use in the order in which I want to see them.  I really like the countdown app, the cycle tracker, the meditation breathing,  the sleep tracking, the heart rate monitor, step tracker, the weather (although it could be more self-explanatory), the ability to control sound and move forward/backwards when playing music, podcasts, or other audio from my iphone.<br/><br/>My favorite feature is that I can have a plain digital clock display with the date, day, and steps when the screen is off.  That was the feature that sold me on the watch!<br/><br/>The screen is also beautiful.  The band is quite plain-looking relative to the beauty of the watch, but I'm just ordering a nicer band to put on it.<br/><br/>I got all of these many new features in a device that still cost much less than what I was paying for those Fitbits!!<br/><br/>I'm giving it four stars only because I had a few glitches that I hope won't become long-term issues.  One issue was that some of the notifications weren't coming through.  However, after restarting and changing a setting on my phone, it has been back to working fine.  The other issue was that after a day or two the digital clock was not displaying when the screen was off.  I'm not sure if that was a watch system issue or if I have a setting somewhere that was not configured properly.<br/><br/>It does have Alexa (to provide text-based responses), but I disabled it.  It only seemed to work when you have the Zepp app open on the phone.  Doing that would get so cumbersome that it would defeat the purpose of having it readily available on the watch.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with this watch!<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I'm actually bumping to five stars.  I am so much happier with this watch than my old Fitbits.  The screen is gorgeous.  I realized that I wasn't getting the digital screen-off clock because the watch turns it off when it thinks I'm sleeping.  After I wake and get moving, it starts displaying again.  Neat! The displays of notifications are still unclear to me, and it can't get the weather for the exact place where I live (only for the next county over).  Still, I'm really happy with this watch given its price and the other options out there on the market. I notice that I'm using the meditation/breathing bubble app quite often!<br/><br/>SECOND UPDATE: They need a better instruction manual for this watch.  Just when I think I had discovered all that it can do, I come across other features that I didn't know about.  I didn't realize that all of the watch faces can come with their own screen off watch faces.  Also, the watch faces you customize have their own bare bones screen off watch face (so that you can get the color of text you want for the screen off face). Being able to customize the screen off watch face has been awesome!  I also had not understood the "lit when wrist lift" setting.  I now have that off, which is what I prefer.  Realizing these functions saves battery life and helps me customize the watch even more to my style and liking.  As for battery life, in the first week, I got a little over four days of battery life on a full charge. However, I was playing with it a lot and I had not realized how to use the "lit when lift wrist" function.  Now that I turned off the "lit when lift wrist function," I'm getting longer battery life. Even happier with my watch!</span>

<span>To start off,  I have Afib and I use a samsung (S21) phone which has samsung health app that had a pretty accurate heart rate monitor but suddenly Samsung stopped supporting HR monitoring on their devices after the S10 i think.  So I had to use my old Fitbit hr 2 But it didn't have Spo2. So as I was shopping around for a Samsung watch I found this (Amazfit band 5). I was skeptical at first since it is made in China by Huami and its similar to Xaomi band 5 and one other but I really needed heart monitoring since I had 15 Afib/Heart attacks from 2013 to 2015. I was 310 lbs now 260 (6") and the Amazfit is in constant heart monitoring. But not only do I get hr and spo2, I get stress monitoring, PAI, sleep monitoring, atleast 30 different workouts, weather, set events, alarm, notifications, view text messages, rated 5 ATM, 15 days battery life if you don't add always monitoring,  i get about 8 to 9 days, it also shows who calls (no you can't answer the phone but if your phone is in the other room and someone calls you that you don't want to talk to,  you don't have to rush to get your phone and dismiss it 🤪. You can also add other accounts so your Wife, doctor or whoever you choose can see what you've done and challenge them to daily, weekly or monthly exercise schemes. All that to say it only cost me $60 for my wife and I and now my twins want one for sports,  Varsity bball, track, and just competition with their old dad 60 yrs old. My 4 older sons who are 32 to 43 are getting in this exercise thing with me.  Plus the mobile app allows you to change the face for free,  you get atleast 25 different faces. And you can get different color bands after market of course that are inexpensive. The only thing missing is GPS. It's not an Apple watch, nor a Samsung watch but it does everything I need it to do,  oh it tells time 🤪🤣 ok I'm just being silly but if you need a smart /exercise watch or as in my case, hr, spo2, sleep monitoring, calorie, running, walking, cycling, you can't go wrong and yes it's made in China The app is called Zepp and easy to maneuver through. Also Amazfit, since I'm basically selling this for you,  you can send me 2 more for my twins 👍🏾🤪. So for my fellow Afib and Heart disease brothers and sisters and those who just staying fit and health conscience, this is a great buy and you won't be disappointed unless you want an Apple or Samsung watch, but for the price you can't go wrong.👍🏾</span>

<span>1: First impression: Hard to open. The packaging did not indicate how you’re meant to actually open it. There’s a little grey tab (unmarked) on the side of the box you’re meant to pull so that it tears the box open for you. Took me way too long to figure it out.<br/>2: The instruction booklet is practically useless. I read it but it didn’t really help me learn to use the watch.<br/>3: The watch itself is not accessible for people with bad vision, lacking fine motor skills, or who are technologically inept (like me). Overall, I would not recommend this product for the elderly. The screen is very small. It is a touchscreen face but  again very small with means any and all text on it will also be very small. To turn it on there is a small grey oval on one end of the watch face. That’s the ‘Home’ button and it turns the watch on and returns the user to the main screen. You can swipe up or down to view the other features and you can tap to go further in depth with each feature.<br/>4: The strap is hard to put on snugly. I primarily use this to measure my heart rate so for me purposes I need it to lay flat against my wrist which I can do because my hands are affected by anything like arthritis or shaking.<br/>5: Accuracy wise I can only speak for the heart rate measurement feature (again as that the main reason I’m using it) and when comparing it to a metronome at the same bpm it reads at, it matches. I am confident in its accuracy. However, having said that, it is NOT a constant monitor. In the app settings you can adjust how frequently the watch measures your heart rate and the most frequent setting is every minute. Next intervals are every five minutes and every ten minutes.<br/>6: the app is very customizable but can be confusing because there are so many options but I like that it allows the user to hide features they won’t use so there’s less clutter.<br/>7: the battery lasts for a while and after a full day I’ve seen it drain about 10% ish so I’d assume it’s meant to last a week before needing a recharge.<br/><br/>I’m satisfied with it as a whole and it works for me and my purposes but I don’t think this is the best fit for everyone. It’s quality for the price and I’m happy with it.</span>

<span>****UPDATED REVIEW****<br/><br/>So I am about a week or so from the last review.<br/><br/>ONE cool thing I will note is that (at least on iPhone) there are widgets you can place on your phone screentop.<br/><br/>I left off the last review on 1/27 with 57% battery, recently charge on 1/25.<br/>Battery died on 1/29, I charged it on 1/30. Wore my iWatch on 1/30 and 1/31.<br/>Put the Amazefit Band on 2/1.  It's 2/3 (8am) I am at 51%.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned previously aside from the original charge, I've had to sync up with the app every time for all the feature to work/work properly.  This is highly annoying.<br/><br/>The last 2 charging times, the band is not syncing or remaining synced.<br/>For example it's telling me it's 60/64 degree's and sunny, sorry its 43 degree's (65/40) and raining.<br/>Or it's told me I haven't walked at all - literally 0 (ZERO) steps today - I've been up wrangling kids for the bus since 5am.  Three hours I haven't taken a single step?  When did I learn to fly?  My iPhone pedometer which hasn't even been on my person the whole time, has registered 218 steps.<br/><br/>I have to open the app and swipe the sync for it to sync, it doesn't automatically do it.<br/><br/>It's literally just NOT functioning in the basic capacity.<br/><br/>And I'm about 3 days out of the return window.....of course.<br/><br/>Guess my kids just got a new toy.<br/><br/>Back to the have to charge every night iWatch.  At least I can answer calls on it, and it has a calculator and memo recorder.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Has everything you want, maybe more so.  Lacks accuracy.<br/><br/>(Review is in compared to an iWatch.)<br/><br/>The main reason I wanted a watch/band is: a watch, a pedometer, a rudimentary fitness tracker (including walking, treadmill, cardio and swimming), a sleep tracker (including duration, REM, # of times awaken during the night, and quality) &amp; continuous heart rate monitor.  The stress monitor would be a plus, but only useful if the information is recorded.  And of course - and LONG battery life.<br/><br/>Compared to the iWatch/iPhone technology, the AmazeFit Band 5 is<br/><br/>Watch - Hello it's a watch - they both probably pull time from the NIST.<br/><br/>Pedometer - Well not only did I measure the iWatch, the AmazeFit Band 5, the Xaomi Mi Band 6, the Garmin VivoActive 4S, and my Treadmill (ReeBok GT40x).  I reviewed both steps and mileage.  They were all wildly different.  I ultimately chose the AmazeFit because it was the closest to meeting the treadmills numbers.<br/>However, after about 4 weeks, this band has become quite different than the treadmill.  Almost 1/2mile to 3/4mile off from the treadmill.  After each workout the band does let me calibrate the workout, and some times I can "match" it up to the mileage I did on the treadmill - but oftentimes I cannot match the total workout, which for me is very annoying.  I didn't do all of that for nothing.<br/>* I am unaware of whether that only affects my "workout" mileage, or if it affects my daily step total also.  I have not been able to see a correlation to daily steps - since that continues on through the day after my workout.  (And the treadmill doesn't tell me steps, of course)<br/>** One other thing to note about the pedometer while in "workout" mode that really bothers me is that, if I am not CONTINUOUSLY swinging my arm it will go in to "PAUSE" mode and stop registering my movement.  And I DO MEAN CONTINUOUSLY.  Like if I literally just not swing my arm or if I take a sip of water or brush my hair out of my face I have use the hand that doesn't have the band or it will "PAUSE".  That is very annoying.<br/>*** I have not had a chance to use it in the pool yet, so I cannot attest to its stroke counting or water durability.<br/><br/>Rudimentary Fitness Tracker - I personally do not enjoy the presentation of the information in the APP.<br/>(I do not particularly enjoy it in iHealth either)<br/><br/>Sleep Tracker - Again, the presentation in the APP is not ideal.  I understand there are a lot of tid-bits presented.  However, if you don't look at it each day, you are unable to view some pieces of information, such as REM, Times awake, Amount of Deep Sleep or Light Sleep.  You can see they are there - just not the individual data.  Which makes it redundant.  When you select the date it only tells you the total amount of sleep for that day.<br/><br/>Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring - As similar with other reports - if you don't check it that day and get whatever information you need, you wont be able to access.  For today only, you can see what time your heart rate was at "xyz," - but yesterday or any day prior you will only see the lowest and highest readings, with no timestamps.  There are no alerts for spikes or dips either.<br/><br/>Stress Monitor - I can manually run it on my band, but the APP doesn't recognize it.  The last registered reading was 1/1/22.<br/><br/>Battery Life - Finally the MAIN Reason I chose this, and did not continue on with my old iWatch.  In late December it had a 15 day battery life.<br/>* You have to reconnect with the APP after each charge or some functions will not work, or sync back to the APP.<br/>My iWatch had buckled down to about 18hours of battery charge, which was useless to me and with it's pedometer seemingly unfixable with every re-calibration trick tried, I was ready to move on.  This was approximately $40, it had a "15day" battery life, it was the closest pedometer accuracy I could find and the app wasn't terrible.  As of late January, 4 weeks later - I have had to charge this band 3 times.<br/>Charged when received 12/28<br/>wore AmazeFit Band 12/29 - 1/13, (14 days)<br/>charged 1/14, wore the iWatch.<br/>wore AmazeFit Band 1/15-1/24,  (10 days)<br/>charged 1/25, wore the iWatch.<br/>1/26-  (2 days and at 57% currently).<br/>* It does NOT take all day to charge, I just did not want to interrupt my step count once the day started by change watches midday.<br/>** I do not know, nor assume that it is a trend, that the battery life will continue to drop.  It's only been 2 charges post full usage, so a lot of factors go in to that.  I let the battery drain completely down, because I understand that it the best way to preserve the battery.  If this is a significant trend I will update.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>As most people say - it's a good watch for $40.  Don't expect an iWatch or a Garmin.  Don't ever expect to compare a $40 item to a $300 item.  That said if you're frustrated with the APP or interfaces of iPhone or Garmin or Samsung and want something more straight forward this could work.  Or if your resigned to not be fully on board with anything/everything, then you'll be happier to pay less at less for a fully functional (in the overall sense) product such as this than paying gobbloads for Apple, Garmin, Samsung, etc.  I will say this - I do like the construction of this product.  I don't feel like I need to buy a protective layer for it or worry about my clumsiness.  It's hearty and fits well on my wrist without being too bulky.</span>

<span>UPDATED 12-31-2020 [This a a real review]<br/>Set up is easy as you download the Zepp app and pair the watch to your bluetooth, then register to sign in. The little band is a bit hard to fasten on your wrist at first as you get used to it, and I have had it come off in bed and once just in everyday use possibly because it wasn't fully secured but more likely due to catching the closure button on something. The read outs are easy to use although the instructions and explanations of functions are somewhat vague. The measurements to input some manual things like blood pressure, body temperature, etc., are only in UK measurements so you have to convert the numbers. Hopefully they will change this for imperial measurements, too. In your profile the standard measurements can be set to imperial or UK so there is no confusion seeing your readouts on your band or in the app.<br/><br/>The band itself provides the ability to change around the menus so those you're most interested in can be scrolled to up or down, left or right, quicker.  You can rotate your wrist toward you to activate one of the chosen 45+ provided  watch faces (the automatic watch face reveal can be scheduled to turn off when you're sleeping) or you can just tap the lower part of the face and the length of time for viewing can be changed, too. Then you can scroll the menu so that side to side brings up Alexa/ Notifications in one directions and Weather/Heart rate in the other as they repeat in a circle. Pulling the screen down reveals More/Workout/Weather/Events/Breathing/Stress/Notifications/SpO2/Heart Rate/PAI/Status before returning back the the watch face.<br/><br/>MORE gives you options: DND/Alarm/Camera/Music/Stopwatch/Timer/Find Device/Silent/World Clock/Band Display/Settings. When you use the app to download one of the 45+ watch faces (band display) at least five remain as a choice in the Band Display section for quick change. Settings allows further adjustments to the watch face use and ability to reboot.<br/>WORKOUT: Outdoor Running/Treadmill/Cycling/Indoor Cycling/Walking/Elliptical/Rowing Machine/Yoga/Jump Rope/Pool Swimming/Freestyle<br/>WEATHER gives you current local conditions and forecast for the next six days. Temperature/Humidity/Level/Quality<br/>EVENTS are reminders of upcoming things you input by speaking into the watch.<br/>BREATHING is an exercise to calm and relax you.<br/>STRESS measures your level between 0 and 100 based on heart and pulse ox and other factors.<br/>SPO2, also known as oxygen saturation, is a measure of the amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood relative to the amount of hemoglobin not carrying oxygen. The body needs a certain level of oxygen in the blood or it will not function as efficiently. In fact, very low levels of SpO2 can result in very serious symptoms. You can quickly test here to obtain your SpO2.<br/>HEART RATE measures the beats per minute, BPM, and can be set to check this periodically or manually here.<br/>PAI is the physical activity intelligence that takes data to provide a number up to 100 showing your activity level, and this number climbs as days pass and it automatically computes the number. You can quickly do a manual test here, too, following the on screen directions.<br/>STATUS shows your steps, calories used, distance walked, idle alerts (if so set), and previous days step counts.<br/><br/>ALEXA is a nice addition and works well with responses in text format. It is not necessary to say the name, Alexa, just scroll to menu and input your command or  question. I often use my Band 5 to turn on/off or command smart lights, plugs, and smart light strips. I can walk in a room and command a light, or change the temperature on the Ecobee Thermostat, if so desired. Very quick responses to questions and computations make this a very nice feature.<br/>NOTIFICATION work very well and promptly show on the watch face to be easily read, and can be scrolled if a long message is received.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE so far seems to be on average around two week at least before a 2 hour charge is necessary using the round magnetically attached plug and short cord. I charged mine after 12 days at 17% remaining charge so it would have gone a full two weeks before going dead.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION. There is a lot to explore and I have continued too use a Fitbit Versa for steps and distance as well as another app, MapMyRun, to plot the GPS path and distance. I have not gotten the Amazfit Band 5 to accurately give my distance and show a GPS plotted route like the MapMyRun app provides. However, the step count is more accurate. It may well be that the Versa and MapMyRun app are interfering with the GPS so that Band 5 cannot calculate this properly. I will experiment in time and work with developers to see if a solution can be found, but it's not a big problem for me. MapMyRun's browser data and history with routes is quite satisfactory and I have found history is available when you use the icon in the top right of the Zepp app and see under Exercise Data the Exercise Record where period of time can be selected and individual dates show full data (again, the routes shown and distance/steps are wrong, so far, and still experimenting with this error). The Versa serves as a watch and notifications I can easily read. Band 5 does not provide the ability to switch functions while using the Workout function, but it does show notifications. So you cannot use the Band 5 for anything else during work outs, if I am not mistaken. Note that outside in the sunlight it is very hard to read the screen, however, unless you turn the brightness up under setting to maximum from the default applied to conserve battery.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased with all the data, including the SLEEP DATA it provides for helping the wearer to better health. A beta Breathing tracking function can be set to check for problems while you sleep and it scored me 99 out of 100. As you turn on things like this it does warn of extra battery use. It could be, and probably will be tweaked so the wearer can more customize it to the wearer's own needs and life. For the price, it is great, and now there is an inexpensive compatible replacement band assortment in 15 colors for easy change to coordinate with your daily wardrobe. As I wear and use the Band 5 I may add more to this review.<br/>UPDATE AFTER DST: Strangely the sleep record is not recording on the date it should and runs a day behind. Reporting errors or suggested improvements seems to go unnoticed as the step count is still showing the miles lower than actual, e.g., 3 miles is shown as approximately 2.5 even though the steps are correct, so the stride distance is wrong and possibly due to the GPS not working correctly with my Moto G6 Plus watch. No fix so I depend on my cell's app, MayMyRun, to accurately record this for me.</span>

<span>UPDATE May 2022: I'm still a big fan of this product and have made a few updates to my initial review(s), but the bottom line is that it's held up to initial impressions.  I ended up knocking off a star just because there are a few improvements that can be made, but it's still very solid.<br/><br/>==============================<br/><br/>I purchased the Fitbit Charge 5 as an upgrade from my Charge 3.  I skipped the Charge 4 since I didn't really need/want the new features of that model, but the allure of a color display with the same lengthy, weeklong battery life was enough to make me upgrade to the Charge 5.  I won't cover all the features of the Charge 5 since there are plenty of other places that go into great detail, and I may update this review after I get more use out of it.<br/><br/>WHO SHOULD BUY A FITBIT CHARGE?<br/>The Fitbit Charge is great if your primary use is as a lightweight fitness tracker.  I prefer the Fitbit Charge over the Apple Watch and other smartwatches due to its lightweight nature, weeklong battery life, and my lack of need for fancier smartwatch functionality.  If you like the extra bells &amp; whistles of a smartwatch and don't mind a heavier watch that needs to be charged every day or three, then you may want to skip the Fitbit Charge.  Also, if you're a die-hard Apple user who needs integration with the Apple Health app, then you'll also need to look elsewhere because there's no data flowing between the apps in either direction; thankfully, the Fitbit app is quite good and does integrate with a number of other apps.<br/><br/>IS IT WORTH UPGRADING FROM THE CHARGE 3/4?<br/>It mainly depends on how much you value a better, color display.  The MSRP on a Charge 5 is $180 (though, I'm sure the sale price will drop during the holiday season), while the MSRP on a Charge 4 is $150; though, at this point, everyone's selling the Charge 4 (and 3) well below MSRP, especially if you buy refurbished.<br/><br/>IMPRESSIONS:<br/>- Initial setup was fairly smooth.  I had to connect it to the charger to get it started up.  Transitioning from my Charge 3 to the Charge 5 in the app was easy enough.  There was a firmware update notice (the firmware enables the EDA sensor), and that update was a little buggy &amp; required a few attempts before it succeeded (at one point, I needed to reboot my Fitbit).<br/>- ECG monitor became available via firmware update 11/9/2021.  I had some connection issues while trying to run it but got it to work eventually.  I don't have any arrhythmia issues, so while it's a nifty feature, it's ultimately useless for me.<br/>- The Daily Readiness Score also became available 11/9/2021.  It's only available for Premium subscribers.<br/> It takes 4 days before it starts functioning &amp; a couple weeks to "tune".  Overall, I'd say this is not terribly useful.  If you work out on a consistent basis &amp; get a decent amount of sleep, then it's always a great day to work out!  That is, you'll remain in the Good to Excellent range (30 &amp; above).  For reference, I typically work out 4-5 days/week spending 30-40 min on cardio &amp; 30-40 min on weights, which ends up being 110-160 Zone Minutes on those days when combined with whatever other Zone Minutes I rack up when not working out. But if you take a week off or so &amp; return to working out, then you may dip below 30 into the Low score range where it says you should prioritize recovery.  I also noticed that if you forget to wear your Fitbit to bed, it can throw off your score; it sent my score plummeting for no good reason otherwise.<br/> Also, perhaps not surprisingly, the Readiness Score seems to be primarily reflective of your cardio workout.  It will classify my "Activity" as "Light" on some days when I spend a fair amount of time on weight training that doesn't really sustain an elevated heart rate (and less on cardio).<br/>- There's no longer a "home" button on the side of the display to "Return" or access additional menus.  This took a little time to adjust to, but I'm generally okay with it, especially since the touchscreen is noticeably more responsive than the Charge 3.  Now, you must swipe right to return to the prior screen, and you can also double-tap in most cases to return to the home screen; though, the double-tap can be finicky.  Would I prefer to have a "home" button again?  Yes.  (Now, the sides of the device used for the EDA sensor &amp; ECG monitor).<br/>- The display is much, much better than the Charge 3/4.  Brighter with much higher resolution.  and of course, color.<br/>- The display has 3 brightness settings; however, the difference between dim, normal, and max is rather subtle; they're all pretty bright, and this is unfortunate because it's a little too bright for dark rooms in my opinion.  I liked the dim, auto, and normal settings on my Charge 3 much better.  Hopefully, this is something that will be fixed in a future firmware update (assuming, the Charge 5 still has the sensor that allows for an "auto" setting).<br/>- The "up to 7 days" battery life is not a lie.  The battery life lasts me about a week with my brightness set to "normal", which is the same as my old Charge 3.  I do not use the built-in GPS nor the always-on display (both of which are a significant drains on the battery), but I do average 6-8 hours/week of active exercise time.  And, since the "dim" brightness setting is bright enough for me, I use it all the time, which translates to even better battery life.  Pretty amazing considering the brighter, color display.<br/>- The Charge 5 does a better job of automatically turning the display on at the turn of the wrist.  My Charge 3 wouldn't always turn on or would require me to turn my wrist more than what felt natural.  The Apple Watch is still superior with regard to automatically turning on when looking since there is a slight delay with the Charge 5 after turning your wrist (and, it still doesn't always turn on).<br/>- The wrist band that's included is a nicer feeling silicone material instead of the plastic one that came with the Charge 3/4.  The "small" strap on the Charge 5 band is also smaller than the "small" on the Charge 3/4.  On the Charge 5, I use the last or next to last notch on the band (i.e. the strap is basically at its largest, most expanded size), but with the Charge 3 strap, I still had 3 or 4 empty notches to work with.  Not a big deal since they include small &amp; large bands, but something to consider if you purchase additional bands.  I did end up purchasing the Sport band, which does have more notches to work with.  Be sure to use Fitbit's sizing tool on their website before purchasing extra wrist bands since they do vary based on which one you get.<br/>- The heart rate monitoring is nice &amp; accurate like the Charge 3.  I run on a treadmill with a Tickr X (1st gen) chest strap, and after the first few minutes of running when my heart rate is more stable, the readings between the Charge 5 &amp; Tickr X are either the same or only off by a bpm or two.  It's less accurate when doing sprints/HIIT since it tends to lag behind the Tickr X, but it's still in the ballpark (albeit, delayed).<br/>- The EDA sensor seems like a waste for me.  Along the lines of the guided breathing exercises in the Charge 3, it's just something that I don't care to use, and I question its accuracy/validity anyway.<br/>- I'm not sure if this was introduced with the Charge 4, but there's a daily Stress Management Score now.  The number seems fairly meaningless, since it's somewhat of a mystery as to how it's calculated.  Yes, Fitbit tells you what the general parameters are (heart rate, sleep, activity) &amp; premium members get to see how the sub-scores feed into the overall score (see below), but in the end, it just seems pretty meaningless to me.<br/>- I think this may have changed with the Charge 4, but it no longer tracks the number of floors you've climbed (no big deal as it was wildly inaccurate), and it counts Active Zone Minutes instead of Active Minutes now.  Fitbit's website has more details on Active Minutes vs Active Zone minutes.<br/>- There's 23 clock faces to choose from.  Most of them only display one stat (e.g. HR, steps, etc.) at a time (though, you can usually cycle through them all by tapping the screen), which is unfortunate.  Hopefully, they'll add more data-rich clock faces, but overall, it's nice to see them making use of the colorful, higher resolution display.<br/>- The charging cable functions a lot better since it magnetically clips to the Fitbit (like an Apple Watch does to its charger).  I believe it's the same charging cable as the Fitbit Luxe.<br/>- My Charge 5 somewhat regularly (once every day or two) has trouble syncing with the app.  It has gotten better over time &amp; usually just requires me to refresh the app (by dragging down at the top of the screen of the phone app).  At worst, I'll need to restart the app, and once I had to restart my Fitbit device itself.  Overall, not a big deal.  Just an occasional annoyance.<br/><br/>FITBIT PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP:<br/>I generally dislike paying for subscriptions since the cost of them can add up to something pretty substantial over time.  The Fitbit Premium Membership isn't exactly cheap at $10/month or $80/year; though, you get 6 months for free with the purchase of your Charge 5.  If you actually use many/all of its features, then it may be worthwhile, but for me, it isn't (i.e. I won't be paying for membership when my free trial runs out in a week or so).  The Daily Readiness Score &amp; Health Metrics Dashboard are the only premium features I routinely looked at, but I question their overall usefulness/practicality.  Here's a rundown of what you get for your money:<br/>- Daily Readiness Score: see comments above in IMPRESSIONS section - in short, not terribly useful.<br/>- Health Metrics Dashboard (see attached pic): graphs/data for Breathing Rate, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Temperature, Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Resting Heart Rate (RHR).  The RHR data is already available for non-Premium users &amp; you can view you most recent SpO2 reading on the device, but the rest of the stats appear to only be available to Premium members.  The graphs are actually kinda crummy; there's two types: 1) one graph allows you to vary the time scale to view 7, 30, or 90 days, but you have to visually line up the dot with the values on the y-axis to determine the actual reading for each dot, and 2) another type of graph shows 7 days at a time with individual readings on the graph, but you can't change the time frame/scale of this graph.  It would be a lot nicer if they made these graphs larger &amp; interactive (so you could change the time scale on the fly &amp; tap on the data points to see the reading).<br/>- Wellness Report: You can generate a PDF wellness report to be emailed.  While it provides a summary of HR, weight, activity, &amp; sleep trends over the course of 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months, it's lame that you can't just view this directly in the app.<br/>- Stress Management Score details (see attached pic): extra details on your score including the sub-scores that feed into it: Responsiveness, Exertion Balance, &amp; Sleep Patterns.... still not sure how meaningful any of this is.<br/>- Sleep Score details (see attached pic): there's a different detailed view of your sleep score; you get sub-scores for Time Asleep, Deep and REM, and Restoration, but I believe all the graphs are the same for non-premium users, so I'm not sure that this offers much more insight that the non-premium view does; I suppose you get to see how much each sub-score accounts for the overall score.<br/>- Instructional stuff: There are various workout routines, guided meditations, food programs, &amp; sleep programs you can look up &amp; do.<br/>- Games &amp; Challenges: You can participate in various fitness games/challenges, which might motivate you to work out more.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the Charge 5 is a nice upgrade from my beloved Charge 3, and for me, it was worth paying the extra bucks.</span>

<span>Some background info: I have been a triathlete for years. I have used Garmin devices half of my life and I track data most of the time such as running dynamics, cadence, and heart rate. I have prior history of using Fitbit watch for 2 years back around 2017-18. Now, I got the Charge 5 because I don’t want the bulkiness from the Sense because Charge 5 practically tracks the same thing as Sense (except a few things like the ABC so no stairs climbed will be measured). I tried Charge 5 for 3 days (including sleep and exercising) and one of the days I compared it side-by-side against a Garmin watch.<br/><br/>My quick summary: it is an excellent fitness tracking band but if you crave for something more than just basic tracking, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I tried it under free fitbit app because I wanted to see what I get from the free app since the membership price per year is outrageous (I am aware there is a 6-month free trial).<br/><br/>Here is my in-depth analysis:<br/>Wear/appearance/design: I did like the charge 5 and its band. It is comfortable once you’ve adjusted to the correct area. I often forget I was wearing it most of the time. I have no problem wearing it overnight and no skin rash or anything after the 3rd day. I wear dress shirts during the day and it is slim and nicely hiding under my cuff. The display is vibrant and easy to read.<br/><br/>All-day continuous heart rate tracking: Their 24/7 PurePulse tech records your rate every 5 minutes. Garmin does it every 2 min. When I was wearing my garmin + charge 5 together for 24 hours, I can see a big deviation between both devices. The RHR for fitbit says 54-55 for me and for Garmin (from years of history tracking me) says 46-48 RHR. The HR graph is also friendlier to read on Garmin than fitbit. There is also more HR fluctuation throughout the day seen from fitbit than Garmin (perhaps because it measures every 5 min?). All in all, it is a bit questionable for me here.<br/><br/>EDA and ECG: I tried them but I don’t know if they are accurate. Even if they are not, it only tells me if I am sinus rhythm or not. I guess these are good features for individuals with heart concern or family hx of heart diseases.<br/><br/>SpO2, Heart Rate Variability, breathing rate, and skin temp: Yes fitbit tracks them, but you cannot interact with/open the graph to see how you did throughout the night/day. Garmin tracks respiration, pulse-ox, HR, and stress in real-time and I can track on the graph exactly when and what 24/7.<br/><br/>Steps tracking: For some reason, Fitbit is always ~250-300 steps more than Garmin at the end of the day. Not sure why but that is not a big difference. Charge 5 has no ABC so it doesn’t track floors climbed.<br/><br/>Sleep tracking: As mentioned above, RHR in fitbit is higher than my Garmin. It may be due to the type of sensor or other errors I’m not sure yet.<br/><br/>SmartTrack: I have done a 10k track workout and a 1.5 hr ride with some tempo zones 2-3. On the run, fitbit sensed it and the GPS is somewhat accurate (but it’s like spaghetti lines, not precise). HR tracking was fair compared to my garmin wrist HR. Then for cycling, the fitbit sensed it but started recording late. It also inaccurately track my HR to be much lower than my garmin heart rate chest strap that I have been using for years. Fitbit says my highest HR was 142 v.s. 166 on Garmin. I know garmin wins in this one for sure. Fitbit also doesn’t allow me to look at my exercising HR graph. If I go to another tab to see my overall HR tracking, the graph does not appear accurate at all. It is simply disappointing for cycling. I didn’t even want to bother trying it in the pool.<br/>Free Fitbit app impression: I did my research on this prior purchasing. The only thing the Premium will get me is the 30 day trends, stress management, videos (which you can easily find online these days), and few other things I don’t care for. If you don’t care much for detailed graphs and numbers, free is enough for you. Premium is a rip-off.<br/><br/>Battery: it went from 100% to about 18% by the end of the 3rd day. I only sync with my phone twice a day (AM and PM). I left always-on display off. So 7-day battery life seems to be a long-stretch.<br/><br/>Overall: I’d give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars mainly because it does a good job tracking things but I don’t think it is there yet. I have also considered my possible bias towards it since I am comparing it with Garmin. But with my 2 years previous background with Fitbit, I do think Fitbit has improved a lot since 2017 but still need a bit more. I do think Charge 5 is great for a fitness-minded, non-competitive or non-data driven person.</span>

<span>Had to replace a FitBit Charge 3 (FB3) and FitBit Charge 5 (FB5) was $80 cheaper, so went with that figuring that improvements would be the majority of what I experienced. . . . surprise!!<br/><br/>GOOD:<br/>  -  the time needed to update and sync between FB5 and app is almost instantaneous when the app is opened and is a great change - no more, "hold, this is taking longer than expected" and sometimes having to restart the process on the FB3<br/><br/>  -  sleep tracking is much more consistent and in-depth with scores immediately available; it's even smart enough to know when you have taken a nap<br/><br/>  -  the addition of an EKG like monitor is a nice function although I'm not sure how accurate it is<br/><br/>NOT SO GOOD:  it feels like there's super annoying and judgmental life coach and salesman packed in there<br/><br/>  -  Alarm function:  the FB3 snooze feature was simple: swipe to snooze and catch a few more minutes; with FB5: the "tap" feature to view the screen to access snooze or turn off features appears to be programmed to require a much stronger "tap" (aka "you asked me to wake you up - I'm going to make you work for it!").<br/><br/>  Once you get to snooze and choose it, the alarm/vibrate function continues on for another 2-3 seconds prompting a gut check/stress moment of "uh-oh, did I not touch the right button or did I actually set the snooze?" (thanks for the use of stress and concern to help "make sure" that I get up at the time I asked for, Coach!") and the "sweet spot" and strength of tap required to access the snooze/shut off feature after consecutive choices to snooze become more finite and you might feel like you have to punch it to be able to turn the alarm off<br/><br/>  select "turn off alarm" and, of course, the alarm instantly stops ("Good job being responsible and getting up like we agreed!  You won't have to work to rest a little longer!")<br/><br/>  -  Being uber connected has it's ups and downs - including security and privacy concerns.  The Salesman in my FB5 somehow seems to have randomly programmed the system to buzz my wrist and make me look at a reminder on my screen that I should enter my credit card information so that I can use my FB5 at swipe or tap and pay retailers;  I chose not to give you that information when I set the app and device up, I don't need to be hounded about more ways to move money out of my wallet!<br/><br/>  -  Be sure the charger is fully attached!  The FB3 had a charging cord with a plastic "dock" that you knew it was locked in and working because of the click and the change on screen to show that it was charging.  The FB5 has a magnet based charging interface about the size of the back of the FB5 and there is a right way (look to align the gold dots on the FB5 with the interface) and lots of opportunity to not get it right.  The magnet isn't designed to "lock" the FB5 in place for charging.  Charging happens via the back of the FB, which is surrounded by wristband - depending on style creating a risk of setting it down to charge and having the wristband press against the cord and dislodge the charger.<br/><br/>  -  FB5 uses battery power more quickly than the FB3.  I could easily go about a week between FB3 charges.  The FB5 has a max of 4-5 days and takes much longer to recharge - to the tune of hours vs. 45 minutes to an hour starting from about 20% remaining charge.<br/><br/>  -  "water lock" sounds like a good feature to have.  If you're thinking it's an extra layer of protection for your FB, it isn't!  Water lock is simply designed to change the sensitivity of the FB face and reduce it so that as you take a shower, the water beads don't inadvertently "tap" the screen and access the FB interactivity and do something you don't want.  Oh the irony of the sensitivity to water and the strength required to wake up!!<br/><br/>  -  Introducing the FitBit Commander Fashionista!  Color choices for the FB5 wristband:  whatever the source store decides!  I had no other apparent choice than the "Lunar White" which was enough for a couple people to ask, "What are you wearing?"  Score one for the Salesman in there!  Another $13.99 spent to move away from forced color "choices".  Unlike the FB3, there does appear to be many more materials, styles, and color choices for other wristbands if you don't get what you like.</span>

<span>Tl;dr The Charge 5 could be great, but fitbit won't allow it and the measurements are very suspect for me.<br/><br/>The Charge 5 has a lot of potential, however, Fitbit has crippled the device, and the application.  For starters, the sensors.  The Charge 5 has both an SpO2 sensor and a body temperature sensor.  However, the device doesn't make full use of them.  You cannot take a real-time SpO2 reading or temperature reading.  You can't even access the information in the app or online account.  SpO2 is given as high and low averages which isn't helpful at all.  You don't have a reference percentage so the averages really don't provide useful information.  The same goes for the temp readings.  The application only tells you fluctuations in your average temperature, but not what the actual reading is.  To top it off, the measurements are only taken when you're asleep which is useless for fitness tracking.  The ability to still actual data, and take real-time on-demand measurements would vastly improve the usefulness of the device.<br/><br/>Sleep tracking isn't accurate for me.  It consistently records time awake as either light sleep or rem sleep.  There were a few nights where I was in bed awake, TAKING AN ECG READING OR USING THE FITBIT APP and the following morning the device registered that time as being in either light sleep or deep sleep.  If the device can't differentiate between being actively used and the user being asleep it makes a lot of the other sleep readings suspect.  There are also times during the night when I've awoken, gotten out of bed for awhile and returned and they're not logged as time being awake.  I've tried to adjust the sleep sensitivity and it makes no difference.  If I am in bed reading before going to sleep the device will track the inactive period between getting into bed and falling asleep as actually being asleep.  To its credit it does show it as being restless sleep, but still inaccurately recorded as being asleep.<br/><br/>The EDA sensor feature requires the user to pinch the sides of the Charge 5 for 3 minutes in order to take a reading.  That's a really long time when you're trying to pinch something that small and hold still.  By the end of every scan my fingers and/or wrist were cramped.  The device must be worn while scanning so holding it comfortably in your hand isn't an option.<br/><br/>The mobile application is confusing to navigate.  It shows metrics on a dashboard, which may be helpful for some users, but in order to find detailed information you have to dig around for it.  The settings are not intuitive and there are an extremely limited amount of options for clock faces, about 24 of them.  There is no real app support for the device, only the handful of fitbit branded apps that are available through the app. The fitbit SDK doesn't support the Charge series so creating your own apps or clock faces isn't an option.<br/><br/>There are a few 3rd party mobile applications (for Android at least, not sure about iPhone) that allow you to collect and analyze your data in much more meaningful ways, but still are not very helpful.  To their credit Fitbit does allow users to download their raw data from their account, but in doing so I've noticed that a lot of data is missing.  Sleep data is hit or miss, as is heart rate data.  This is doing a complete archive export and viewing the json files, so the data should be there, but isn't.  I can see it on the app, and in my account dashboard so it exists, but just isn't being provided.<br/><br/>Activity tracking isn't very accurate.  I bike to work every day and most days those commutes are not tracked unless I manually tell the device that I'm about to start a biking workout.  The minimum length of time that can be set for auto-tracking activities is 10 minutes with the default being 15.  If I am pedaling fast, or not slowed down by traffic, my bike commute can be less than 10 minutes.  But even when going for a ride in the evening that lasts an hour or more the device doesn't always track that I'm biking.  When activities are not tracked it affects the daily readiness score, which looks are previous activities, combined with sleep, to calculate how ready for the day you are.  Lacking actual data on activities, and suspect sleep tracking data, the readiness score is rather meaningless.<br/><br/>This may be an accurate device for some people, but for me it just isn't.  The fact that fitbit intentionally cripples devices and makes analyzing your own data incredibly difficult suggests that maybe this isn't the best company to buy a product from if you want to be in control of what you see.  That may be fine for some users.  I'll be returning the Charge 5 because it doesn't meet my needs and isn't very well supported.  Perhaps I'll try the Versa 3 or Sense since they are better supported, but the lack of data analyses tools is a big impediment to taking the devices seriously.</span>

<span>A couple months back, after more than 8 years of service, my trusty Garmin Forerunner 60 bit the dust.  In need of a new watch to help record my workouts, I surveyed the field of new fitness watches and activity trackers and settled on a Pebble2 +HR.  I loved the relatively sleek design of the Pebble and the customizable watch faces, but the companion app lacked a lot of basic features and less than two weeks after receiving mine, Pebble announced their acquisition by FitBit along with a statement indicating they could not promise the watch would remain functional in the future.  So, back went the Pebble, and I ordered up this Garmin Forerunner 35 (FR35) as a replacement.  After living with it for about a month, here's how it stacks up.<br/><br/>HARDWARE<br/>Overall the hardware is acceptable, although far from stylish.  I do have a couple of quibbles though.  The "Analog" face, isn't completely terrible, but the "Digital" face is ugly.  The digital time readout is legible, but the giant Bluetooth connection indicator and battery status stick out like a sore thumb.  My Pebble offered a much more elegant face (along with dozens of other options) that was able to show a digital time display along with the current weather, current HR, and current step total.  It would be nice to see something more along those lines offered here.  Another minor complaint is with the wrist strap.  While plenty comfortable for 24/7 wear, the diagonal line texture seems to trap chlorine and soap residue and requires a thorough scrubbing every few days.  I'm also disappointed to see that it's connected to the watch via two star-head screws.  When the strap inevitably fails, I'll have to hope Garmin has replacements available.  A standard watch strap would have been much preferred here.<br/><br/>WORKOUTS<br/>I have had the chance to try the FR35 out across a varied set of workouts including swims, indoor treadmill runs, and outdoor runs.  When outdoors the GPS tracking is as accurate as my phone's GPS.  I compared measured workout distances between the FR35 and MapMyRun and found the total distance measured to be extremely close.  The heart rate accuracy provided by the wrist strap is good, much better than what I saw on the Pebble, but it's slower to react to changes than the Wahoo chest strap I compared it against.  Given an additional 5-10 seconds to respond to a change in effort, it seemed to +/- 5bpm compared to the chest strap about 95% of the time.  If that error bothers you, you can pair it with an ANT+ chest strap during workouts instead (like the Wahoo Tickr or any recent Garmin strap).<br/><br/>ACTIVITY TRACKING<br/>The FR35 seems to count steps fairly accurately.  It does a pretty good job of rejecting random arm movements that otherwise inflate step counts.  While I generally find the distance calculation based on pedometer step counts to be laughably inaccurate, I was reasonably impressed at how close the total calculated distance to the actual distance on a treadmill run.  While I wouldn't necessarily rely on this to measure out mile splits, it's close enough for casual distance guesstimation.<br/><br/>The sleep tracking works quite well and is automatic.  I find it logs my actual sleep and wake times within about +/- 10 minutes of when I actually fall asleep and it does a good job of rejecting time spent reading in bed.  The sleep tracking graphs breakdown sleep into light and deep sleep periods (although, without knowing how these periods are calculated it's hard to read too much into these) as well as movement levels.  I'll be very interested to monitor my sleep levels over time (hours and quality) to see how my general feeling of wellness changes as the amount of quality sleep time I'm getting varies.<br/><br/>It's hard to comment on the accuracy of calorie tracking without access to a physiology lab.  The calories burned are tracked, and it's kind of useful to look at the trend over time.  I wouldn't rely on the number of calories burned as reported by the watch to be super accurate though (if, say you're monitoring caloric input/output).<br/><br/>NOTIFICATIONS<br/>When connected with my phone, the notifications are usable.  Text messages and phone calls (and other notifications if I desire) buzz through to the watch face.  It's enough to know there's something that may require my attention and a glance at the screen provides enough of a summary to decide if I need to pull out my phone or deal with the notification later.  While I have found getting these alerts on my wrist pretty useful, this particular feature falls short of what the Pebble offered.  There's no queue or timeline for reviewing notifications as there is on the Pebble and I find I miss the ability to simply scroll back through previous alerts.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/>The Forerunner 35's battery life is outstanding.  I get between 8 and 10 days between charges, and a full charge takes only a few hours.  This is much better than I expected and ensures I only miss a few hours of activity monitoring per month.  Given the time of year, I've been doing most of my running indoors so I've made light use of the GPS, I expect as the weather warms up and I do more outside running with the GPS on, I'll lose a couple of days of battery life, but I expect I should still make it a week or so between charges.<br/><br/>APP/WEBSITE<br/>I've used Garmin's connect website to log my swims and runs for years now, so most of the experience there is familiar.  The website provides access to my workout history so I can compare runs and swims against previous efforts and see improvements over time.  Now that I have the FR35, I get access to my sleep, all-day heart rate, and activity tracking data there as well.  The app for my Android phone is decent.  It can be a little confusing navigating through the various screens, but overall, all of the information I would care to look at is available, often presented in easy to digest charts and graphs.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS<br/>Overall I find the FR35 to be an excellent activity tracker and workout companion, but only a mediocre smartwatch.  A few tweaks to the software allowing for some nicer watch face options and a better interface for dealing with notifications would make this a five-star device.  Still, even with these shortcomings, I find myself wearing it 24/7 and imagine it will be on my wrist for a few years reliably logging my activity until my next upgrade.</span>

<span>I love this watch, it was a great deal on Prime sale 3 years ago.  Now at 3 years old, here are shortcomings:  I can't wear it more than a day or two at time without getting a rash beneath strap.  The strap has to be washed daily, which has helped, but when I forget and wear it several days straight, rash comes back, at which point I can't wear it for a week, or put it on other wrist.<br/><br/>Again, the strap:  The keeper broke last week, leaving end of strap untucked and annoying.  Luckily replacements are easily available on Amazon, and it was easy to replace.<br/><br/>Water resistance:  Supposed to be 5atm, or 50 meters water resistant.  I'm a watch geek, so own a watch pressure tester.  I'm glad I tested it at beginning of summer before taking it into water.  Pressurized to 4 atm, (20% below rating), it failed test, leaking from upper left corner of crystal.  So I have to be careful to not take it into water now, as it would not be cost effective to have it serviced.</span>

<span>Synopsis:  Overall, this is a good, basic running/ fitness watch that makes a nod at also being a smart watch.  There is nothing flashy here.  The watch doesn't do color, just back and silver/white on the display.  For those who have used or who remember the traditional Kindles, this is actually pretty nice in terms of contrast as it is easy to ready in low light and high light conditions.  In the dark, you still need the light from the lighting button.  Unless you are a pro/ elite level runner who will use the advanced features of the higher end watch offerings from Garmin or their competitors, or are someone who doesn't mind paying an absurd amount for a the latest tech gadget, this watch is more than adequate when paired with external sensors such as the HRM Run.  As you read this, please bear in mind that I haven't had the opportunity to run the higher end models, so my only points of comparison are the spec sheets and the price points.  I will try to avoid providing second hand anecdotal evidence for or against them.<br/><br/>What's Good:<br/>-- The weight.  This watch is very light.  Unlike my dive watches and other larger, necessarily robust watches, this guy is light enough that I don't feel a need to take it off to type or when doing wood work (both activities that involve repetitive motions that become annoying with larger watches on.  For those who mind having something heavy on your wrist during a run, that won't be an issue with this watch.<br/>-- The Band.  The silicon band that comes with the watch seems to be robust and is stretchy and comfortable.  I have had sport watches in the past that became uncomfortable in hot conditions after a while as moisture built up under the bands making them itchy or painful.  To date, I have had no such problems with this watch.  I also like the securing ring on the band which has a tooth on the inside to lock it into one of the fitment holes.  The stretchiness is important as you need the watch snug/tight to adequately place the optical heart rate monitor.<br/>-- The Smartwatch functions.  I don't own an apple watch (which wouldn't work with my phone anyway) or a Gear S3, so I don't have a basis for first hand comparison.  However, I have observed the frustration of my friends and family with such devices when trying to use them for input tasks (two way communications with the cellular device.)  This watch passes on notifications from your phone, but you have no ability to respond with it.  For me, this is the best of both worlds.  I get to keep situational awareness while avoiding getting caught up in the minutia of responding with a yet smaller computer interface.  This is a personal preference, but I do like the way it works.  It is also nice that notifications turn off during a run.<br/>-- The interface.  The UI (User Interface) is menu driven.  It took me only a few minutes to get used to it, so it has to be fairly simple.  Overall, it is intuitive once you absorb the designer's logic, you just have to be patient.  It does not have a touch screen, so you have to use the buttons.  This isn't a problem for me.<br/>-- The GPS.  Because this is a lower end offering, the watch only uses the GPS constellation and not the GLONASS constellation (Russian GPS).  As a result link up times are a little slower and accuracy can be degraded as the US places a mandatory limit on how accurate civilian GPS instruments can be (its a strategic thing.)  Overall, this watch isn't too bad.  At the end of my recent runs, the watch is generally off by about .03 to .05 miles from my phone which uses both locating systems and you can see the differences in the map.  Part of this is, I am sure, due to the frequency of updates which is not user changeable unlike on the higher end devices (I would love to minimize the time between fixes.)<br/>-- External Sensors.  You can still use external sensors with this watch.  I love this feature as I prefer the HRM Run over the watch which has its own accelerometer.  This becomes very nice when I'm pushing my daughter in a running stroller.  For bikers, you could also use a cadence sensor.<br/>-- Movement Tracker.  I like to track steps.  As a teacher though, I take everything out of my pockets when I get in front of a class so I don't fidget with it, so its nice that the phone will continue tracking for me.  Its also nice that it will tell me if I've been sitting too long.  This is good for two reasons.  Research shows that you start to lose focus and effectiveness after about 50 minutes of continuous concentration, so its a reminder to take a break (the movement bar seems to ping after about 45 to 50 minutes).  Its also a great reminder to remain active instead of just sitting there like a lump on a log.<br/>--  Battery life.  The phone is advertised as having up to a 13 day battery life.  I haven't seen it.  However, it does seem to last about 5 days with workouts which draw significantly more power than standard operation.<br/>-- Charging.  The charging of this device is impressive.  My first forerunner, the venerable F405, had to charge on a cradle that was poorly designed and didn't positively engage the device.  Over time, the connections would degrade and eventually stop working.  The new version uses a clip that actively clamps onto the watch.  Even with oxidation, it should last a long time.  The other part of the equation is the speed of charging.  In this aspect, the watch charges very quickly.  My personal experience is that a full charge takes less than 1 hour.  So if I'm at my desk and notice that my watch is low, I can put it on to charge and have it back on my wrist in time for my next break.<br/><br/>What's not?<br/>-- User control.  The sacrifice you make to get a robust watch is that you sacrifice control.  You can still adjust view fields on the exercise screens, but can't change how often the watch takes position fixes which would affect accuracy.  There are some other little niggly bits of control that are sacrificed as well, but they are well hidden.  Now, that having been said, how much control does the average user really need?  If you ask the fruit company, they will tell you not much.<br/>-- Accuracy.  As mentioned with the pros, the watch is not quite as accurate as I have come to expect from my phone.  However, it is within the tolerance of the system so really, how much are you missing?<br/>-- User feedback.  The watch does not provide the same level of feedback as the higher level watches.  Such esoteric values as VO2, Lactate threshold, expected recover time, and foot contact time simply are not measured.  Now, here's the thing.  If you are an elite level athlete or a professional, or have a personal coach that actually cares about this stuff, you might care.  If you are an every day runner or biker out for fitness and fun or a weekend warrior out to train for your local half, do you really need that extra information and will it be of benefit to you?  This is a question you have to ask yourself.  My answer was clearly no.  Now that having been said, the higher end watches all rely on the chest strap sensor to develop those metrics.  Would it be possible for Garmin to move the calculation muscle to your paired analysis device (computer or smart phone)?  Well, the answer is that there is nothing technically in the way, so clearly it is a selling point for their higher end lines.  Will it show up on Garmin Connect in the future?  Who knows.<br/>--  Limited activities.  The watch has limited workout options: Run outdoor, Run indoor, Bike, Cardio, and Walk.  If you are looking for something that will track your cross fit WOD, this may not be your baby.  Nor is it really designed to track golf, basketball, Frisbee golf, ultimate Frisbee or weight lifting as separate activities.  Of course, most of the devices that are built around that desired capability are not reported to work well in that application.  If you really want something that has specialized tracking capabilities for a wide variety of sports, by all means, pay for the higher end models.<br/>-- Garmin Connect.  Perhaps I'm just getting used to it, but Garmin Connect has some issues in the way that it appears on my phone.  It tends to be difficult to navigate and can be hard to get it to sync.<br/>-- Only two potential watch faces.  There are two built in watch faces and there are no options to be able to create your own.  This would be worse if I cared more, but I personally like the simple, in your face faces that are standard with the watch.  The higher end watches have infinitely adjustable faces.<br/><br/>Wrap up.  Over all, I am very happy with this watch.  It is the rare blend of having most of the features that I wanted and all of the capabilities that I need, while maintaining a reasonable price point without having to turn to the factory reconditioned items that may have been a lemon to begin with.  I highly recommend this watch/ fitness tracker.  If you don't believe me, check out the consumer reports review of this watch.</span>

<span>I've had this watch for about a month and a half now, and I love it!!! I had the Forerunner 15 (which is also a great watch) before this, and I like the 35 even better! It is definitely slimmer than the 15 and looks more like a smart watch than just a GPS watch. It is not touch screen - it has the same 4 buttons as the 15, and the interface is similar. The 35 has a bigger face and the time is displayed in white with the background black which makes it easier to read in the dark (it does still have a backlight button like the 15). I wear my watch all day, but not at night. It's supposed to do sleep tracking if you wear it while you sleep, but it bothers me to have something on my wrist while I sleep, so I haven't tested that feature. I think the step tracking is accurate - it seems comparable to what my 15 was calculating. The GPS is very accurate - within .05 of a mile I would say. If I'm running on a measured course, it usually is a bit under what the course is supposed to be, but that's probably because I'm running as close to the inside as possible making the distance I actually ran a bit shorter than what the course is supposed to be. The 35 offers several features that the 15 does not have: smartphone notifications, bluetooth connectivity, displaying the weather, and heart rate. Starting with the smartphone notifications: it is pretty simple to set this us - just connect via bluetooth through the garmin connect app (I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and it was easy to set up and works well). There is a setting where you can set which apps you get notifications from and you can set it to beep or vibrate or both. I have mine set to vibrate and it works perfectly. You can NOT send messages from the watch - it ONLY READS notifications. If you want to send messages or make calls from your watch, this is not the watch for you. However, you can answer/reject a phone call from your watch. This has been surprisingly useful - if my phone is in my bag, across the room, or somewhere else, I can answer the call from my wrist then look for the phone so I don't miss the call. Also, I keep my phone on silent all the time, so its nice to know when I get a message and not disturb others. There is a do not disturb mode - the watch won't vibrate/beep which comes in handy sometimes. On to bluetooth connectivity: You don't have to plug in your watch to sync it with garmin connect! It will automatically sync with your phone when bluetooth is enabled! I didn't think that this would be a big deal, but now that I have it, I don't think I'll buy another watch without it - its just so convenient. Weather: It will display the weather, but you have to have the GPS on your phone turned on (I don't leave the GPS on my phone on, so I don't use the weather feature). I set it up at first and turned on the GPS just to see what it looked like, and its pretty nice - it gives you hourly temperatures and rain chances. Heart rate monitor: I think I like the idea that it has a hr monitor more than I actually look at it. There is an option to turn the hr monitor off if you want (I assume it would save battery). It calculates your average resting hr which is nice (I haven't tested its accuracy, but the numbers seem right). It also gets your hr during a run/workout which is nice, but I rarely look at it. One final feature that may be the best thing about this watch - it does "find my phone." You have to have it connected up by bluetooth and be in range (which is surprisingly far and can even go through a wall/door). When you select find my phone on the watch, it makes your phone ring (even if its on silent), vibrate, and the flash for the camera blinks. I haven't tried it with my phone turned off, but I don't think that would work since it has to be bluetooth connected. I almost forgot about music control! This is a great feature that lets you play/pause/skip. I don't use it because I don't listen to music when I run, but it works well - I played with it when I first go it. Overall, I love this watch and highly recommend it!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Accurate GPS<br/>HR Monitor<br/>Phone notifications/answer calls<br/>Bluetooth connectivity - automatically syncs<br/>"find my phone"<br/>control music from it<br/>Interface and overall look of the watch is much sleeker than the previous forerunner models which have a very sporty look<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Can't send a text from the watch<br/>Have to have your phone's GPS turned on the use the weather feature<br/><br/>There is nothing that the watch does poorly, the cons are just features that would be nice if it had them.<br/>Another quick note: Battery Life - It has not been an issue for me. I charge my watch every night, but it usually still has 2/3 bars of battery when I plug it in. I run every morning for 30-75 minutes with the GPS on which is the primary loss of battery. If I don't run, it stays at 3 bars the whole day. I think the HR Monitor can drain the battery too, so if you wanted you could turn that off.</span>

<span>Background:  My wife has had Fitbits for three years.  First one was a Charge 3, the brightness got kluged on a software update.  Fitbit had no solution and since it was a month out of warranty (12 mos.) her option was to buy a new one - even tho it was recognized to be their issue.  We bit the bullet and bought a Charge 4 at Sam's with two bands.  Eleven months in, the connection from the watch (pearl as they call it) that holds the end of the band broke at both ends.  We sent the entire package back at their expense, and they sent a replacement with only one band.  Within 6 months, it happened again.  Now that it was out of warranty, they offered us a refurbished pearl.  This one lasted nearly a year before the same issue started to occur.  Fortunately we retained the end connector that was separating and super glue now holds it on.<br/><br/>Review:  Prime early sale came and I convinced her to buy one of the Amazfit GTS2 Minis for 67.99 here on Amazon.  We bought two.<br/><br/>Set up was moderate, trying to get things to function with the Zepp app.  Initial pairing was easy, just getting things like Alexa and weather to work, and the learning curve to the rest of the built in features.  Today is the first full day of wearing.  I did accomplish creating a custom face.  There are 50 faces, but only a handful appeal to my elderly conservative tastes.  Watch band is comfortable enough, but I ordered a metal link, which is set to arrive in a few days - just to dress it up.  I have a narrow wrist, so the Mini is well suited to my arm.  Charging is simple enough with a magnetic plate that has a USB cord attached, I just wish it would do wireless, as I have chargers around the house for that.</span>

The transfer progress bar reached the end, and the watch went dark as if it was restarting.  Except that it didn't.  I tried pressing the start button on the watch, and plugging it in to its charging cable.  No sign of life.<br/><br/>Here's the worst part though.  In the app you can go to the Help screen... IF it can sync with the watch.  Obviously, I can't.  Great - no support through the app.  So I found the feedback link in the app.  But that's for suggestions for new or better features.  Undaunted, I went ahead and used it.  I got an auto-response saying they would take my suggestions under consideration.  le sigh.<br/><br/>Hoping for the best, I went to the website, and found a Support contact interface.  But you have to be able to enter the build version of the watch into the contact form.  To find the build version, you have to turn on the watch.  I can't turn on the watch, and that's a required field on the Support contact interface.  So I can't reach support that way.<br/><br/>Finally, I found an actual email link.  I emailed all of this information to that address.  I got an auto response saying that my email had been blocked.  At this point, I've spent far too much time explaining the problem to nobody.<br/><br/>My final, last ditch effort is to come here and change my review to 1 star, in hopes that *someone* from the company will answer me.  If not, I will send this dead watch back to where it came from.<br/><br/>If you are considering purchasing this watch, be advised that getting support for a dead unit will be nigh unto impossible.<br/><br/>- - - ORIGINAL REVIEW - - -<br/><br/>I ordered this on 9/10, received it on 9/11.  When I received the watch, I charged it to 100%. Since 7pm on 9/11, I've taken it off only to shower.  Configuring the phone via the app was mostly intuitive, and I quickly had it set the way I wanted it to remain dark during my sleep cycles.<br/><br/>I haven't been tracking my steps as closely as I have my sleep score.  We have a late model Sleep Number bed with the  SleepIQ app, and I've been dissatisfied with the scores on that system because I was sure it was picking up our cats' nocturnal motion rather than my own.  This watch has proven my suspicions.<br/><br/>But what seems absolutely stunning to me is the battery life and comfort of this watch.  It's very light in terms of physical weight.  I've been wearing a Samsung Galaxy, and this AmazFit is so much easier to wear.  And two weeks on a single charge is - well, amazing.  Today is 9/25.  I just now plugged it in, and it was still at 22% charge.<br/><br/>I'm hopeful that more watch faces become available, or that the app developers will publish a guide to enable users to make and submit their own. I'm hopeful that some of the data which must currently be entered manually can one day be detected via the watch, including blood pressure. Other than these minor details, which are common to Samsung's Galaxy watches as well, I'm well satisfied.<br/><br/>I do think I'll update the watch band though.  It isn't uncomfortable in the least, but it's plastic.  I want to dress this fine watch up a bit!  :-)</span>

<span>—Review after 1 week—<br/>This watch is very budget-friendly and has all the functions I want.<br/>I like having the option to track my sleep, especially because the app scores your sleep quality. I really do make an effort to sleep earlier because of this.<br/>Heart rate is also pretty cool, my resting heart rate seems about right and I like seeing how often I reached a certain target heart rate zone when working out.<br/>I work out a few times a week (about 4-5) and the watch has many workout options, which is nice. The battery life is phenomenal so far, it’s at 58% after one week of continuously using it.<br/>You can’t wear this watch for showering or swimming though, which isn’t really a huge concern of mine.<br/>I really wish the band was better;  when I first put it on it smelled like cheap plastic and feels uncomfortable when sweating. I recommend buying a new band along with the watch.<br/>The watch face options are limiting, but you do get the choice to personalize the background.<br/>One major complaint I have with the screen is that when I raise my hand it doesn’t light it up. The screen mostly only lights up when I press the side button. It’s not that annoying now, but I know it will be later on.<br/><br/>Overall pretty satisfied with the watch, especially for this price point.</span>

<span>I've been using this watch for exactly one week now and I have 63% battery life left. The heart rate, workout tracking, sleep tracking, waterproofing,and screen display so far are great. There is no always on display but that is likely why the battery is lasting so long. I also disabled the lift wrist to view time function as I don't like when smart watches light up when you don't want them too and I don't mind quickly hitting the button when I need to see the time. I had the GTR2 right before this but I returned it because it was too heavy, the call pickup and Alexa function kept disconnecting so I figured this one would be a better choice at half the price and the fit is MUCH more comfortable to me. A different reviewer mentioned these nylon strap wrist bands which are 3 for 10 bucks and I find AWESOME! I highly recommend them if you hate silicone, leather or canvas bands.<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B09ZT2DWPH?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title</span>

<span>The battery life on this is amazing, I usually go 10 days between charges.  I like that the running selection has a treadmill option (otherwise it shows you going nowhere).  I do wish it had a tennis option for the exercise selection.<br/>The PAI score will try to kill you. :) I have only had it above 100 once after exercising multiple times a day for a week.  Usually stuck around 25 when exercising 6 times a week.<br/>I do recommend cleaning the band with rubbing alcohol often or replacing the band with something breathable.<br/>Only con I've experience is every once in a while when I'm running the heart rate stop detecting, but instead of the app showing it can't read it just starts dropping the number.  It has caused me to stop running to verify I wasn't dying.  i.e. drops from 160 to 50 really fast while having the app open on the treadmill.</span>

<span>I'd never heard of Amazfit prior to a week or so ago. Which is okay; they'd never heard of me either. I certainly know who they are now!<br/><br/>I found myself in need of a timepiece, but I wanted one that was a little more comprehensive than my usual Timex Ironman. A "smart" watch; something like an Apple Watch might've been nice; I'm a Mac adherent and have been for thirty-plus years. But research showed their watches possessing a hefty price tag and a skimpy battery life.<br/><br/>Having received gift cards for my birthday, I looked around, did my homework, and finally decided to give the amusingly named Amazfit Bip a try. Or, more precisely, the Amazfit Bip 3 Pro. I guess that's a Bip 3 that's lost its amateur status.<br/><br/>My initial thoughts on receiving it...hey! This is COOL! What you have here is a slick looking watch that does everything I could want it to do...heart monitoring, blood oxygen sensing, workout tracking, even sleep monitoring...and it does a lot more stuff Amazfit does a much better job at listing in its promo material than I would be able to do here. Of course you can change its face, and the amount of widgets available. I kinda like that; an overly busy display is annoying. Speaking of which, the display is big and readable even in bright sunlight, which at my age is pretty vital. I can get notifications on incoming messages and phone calls. The Zepp app (which comes in both iOS and Android flavors) makes it fairly easy to digest all of this incoming info. It's all packed in a lightweight package that boasts a battery life of two weeks. I can't verify that yet, but I'm almost a week in and I'm at 52% life remaining...and this is with a lot of playing around with the thing to learn how to use it and several workouts and hikes using the GPS. Yes, a GPS! With mapping, even!<br/><br/>Now on to the downsides, such as they are. It's not a Dick Tracy watch (I know, I am dating myself here) which means that I can be notified of incoming phone calls and texts, but not answer them. And I can't play music on it. Control it, yes, play it, no. But honestly, these are two very minor gripes in a watch that comes in at under $60.<br/><br/>But then...there is the execrable strap.<br/><br/>Yes, It truly is awful: hot, sticky, and tight. Mind you, I am a large-framed person but frankly my wrists aren't THAT big around. How a really buff guy could wear the Bip comfortably right out of the box just mystifies me. Now, you could stretch it--I've done this in the past with watches--but you don't have to: quick-release pins make the silicone torture devices a cinch to swap out. I got a pack of three stretchy nylon straps for a little over $10 (I'll include a link below) and, PRESTO! Problem solved. The watch is now comfortable, so much so that I barely notice wearing it. And it looks rather spiffy too. There's plenty of colors and designs to choose from.<br/><br/>And now? I really don't see any downside to the Bip 3 Pro. Low cost, plenty of available data, easy to learn and use, customizable, and it looks good on your wrist. Mind you, I'm still waiting on a jetpack, but this sort of gee-whiz stuff may be a bit much for an old codger. Maybe a hoverboard...<br/><br/>Link to the stretchy nylon replacement straps I got (there's lots more that will work):<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZSW3RKS?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details</span>

<span>Wanted to try something different as my Fitbits continued to malfunction prematurely and I could no longer justify buying another one at their current prices. After looking around decided on the Bip 3 Pro. Initially was hesitant since Amazfit is an “off brand” based in China. However, have been pleasantly surprised. Screen is easy to read and responsive ( but is not an always on screen). Battery life has been really good even with using GPS. Maybe the best thing is the Zepp app. It has even more info than Fitbit Premium and it is free. Demerits are that even though it has the ability to give notifications, it’s working ~65% of the time for me. Also the screen is completely manual for brightness - it does not automatically adjust. Finally, even though the size and shape would seem to indicate it is a smartwatch, it is not. But it is a very good GPS fitness tracker with useful extras.</span>

<span>Hello, I really enjoy this watch.  The battery life seems nice. I am on day 4, going on 4 nights and the battery is at 41% This includes the sleep monitor and the Beta version of the sleep breathing monitor being active. The oxygen sensor works as well as the heart beat and step count.  The weather portion in the app did not seem accurate, but it could be, it did not have my city listed nor another close by and when I turned on my location, it did get the closest major city to me, but said city is right on a Great Lake, hence the 5 degrees difference from my location and why I think it is in accurate. I was able to remove the weather display from the watch. The watch is paired with an Apple phone, so text alerts do not always come through upon the watch.  The sleep monitor is okay. I wake up in the middle of the night, but since I am not moving around and just reading or listening to the radio, it thinks I am still asleep, but it does appear accurate about deep and maybe the REM sleep. There are plenty of watch faces to obtain. I chose the one I can see  the time, date, battery life, and steps. The watch may not even be the problem, it could be the app itself, but overall,  I am pleased about this watch, even though it is not same manufacture as my phone, but at a fraction of a price, I am very happy.  Good starter health tracker with smart watch capabilities. It is making me think of purchasing a more expensive model from the same manufacturer with more smart watch features for my next watch. Keep up the good work!</span>

<span>It is not perfect but for the price, I totally give it 5 stars. I bought it for monitoring my heart through exercise but I use it for so much more. My favorite surprise is that I no longer have a phone that beeps and rings loudly to annoy others my watch lets me know what is happening without anyone knowing.<br/>Having said that there are some simple things I don't understand why they don't add.<br/>Exercise recovery. You are tracking my running, heartbeat, stride, etc. Why when I end the exercise can't I track my recovery to see how my fitness is progressing? It is a slam dunk.<br/>Notifications. I would LOVE different notifications for different applications. Three taps for  WhatsApp one for messenger. Continuous buzzing for any call phone or 2ndline.<br/>Late night is a nap? If I fall asleep at 9 to 11 and then can't back to sleep until 1am it is not a nap. LOL<br/>The difference between work and play!

<span>This was purchased as a gift for someone who's not really tech savvy. I have been a loyal Fitbit user for the past 7 years and currently own the Fitbit Sense which is the current top of the line Fitbit (I previously owned the Fitbit Versa). This Amazfit Bip U Pro surpringly has a lot of the same features as my Fitbit but at a fraction of the cost. I stay with Fitbit because most of my friends &amp; coworkers use it so we can challenge each other and it's just easier to purchase accessories. Now back to the Amazfit... I like that you can take an SpO2 measurement anytime, unlike my Fitbit which only measures SpO2 at night when I'm sleeping and then it shows a reading. The Amazfit has other features that the Fitbit doesn't have such as a compass, way more activity tracking, it can control music from your phone and also act as a camera shutter for your phone. I like that you can create custom vibration patterns for your alerts (like for calls, texts, app notifications). The battery life is longer but that all depends on how your watch set up (screen time out length, vibration length, how often your heart rate is checked, etc). The one drawback for me with the Amazfit is that you cannot reply back to a text message or social media messages (not even with preset messages). You can reply with a preset message only when you get a phone call (you cannot answer a call from the watch or answer it until you get to your phone. It only gives you the option to silence, hang up or reply with text option). My Fitbit can reply to texts with preset messages or I can talk to text and reply that way which is wonderful. I can also answer my calls and talk through the Fitbit as long as my phone is within distance. If the Amazfit incorporated those features in the future, I may actually switch to Amazfit. I did see a more expensive version of the Amazfit at my local big box store so maybe in the future it will be more popular. I have heard good things about the Amazfit years ago but wasn't too keen on ordering something online without physically seeing or touching it in person. So when I saw a similar version at the store, I figured I'd give it a try and purchase it as a gift. The recipient loves the watch, it was purchased as a replacement smart watch so this one definitely has way more features (recipient previously used the iTouch Air SE and the screen became unresponsive to touch and the heart rate tracker stopped working). The Zepp app for the Amazfit isn't really too intuitive as many reviewers have mentioned but if you play around with it it's not too bad. I still prefer the Fitbit app better but if you've never had a smart watch before, you may not even notice a difference. I like that the Amazfit uses a standard watch band size so you don't necessarily have to order a replacement band marketed for the Amazfit. You just need to purchase the correct sized watch band. The Amazfit charges magnetically and you'll appreciate that the charging cord is fairly long especially compared to my Fitbit. The magnet only connects in one direction so there's no guessing if it attached correctly so you don't end up with an uncharged watch accidentally. The Amazfit is light and does feel cheaper than my Fitbit but maybe the more expensive Amazfit version is made with better materials (like not as much plastic). I do like the button on the Amazfit, it's much easier to press than the hepatic button on my Fitbit. As I mentioned before, I think the Amazfit is a good contender in the smart watch world. There are many models to compare depending on what features are more important to you. I would probably continue purchasing the Amazfit as gifts since it's much more affordable for all the features it comes with.</span>

<span>I got this to help track my steps, and to receive call and text notifications, so I cannot speak for other aspects of this watch.<br/>It does exactly what I need it to do.</span>

<span>This watch is overall a great watch for the money but I would particularly recommend it more as a sports watch than a traditional smartwatch. The biggest thing I would change is the band to a textured band vs. smooth as sweat buildup while working out is my biggest complaint of this watch. Here are some of the pros and cons that I have of the Bip U Pro.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>-Great value at $70.<br/>-GPS Tracking.(Most watches remotely close to this price point have none.)<br/>-Lots of sport modes to choose from with lots of data after the workout.<br/>-Accurate heart rate, sleep, stress, and distance monitoring.<br/>-Many other helpful features.<br/>-Great battery life. (I get about 5 days before needing to charge. Keep in mind I use 1 minute frequency heart rate monitoring, assisted sleep monitoring and all day stress monitoring. I also use gps tracking for 1-2 workouts every day.<br/>-Waterproof up to 50 Meters.<br/>-The watch was relatively easy to set up.<br/>CONS:<br/>-It can only store up to 10 texts or calls at a time.<br/>-Although the band is comfortable for all day use it can be uncomfortable during prolonged workouts as sweat builds up under the band. This could be helped by changing the band to a textured band so it doesn't stick to your wrist.<br/>-I wish you could access the zepp app from a laptop or desktop.<br/>-If you set the watch to military time it will randomly undo it and go back to am/pm time</span>

<span>Easy to use, easy to manage the app, easy to customize the screen.  I like that I don't need to have my phone on hand in order to track heart rate and activity.  The only two negative points are the charger limitations mentioned by other reviewers and that it can't tell the difference between reading in bed and sleeping.  And I wish the ECG function performed.</span>
