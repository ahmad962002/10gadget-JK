<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>For the price, and for a home printer that’s occasionally used, it meets our needs. I got this printer a few weeks ago and it did take some time (an hour or so) to connect it to my laptop and cell phone (for the remote printing capabilities). I am not tech savvy, and I did get frustrated during the process. It also lures you in with “ink for 6 months!”…more like 1 month. I print the occasional paper for my kids school, a recipe here and there, and maybe a few sheets - it’s out of ink and I’d guess I’ve used 30 sheets. Definitely not 6 months worth, and definitely not if you’re using it as a primary printer. I’m disappointed because I think that was false advertising. For what I need it for, what it does and the cost, it’s fine for our home desk option. Don’t purchase if you’re using it for college kids who will need to print a lot, or for business/office use; you’ll run out of ink constantly. Let’s also mention the ink is $30…after 1 refill, I’m going to donate the printer and buy something else, or else I’ve spent more on ink refills than the device cost!</span>

<span>My old HP printer gave out and since I'd had such good service from the brand, I bought this as a replacement. I needed all-in-one capability, which this printer has--scanning, copying, printing- and I wanted wireless capability. For some reason, I felt like the instructions to set this up to get the wireless capability started were just not as clear as they could have been. I finally resorted to just common sense after some frustrating tries, and got it working, but frankly, I still don't know how I got there. No matter. Once it was connected wirelessly it worked perfectly. The print quality is great, it's responsive, and it does exactly what I need it to do. It's a simple printer for home use. Other than the annoying matter of the instructions, there's one other small detail that owners should be aware of: there's a small, pull-out extension to the finished print tray that's only about three inches wide and rotates out to extend maybe six inches or so. It's not the width of the fixed print tray. It looks like an option. It's not. Use it. If you don't, you're liable to find your print job has shot across the room all over the floor. Ask me how I know. First glance, the finished print tray appears to be long enough to keep the printed pages stacked in place, but it just isn't. Without that little extension rotated out, you're going to have to pick up your print job off the floor. OK, I know; it's an inexpensive printer. But another 50 cents worth of plastic to keep this from happening wouldn't have bankrupted Hewlett Packard.</span>

<span>This printer comes with VERY FEW printed instruction sheets, which one would assume means it is simple to setup. Unbox, plug in, insert ink cartridges, connect via USB, WiFi direct or add to your WiFi network and voila!<br/><br/>Except when I plugged it in and opened the front panel to install the ink cartridges, I could hear/see the cartridge carrier shake and vibrate but it would not move to the open area to allow installation. I looked inside for one of those large red/orange tabs that sometimes secures movable components, but none were visible. I checked the instructions AGAIN - nothing. I viewed the setup/get started videos on the HP website, no mention of anything to remove.<br/><br/>Error code 3E on the panel which means 'carriage malfunction' (no surprise). Instructions on how to clear the error were about removing paper jams. Have yet to print anything, so no paper has been through it. After 30 minutes of back and forth I am ready to box it up and return it and as I turn it over, I hear a 'rattle'....hmmm.  I shake a bit, more rattle. I look inside and shake and waaay in the back, I see a small white plastic piece. I cannot reach it with my hand, so I continue to turn and shake until this piece falls out (see picture).<br/><br/>Plug it back in and the carriage centers as it should and I can proceed with installation.<br/><br/>While the installable HP printer app is well designed and easy to use, and there are numerous pages of instructions you can print by pressing buttons on the printer, HP should include just a little more information - especially about the carriage lock AND use one that is a more visible color.<br/><br/>Another potential problem is if you sign up for 'Instant Ink' - the ink delivery service.<br/>This service requires connectivity from the printer to HP using a webservice. Unfortunately, this feature was disabled by default (at least on this printer). When I tried to register I kept getting a rather innocuous error. After a bit of frustration and way too much time, I found reference to how to enable it, but using a browser to connect to the printer directly. Cool - except I was prompted for a password, which wasn't provided anywhere. None of the 'usual defaults' worked, nothing listed on the HP site/web search worked but I found mention of how to reset it to not need a password, which I did. This also reset the WiFi settings on the printer - phhht.  Fortunately, the HP software made setting that up, AGAIN straight forward, but I mean - COME ON!<br/><br/>All total, I spent approx 2hrs of frustration getting this tiny box setup when it should have been &lt;30 minutes.<br/><br/>As a result of these experiences, I rated this printer 1 for tech support due to setup issues and 3 overall.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with WiFi Direct, be aware that when you are connected to the printer you are NOT connected to your internet connection. I've had more than a few friends get frustrated by that.  I recommend you avoid it unless you have used it before. It's benefits in your average home environment is, IMO- limited.</span>

<span>I just finished setting up the printer so far, so good. It took less than 5 minutes to connect to wireless.  The print quality is good and the compact size of the printer is exactly what I was looking for. I don’t do a ton of printing so it’s perfect for what I need. So far I’ve printed from my iPhone and iPad with absolutely no problems. I haven’t tried printing from my MacBook yet because I’m too lazy to go it right now but if there are any problems I’ll update. If you are looking for an inexpensive, compact printer for basic printing go ahead and get this one.</span>

<span>I liked the price of the computer, and ability to print color, 2-sided, scan, etc. Three years after purchase, a color cartridge did not communicate with the printer. The online instructions to solve issue just put me in a loop. I never found a phone number to call for help (virtual assistant was useless). All I wanted was a replacement cartridge. I was on the instant ink program. So I am canceling that program and will not buy another HP printer, and will sell this one at a low cost. What a waste of money, cheap not!</span>

<span>This HP's had no issues so far. I was reluctant to get another HP after the last one I had a couple years ago, which had a really clunky and frustrating software package, combined with poor print quality. But then I replaced that with a Canon that couldn't get though five print jobs without jamming, and finally an Epson that had even worse print quality. After the Epson locked up because I dared to use non-Epson ink cartridges, I decided to give HP another chance. Glad I did.<br/><br/>So far, I love this printer. It was fairly easy to set up, but did take some figuring to do it without installing all of HP's software, which was my primary issue with the last HP I had. I eventually found HP's EasyStart installer on their website, and from there it was easy to select the options and software I wanted to use. I went with a very basic install and haven't had any problems with the software other than having to delete a few random new desktop icons.<br/><br/>After setup, it was like...having a normal printer! Refreshing. No jams, no stripy print jobs, no weird apps with a bunch of essentially useless features popping up when you just want to print something. I haven't had a printer that worked to an acceptable basic standard in years. The first thing I printed with it was a shipping label and was like "Whoa, a normal printout!" The second thing I printed was some instructions, and the text is comparable to a laser printer. It's also fast.<br/><br/>There are a couple other features that I like, starting with the icy-blue output tray light. It's calming and makes me feel like this printer's got it handled. Between that and the pleasant sound effects it makes for various functions, it feels like getting a little something extra. It doesn't have a touchscreen, but it does have a lighted icon-pad, which in my opinion is all a printer really needs. Lastly, though the printer has a wider footprint, the paper tray is contained and concealed; you pull it out from the output tray deck, insert paper, and push it back in. No awkward paper tray extensions or paper sticking out of the top.</span>

<span>I just had to say that I almost did not purchase this printer based on the many reviews stating how difficult the set-up was. My beloved Cannon printer had expired and family members recommended HP with their ink subscription. I wanted the HP Envy 6000e printer but it seemed like the set-up was going to be a nightmare based on comments from other purchasers. However, believing the best, I used HP Smart App on my desktop computer, followed its very clear directions, and was printing in no time at all! I was so surprised at the simplicity of set-up when using the HP Smart app. I do not know what problems other customers ran into- but really, I'm 75 years young and it could not have been easier. I tested printing duplexed articles, images, and photos. All crisp and beautiful! Now I have a ZIPPY and lovely HP Envy 6000e printer! Please don't hesitate to buy this printer because HP offers a lot of support should it be needed. I am quite pleased.</span>

<span>I rarely need to print anything on paper at home, but like to have something.  My ≈20 year old HP printer had died, so I wanted something inexpensive to replace it.<br/><br/>I see that some reviewers were annoyed by the fact that this doesn't come with a USB cable.  Perhaps earlier versions of the ad did not mention this, but it's in the description now and did not surprise me.  My old printer cable worked fine.<br/><br/>I no longer have a Windows or Mac computer.  This does work with my laptop and desktop, both of which have Ubuntu 20.04.  Downloaded the Debian package directly from the Canon web site.  Unpacked in the downloads folder, navigated there in a shell, and typed "sudo ./install.sh".  Easy peasy.<br/><br/>There is a Canon mobile app for android, but unfortunately it's only for their wireless printers, and this one needs a USB connection.  I found an app called Nokoprint, which lets me print from my android phone and tablet using the cable, although of course, an additional adapter is required (which I already had).  It didn't have a Canon driver, but used a generic driver that works.  The only problem is that this app has very aggressive ads, which are particularly annoying on the tablet, to the point where it actually makes it more complicated to print something.  Still, I just  wanted to have that capability; I'll hardly ever use it with those devices.  Someone else may be able to suggest a better app.<br/><br/>Anyway, that part is not Canon's fault.  This is a good basic printer which is fine for what I need, printing out the occasional document or picture on letter sized paper.  It is supposed to do other sizes as well, but I haven't tried that.<br/><br/>This did come with ink cartridges, although I bought spares while I was at it.</span>

<span>First off, READ THE DESCRIPTION! Don’t give the printer a bad rating because you couldn’t be bothered to read the information provided.<br/>  Is it a scanner? NO and it doesn’t say so. Is it wireless? NO and it doesn’t say so. It says its USB. Is there a cable? No and there is actually a list literally called “What’s in the box” to tell you so! You can use your old cable, they’re all the same.<br/>How long does the ink last? Really??? That’s like saying how long does a gallon of gas last! It depends on how you use it!<br/>  C’mon people, its 2022. Every new printer has come with “starter” cartridges since before the millennium! This comes with #s 243 &amp; 244 included. Available cartridges numbers 245 &amp; 246 are “standard” and 245xl &amp; 246xl are high capacity. And I don’t know how long they last either!<br/><br/>  I found the printer easy to set up. Not quick, necessarily, but pretty straight forward. There is an instruction sheet that actually has English on it so that’s a plus. I installed it on a laptop, with a disc drive, running windows 7. Easy peasy. Some downloads and test prints took some time so it all probably took 45 minutes but a lot of that was waiting for the programs to do their thing.<br/>  I only gave it a 3 star rating because the printable area is pretty bad. The unusable margins, top, bottom and sides, are pretty big. So big, that the one thing I bought it for, printing ebay labels, it doesn’t do properly. It cuts off the left edge to point that there is only one digit left showing in my return address. (I have to download the label, and print it using software that allows me to move it over on the page.) To me, that’s a big negative.<br/>  Yes, it will do borderless but not on plain paper. Thanks for nothing.<br/>  While trying to see if there was a way to improve all this, I navigated around in the software. A little awkward to say the least. If you want to stop the huge short cut collection from showing up on start up, you have to find the Quick Menu, then locate the little screwdriver and pliers icon -NOT the settings icon- and that will give you the option to not see it on startup.<br/>  I have not used it for color or photos yet. If that’s important to you, I suggest you spend more than fifty bucks! Even at that price, its not worth returning, I’ll deal with it, but had I known how bad the printable area was, I would have shopped more.<br/>***update*** After a month or so, either I accidentally clicked something or there was a software update. I can now print ebay labels but its not straight forward. I have to choose my options EVERY time. But at least the menu includes "print to usable area" or something like that. Which is kinda dumb. Seems to me that would be the norm. BUT you have to tell it to do it on a quarter sheet otherwise you get an 8 x 11 label!!! Basically, my old printer printed a label as you  would expect, normally and completely. This takes a lot of clicking boxes and it still comes out smaller. And since I can only play with the settings when I sell something, its a slow learning curve.***</span>

<span>I have been a faithful HP user for the last 5 years due in no small part to their quality and reliability.  My Officejet Pro 8600 Plus (n911g) finally died after 4 years of home use. So, after doing some web searching, I decided to fall back to the highly recommended HP Scanjet Pro 6978.<br/><br/>After 3 days of frustrating effort in trying to implement the wifi printer function, I was able to successfully enable it in my new printer/scanner. Seeing and experiencing the frustrations shown in purchase reviews, I decided to take the time to layout what worked for me.<br/>The bottom line is that HP Smart was not detecting that my computer was set up to not share devices.  The basic software at the HP Customer Support web page did and corrected this.  More detail below.<br/><br/>As background, I had used HP Smart with my previous 8600 printer and became frustrated with it, so I stopped using it and started using just the basic printer software.  Also, seeing the Instant Ink “horror stories” in the purchase reviews, I was determined not to let this happen during the install.  As it turned out this latter fear was totally un-founded and I was easily able to bypass the Instant Ink offer.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I believe HP Smart is a good addition to the basic software, however, over the years my 5-year-old laptop has been subjected to a lot of additional security and other software which I believe HP Smart was unable to detect and correct. Once corrected, I plan to continue with HP Smart and believe the underlying issue was also the source of the problem I had with it with my prior printer.<br/><br/>During the initial setup, I was easily able to get the printer into my network (solid unblinking blue wifi indicator on the printer).  Where the 3 days of frustration happened was in getting the computer to recognize the printer! Once I gave up on the HP Smart wifi and other USB and ethernet solutions, I decided to go back to finding the basic 6978 software.  On the HP support web page I found a it through web link HPEasyStart_14_6_6. Using it led to another piece of software (Full_Webpack-40.16.1234_1-OJ6970_Full_Webpack) that completed the installation on my laptop. I believe I had to start an HP account for this as well as use the sharing functions.<br/><br/>What the basic software detected was that my computer was not allowing my devices to share.  Once it corrected this, the software installation went quite quickly.  I believe this unsharing was done by my security software in order to eliminate the risks of remote hacking.  I may very well go back (or have to when the AVG software scans again) and limit the sharing to only the devices I want to access the printer.</span>

<span>As usual, a great HP product. I upgraded (or downgraded depending on how you see it) from a Photosmart printer that has recently seen most of its apps be rendered unusable due to HP killing them off from that generation of printers. I was tired of the random quirks I was having with ePrint since they moved to a new service they call HP Connect. I'm also doing less photo printing and more document scanning.<br/><br/>First off: Yes, this printer can do automatic 2 sided scans! I was getting tired of trying to find if it did or not considering the material only points to automatic 2 sided printing and the ability to scan multiple documents to copy as 2 sided (2+ single sided to 1+ double sided). So I honestly bought it on a risk and also due to price when I bought it, $20 less than price shown on 1/18/17. When I installed it, I started messing around with settings and at the bottom of the page options for copying was 2 -&gt; 2 sided. It isn't mentioned anywhere, but that's the setting to take a 2 sided document and copy as a 2 sided document. There was also a 2 -&gt; 1 sided which allows you to undo the dual sided and copy each side as a single page. This will be a huge time saver with all the documents I plan on saving digitally.<br/><br/>Second: For the price, this is one of their faster models. Although color still lags behind after all these years, I feel it is still respectable at 11 ppm at best quality. The product page on HP claims it can be as high as 20 ppm or so if using draft. Considering the only color prints I'd use at best quality are photos, this is blazing fast to me. Black can get as high as upper 20's in draft. I have never seen a reason to print a document in best mode, so to have speeds of upper 20's black and roughly 20 color is more than adequate for most people. Also, draft mode ensures a longer life for your cartridges. Even during my heaviest printing times, I've had cartridges last me months using draft mode. And ever since getting the Photosmart as my first dual sided capable printer, I have bought paper in years! I admit though, I over bought paper a few years ago when Staples did buy 2 get 1 free on cases.<br/><br/>Third: I have always hated tri-color cartridges. Yellow is ALWAYS the first to go since black printing uses some yellow as well for whatever reason unless you set default document settings to gray-scale. Even when I would print photos way back when, the 3 colors never finished at the same time. A tri-color cartridge guarantees that you will have to buy a new one before using all the ink. Part of the reason I took so long to change printers was that HP seemed to have gone back in time to strictly tri-color. This printer though uses a single cartridge per color! Thank goodness. This is the 21st century, tri-color cartridges should be totally obsolete, or at the very least relegated to the cheapest of models.<br/><br/>Fourth: Wi-Fi connection appears very fast. There is a caveat though, this printer takes a while to start from a cold start. I sell often on eBay and print from the app. With the Photosmart, maybe due to the change in service, I used to have to wait a while before the printer processed what it was doing. With this one, as soon as the printer states it's online, it begins within seconds any print job received from either HP Connect or HP Direct (the mobile to printer connection that uses Bluetooth I believe). I have had consistent success with HP Direct since it takes out of the equation everything except my phone and the printer. HP Connect though I always had issues with. The eBay app seems to hate printer plug-ins, so I decided to try going the HP Connect route. This involves e-mailing the printer what you need to print. Well, I e-mailed a shipping label. I decided to sit down and wait the customary forever for it to print (based on Photosmart experiences). After hitting send and touching the chair to sit, the printer had already began the printing process. Since this printer was made after the switch to HP Connect, it went super fast! I can say I am completely impressed.<br/><br/>Fifth: Paper tray. Yeah I know how cares, it's a tray. But coming from a Photosmart, being able to put what looks like a third of a ream of paper into the tray is so nice. I always felt I was reloading paper too often on the Photosmart due to the small tray. I do miss the dedicated photo paper tray though.<br/><br/>That's all I could think of with my limited use of the printer thus far. The only negative is that I feel it takes too long to be ready from a cold start. I know it is partially my fault because I kill the surge protector to save as many pennies as I can. Florida Power and Light really loves shafting us with the power bills here in Miami. But I have restarted the printer without turning off the surge protector and it still took a bit longer than the Photosmart. But with 5 positives so far vs the Photosmart, whats a bit longer boot up time?</span>

<span>Hp smart set up didn't work. We went on hps page for this product and downloaded something called print doctor and diagnose and from there we had no probs wifi printing from the initial laptop we hooked the printer up to and subsequently all computers. We have had decent luck with hp products. We did have an hp printer die on us ages ago, but same with every company (Epson, brother, Canon especially absolutely horrible.) 2 year lifespan. We're hoping for the best. Family made me splurge on this 180 printer. Seems worth it. Fast period. Adding an edit: We didn't bother with the whole instant ink program. Idj</span>

<span>I am not a happy adapter of new technology.  When my printer finally gave out, I searched for an unused model of the same kind, no longer manufactured, and used it.  It had actually been free as an Apple Store promotion when I bought my computer.<br/><br/>But the color function never worked, so I was limited to black-and-white.  It was somewhat compatible with my newer MacBook, but I found it easier to use the older one.  Finally, I realized I needed to move forward and purchased a new printer-- which was immediately returned because it was so complicated to install and never actually worked.  So, back to the old one for a long period, until I decided to be brave and attempt a new model again.<br/><br/>Researching online the best models for my computer, I found this one was rated highly.  My previous printer was an HP and, although the quality was never quite as good as my previous model (and I can't even remember the brand), it was good.  Most important to me, it can be used with a USB connection, as I have had terrible luck with wireless anything.<br/><br/>When it arrived it sat in the box for at least two weeks, as I avoided the presumed hassle plus endless waiting for tech support.<br/><br/>I was thrilled to find out that it was actually quite easy to set up and install.  The ink cartridges separate the three colors, which of course means you aren't paying the exorbitant cost to replace a triple cartridge when only one color is depleted.  But they install as my old HP cartridges had, so not a challenge.<br/><br/>The happiest aspect is that connecting the WiFi is as simple as entering the password for the modem.  I was absolutely thrilled to find it instantly functional.<br/><br/>In fact, I did not rate the tech support for this review as I had no reason to contact them<br/><br/>I have thus far only printed, and haven't attempted to use the assorted other functions, like faxing or scanning (I have a separate scanner which I have used for years and doubt that the smaller version included with the printer would meet my needs, though it could be fine for various documents).  The printing quality for scanned photos is so-so and a bit streaky, but I only have attempted this with garden variety copy paper as a trial for modifications before taking it to be professionally printed.</span>

<span>My old HP DeskJet 940c finally broke after many years of reliable service.  The 940c was HP's old version of a basic inkjet printer.  I needed only a basic printer to replace it and wanted to stay with HP, so I got this model last month.  It was easy to set up and seemed OK at first.  Sometimes it would pick up an extra piece of paper so there would be a blank sheet in the middle of a print job, but that's not a major problem.  I haven't had to print a lot since I've had it, no documents more than a few pages long.<br/><br/>Today, I tried to print a one-page document on regular 20 lb. paper, and so many sheets went through that there was a paper jam.  (I had even riffled through the paper before I inserted it so there would be air between the sheets.)  I had to remove the jammed sheets and print again, this time with fewer sheets inserted in the paper "tray" on the top of the printer.  It didn't jam, but all but one of the sheets from the paper area were pulled through.  This is ridiculous.  My old 940c had the paper tray on the bottom and had no paper jam problem, even with 24 lb. paper.  My brother has a discontinued HP model that has the paper "tray" on the top like this 1112, but his doesn't have the paper jam problem.  The older models were obviously better.<br/><br/>The only good things about this printer are the low price and the fact that your first two toner cartridges (black and tricolor) are included.  The toner cartridges are only about 2/3 the size of the toner cartridges that fit the 940c.<br/><br/>I will stick with this printer for now since it's all I can afford.  Fortunately, I don't need to do a lot of printing at this time.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2/3/2017: I have changed my earlier two-star review to a one-star review.  With my old printer that had larger toner cartridges, I was used to seeing the toner run out gradually -- if the black toner was low, anything printed in black would fade to lighter &amp; lighter shades of gray. Today, I printed a one-page Excel spreadsheet document that is mostly black border lines and text with some cells filled in with pastel colors. I've printed this same page many times (blank shopping list). On the top half of the page, the black lines and text printed fine -- then they faded out COMPLETELY! I tried printing the page again, and there was no black at all, not even a tiny bit of gray!  These are HP toner cartridges number 63 Black and 63 Tri-color.  DON'T BUY ANY PRINTER THAT USES THESE CARTRIDGES -- they're just too small! Shop around to find out which HP cartridges are larger, and see what printers they fit.  In the old days of Windows XP, you could check your estimated ink level, but Windows 7 (and probably all the later Windows) doesn't have this handy feature. If you have a larger cartridge than runs out gradually, at least you have some warning, but with these 63 cartridges you have no warning at all. This reminds me of the Volkswagen beetles in the very early 1960s -- they had NO gas gauge!  When you realized you were running out of gas, you could push a button or pull a lever that would give you a little more gas from a small auxiliary tank, enough to get to a gas station. This is not a joke or urban legend -- my parents bought one and soon got rid of it.</span>

<span>I need to regularly print about 20-30 pages a week. When my 7 year old Canon iP2702 started acting up I bought this as a second printer. It's a good color printer that produces beautiful laser like text and gorgeous photos even on plain paper. I got more than I expected and I'm quite happy with this purchase. However, the first week I had some minor problems. Instructions were not well organized so I had to use some trial &amp; error to figure stuff out. Also I was mistreated with constant HP popups telling me I need to buy ink. I was also aggressively routed over and over to the HP website without being asked. The fix for this annoyance is to use a good start up manager to prevent HP from controlling your computer whenever it wants. I never did like HP's overly aggressive tactics. Another minor flaw is that the ink cartridges tend to run out faster than my Canon. However many sites (including Amazon) sell a combo set of cartridges (color &amp; black) for about $20 or a bit less. By shopping around you can get a good deal. The ink gives about 4-6 weeks of moderate printing which is not as bad as other printers. Also note that when it tells you the ink is low that is a definite lie. Just keep printing until your printouts are no longer acceptable. Then change the cartridge &amp; you're back in business. Overall this is a basic color printer with good to excellent quality printing. The fact that the cartridges aren't overly expensive is another big plus.</span>

<span>I bought this printer on April 16, 2019.  It fits in a very small space and although it was white, it has been a wonderful printer.  I bought the HP63XL Ink to go with it (both the Color and the Black Ink.)  Until recently I have had very few issues with this printer.  The one thing I did notice was that after several months (probably after more then 6-8 months of use) the Printer Out of Ink Window stopped appearing.  Who knows why!!!<br/><br/>Other than clearing maybe one paper jam, and resetting my printer about once every 2 or 3 months, I haven't had any other issues with it.  I have used it to print everything under the sun, from professional papers to applications, and all kinds of Address Labels, Signs, and Tax Paperwork, as well as numerous craft projects for Children's Church while using a variety of paper stock!!!<br/><br/>The print quality was always excellent except of course, when ink was low!!!  This printer has truly been a work horse, and certainly well worth the $30.00 plus tax that I paid for it!!!<br/><br/>I did however, protect my investment by purchasing a 4 yr. Protection Plan from Asurion, and may have to use it very soon.<br/><br/>The Sunday Morning before last I ran this printer out of ink, and had to cancel the print job. I got one good copy of my lesson for Children's Church and that was okay.  This printer sat for over a week without any Black Ink in it.  That's my fault, but the extra ink that I thought that I had has disappeared.<br/><br/>Anyway, after working faithfully for almost a year and a half with very few issues, it won't print.  I keep getting a "User Intervention Error."  I will try again tomorrow to find a cure for my sweet little printer, but if I fail, I will be calling Asurion.<br/><br/>Thank GOD, I have already purchased another Printer.<br/><br/>This small compact printer was ONLY supposed to be a secondary printer!!!  I bought it when my large ALL-in-One Printer Failed!!!  However, due to the time and situation that I found myself in, (being gone 6 days a week to care for an ailing loved one) it has faithfully been my main printer for well over a year and has been doing a wonderful job up until now!!!<br/><br/>I would definitely buy this printer again!!!  But it's NOT available!!!<br/><br/>Most mechanical items fail after prolonged use!!!  Protect you investment - no matter how small - with a Protection Plan!!!  They come in handy!!!</span>

<span>So I have a $179 office jet 8710 printer that ran out of ink. HP went to great lengths to make sure you use genuine $100 ink so they have errors and warnings display (and in my case) the inability to print with certain ink purchased online.<br/><br/>The 8710 is great for duplex scanning and scanning using the document feeder which is mainly what I use this printer for. But here is where things get hairy. The ink refills for the 8710 are $100! For someone like me who prints 10-15 pages a year of some random document I need to sign, the ink drys up faster than I need to print!<br/><br/>I’m pretty financially savvy so I refuse to ever pay $100 for new ink. So rather than buying new ink for the 8710, I bought a brand new printer, this hp 1112. It fulfills my basic need to print documents and unlike the 8710, you can print black documents even when the color cartridge is empty!<br/>I print 99% in black and white and only occasionally need to print in color. So this printer is perfect for me. The best part is, a refill of the black ink which yields 2-300 pages is only $15 on eBay for genuine ink! For this amount of money I can buy a brand new printer any time I need one, yearly if needed, and either use the sample ink which yields 50-100 pages or buy a new black canister for $15. Either way, much better than paying $100 to refill my 8710.<br/><br/>Obviously the 1112 doesn’t scan nor do WiFi printing and it doesn’t come with a USB cable (but you can find those cables for a couple dollars online or at a goodwill store). This printer meets my needs perfectly to save me $70 by not replacing ink in my more expensive printer</span>

<span>The reviews and Q &amp; A's are conflicting as to whether this printer is compatible with computers running Linux. The truth is: yes, it is. But not in a way many people are used to. I struggled with this too. There are no native device drivers for this printer, for Linux. But like most popular modern printers, you can print from your phone on this printer, which means it supports Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP and AirPrint are protocols understood by the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS). So it will work but it may require some extra setup on your part. Especially if you are trying to set it up while not connected via USB. I have not tested the printer over USB, but I suggest you do that first if possible before taking any of my advice. Your Linux distribution might be able to detect and setup the printer automatically over USB. If not, or if you need to set-up over WiFi, here is the process I followed on Manjaro, specifics on your distro might be different.<br/><br/>1. If you have already been messing around with many settings. Use the printer's display and buttons to find the reset function to reset everything on the printer to factory defaults. It's under: initial setup &gt; reset &gt; machine reset.<br/>2. Start up the printer and connect it to your WiFi by following the included instructions.<br/>3. Access your router's admin portal, find the IP address of the printer and write it down. You should make it static as well. Otherwise the printer's local IP address might change in the future.<br/>4. Now enter the printer's IP into your browser, which will bring up a remote management portal.<br/>5. At the top, there is a login button with a text input box. Enter the password found on the sticker on the back of your printer and login.<br/>6. Go to the network tab.<br/>7. click "protocol" on the left-hand menu.<br/>8. Make sure "IPP" is checked.<br/>9. CUPS is probably already installed on your system. But just to be sure use your package manager to make sure you have CUPS installed, as well as the web interface. On Manjaoro, the package called "manjaro-printer" will download all the necessary stuff. I believe it is installed by default. Either way, you're looking for a package called CUPS, manage printing, CUPS web interface, or something similar.<br/>10. Now that CUPS is installed enter this URL in your web browser: http://localhost:631<br/>11. If you installed the right package, this should take you to a web page where you manage CUPS. At the top of the page, click "administration"<br/>12. Click "add printer".<br/>13. In the list on the next page, select "internet printing protocol (IPP)" and continue.<br/>14. For connection, enter "ipp://&lt;printer-ip-address&gt;:631" and continue. Replace "&lt;printer-ip-address&gt;" with an actual IP address...<br/>15. Add a name, description and location for the printer and continue. This information isn't critical. It will show up in print dialog boxes.<br/>16. Select "Brother" from the list of makes and continue.<br/>17. For model select "IPP Everywhere" (lol) and click "add printer".<br/>18. The next page has something to do with "banners". I have no idea what it is, doesn't seem important. Click "set default options".<br/><br/>That's it, the printer should be ready to use now. To print a test page:<br/><br/>1. Click "printers" in the menu at the top of the page.<br/>2. Click on the Brother printer you just finished setting up<br/>3. In the "maintenance" drop-down menu, select "print test page".<br/><br/>If everything worked out, you should see a new print job appear at the bottom of the screen and a few moments later the printer should whirr to life and spit out the test page. I hope this helped!</span>

<span>I ordered one of these for my Mom and it is excellent. It was easy enough to set up despite her OS, (I don't do Windows). The print is crisp and clear and it can print on both sides of the paper. I decided to get one for my hubby, too, since like Mom, he doesn't print often enough to prevent inkjets from clogging. The laser printer is a good solution.<br/><br/>Unfortunately things didn't go as well with the second printer. We all came down with COVID so I didn't get it set up right away. When I finally got well and motivated, I set it up for him and the printouts had a dark thick strip of ink along the left side. After trying every trick in the book. I realized that the cartridge was damaged. It was supposed to be good for I think 7000 printouts. I contacted Brother and they said because it was past the time to return the product, they were done with me. I didn't want a return. I was hoping for at least a discount on a new cartridge. but apparently fairness and customer satisfaction isn't in their policy. While I like the printer, I have great reservation about the company.</span>

<span>The Brother HL-L2300d is a great little laser printer. Easy to set up and maintain without headaches. I am quite particular about what I buy and use. I read through all the reviews and the FAQs before I decided to go with this printer. First of all, this printer has been out for a few years so it has stood the test of time. This printer allows you to reset the count (or clicks) on the toner cartridge and drum so you can get all the life out of these items. It is easy to set up and get running. The printer doesn't come with a USB printer cable, so just buy one at the same time or most people would have one on hand. To reduce possible problems, use a printer cable that is only 6 ft. or shorter. Problems arise when using long cords with serial data transmissions...just believe me on this.<br/>  This printer does not allow WiFi. Please understand that most problems that I see people having are with the WiFi connections. Listen to me when I tell you that WiFi, printers, sleep modes, dynamic DNS and overcrowding on WiFi routers do not always go together. Most WiFi printer setups are not ready yet for the typical consumer. It might work for a while, but throw the sleep mode into the mix and then you're in a pickle. It is so much easier to just use a USB printer cable. You may even thank me later.<br/>  I have Windows 10 and it was easy to install. The Brother support website does a good deal of providing directions and problems solving. There is one part that might throw you off so I will take the time to give you easy directions for Windows 10. Get your printer all ready according to the quick help guide (i.e. remove the packing materials and install the toner cartridge, load paper, install power cord and connect USB printer cable to the printer only). DO NOT turn on the printer or connect the USB cable to your computer yet. DO NOT use the installation CD/DVD that comes with the printer. Go to support.brother.com on the ol' interweb. Do a search on "HL-L2300D". It doesn't need to be in caps, but I did that for clarity. Click on downloads and the website automatically determines what OS version you have installed. At this point say, "How cool is 'dat!" in the same manner as the Crazy Russian Hacker. Start downloading the FULL DRIVER &amp; SOFTWARE PACKAGE. The software will start downloading and then will pause. This is when you plug the USB cable into your computer and turn the printer on. The software will continue to load and install your printer.<br/>  Now if you did like me, I got too antsy and plugged in my USB cable and turned on my printer before partially installing the software/drivers from the Brother website. This installed a built-in driver which only supports the basic functions of the Brother machine. You just need to back up the process. Have your printer on and connected via USB cable. Go to support.brother.com just as you would in the previous paragraph. Go to the download section and halfway down the page you see a UTILITIES section. Run this uninstall tool to get rid of this basic driver. Now unplug the USB cable from the computer and turn off your printer. Go back to the previous paragraph and get it done right this time.<br/>  Always use good quality paper especially when printing in duplex to reduce the risk of jams. I picked up some HP Office20 (20#) but am not really impressed by it. It works well but seems a little too translucent. Using slightly heavier (24#) and a better brand will easily fix that. I hope this review helps someone. Please take the time to read all the FAQs, sort through the good/bad reviews before and scour the specifications on the manufacturers' websites before making purchases. It will solve most of the problems people encounter.</span>

<span>I bought to use with foiling and paper crafting. Hubby decided to upgrade from his 1996 HP monochrome laser to an expensive color laser and he refused to let me buy generic toner drums for it and continue to use the old and true. However it did have some probems as it did not handle cardstock well. In the end rather than fight it I ordered this rather older model though still being made brother laser monocolor printer. And it has not let me down. As cheap as some of it feels overall it's wonderful. My two favorite things is it is a SMALL FOOT PRINT working next to my huge 19" color inkjet printer it's tiny. And it allows me to do straight passes which so far have accepted all cardstocks I've tried. I used a color 110# card stock and both 65 and 85 special smooth extra white cardstock I buy here on Amazon and everyone printed well and then laminated well when foiling. Extremely happy. Did I mention the TINY size. I intend to travel with this gem in a class b mini motor home so to speak and so continue to enjoy my hobby on the road trips too. I also splurged and upgraded my older legal size flat bed scanner with also an older obsolete fashion model by cannon that allows it to sit upright and feed upright or laid down for a flat bed but only 8.5x11 inch standard sheets. Again I'd been stuck with the albatross of over sized scanner cause hubby wanted this and when it arrived he rejected and stayed with his orginal even larger scanner. In the end he now is taking my reject and actually his all along and I'm finally enjoying the smaller sized officee hardware and more desk space. Love it. Now I know I could have gone with the color for less than 100 more in very similar size and Brother too but really I wanted to keep it simple. I want to test the waters without spending too much and leaves the bank account to spend more on FUN stuff like more cardstock and more foil patterns to play with. Look up H&amp;H signs for finding wonderful toner/textile foils they have a huge supply at great prices and note textile foil is what works with toner. Not all foils work the same way. So make sure you know which one  you are buying before buying or using the wrong one and ruining a project. (I have foils for glimmer hot embossing that is not the same foil. I have permanent vinyl foils for just that hardsurface applications, I have heat setting foils for just that ironing onto hard surfaces, paper and even fabrics. Then I have foils for toner work and yes they also work with some textile applications with special adhesive technques you may use with it. That I do not do just the toner to date. There also is foiling an foil flakes that work with tacky glues and pastes on cardstocks and fabrics too. So a lot to learn about foiling and that not all foils work across the board the same. I keep mine in different drawers labeled to insure I don't use the wrong product. Also to insure I get a good foil when it comes to fabric I always write on a flap or smaller to be applied piece of fabric rather than take the chance of ruining a tote bag etc. I spent hours sewing and damage it with a messed up foil job. Better to get the foiling done right before full assembly. So this printer I highly recommend if you know you are happy with no color other than BLACK print. It will do shades of gray by the way so it's possible to kind of play around with pencil drawings and get some lovely prints..I haven't tried to foil those however. Of course not. Meantime it does do two side printing but I don't do that. I don't want to worry about the interior getting dirty because I printed both sides. And with foil work  you don't want any extra toner specks on your work sheet to be foiled. If you do a brush that's great but if you go over the toner area you want to foil you can mess it up by removing too much and can't tell until it's foiled and little missed specks show up. Not sure why in Q/A they said you could not do cardstock. The bullet points say clearly you can. I proved you can. I would buy this printer again if something happens to this one. Should last a long time if I take care of it. And we take care of our hardwares and often my printers last well over 10 years and the scanner was over 19 years I just replaced. I also work with a windows 10 and a windows Xp machine. I do most of my graphics on The XP because a lot of the software I use and rely on is no longer supported sometimes no longer made and not for the W10's. So far the printer works flawlessly by either machine. I did not go with the Wifi version but my husband now wishes I would have. We got our comunications mixed up on that. No matter I'm happy and we've been married 50 years last month so we're fine and used to wee bits of nickering to keep us aligned and well. PS he hates his NEW COLOR Laser. He's got his eye on this Brother and that's ok too. He sneaks into my office area and uses my STUFF all the time. Ok sneaks not so much...he loves my big paper cutter and my Carl paper tirmmer and my various 4 different binder equipment. He used to offer to take them off my hands in fact. Silly guy...he's got his own. He's got the bigger office room with tons of drawers. But I've made my area work well with lots of clean work surfaces to lay out projects small and large. I know have embossing machines too. This little guy is going to get a huge work out and already passed with flying colors.</span>

<span>I bought this printer to replace a 14-year old Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer. That printer has an Ethernet connector that I used as well as USB and LPT connectors that I did not use.  I needed a replacement printer that I could access on my network from various computers around the house.  This Brother HL-L2300D had everything the Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer provided, but with only a USB connection.<br/><br/>I can report that I have installed this new Brother HL-L2300D on my wireless router USB port and have it printing flawlessly from my desktop and laptop.  I used no additional software other than what is built into the router and Windows 10.  The new printer's print quality is excellent, both the duplex printing and all other printing is quieter than the old printer, and it has a straight-through paper path for manual feed which improved envelope and label printing.  I have Continue Mode set ON and Auto Shutoff set OFF.  I have the new printer in a switched AC outlet, and only turn it on when I need it.  Using the switched outlet, the printer powers up and is ready to receive print jobs without having to press the Power button.  When I leave the switched outlet on and the printer falls asleep, the printer wakes up when the router sends it a print job.  This is exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>I hope this review will provide anyone else who has similar requirements with a way to test their system to make sure that using a USB-only printer connected to a router will work for them too.  I read about using the USB port on my ASUS N900 RT-N66U Wireless router to set up a network print server and wanted to be sure that would work, so I used the old printer to test that.<br/><br/>I decided to use my desktop for this test and make no changes on the laptop until ready to install the new printer.<br/><br/>Still using the old printer, I disconnected the ethernet cable and connected the printer to the router with a USB cable.  Using the web interface to the ASUS router (192.168.1.1 by defaults), within 60 seconds I saw Brother HL5250DN appear as a USB 2,0 connected device on the router.<br/><br/>Because I already had the Windows 10 driver installed for using this printer on an Ethernet port, all I had to do was add a new TCP/IP port to the router for the USB connection following these breadcrumbs:<br/><br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Brother HL-5250DN &gt; Manage &gt; Printer Properties &gt; Ports &gt; Add Port... &gt; Standard TCP/IP Port - New Port... &gt;<br/><br/>The Add Standard TCP/IP Port Wizard will appear.<br/><br/>Click Next<br/>Enter your router IP address, usually 192.168.1.1 in both the "Printer Name and IP Address" and the "Port Name" text boxes.  If you already have a port named 192.168.1.1, Windows will change the name to 192.168.1.1_1 automatically.<br/><br/>Windows will then try to detect that port for about a minute, then show a screen "Additional port information required".  Select Custom &gt; Settings to see the Port Settings dialog.<br/><br/>Change protocol from Raw to LPR<br/>Under LPR Settings enter a "Queue Name" such as LPRServer1<br/>Click Ok &gt; Next &gt; Finish and the new port will be shown in the ports list and selected for use by the existing Printer driver.<br/><br/>When I got the new Brother HL-L2300D, I used these breadcrumbs to install it on the desktop and laptop:<br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; My printer isn't listed &gt; Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings.<br/><br/>I followed all the screens in the wizards to install the new printer.<br/><br/>On the desktop, when I reached the point to define the port, I just selected the 192.168.1.1 that I had set up above.<br/><br/>On the laptop, when I reached the point to define the port, I followed the same steps as above to add the new port 192.168.1.1<br/><br/>On both the desktop and the laptop, when the Wizard asks you to select the driver you want, the Brother HL-L2300D will probably not be on the list.  Click the Windows Update button on that list page and Windows will download all the printer names for all printers for which Windows 10 provides drivers.<br/><br/>Hope this is helpful.</span>
