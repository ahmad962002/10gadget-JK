<span>Came broken at first (Dead pixels on image sensor). I ended up getting it from Microcenter for an even cheaper price and the camera is awesome. I love it.

<span>Update: the video quality is so much better than the original Mevo.  Some helpful hints if you have a large auditorium and you want to zoom in this is not the camera for you.  We stream to FB and YouTube live.  We only have 22 YouTube subscribers for our channel.  So in order to go live on multiple platforms you need another software to do that.  We use Vimeo.  To go live on YouTube you must use the RTMP button on Mevo.  Set up your stream on YouTube Studio and get your URL and streaming key to paste into Mevo.  Great thing is the Mevo will save it and YouTube doesn’t change it for a new stream when you reuse your settings.  Once everything is programmed into the Mevo it gets much easier to go live.  Again the video quality with the Mevo Start is so much better than the Mevo Plus.  We spent about $800 for the original and this was only $399.  You get your monies worth if you can leverage all its features.  Also if you are being asked for constant firmware updates which Mevo are you using and is your app updated.<br/><br/>Our church has been using the first generation Mevo for over three years.  We didn’t realize how outdated our Mevo camera was.  The video streaming began to get worse and we kept losing signal and the audio was terrible.  I went looking for another camera but Mevo still came up in the top.  I looked at the specs of the Mevo Start and realized how outdated our original Mevo was.  Today we streamed our service for the first time using Mevo Start and people complemented our video on how clear it was.  We had no audio issues or dropped internet.  We also didn’t have to plug it in since we stream for about 2 hours.  We always liked Mevo and they have made streaming affordable for our church.  This Mevo Start addressed most of our issues with the first Mevo we had.  Also the price has gone down from what we paid for the original Mevo.  It is worth the price.  It does so much more than just record video.  I love the app also.</span>

<span>I purchased a Mevo start in July of this past year, 2020 and started using it to livestream our church services a few weeks later. Our budget was small and our volunteer work force, because of Covid, was smaller. I did a lot of research on which direction to pursue. My son-in-law had suggested one of these a few months earlier when we were in full lock down and recording our services to be uploaded to FB and YT. I purchased one after a lot of reading and comparing to other possible streaming directions. It has taken awhile but the camera is mounted from our ceiling, about 12' high on an adjustable pole bringing it down to about 8'. I then network hardwired to the router with the power being supplied by a smart plug which I control by an app on my phone. I control it with a mini iPad 4. I purchased a Yamaha 6 channel mixer which I use to add reverb to the musical portion of our service, the worship. The audio is wired from the church's soundboard to the Mevo 3.5mm input above the usb-c port. I am in the process of ethernet hardwiring my mini iPad 4 also. I do have that adapter, cables, and network switch. I just need to find the time to implement it. I must say that if used within its limitations, just like everything else, it just plain works, and works very well. Hardwiring the ethernet is very important, does not amount to much more expense and gives a pretty much fail-safe internet connection barring any very unforeseen circumstances. The audio was my biggest challenge since I was trying to find something fairly inexpensive to mix with, adding an adjustable reverb effect, just the right size for my application and something that when added to my components, could be all controlled by one person. Your streaming video can be good, bad, or hopefully, not so ugly, but if you do not have quality audio, you may as well go home because you will not keep your audience's attention for very long.<br/>I am glad I purchased the Mevo Start and may buy another since before permanently mounting, it had proved useful elsewhere, such as our men's retreat at a remote location with wi-fi.<br/>If used correctly and researching for your application beforehand, you can make a responsible intelligent decision.</span>

<span>Welcome to the webcam big leagues, folks. Sporting 1080p60 and 1080p30HDR modes and a HUGE (for a webcam) sensor, this baby is in a league of its own.<br/><br/>This camera also outputs uncompressed H.264 video, and this requires a lot of bandwidth so you NEED to give it its own USB3 port. Do not use a hub, even a powered one.<br/><br/>Two complaints: the included type-C to type-A cable is way too short (which is a cheap fix, just get a USB3 extension cable), and the autofocus is absolutely garbage. AF keeps locking on to random objects and can't stay in one setting. Just use manual focus if you're not going to be moving around much in your scene.<br/><br/>Once you get your settings dialed in, however, this webcam has the best video quality I've ever seen in a webcam.</span>

<span>For a year and a half, I had used a Logitech c920. My c920 features the Carl Zeiss lens. The c920 served me well and I never had any issues with it. However, I desired a camera that had better image quality. When I noticed the Kiyo Pro on sale for $99, I decided to give it a try. I have not been disappointed. The image quality on the Kiyo Pro is markedly better.<br/><br/>I use the cam strictly with ZOOM. I use a green screen and alternate backgrounds for every meeting. I have excellent lighting and with a little effort have been able to present my image without ghosting which is common with everyone I have seen trying to use a virtual background. The Kiyo Pro makes it even easier to eliminate ghosting. With the Kiyo Pro, I do not even have to light my green screen separately as I did with the c920. I turn on the key lights and hair lamp and that is it. For someone wanting to use a virtual background and green screen, this camera will improve your image and decrease ghosting, however, you will continue to experience ghosting with a poor setup.<br/><br/>Speaking of a poor setup; if your lighting is less than ideal, you will love this camera. The low light capabilities are head and shoulders better than the c920. Very little light is needed to provide a clear image in comparison to the c920.<br/><br/>I've had the camera for a month. On first use, I was prompted to install updated firmware. The installation was completed without issue. Whatever problems others have had, seems to have been corrected, at least in my case.<br/><br/>As far as the autofocus that is the disdain of most reviewers, I believe that it is probably much improved. Although I can say that it is far from perfect. Compared to the c920, I would say neither is that good with the autofocus, although the Kiyo Pro does seem to hunt for focus a little more often. Both cameras do however focus correctly. Since I am for the most part setting still in front of the camera I could turn off autofocus and adjust manually, but it is not so bad that I have thought about doing that.<br/><br/>The Razer Synapse software used to adjust the image and field of view works well and is easy to use. I have seen a lot of reviews complaining about it for various reasons, but I have had no issues. However, once you configure your settings, you do have to make sure you check the box that allows the software to load on Windows startup. Everyone's setup will require unique settings, yet for the most part, the out of box settings in my case was excellent. I simply selected the narrow field of view and added a little warmth and it looks great. I do not use the HDR.<br/><br/>Now for the bad:<br/>On a number of occasions, the image has either frozen or presented a black screen. This has not occurred unless I have stopped my video (ZOOM controls) and then restarted. Or have switched between Synapse and ZOOM. So if I am in a ZOOM meeting, it works perfectly as long as I don't stop my video. If I do stop the video and then restart the video by clicking on the ZOOM controls, about one out of 5 times, the video does not return. In that case, I have to unplug the camera and replug. Fortunately, my USB port is on the side of my monitor and is therefore easy to do.<br/><br/>I can't comment on the microphone since I use a Tonor mic.</span>

<span>I really wanted to like the Razer Kiyo Pro Streaming Webcam, but the experience has really been made up of a few different stories.<br/><br/>I’ve bought a number of Razer keyboards and mice over the years, so I wasn’t surprised by the Kiyo Pro’s slick retail packaging.  Open the box and you’re treated to the sight of a CHUNKY webcam affixed to a folding stand, sitting in a cavity in foam.  I immediately detached the folding stand, and was left with a cylindrical camera that’s reminiscent of a DX-sized, short focal length DSLR lens.  The resemblance is probably not accidental, as you have the F-stop, focal length and knurled top outer ring plainly visible.  The stand seems fine, though I don’t know why you’d use it with a $200 webcam.  A lenscap and braided USB-A to USB-C cable round out the hardware.<br/><br/>Plug the Kiyo Pro into a Windows 10 machine, and it will be detected as a normal UVC device.  That’s to say that it will be listed in your Device Manager, and will be visible to your camera-aware programs and services.  It will also be using whatever settings are configured from the factory.  Accessing the hardware settings requires the installation of Razer’s Synapse software.  My initial excitement at seeing a 6MB download turned to resigned dread as I saw that another 345MB need to be downloaded.  This is probably fine if you can amortize this bloat over a full ecosystem of Razer peripherals, but I only have the Kiyo on this PC.  Ugh.  Once you get the software installed, it (in an nVidia-esque way) asks you to create an account.  Ugh.  Thankfully, you can skip past that, but it does ask you one more time.  Synapse is ok, but it isn’t fast, possibly owing to its “plug-in” type architecture.  Once in the Kiyo Pro widget, you can turn off AF, set a fixed focus point (assuming AF is off), set the FOV, and set a number of image adjustment parameters.  Considering the AF was hunting all over the place, I found disabling the AF and setting a fixed focus point to be the right solution for me.  It was at this point that I saw that there was a firmware update available (though no indication of what level of firmware the Kiyo Pro had loaded).  Easy, right?  Wrong...<br/><br/>Clicking on the link for the firmware download should have been a trivial exercise.  The link went to a support article directing you to contact support if you wanted the update.  Huh?  I got on live chat on the Synapse website, which required the device’s serial number (inconvenient to get to, since I already had the device mounted).  What followed was a 20 minute chat session.  I asked for the firmware 4 times.  The last time I asked, I was told that I needed to download a log generation tool.  I downloaded and ran the tool, and it created a 2.8MB ZIP file, with over 27MB (across 57 files) of data inside.  What?  I explained to the extremely patient tech that I didn’t feel comfortable sending 27MB of data about my PC to them, just to QUALIFY to get a firmware update.  She explained that the ZIP file was much smaller (not the point), and that my data would be only seen by people who needed to see the information.  Again, this is to get a firmware installer.  She eventually relented and gave my a tiny link to an all-in-one installer, which updated me from version 1.0 to 1.3.<br/><br/>Without a changelog, I wasn’t really sure what to expect from the update.  As is happens, the firmware update bricked the camera.  It was still detected by the OS, but no video was visible.  Same result on multiple PCs.  Time to go back to support.  Ugh.  What unfolded was OVER TWO WEEKS of wrestling with support.  That was chats on the portal.  Messages on the portal.  Attachments uploaded to the portal.  In the end, it was tons of wasted time.  I really only bothered with support for the purposes of this review, since I hadn’t ever dealt with Razer on a support issue.  In the end, I just returned it to Amazon for an exchange.<br/><br/>If this review were just about the camera, it would be pretty easy.  The build quality is extremely high, and the video quality is very good for a 1080p camera.  It is a LITTLE better than my Logitech C920 Pro, which is around the same price.  The video quality is a bit better than a no-name 4K unit that I’d tried using for a while.  Low light performance is pretty good, owing to its decent CCD and f2.0 lens.  Ultimately, though, it still comes down to CCD size.  You see, the CCD is TINY.  While the Kiyo Pro does extremely well for a webcam, it’s still not going to come close to what you’d get using a DSLR as your stream cam.  I would assume most people already knew that, but you never know who will get sucked into the marketing vortex.  Speaking of marketing, the materials tout the Sony STARVIS CMOS CCD.  I already have a number of IP cameras with these imagers, so I’m familiar with what they are, and how they work.  The imager is back-illuminated, stabilized, and has a bit of image processing.  While the imager itself has somewhat higher sensitivity, it’s largely the post-processing that essentially denoises a long exposure.  It’s not magic - it’s nice to have, but it really doesn’t change an awful lot when it comes to low light scenarios with the Kiyo Pro.  You will need some lighting for best results.<br/><br/>So, we’re finally down to the price.  At $200, the Kiyo Pro is somewhere in the Logitech C920/930 Pro to Brio range.  The Razer is also between those two segments of Logitech’s webcam product stack in terms of image quality, too.  Generally speaking, that would make the Kiyo Pro a reasonable value.  However, that presupposes that NOTHING goes wrong with your Razer product.  All I can say is this: if you EVER need to deal with Razer support, I hope you have a better experience than me.  While everyone I dealt with seemed nice enough, nobody was actually helpful.  Ick.  Unless you’re in love with the looks of the Kiyo Pro, and expect to deal with Amazon if you have any issues, you should get something else instead.</span>

<span>This WebCam has very good camera quality. You can adjust the video software that you are using to video chat to change how you appear on the camera as well, but I wish the camera was easier to manipulate in settings for low lights and a lot of light settings. The other issue I had with it is the material used to manufacture this product is cheap plastic. The privacy cover broke when I was trying to put it on/it is supposed to bend. They go up and down but it snapped right in half after adjusting it twice. That should not have happened because even the adjustable camera goes up and down and that did not break. However, the WebCam itself is hard to adjust to where you want it because of how tight the cheap plastic is that you have to move to adjust its position. Most monitors are flat nowadays, and I have a really flat monitor. This WebCam does not attach to the back of your monitor with the pad that is on the bottom of the adjustable arm like it is supposed to. That is because of my monitor being too flat, of should not be a problem either.</span>

<span>Pros<br/>Good sensor, for what you can get on a computer (pc/laptop) I’ve tried it in light and dark rooms. It’t not better than what your getting with an iPhone or high end android device. But it’s a lot better than several I’ve used including other Logitech and some off brands and few Microsoft ones as well as several laptops.<br/><br/>Mics good too<br/><br/>No external branded weird software to get in the way. They kept this clean just as I like it. It’s just works. That’s what we want we are working no nonsense Logitech gets it.<br/><br/>(internal) Software/drivers and hardware is good: this is what I mean. Logitech generally an expensive company. You could say overpriced, but their stuff has worked well for me when competing products haven’t. The mice for example are fantastic. They have these little touches and never fails that’s not the review but I’m just saying their products are well together on the software end. Autofocus works no messing around with your operating system trying to get the camera to work. It works fine with Team and Zoom.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Cost: I mean 170 is a lot of money for  good but not high end camera. Think about a high end Iphone or a highend Samsung phone. You almost expect that for a 200 stand alone camera. This is sharp but it can’t touch those kinds of cameras on color or light handling. Does it matter for office calls. Ehh, but still your spending this you must care right? I did. I got tired of looking like a faded blurry mess which is why i upgraded to this. Your just not making memory here. They aren't artistic beautiful web cam pictures but you look pretty decent.<br/><br/>The biggest con for me is the stand. I get it everyone will complain about a stand I’m telling you take their 910/920 series and give me that stand anyway. It sticks better on the monitor, it pivots way better. This thing has a tripod attachment, but I don’t know many offices workers sticking a tripod on the desk. This is the place where I thought they could do a ton better. I mean I can live with it, but it needlessly sucks. Once you get it right it’s basically set and forget well unless if you are a call with a whiteboard and moving around or something (I do that).<br/><br/>It's a good camera. I ‘d probably do it again, because again the other ones just don’t create clear video or have other problems, I prefer to buy something good rather and keep it for like 10 years. I had a C910 for 10-11 years until it got a bit flakey. I bought a Microsoft one before that the cam studio where the autofocus never worked right and kept getting crappy ones form my it department that had weird issues or were impossible to see fine details. I finally expensed this, they pushed back and I just appealed to them … environmental care … buy suggesting continuing to buy me crap that breaks or doesn’t’ wrok will just fill landfills. Just get me a good camera and be done with it.  They are happy because I went away and shut up about the camera . And I am because I ‘ve got Gorilla tape holding a great camera to my monitor. It’s  win for everyone. I think you’ll be happy. You’ll be mildly annoyed with the stand. Don’t expect iphone. Expect good computer camera for calls.</span>

<span>Working remotely and the built-in camera in the laptop does not produce the greatest video.  I decided to by this and hang it on top for Teams Meetings.

<span>Bought these to replace my canary cameras due to them moving everything under a subscription. So im using these with the sync 2. Quality is pretty good but grainy when zoomed in and they don't seem to connect to the 5 network. only the 2.4. App is pretty basic and the login gets stuck sometimes making it so I have to close the pap out and reopen. This is for android. What really stinks is the app doesnt have a gps feature to auto arm and disarm when you leave/com home but you can work something out using IFTTT but it really should be built in. YEs you can schedule times to arm and disarm but that isnt too convenient when you don't have set times that you leave and if they are armed when you are home the notifications just pile in.</span>

<span>This product is a great product overall for its function however the miss leading information that a lot of buyers are not aware of is issue with the app. I have contacted customer service regarding my issue about the app and none of them were able to help resolve the problem. if you already have the app for another camera for another house house or institution and You want to add additional cameras to other facilities or homes the original app will not allow you axis to any new cameras at different houses without logging off one to get to another. I contacted the manufacture representative about the issue they saying that they are working on fixing this problem because many other people have this issue.  should when they design the app that has multi function to allow customers to have access to more camera one App camera it will be an excellent product.( My dilemma Since my sibling set up a blink camera in my mom‘s home she gave me access to have to that camera to check up on mom; so now I have I already have the app and it being use already now I  have my blink camera ; the app won’t work for my camera with me losing access to mom blink camera. ) I really like the product I like the size but it didn’t work as a attended to perform . 🙁</span>

<span>We bought a set of these on sale to help keep an eye on our dogs while we are away/ to keep an eye on the baby cribs when the children go to nap.<br/><br/>They work great for the dogs but it took a little adjustment for the babies. The reason is because at night the cameras have to switch to night mode when activated. This causes the camera to make a slight ticking noise. Of course babies being babies, picked up on this right away and were originally weary of the camera.<br/>However, they got used to it quickly and now have no problems with the camera.<br/><br/>I can say that the night vision works well and I like the alerts provided when movement is picked up.<br/><br/>Another slight hiccup I've experienced a few times is that if the motion alert is activated, you can't turn the alerts off until the camera is done with its 10 second recording.<br/>Not the biggest deal but it makes it challenging to time it correctly to deactivate the alert.<br/><br/>Overall, I think its a good budget camera and it works well with the rest of our Blink system.</span>

<span>I received this C960 webcam yesterday. I bought it because it seemed simple to use, looked like great video at 1080p hd, dual speakers, low profile, good price. Since it's a PLUG-N-PLAY, why not put these words first on the user guide so users don't have to figure out what all the documents are for, in addition to indicating on user guide a #5. eMeetLink for Windows/MacOS to learn how to adjust the camera.....ughhh, it was so disappointing to spend over an hour figuring this out only to find out, the webcam installed itself as soon as you plugged it in. One guide had me find the device manager and 'UNINSTALL' the webcam off my laptop, unplug,, then plug it up again......WHY???? On the EMEET website there are 5 downloads for the C960, with a couple of them having ZIP files that I extracted, and some having a different webcam model number on it. THERE IS NO SOFTWARE TO DOWNLOAD TO ADJUST THE WEBCAM. Adjustments, from what I can tell, are in the media app you're using the webcam with.....and that seems limited.<br/>This is my first review of this product. Tomorrow I begin the work week and will be using the webcam, which is why I bought it in the first place. I'll provide a review after using it for this first week. Hopefully I won't have to return it. YES the 90degree view is awesome and/or can be intrusive in a small place. Another issue was the "Quick Start Guide' #4. Mount to tripod......well, why not put optional here. I had to find a YouTube video to figure out how to put on my laptop's screen. This C960 webcam better be worth all the time it took me to figure this out.<br/><br/>10.7.22<br/>Adding to my original review....I used the webcam all week and I received good comments on video/picture quality and microphone. I also used it at night in low light, the image was great, no dullness, no darkness, I almost didn't need to use my video ring. The picture was clear and defined. At this point the only downside is that you can't zoom in. So although you're sitting a foot away, it appears like you're really far back from the camera. It's wide zoom, with from what I can tell, no way to center yourself in the middle of the screen. It looks a bit weird when everyone seems to be in a perfect position, centered in the middle of their screen and I'm sitting so far back....when I'm actually sitting as close as they are. Haven't decided if I'll keep it yet because of this.</span>

<span>I bought this to use when I don't want to use my laptop camera for meetings.  It's got nice quality for both picture and microphone.  It didn't want to work consistently when I hooked it up to the docking station.  I have to plug it directly into the laptop to get it to work best.  A few times it wouldn't turn on. I simply unplug it, wait 10 seconds and plug in again.  That's been a little annoying but only happened a few times.  For the amount I use it, it's not super horrible. Just be aware.</span>

<span>I love this webcam. I wanted a new webcam for my PC to be able to video chat with my friends without having to turn on my laptop. I'm super happy I found this one. When reading the reviews before purchasing, people complained about how the lighting changes depending on room lighting, however, I find this to be positive. The camera lighting adjusts really well to the room lighting and you really don't need to have a light on to be able to see things in the camera during the night.<br/>I can't comment on the mic or mic quality as I have a headset and don't use the webcam microphone.<br/>The stand for this webcam was a bit confusing to use at first and I wasn't sure it would be able to stay balanced on top of my monitor but once I got the hang of it, I think it works quite well. I'm happy to say that you can adjust the angle of the camera quite easily without having to take it off your monitor or worrying about it falling. I like that the camera cover requires you to actually touch it the entire time you're opening or closing it because I know the cover won't fall down over the camera accidentally if I don't push it up the whole way. The hinge is stiff but in a positive way. Will buy a second one for my partner once he decides to upgrade his webcam!</span>

<span>I'm not a camera expert, nor am I a professional streamer. I just work from home and needed a webcam. This one was pretty good (honestly probably better than I realize), but it started flickering and having trouble about two months ago.<br/><br/>It finally got so bad that I called Elgato customer support. They were so helpful, I was amazed. You don't see good customer support anymore, and from the very first conversation, I knew I was in good hands. They got some information about the issue and asked for computer specs and a video sample of the flickering. Once they saw that, they figured out that I needed to adjust a setting and update my firmware.<br/><br/>I went back and forth with them for about two days but they were extremely helpful. That alone is worth buying this camera over others. They resolved my issue (updating the firmware) and I can still use my camera.<br/><br/>Also, I think it's worth noting that when I called them it was very easy to get ahold of them on the phone. There wasn't endless menus with robots running me around in circles.<br/><br/>I am very impressed, so much that I came here to write a review. Thanks Elgato!</span>

<span>I researched So many cameras, I am SO happy that I went with this one! It is inexpensive but works perfectly. Easy to set up, just plug it into the wall whenever I want to use it. It sits on the window ledge and gazes at my front door/walk and driveway. I set the viewing area to Not pickup the street else I get notified for every car that goes by! It detects everything, lighting changes, insects, the cats hitting the camera - and you can let it know via the app what the "event" was to improve the ai. You get notified on your phone via the app if you want to, and there's a little picture of the event, or you can go to Wyze app and see a few second video clip of each event. There are frequent deals for the Wyze subscriptions (required to receive notifications and have event videos saved) and it's well worth it, I think mine was only $10-20 for a year subscription. The images are clear even at night and through my window pane or screen and the detection is extremely accurate. Plus if I don't want it on I just unplug. No Batteries needed! Great purchase. Get this one!</span>

<span>The Wyze team are killing it with this one.  Their low cost products have always been a good draw.  My prior Wyze camera was the pan camera - good price for one that I could make spin around and look up and down.  I bought two v3 to get my side yards.<br/><br/>My primary cameras are nest...traditionally seemed to be the top of the line for this new generation of cloud based IP cameras - highest quality but highest cost.  But at least with the nest app I felt I was getting what i paid for.  Now those guys at Google made their new cameras not work with their own nest app, only the Google Home, which is crazy to me.  The Google Home currently doesn't let you see the *entire* 24 hour history within your subscription time frame, which was always a key distinguisher from Ring and other IP cameras - only highlights!  I had ordered a 2 pack of their new cameras  on Prime Day but then did some more reading and found out about the lack of nest app support, and found my existing nest cams could not access more than highlights/alerts in Google Home app, and decided that was just not going to be good enough.  I want to be able to look through the entire feed in case an alert didn't catch everything.<br/><br/>Then I decided to look at Wyze - I'd read their emails and was interested in their skylight night color and decided I would 'try' their $35 camera instead of the nest $120 camera.  After all, the new v3 is outdoor rated, has great night vision and has a lower cost, can install SD cards for onboard extended feed coverage (not just alerts) and I'm already using the Wyze app for my two pan cameras so I'm already in the ecosystem in my Google Home.  So I ordered 2 Wyze v3 cameras.<br/><br/>Installation - First, even the box is small...reminded me of the Blink camera size.  I ordered SD cards for the v3 cams to give me that very long look-back ability (very cheap for the sizes needed).  When I went to install I realized the USB cable/power line was thin - and I was able to run it inside my window track so as to NOT DRILL into my siding (because lets face it, eventually i may change to something different and who wants to put holes in their siding).  Unfortunately I did have to poke the cable through the screen b/c my screen didn't slide up/down.  Like I said, the camera is very small and light, so when I mounted I only needed one small screw (provided with kit) to hold it in place.  There was a magnet ring around screw area, and that could have helped with the mount, but I didn't use it.  The camera has left right and up down hinges so I was able to point it in the place I wanted to.<br/><br/>Performance - I am happy with the camera's performance.  Its 1080p.  One camera is on side with street light, and that area stays color lit with the starlight feature and yes can see pretty well.  The other camera is in more shaded part and uses the gray IR feed, and yes I can see what's going on there pretty well.  Unfortunately I don't think any of these cameras can "zoom" in and really see someone's face or a license plate, but that's just a limit they all have if you don't have a mechanical zoom presumably like the traditional fully wired camera security systems.  But I'd say the picture quality is on par with my $350 nest outdoor v2 IQ camera.  I haven't tried the higher level wyze plans with their version of person recognition, so can't comment on the facial recognition aspect, but I'm totally fine with losing that one feature when everything else has the $35 camera totally pacing the $350 camera.  What a value difference and its crazy the quality you get for this price point.  Wyze is really a super top level choice in the budget to mid-level home camera market.  Extremely happy.</span>

<span>I love these cameras they are so easy to use so easy to hang up they stay up with the sticky pad that comes with or even just a little duct tape or blue painters tape if you want to reposition them multiple times to get the view you want.  No need for complicated outside cameras that need wire or batteries. These cameras work right through our windows while plugged in to any outlet. They even capture excellent pictures through screens with just a tiny amount of distortion. Definitely get the 32 SD card so you can keep track, so easy to erase, reset-<br/>all remotely. Excellent voice and sound quality-- outstanding product.  I have views out all sides of my house with just 4 of these! What a deal. Color and vision is excellent day and night. I either set them on a window sill inside my home or configure their bases to hang them (with a little painters tape) up against the window glass.</span>

<span>Lets face it for the price it's hard to complain much about a 1080, indoor/outdoor camera that works pretty well.  Setup was pretty easy, it has the ability to record 24/7 to a microSD, it has competitively priced options for cloud storage as well and the video quality is pretty good.<br/><br/>In 2022 though I'm still amazed how poor the feature set is across companies making these products.  First of all every brand should have both local and cloud storage options, period and wyze checks this box.  I see a lot of break ins and even the smash and grab thieves have learned to take the camera, rip the camera doorbell off etc.  If you have local external storage the cameras record to, get it away from your router/modem and hide it (it better be wifi) or they will find that and take it too.  So we can debate the privacy of cloud storage but you really want a system with both local and cloud, and preferably 24/7 cloud recording for any wired cameras.  I can't count the number of break ins I've seen where the owner had cameras but either ended up with no video, or at best a couple notifications on their phone with no recordings.<br/><br/>24/7 recording to the cloud is ideal, you want to be able to go back in a camera feed in case something odd happens.  For example most people if they have a camera in their front yard set it so it won't notify them of cars and people on the sidewalk, understandable you'd be getting alerts every 5 minutes.  However, if your neighbors mention a strange car has been parked across the street, or a strange person has been walking around recently, you want to be able to go back and look at footage for the last few days.  Wyze cannot do this last part, all you can get is motion notification recordings to the cloud, you can do this through the camera if you use 24/7 recording to the SD card.<br/><br/>Multi-person geofencing, this is the one that really amazes me that more companies don't have.  If they are 24/7 outdoor cameras, or you live alone it might not be a big deal, but the fact that more companies can't geofence all the members of a family is hugely annoying and unless everyone in the family is diligent about manually engaging/disengaging cameras you either get bombarded with notifications (that you'll soon start ignoring) or the cameras don't get turned on when no one is home, either of these is good.  Wyze cannot do this, and after using systems with that feature it was a deal breaker.<br/><br/>Integration is the last part that's difficult but important.  For example it would be nice if say the camera in the backyard saw someone at 9pm, or your doorbell camera sees someone at the door, it would automatically put that video up on say an Echo show, smart tv, etc. if you had one to let you see what is going on.<br/><br/>What's worse is the features change even in the same brand based on the equipment, some cameras for brand X record to the cloud, some don't, some work with alexa, some won't, even if you commit to a single brand functionality changes.  Now I understand with battery cameras you can't get 24/7 recording, but you'll see wired cameras for a brand some record to the cloud, some don't, some only record clips to the cloud, some record 24/7, etc.  Companies also do not make it easy to figure out this in advance as a consumer, likely on purpose.  Many will say "works with alexa" but it's hard to find out exactly what functionality is there.  Can you just ask alexa to show the video on an echo show, can alexa alert you if there's a notification, can alexa automatically play camera video if motion is detected, etc.<br/><br/>This isn't just beating up on Wyze because the majority of camera companies these days still don't offer these features, but it's something to keep in mind to know the limitations.  That said for the price you can do a lot worse than these.</span>

<span>Unfortunately it arrived defective so I wasn't able to really test it out very much. The few shots I did manage to take had great color but the zoom factor was not very high. It would be great for doing some vlogging and landscapes plus other wide type shots.</span>

<span>I needed a point and shoot with some advanced features and this totally fit the bill. I have a full sized DSLR and a mirrorless camera and was looking for something I could put in my pocket or fanny pack and not lug around a bunch of gear all the time. I was thinking of purchasing a Ricoh GRIII but I just couldn't see myself spending 1k for a camera with a built in prime lens (no zoom). This camera is really fast, touch screen functions are great, and image quality and color is fantastic. It's pretty solid feeling in the hand, has a nice weight to it, and dials and buttons all feel great and have nice placement. Some reviews complain about battery life but I haven't had any problems. I mainly shoot stills and an occasional video and the battery lasted all day. I'm from an older photography generation so coming home with 1200 pics is not something I do.  I may shoot 30/50 stills per day so the battery lasts for almost 1 week. Battery life does suffer when shooting video but the videos look really good. If you're just beginning with photography this camera has some features you might not need or want as of yet so save your money and downgrade a bit. Overall a good camera!</span>

<span>This camera is ok. Its a 1080p resolution, not 4k. Not impressed</span>

<span>Works well with no issues so far<br/> We needed to upgrade since our laptop's built-in camera and our other webcam were 480p and with very poor low light performance. My wife has been teaching online and once she switched to this camera everyone commented how much better the video was. The image is Crisp, and the colors are vivid. As a plus, the built-in microphone is also a step up from the one in the laptop. We have tried it on 3 computers and it has worked fine in all. We didn't really need the ring light feature, but it may become handy later. The view angle is perfect with no distortion to the picture. Also, the clip to attach it to a monitor or a laptop lid is well designed and comes with small tripod, which is great. Overall, we are happy with this purchase.</span>

<span>Runs great at 1080p.  At 4k you only get like 15 fps. Still has a nice picture and the built in light has 3 settings, all of which are bright. Not a bad camera for the price.</span>

<span> I love this camera especially because of how high quality the picture is. I am not a tech type of person. But with this camera I didn’t need to be. It was so simple to use and set up. The lighting is great and it makes the quality of FaceTime calls much better, pictures better and even light to the area surrounding my laptop which is really helpful as well. I didn’t realize the difference it made because I was so used to the camera in my MacBook, but now…I don’t think I’ll ever go back to not using this camera!!!</span>
