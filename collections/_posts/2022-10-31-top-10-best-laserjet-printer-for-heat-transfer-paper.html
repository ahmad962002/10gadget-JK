<span>Printing onto the transfer paper from our laser jet printer was very easy, as was transferring the designs onto sweatshirts just using a hand-held iron. You can see the excess transfer material on darker colored clothing (see green sweatshirt), but it blends in well on lighter colors (see gray). The transfers also survived their first washer/dryer cycle intact.</span>

<span>When I first tried the iron on transfers following the directions I messed up a couple shirts :( I just knew I was going to leave a bad review but then I read other reviews and found out that you need to let the transfer cool before peeling off the backing. After that information the transfers worked perfectly with my iron. Will definitely purchase again.</span>

<span>Update on 03-11-2019: I wound up putting decals on four shirts. I washed and dried them today, and they look great. Original Review - Excellent. I used this to make 3.5" round iron-on patches for my astronomy club. I carefully followed the instructions, and they worked great. I ironed the patch onto two shirts to make sure they're okay before I take them to the next club meeting. So far, so good. I'll be washing and drying both shirts over the next couple of days and will follow up if there is a problem after washing. Some important points: 1. I used the "cotton" setting on my iron, with the steam shut off. I pressed hard each time and kept the iron in full contact with the transfer.  2. You have to use parchment paper in the final pressing step. I ordered mine from Amazon, but you could probably find it in a grocery store as it is frequently used for baking and for separating frozen meats, etc.  3. I put both of mine on cotton shirts. At first I used the "cotton blend" setting on my iron, and the decal started lifting up when I tried to peel the backing paper off. So, before it did any damage, I increased the iron setting to "cotton" and ironed another 10 seconds on the backing paper. After it cooled, the backing paper came right off.  4. For the second shirt, I used the same parchment paper, and a small piece of the decal stuck to the parchment paper. So my recommendation is to use a fresh piece of parchment paper for each transfer.  5. If you haven't done this before, start out with something small and on a piece of fabric that you don't mind pitching if you mess up.</span>

<span>It cracks easily. Photo attached isn’t best representation since I am completely aware this is for whites, but didn’t want to waste good material.<br/>It also feel ver plastic. You can see border lines even on the white areas ( I used a heat press)<br/>Update: after nearly waste most of my paper found that 350 f for 27 seconds at medium to high pressure gets better results. (See second picture the with no.4 which been wash 3 times already) it’s very plastic (which is expected with this kind of material) but get the job done.<br/>Giving it 4 stars<br/>For best results use a cutting machine (if you have one) and weed out the blank unnecessary space.</span>

<span>Amazing color and image transfer, no color loss after wash. Very hard to peel after cooling from press. Considering testing out a pre-slit in the middle of design back to see if that helps peeling process next. May not be as easy to avoid cutting through design though.</span>

<span>Easy to use once you get all the materials. Fortunately, we just broke down an old desk, so I used a piece of the particle board to iron on top of.  It fit perfectly. That’s the only issue I’d have with this - would be finding a wood-like surface to iron on top of.  Otherwise, directions are clear and simple. Print design, cut, peel side that’s face down, iron, cool, peel top side and you’re done! Colors came out well on red, blue, green and yellow canvas bags I was ironing. I even accidentally started to iron without peeling the bottom side - realized my mistake fairly quickly and was able to pull it apart and still use it! Wasn’t perfect but at least it wasn’t wasted.</span>

<span>I'm a graphic designer, coach various kid teams &amp; always seem to be making shirts for them. I began using the Avery transfers in 2010 &amp; have some shirts that have been through the wash countless times since then. Never had a problem &amp; the colors seem to last amazingly well over time. Other than using only white or light grey fabric &amp; a good quality shirt, my tips would be:<br/>1) pre-wash the shirt (I've used cotton &amp; 50/50) &amp; tumble dry.<br/>2) Plain paper final review: ALWAYS look at your design through the back of the paper (hold it up to a window or bright light) &amp; make sure all of your text has been mirrored &amp; the design looks good.<br/>3) Print the final design using the best quality your printer can output.<br/>4) Trim close to the printed parts but leave a bit of a margin - 2mm'ish. Don't cut so close that your design falls apart or warps while you are ironing. Round off points, if even a little.<br/>5) For fine designs that have been cut to the flimsy stage, cover with a sheet of parchment paper in the beginning of the ironing  to get it stuck down. The parchment can be removed to finish the ironing. Baking parchment will not stick to this stuff &amp; can get pretty darn hot. Do not use waxed paper or regular printer paper: they do not like to get hot.<br/>6) Follow the package ironing instructions. Simple as that. I use a cutting board on the floor so I can apply good pressure. For sleeve designs, my hubbie made me a little block of wood that fits inside. He cut a small groove on the bottom for the seam so the wood lays flat.<br/>7) After I peel the paper off I lay a piece of parchment over the whole design &amp; give it a final hit with the iron. This seems to really set the transfer into the fabric &amp; gives the most natural feel.<br/>8) If you can plan ahead, it's good to give them a final rinse with a bit of vinegar in the water to set the dye. Line dry &amp; tumble on low to soften the whole shirt. I've never had the nerve to do the full heat dryer before the 'event' but that's my own weird thing.<br/><br/>My worst experiences have come from using a cheap, lightweight shirt, using transfers that were too old or had been exposed to moisture (they did work though, just needed some extra tlc), or using a shirt color other than white or light grey.<br/><br/>Love these things, just ordered 18 more. Buy them, have fun.</span>

<span>To say that this is my worst purchase on Amazon, ever, is a big deal. I place 5-8 orders a week on Amazon.<br/><br/>This basically places a nylon layer on your shirt. First, the quality is awful. Second, you’ll feel a nylon layer (think of an umbrella material) on your shirt. Third, it’ll start to peel almost immediately. So if you want to use it for an event for like a few hours, sure. But nothing more.<br/><br/>4th, it’ll ruin your iron and anything it comes in contact with.

<span>I've had Brother printers for decades; they are reliable workhorses.  This printer is cheap to operate as off-brand toner cartridges are easily found.  I mistakenly thought I was buying a network printer; this has no LAN jack.  Brother recommends a 2.0 USB, because the cable does not come with the printer.  You must purchase a PRINTER CABLE for USB - that is a Type A/B for about $10.</span>

<span>I bought this printer to replace a 14-year old Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer. That printer has an Ethernet connector that I used as well as USB and LPT connectors that I did not use.  I needed a replacement printer that I could access on my network from various computers around the house.  This Brother HL-L2300D had everything the Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer provided, but with only a USB connection.<br/><br/>I can report that I have installed this new Brother HL-L2300D on my wireless router USB port and have it printing flawlessly from my desktop and laptop.  I used no additional software other than what is built into the router and Windows 10.  The new printer's print quality is excellent, both the duplex printing and all other printing is quieter than the old printer, and it has a straight-through paper path for manual feed which improved envelope and label printing.  I have Continue Mode set ON and Auto Shutoff set OFF.  I have the new printer in a switched AC outlet, and only turn it on when I need it.  Using the switched outlet, the printer powers up and is ready to receive print jobs without having to press the Power button.  When I leave the switched outlet on and the printer falls asleep, the printer wakes up when the router sends it a print job.  This is exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>I hope this review will provide anyone else who has similar requirements with a way to test their system to make sure that using a USB-only printer connected to a router will work for them too.  I read about using the USB port on my ASUS N900 RT-N66U Wireless router to set up a network print server and wanted to be sure that would work, so I used the old printer to test that.<br/><br/>I decided to use my desktop for this test and make no changes on the laptop until ready to install the new printer.<br/><br/>Still using the old printer, I disconnected the ethernet cable and connected the printer to the router with a USB cable.  Using the web interface to the ASUS router (192.168.1.1 by defaults), within 60 seconds I saw Brother HL5250DN appear as a USB 2,0 connected device on the router.<br/><br/>Because I already had the Windows 10 driver installed for using this printer on an Ethernet port, all I had to do was add a new TCP/IP port to the router for the USB connection following these breadcrumbs:<br/><br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Brother HL-5250DN &gt; Manage &gt; Printer Properties &gt; Ports &gt; Add Port... &gt; Standard TCP/IP Port - New Port... &gt;<br/><br/>The Add Standard TCP/IP Port Wizard will appear.<br/><br/>Click Next<br/>Enter your router IP address, usually 192.168.1.1 in both the "Printer Name and IP Address" and the "Port Name" text boxes.  If you already have a port named 192.168.1.1, Windows will change the name to 192.168.1.1_1 automatically.<br/><br/>Windows will then try to detect that port for about a minute, then show a screen "Additional port information required".  Select Custom &gt; Settings to see the Port Settings dialog.<br/><br/>Change protocol from Raw to LPR<br/>Under LPR Settings enter a "Queue Name" such as LPRServer1<br/>Click Ok &gt; Next &gt; Finish and the new port will be shown in the ports list and selected for use by the existing Printer driver.<br/><br/>When I got the new Brother HL-L2300D, I used these breadcrumbs to install it on the desktop and laptop:<br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; My printer isn't listed &gt; Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings.<br/><br/>I followed all the screens in the wizards to install the new printer.<br/><br/>On the desktop, when I reached the point to define the port, I just selected the 192.168.1.1 that I had set up above.<br/><br/>On the laptop, when I reached the point to define the port, I followed the same steps as above to add the new port 192.168.1.1<br/><br/>On both the desktop and the laptop, when the Wizard asks you to select the driver you want, the Brother HL-L2300D will probably not be on the list.  Click the Windows Update button on that list page and Windows will download all the printer names for all printers for which Windows 10 provides drivers.<br/><br/>Hope this is helpful.</span>

<span>The Brother HL-L2300d is a great little laser printer. Easy to set up and maintain without headaches. I am quite particular about what I buy and use. I read through all the reviews and the FAQs before I decided to go with this printer. First of all, this printer has been out for a few years so it has stood the test of time. This printer allows you to reset the count (or clicks) on the toner cartridge and drum so you can get all the life out of these items. It is easy to set up and get running. The printer doesn't come with a USB printer cable, so just buy one at the same time or most people would have one on hand. To reduce possible problems, use a printer cable that is only 6 ft. or shorter. Problems arise when using long cords with serial data transmissions...just believe me on this.<br/>  This printer does not allow WiFi. Please understand that most problems that I see people having are with the WiFi connections. Listen to me when I tell you that WiFi, printers, sleep modes, dynamic DNS and overcrowding on WiFi routers do not always go together. Most WiFi printer setups are not ready yet for the typical consumer. It might work for a while, but throw the sleep mode into the mix and then you're in a pickle. It is so much easier to just use a USB printer cable. You may even thank me later.<br/>  I have Windows 10 and it was easy to install. The Brother support website does a good deal of providing directions and problems solving. There is one part that might throw you off so I will take the time to give you easy directions for Windows 10. Get your printer all ready according to the quick help guide (i.e. remove the packing materials and install the toner cartridge, load paper, install power cord and connect USB printer cable to the printer only). DO NOT turn on the printer or connect the USB cable to your computer yet. DO NOT use the installation CD/DVD that comes with the printer. Go to support.brother.com on the ol' interweb. Do a search on "HL-L2300D". It doesn't need to be in caps, but I did that for clarity. Click on downloads and the website automatically determines what OS version you have installed. At this point say, "How cool is 'dat!" in the same manner as the Crazy Russian Hacker. Start downloading the FULL DRIVER &amp; SOFTWARE PACKAGE. The software will start downloading and then will pause. This is when you plug the USB cable into your computer and turn the printer on. The software will continue to load and install your printer.<br/>  Now if you did like me, I got too antsy and plugged in my USB cable and turned on my printer before partially installing the software/drivers from the Brother website. This installed a built-in driver which only supports the basic functions of the Brother machine. You just need to back up the process. Have your printer on and connected via USB cable. Go to support.brother.com just as you would in the previous paragraph. Go to the download section and halfway down the page you see a UTILITIES section. Run this uninstall tool to get rid of this basic driver. Now unplug the USB cable from the computer and turn off your printer. Go back to the previous paragraph and get it done right this time.<br/>  Always use good quality paper especially when printing in duplex to reduce the risk of jams. I picked up some HP Office20 (20#) but am not really impressed by it. It works well but seems a little too translucent. Using slightly heavier (24#) and a better brand will easily fix that. I hope this review helps someone. Please take the time to read all the FAQs, sort through the good/bad reviews before and scour the specifications on the manufacturers' websites before making purchases. It will solve most of the problems people encounter.</span>

It took me a lot of trial and error to make it work just right, but once I figured out the setting, I LOVE IT!<br/><br/>At first the image would not fuse correctly on the paper and image would smear or give me a ghost image on every print! It was extremely frustrating and wasted lots of paper...however, I was determined to make it work!  I searched and read articles and watched YouTube videos and finally decided to play with the printer settings.  I figures that the printer needed to print a little slower so toner would fuse to the paper.  I first set the PAPER OUTPUT to "Heavy 2" and that worked, but still had a little smearing if I ran my finger through the image. At last, I tried Labels setting for paper used to print and Viola!!! It prints amazing and NO smearing!!!<br/><br/>This has allowed me to print a variety of images on shirts and face masks!</span>

<span>These works great but you have to set your printer to the PHOTO PAPER mode if you have that setting. If you just print it, it will smear all over your print rollers and make you mad! A cheap printer that has no way to change settings I don't think will work. Beware.</span>

<span>It works great,it can hold up to several washes... the sheets are not entirely flat so that's a concern for me when I print. The pressing time is too long though.</span>

<span>The printer is just what I wanted and there are no issues with the seller but Amazon and their deal structures sux.<br/>Bought this  w weeks ago at a reasonable price + 5% discount.<br/><br/> Background<br/>Despite surge  protection My Computer and printer both dies at same time along with a few other devices after storm.<br/>Haven’t replaced computer but ordered printer 2 weeks ago.<br/><br/> Today’s Daily deal offers same printer as daily deal 20% off an even lower list price  but Amazon won’t credit the difference. They actually suggested I return the printer (open box but still unused) get a refund and order a 2nd printer costing Amazon and the seller more $ than I lose.<br/>I’m not going to screw anyone around like that<br/>Guess I’ll keep it instead of creating hassle and eat the cost.<br/>Just what I needed…cost myself more while  attempting to save money.<br/><br/>Nice printer lousy Amazon  customer service (overseas boiler room)</span>

<span>I haven't had any issues with wifi disconnecting but I had a previous epson printer and I had changed some settings on my router that I think is why I don't have any problems. I didn't install any software, I just plugged it in, connected to internet and started using it. I have printed from my phone several times. I don't plan on installing software or doing any uppdates. I buy name brand ink anyways but I think sometimes even from Amazon, you get a fake. I think this is why my last printer turned into a brick, probably bad ink. It wasn't worth replacing all the cartridges to find out. My last printer last 8 years so was a good run.<br/>I didn't even have to wake it up.</span>

<span>I searched on Amazon for All-in-One printer/scanner/fax that works with a Mac.  I then spent a lot of time comparing the results.  Of the choices, the Epson WF-4820 seemed to be the best.  I was very excited to get rid of my old Brother All-in-One.  Sadly, the excitement turned to extreme disappointment when I tried to set the WF-4820 up on the network.  The WF-4820 connected to the network relatively easily, and I could find the WF-4820 when I used the iPhone app, EpsonSmartPanel.  However, part of installing the printer driver on the iMac requires the iMac to find the printer on the network, and that simply would not work whether I tried an Ethernet cable connection or WiFi connection.  I even used a USB cable, and it did not work.  I called Tech Support, and the advice was ridiculous.  The technician wanted me to run an ethernet cable directly from the router to the printer, which would not be feasible on a daily basis, or reconfigure my WiFi system specifically for the printer even though it would make other operations more difficult. (I actually did move the WF-4820 to a position where I could connect it directly to the router, and that solution did not work so basically the advice from Tech Support was terrible.  And it was frustrating because the technician had the stereotypical attitude of the problem cannot be their device.  It must be a user problem.) I was about to send the WF-4820 back and write a more scathing review when I decided to look online for the software necessary to run the printer and scanner instead of using the installation software provided by Epson.  It turns out that the software installer provided by Epson is almost 2 years old and designed for Apple iOS 10.4.  Most of the Apple world is on iOS 12.4 so the Epson software installer is very out of date.  Sure enough, when I located more recent software and drivers for the individual functions of printing and scanning, everything worked fine.  And the printing quality and scanning software is far above my old Brother unit.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this All-in-One unless Epson updates its installation software.  It was not easy doing what I eventually had to do to get the WF-4820 to work.</span>
