<span>At first glance other than a few buttons you can't tell the difference between this tablet and a standard galaxy tablet.<br/> Used this in rainy wet days with gloves on, I was skeptical but it actually works pretty smooth.  Had a few minor 'skips' here and there but was able to use it a full day in winter rain with thinner gloves on.  I tried some thicker gloves but no luck.  Performs similar to other Tablets in the same class but the touchscreen really sets it apart.  Battery life also pretty good, lowest I dropped to was 35% after a 11-hour day in 40-degree temps, that and you can easily replace the battery.<br/><br/>Some considerations:<br/>-If you're using this solely indoors for POS this is kind of overkill<br/>-iPads dominate the Tablet market and unfortunately most of the business software support<br/>-the light sensor for dimming the screen can be a bit annoying if you're rotating the tablet a lot</span>

<span>Bought this for my destructive preschooler. So far it’s been really good. It’s rugged enough to go through all of his drops and spills a vent made a dent in it thus far. It is fast enough to keep up with his short attention span too, seamlessly switching between apps and running games like a dream. I cant say much about the use of the pen as we haven’t given it to him (didn’t want to lose it). But I can say so far this is a rugged reliable tablet that can stand up to everything my kid can throw at it.</span>

<span>I really wanted to like this Galaxy Tab Active PRO tablet, but I can't. In fact, at this point I really kind of hate it due to one factor: the terrible placement of the function buttons.<br/><br/>To be fair, the tablet it's perfect in almost every respect, but the placement of the function buttons is terrible and frustrating.<br/><br/>When held in landscape mode (which is the only way I use it) the function buttons are located on the bottom bezel.<br/><br/>This means that if you want to click the Home or Back buttons you have to lift it up to press them. The older Galaxy TAB devices have the buttons on the right which is perfect, because that's where your thumb naturally ends up.<br/><br/>The buttons are also marked so faintly that even under bright light it's nearly impossible to see the markings. Not a deal-breaker, but it shows a real lack of thought in terms of end-user design.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, the smaller 8" version of this tablet DOES have the buttons located correctly (on the right of the bezel in landscape orientation), but an 8" screen is too small for watching movies, browsing the web, and reading ebooks. That extra inch of screen size makes a big difference; you wouldn't think it would but it does, at least for me.<br/><br/>Again, this is a *great* tablet in almost every way, but the ridiculous/terrible design choice to place the function buttons on the bottom is an absolute no-go for me. I'll either return it or sell it online.<br/><br/>You were SO close, Samsung, so so close. So disappointing. I guess I'll be using my old TAB A for the foreseeable future.</span>

<span>After reading some reviews, I was skeptical about ordering this unit, but to my delight, it was an unfounded worry.  The unit arrived in an extremely will protected packaging with all needed accessories; once out of the package, I was surprised as of how nice this thing looks like.  It is described as an used unit, but you will be hard pressed to find any scratches at all on it.  It is unlocked, I just put a sim in it and went to work with it.  I have no idea about the phone function and honestly don't care, I do not plan to use it for phone calls.  If you are looking for one of these to browse the net, watch moves and so for, this it the one to have, very pleased with it.</span>

<span>As tablets go, this is the normal Samsung quality and the main reason I purchased this and the reason for the three stars. The other two were knocked off because it won't activate on Verizon's service or a pay as you go service. That ain't good!<br/><br/>I wanted a LTE tablet in my vehicle to run Maps and do the random Google search when required so I bought this as it wasn't too expensive and has a bigger screen than my phone. During setup when it came to activating the LTE service a message popped up saying that it couldn't be done and I traded out the SIM for bring your own tablet, pay as you go, one and it popped up a message saying it couldn't be activated on their service.... no bueno.<br/><br/>I read other reviews that had the same information but figured I'd try my luck as I've been fairly successful in getting things to function when other couldn't. Trust the reviews, they ain't lying. The tablet itself is good and functions like it's supposed to but there are cheaper versions for a straight WIFI tablet than paying for a LTE one and then not being able to use it. I just said the heck with it and went to a Verizon store and bought the same tablet from them already activated. The model numbers between the two tablets are the same so that wasn't the issue. I didn't bother trying to call Verizon to get this tablet running on LTE, it just wasn't worth my time and I didn't have it to waste anyway.<br/><br/>I did keep this tablet and use it for a E-Reader for work instead of my more expensive Tab S7 FE and it's a good little tablet... no complaints with that. The LTE connectivity is a different story though.</span>

<span>I previously had a Samsung Galaxy tablet that was outrageously slow to boot up and be useful after first being turned on (prior tablet was a Tab A 8.0 tablet - a different model than this purchase).  I wanted a better/faster Android tablet that was still in the 8" size range but unfortunately there aren't that many options in a smaller Android tablet.  I debated for months and months and finally settled on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 8.7 Lite -- it was a GREAT decision.  I was able to transfer my apps seamlessly through Samsung Smart Switch and, best of all, when I turn on the Tab A7 8.7 Lite I can IMMEDIATELY get out to the internet and my apps.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 8.7 Lite is a great tablet and was less expensive than the prior Tab A 8.0 tablet.  I am very happy with this purchase.</span>

<span>This tablet is very simple and user-friendly. I always like this about Samsung products.  The camera ain't all that good but I can use it for video calls and conferences.  Great microphone (good sound),. As far as I can tell it won't link to any phone besides another Samsung to use for texting or as a phone, which I was hoping it would.  I need the bigger buttons due to my arthritis.  Overall it's it's a really nice product.  Would recommend</span>

<span>I bought the 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM version, which is the cheapest model due to it being on sale. If this will be your go-to, main tablet then I would suggest upgrading to a version with more RAM and internal storage. Others say the 64 GB internal storage doesn't experience any studder performance with the device.  This 32 GB internal storage (3 GB RAM) studders through swipes and many other operations. I am still going to keep it though, because I only have a few purpose for this device.  Sufficient to use for reading books, but just make sure it's not under the bright sun. It allows me to watch YouTube TV, YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, just fine, but I tell you I come from owning an old IPAD Air that does not even qualify for the latest IOS update today.  That IPAD is just as smooth if not smoother than this tablet, however due to the IOS (12.x) being outdated, it cannot run many applications. This Samsung SM-x200 A8 tablet can run all the applications that I want to use today. Here are the PROs and CONs from my perspective:<br/><br/>PRO:<br/>- Newer device that runs most application today that I use.<br/>- External MicroSD card feature.<br/>- Cheap price, waaaaay cheaper than Apple Ipads.<br/><br/>CON:<br/>- Studders with 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM.<br/>- Screen brightness not that bright, but useable. Glossy screen reflects under the sun so probably not that great outdoors.<br/><br/>Summary - Battery life is OK, I think it isn't that impressive but up to 8 hours+ of usage is not terrible. Upgrade to the higher internal storage/memory model versions to avoid studdering I guess, other reviewers say the tablet is better with more internal storage.  I believe with higher amount of internal storage, Samsung also increases the RAM to 4 GB RAM, but I'd double check before you buy on that information. The software applications installs on the internal storage, and I have not been able to figure out if they can be installed on the external MicroSD card.  On the other hand, you CAN move the data many or most of the "data" that the installed applications use to the external MicroSD card. Speakers are loud and clear, really like it. The WIFI connection is okay, but I bet overall tablet performance would be WAY better if there was slightly more RAM internally (3 GB vs 4 GB). This tablet supposedly is compatible with up to 1 TB of external MicroSD storage, and I have one on order that's arriving soon.  If is not compatible with the 1 TB MicroSD card, I will update my review and mention it, but I do not anticipate any problems.<br/><br/>I do not use this tablet as my main source of electronic device though (I prefer my higher performance laptop), so this is why I will keep it even though I think the performance for this lower-tier performance device is a bit lacking. It works very well for watching streaming services, reading books and minor browsing. If you are okay with the studdering performance here and there, then this is an inexpensive product to have on a budget. It connects to my home network NAS just fine, I can plug in the USB-C power cord and let it stream news all day, no issues (for now). I'm sure after a few years this tablet will be obsolete just like my Ipad Air has become, but it will have served its purpose.</span>

<span>I bought this tablet partly because it was an Amazon prime sale item. I wanted a tablet to read ebooks (I was tired of trying to read on a phone) and to stream movies and TV shows.<br/>Positive: The screen is large and clear, and even in with a screen protector it is responsive to taps and swipes. The system is not lightning fast but it is quick enough, and it streamed the first TV show I watched without buffering. The battery lasted 2 days of me playing with it the first time. It is lightweight and slim. I don't know if it's durable; since I drop things I put it in a rugged case to protect it. It came with Android 11, One UI Core 3.1, so I was able to install most my most important apps.<br/>Negative: NO FLASHLIGHT OR CAMERA FLASH. So it can't be used to take pictures at night or in poor lighting. I found this out when I turned out the the light in my room and went to put the flashlight on the tablet and, surprise, there isn't one! And the pictures taken with the tablet appear a little grainy when compared with a picture of the same scene taken by my Samsung S10 phone.<br/>Also at least one app that I can't install. When I look in Google Play for the Jenny Craig mobile app, it's not there! It installed on my phone and its specs say Android 6 and up, so I'm not sure why it would be incompatible with this device, it is an inconvenience.<br/>I've only had it for a week but overall I am pleased with it.</span>

<span>Well we just received the tablet, so I haven't been able to experience it fully, but to me, I think it is great! I already love it more than the Tab A7, mostly because it actually has the home button and back arrow on the screen. The Tab A7 didn't have that, and I HATED that!!! The tablet seems very easy to use and navigate. It was easy to set up. I got it for my son, for that is why I haven't experienced much, I just set it up. I prefer Samsung products over some others, so I hope this tablet keeps with that quality I am used to.</span>

<span>I think it's a great rugged 8 inch tablet that  met all my expectations. Well for some reason Samsung didn't enable voice over LTE, voice over IP works fine. I use Google voice which is free and I can make and receive calls on this tablet! You can use internet connection sharing and connect other devices to share your LTE internet, but speeds are limited. However the tablet has DeX which lets you run Android on your laptop or TV wirelessly in an environment very similar to Windows 10! Your internet speeds are not limited when using Dex so you can watch videos at full 1080p. The only problem I have is all the software that Samsung ads to the tablet which is trying to duplicate everything that's already on it from Google. it has room for two SIM cards (if you don't mind giving up the memory card slot) and if you have one sim for LTE and the other one set up for 3g, theoretically you should be able to make phone calls over the 3G sim and get your internet over the LTE sim. I haven't tried this yet I've only had this for a few days but so far I'm very impressed with it!</span>

The pen is OK, just not sure I'll use it.  The processing power is pretty good, not like a PC when doing small tasks but browsing the internet and editing small videos is surely within capability.  Overall I'll give it an A- becasue the USB2.0 connection is something to be ashamed of when trying to copy movies on and off of it.  Why in 2022 does a tablet not have a USB3.0 connection.  The way around that is to copy and paste files via 802.11ac, which is far faster than USB2.0.</span>

<span>Excellent tablet for its uses. Great extension to phones as a media player, music player, mobile games, and saving photos and more. Memory storage can be extended as I extended with a 256gb microsd card. Do note - apps can only be saved and installed in the internal memory not the SD. Internal saves the app data while save files and additional files can be saved to SD card. SD card is mainly used for saves of photos, music, videos, digital art files and other such media. Battery life is great only need to charge once every other day even two if not on it frequently. Best to charge up to 85% not 100% for longer battery life.</span>

<span>I bought the Samsung Galaxy tab a to replace my 10 in Chinese tablet. only having the Chinese tablet to compare this one too, I still think that this tablet works amazing. I have no problem streaming movies, listening to music, surfing the web, or buying products off Amazon. I would have liked a little bit more memory than 32GB, but after downloading all my music I still have 20 gigabytes left. The sound out of the speakers is much better than the Chinese tablet. The Dolby Atmos on this tablet creates a very interesting surround sound. It's hard to tell where the sound is actually coming from. I don't play many games but the one I do play witches alien Invaders, plays flawlessly. The screen in the resolution is absolutely amazing. It is definitely on par with my 4K TV. It quickly and easily connect to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. And the range on the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is amazing also. I have yet to run the battery completely down because the battery life is also very good.</span>

<span>This Samsung tablet is for better than my Apple IPad.  It's light,  very versatile, comes with a cool and very useful pen, and the sound and resolution is incredible. Battery life is great, and  watching a movie with the surround sound is a real treat. The Bluetooth option also allows me to connect my Bose Earbuds and away we go to enjoy movies and shows on a long plane ride.<br/><br/>The speed and interactivity are fantastic. No lag time, no issues. I thought I would not have any need for a pen, but wow, I was wrong.  The pen allows me to take notes during meetings very efficiently.  My handwriting is immediately converted to text. Best tech purchase I've made in a long time.<br/><br/>I do recommend buying a case to protect it and to help you watch a movie while traveling.<br/>I highly recommend this product.</span>

<span>This is such an incredible device. Having used cheaper tablets before the quality of this excels so far above even the best offerings from Apple and other Android manufacturers. The screen quality is pristine and the feel of the screen as well as the device itself is just great. Quality is first and foremost here with ease of use being a close second. If you're looking for a great tablet experience that can do anything you need it to then look no further unless of course you're more accustomed to IOS. Speaking of which the S Pen has in my opinion a significantly better feel to it than the Apple Pencil. Maybe it's a combination of the better screen on the Tab vs the iPad or maybe it's the combination of both devices. Either way they're great devices but this is better to me and the only way to get better is to buy the plus or the ultra and those are pushing more into using the tablet as a laptop rather than as a standalone tablet.</span>

<span>I primarily purchased the tablet for its portability. I move it near the stove to reference a new recipe. I prop it at the table to watch a movie while I process vegetables from my garden. I keep at my work desk to stream music and watch YT videos while working from home. If the weather ever cooperates, I will take it camping for sleeping bag movie time. I love that I can sync it with my Samsung galaxy phone and use it to make and receive calls. I purchased a separate adapter so I can use wired headphones if I want. Love the tablet and would purchase again.</span>

<span>I purchased this tablet because I thought having a big screen tablet would be cool and the specs of this tablet were beyond awesome.  However, I am in the middle of returning it and I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>Don't let the fact I'm returning it steer you away from considering this tablet.  For most, this tablet may be perfect except for people like me that had the negative issues mentioned down below.<br/><br/>First of all the pros:<br/><br/>- During the few days I had this, I used it a lot like a laptop.  I had a Bluetooth keyboard and a Fintiecase with it that stood it up.  I also had a Bluetooth mouse that worked right away when connected.  There is an option called "Dex" that loads a desktop environment which makes the tablet seem very much like a PC, and it did it well.<br/>- Performance was as expected for the most part with a few hiccups *see cons below*.  It was snappy, fluid, and responsive.<br/>- The high point is the screen.  The screen is beautiful.  The Colors Pop.  The sharpness is outstanding.<br/>- Sound is awesome as well.  Does better than most laptops I have ever used.<br/>- the 12-inch screen is huge, and with the high definition this screen has, can fit quite a bit on the screen if you choose to.  Using apps side by side was really awarding.<br/>- For a tablet, the camera was really impressive.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>- Weight.  Using it in landscape orientation isn't too bad.  However, if you play some games that only work in Portrait orientation, holding the tablet does start to give you hand fatigue, in my case in as little as a few minutes.  So if you are a reader and want to hold it like a book vertically, you stand a chance of discomfort trying to hold it in portrait mode.<br/>- While the snapdragon chip that is included in this tablet should be more than enough to do most tasks, the few programs I used that streamed games and or shows seem to always have a micro stutter, and I spent most of the time having this trying to fix the problem and find out which of Samsungs programs are bogging the tablet down.  I never found it out.  Hence why I returned it.<br/><br/>If you are going to use it like a laptop with a keyboard, this is an awesome solution.  However, if you plan on using it in your hands a lot.. well with big size comes the loss of some portability.  The tablet is pretty heavy.  If you don't mind that, then the tablet will be perfect for you.  However, the Regular Galaxy tab S8 will be more than enough for those that want the portability and lightness of a tablet, despite the unfortunate decision of Samsung to leave out the Amoled screen.<br/><br/>Also, Samsung has given their word that these tablets in the S8 will have updates for 5 years, and a soon-to-come update will focus on making android, even more, tablet friendly.<br/><br/>To summarize:  If you want to stream games (Moonlight, Steam Link, Playstation Remote play) to this tablet, it didn't seem to work well, despite an old laptop of mine doing it just fine.  If you do this, don't get this tablet.  There is a possibility that a future update may fix this.<br/>If you want something light and easy to carry... don't get the S8 plus or S8 ultimate, stick with the regular S8.  The S8 plus was heavy and not as portable as other smaller tablets.<br/>If either of these issues doesn't apply to you, then the S8 Plus is an amazing tablet.  But overall, if you don't mind the slightly lighter blacks of an IPS screen and just over an inch of a smaller screen, stick with the S8 and save yourself some money.</span>

<span>I got this year during the Prime Day and I will say I am not the least bit disappointed. I am not tech savy but I did love a good deal when I saw one and this to me seemed like a pretty good deal. I am not a stranger to Samsung so I know its a great brand so I gave it a go. I will say I love how the setup is thou its long and there is quite a few installments that are needed I was very pleased with the walkthrough that is provided thru the assistant manager. Everything was literally effortless and it talks you thru everything once I was set up I had all my information,apps,notes,etc from my phone and I was very pleased with that. It even carried over my google info given that I used my Google info to sign in under it truly made the process the opposite of frustrating. I love how smooth this tablet is in comparison to now my none exsistant phone since I am on this thing so much. The camera is nice too as all the pics provided up top are from my tablet. The one thing I do have a problem with and not even often is there is a studder every now and again with web pages or this one in particular. However overall I have to say for the price I paid for this I am not at all disappointed and in fact have purchased 2 more in additon to mine for my husband and daugher the price was too good. I can also say my husband is a huge fan now as well and tells me how much he loves his tablet often as he uses his for Amazon and gaming lol. I also have to note I got this one thru Amazon the other 2 thru bestbuy (the price was no longer avalible and I couldnt get a warrenty with mine with the price) but I mention this becasue mine has device care which helps to keep my tablet in check and theirs doesnt so I dont know if that was because I got it thru here or not but that and there are a couple of other things too that are different(better) than there's.</span>

<span>This tablet is replacing a first gen Galaxy tab.  It was a great tablet but time has taken it's toll and it was time to replace it.  I have a 2017 Tab A and love it so this one was for my wife. . This is a great improvement over the 2017 version.  Both are running Android 9.0 smoothly.  Battery life on both is amazing (we charge them 1 or 2 time a week and they see 4 to 5 hours use daily).  Screens are also amazing.  This tablet ups the stakes with the return of auto brightness setting and what appears to be a better camera setup (the reality of it is that both have pretty good cameras for a tablet)  Samsung also did away with some of the bloatware (THANK YOU SAMSUNG!!)  They got rid of that stupid Bixby home thing (I finally was able to disable it on my 2017 after the latest Android update).  There is some other bloat ware that was also not included (like half a gig worth!)  Speed for both is the same.  Now there are some steps backward.  They moved back to a micro USB charging (the 2017 had USB C) and the speakers are not as nice (in real world performance- no idea on the spec sheet).  Also they removed the physical home/back/list buttons from the bezel and put a virtual back and list button on the screen space.  THe home button is gone completely and you have to use the power button now (A HUGE step back!).  With the buttons gone now the bottom of the tablet has this 3/4" bezel at the bottom that does nothing but make the tablet longer than it needs to be.  Bottom line this is a great tablet.  It is fast, powerful and with a micro SD card installed has a ton of storage.  At the current price (under 0ne hundred and twenty bucks!) it is a steal.</span>
