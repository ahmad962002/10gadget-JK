<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>My printer (Raise3D N2Plus) can't handle this spool width properly.  This is a non-standard spool and for no good reason.  I have ordered these before as it's a good price/performance, but I have had to re-spool the filament to empty standard width spools before I can use it.  That's a real pain.  Standard spools are approx 64 mm wide..  this stuff comes on a ~75 mm wide spool.  Check that you can use this width on your printer.  The N2Plus has a door (fully enclosed printer) that can't shut properly with this spool loaded and the spindle doesn't even accept this width properly.</span>

<span>OK what a deal, right, couldnt get any PLA for some reason during the start of the lockdown (don't knw were people printing TP with PLA..not a good idea) so I bought this ABS as my printer can utilize different materials.<br/>After replacing my beds normal surface with Kapton Tape and aquanet (instead of Painters Tape) went to work printing. Seems this stuff LOVES to clog. Loves to gum up the stepper motor and does not like to adhere to the bed and to itself for that matter.<br/><br/>Again might be my settings but after multiple tweaks and tries and going through 2 spools still not achieving the same level of detail I could with PLA (same printer) I am at the point of assuming its the ABS or ABS in general.</span>

<span>This is my first real experience with ABS - tried it years ago but quickly moved to PETG.  For this application, I needed something that would withstand higher temperatures.<br/><br/>It took a few tries to tune this in as I don't have an enclosed bed.  With the following settings<br/>1. Bed  of 125C with painters tape<br/>2. Flow of 90% (so I don't get rough sides)<br/>3. Infill of 100% (it will be outdoors and I want it to last forever)<br/>4. Any hotend temperature (full range seems to all work fine)<br/>5. Slightly tighter bed leveling<br/><br/>Prints are beautiful.  No problems with layer adhesion.  Bed adhesion was the tough one as I don't use glue.  Items 1 and 5 were key there.</span>

<span>I have only ever used ABS to print on a Maker Select since 2016. Normally cheap filament prints at 235C and I always run the bed at 110C. (otherwise it will warp.)<br/><br/>This stuff threw me for a loop for a week. I found that I had to run it at 250C otherwise it would not give me any flow and there were tiny  particles in it that did not melt. Having been in the plastics industry for 20 yrs I know that this has a lot of fillers in it to cheapen it up. But that's ok it works well.</span>

<span>Overall, it's alright. Small prints? It's fine. You're in the room, and can run over every time you hear a motor skipping steps? It'll do alright.<br/><br/>Not you? They might have improved the process, but this stuff tangles like crazy. It's like a puppy: it loves playing tug of war with the spool holder, and will absolutely wreck the place if you leave it on its own for too long.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I have not had the filament snap, not once. It got tangled so bad, once, it full-on pulled the spoolholder over, but it did not snap.</span>

<span>I print a lot in PETG. In fact, it has been the only thing my Ender 3 prints with for almost a year now. I'm printing with my second roll of this currently. It prints and looks great. You have to take some care though. This is not PLA.  PETG is more hygroscopic and stringy than PLA.<br/><br/>#TLDR; Save yourself a lot of time and dry it before printing. Then print from a dry box if you are in a humid area.<br/><br/>This filament seems to be more hygroscopic than even some other brands of PETG, before printing. That could explain some of the other reviews here mentioning that it bubbled, was stringy, or didn't print properly. Halfway through my first roll, I noticed that quality had gone down quite a bit in the prints; the surface finish wasn't as nice, it got more stringy, sometimes there would be under-extrusion, etc. Then the bed adhesion issues started. Once I dried the filament and stuck the roll in a dry box (cost me &lt;$15 to make and it holds 3x 1kg rolls) it went back to the nice quality my first prints displayed.<br/><br/>In terms of slicer settings on an Ender 3, you can mostly just use PLA settings with some changes to retraction, temp, bed/nozzle height (less squish), and speed (tuned for PETG). If you have a hot-end with a higher flow rate, you can probably leave the speed alone. As mentioned previously, as long as the filament is dry, it prints very nicely. For the translucent qualities, the fewer walls you print with the more translucent the end print will be. In vase mode, if your slicer supports that, this filament is quite translucent. If you increase the number of walls and line width, it turns into a deep blue color.</span>

<span>Tl;Dr:<br/>It works, but don't expect easy, gorgeous, or consistent printing. I don't think I'll buy this again unless better filaments are out of stock. I've also included my temps and settings below.<br/><br/>Let's start with the packaging:<br/>The description mentions that the filament comes in a resealable bag, and that it jut true at all. It comes in vacuum sealed plastic that was so thin I could poke it and break it open. In fact, the plastic was so thin, it had dozens of holes in the plastic. PETG isn't super prone to absorbing humidity like other filaments, but this will reduce your print quality right out of the box. If I had waited a few weeks to use the filament, I'd have had much worse time printing with it as there's already a pop from water boiling in the filament every so often.<br/><br/>Dialing in this filament required a TON of work. I had to go all the way to the hottest temperatures recommended on the package just to get anything to adhere. I'm using a Sovol to print with, so which is supposed to release prints easily but PETG is notorious for over adhesion and this should not have been such an issue! Even after raising the temp to 85 on the bed, I still have some issues with the filament coming loose during the first few layers, so I almost always print with a raft, even brims don't cut it because the filament won't even stick to itself very well!<br/><br/>I have tried printing at the entire range of temps, and found again that hotter was better. Prints at 250 had the least issues with layer adhesion, but resulted in some singed bits of plastic sticking to the prints and some stringing. Prints at 230 were able flow, but resulted in a clogged extruder after only a few mm. I found 245 was an acceptable balance between adhesion and flow.<br/><br/>Speaking of flow... I had to bump the flow rate to 107% to get the filament to extrude evenly on the bed. After hours of leveling, releveling, switching back and forth between successful prints and failed prints, I found this to be the magic number. The issue is that the filaments diameter is pretty inconsistent, and tends to go well below the nominal 1.75mm. 107% strikes a decent balance between the combination of over and under extrusion I've experienced on my prints.<br/><br/>So, here's my overall opinion. I'm not doing profession work with this filament, nor am I doing complex prints. It might be frustrating, but now that I have a good profile set up, it prints reasonably well. For PETG, it's not too stringy. Once I got the everything dialed in, the prints would come out looking pretty good, but not world class. It's low odor, the prints are very strong so it checked all the boxes from what I would consider my minimal acceptable criteria. I just wish I didn't have to rely on a raft to print anything without a inherently large footprint.<br/><br/>Settings:<br/>Extruder Temp: 145*C<br/>Bed Temp: 85*C<br/>Extrusion rate: 107%<br/>Rafts: Recommend for smaller prints.</span>

With the ideal processing temperatures between 200 ~ 220C and a diameter of 1. 75mm 0. 05mm, these filaments provide a beautiful contrast versus typical opaque PLAs. Print crystals that truly shine, water that glistens, or contrast against flat or opaque colors can bring a new depth to 3D printed projects that can otherwise feel dull or lacking in luster. These filaments are great for sets, minis, art projects, or any prints that need extra depth and beauty of color. Multi-piece prints or multicolor prints can also benefit greatly from the Monoprice Hi-Gloss filament line.

<span>It looks much more like a flat silk blue than a high gloss bright blue. If you want a silk look its almost perfect. Maybe with a clear coat it would be glossier.<br/><br/>1/4 through the roll it started catching on itself and I have to go and run a few feet out by hand so the printer doesn't stop feeding.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you want something to look like its made out of silk and you print the viewing side up and down it will look like its made of silk!</span>

<span>I got the blue silk color just to have some blue in my options. For 16 bucks it’s not bad but its a bit more brittle than others. The print color is a shade lighter than the color on the spool. So more of a milky blue. I had issues with layer bonding so I had to keep my hot end at 210-215 and my platform 70 otherwise it would not stick to itself very well. There is a little bit of expansion and shrinkage from hot to cold so you may need to keep your layers tight or extrude some extra filament just it doesn’t pull tight as it cools which can be a problem on overhangs or inside radius.</span>

<span>Ordering: Seamless with Amazon<br/><br/>Delivery Time: Prompt delivery with prime<br/><br/>Delivery Packaging: Ordered 2 filaments at the same time, so nicely packaged in a box. If you order just 1 filament, then not sure if they use box or bubble pack for shipping.<br/><br/>Product Packaging: Nice sturdy box compared to other similar products. Roll packaged in vacuum seals poly bag. Labels were both on the product and on the box, so nice to trace even if you pitched the box. There is a nice small window cutout on the box that shows the product and you can see filament and its color, so no need to open the box to check the roll you need to use, making you to save the box for product storage especially when you have multiple color rolls in storage.<br/><br/>Filament Printing and Printed Product Overview:<br/>• Filament is wound nicely on the spool and it didn’t untangle as soon as end is released on the spool<br/>• Tested filament on Ender 3 printer with same setting used to print other filaments<br/>• Used Cura software for slicing<br/>• Same temperature setting of about 200 degrees for extruder and 50 degrees for bed, noticed no difference in printing or bed adhesion issues. Used recommended setting for speed, infill and wall thickness<br/>• Printed surface is smooth and no fiber or fine threads that got dragged when head traveled between the walls, so final product is free of any blemish or hanging threads that needs cleaning<br/>• Grey color is a touch lighter when compared to other grey filaments I printed with the same setting<br/><br/>Concern:<br/>• Some reviewers mentioned about they were ordering this as a silver and disappointed that it looks more of a grey than silver, here is the concern<br/>• Label on the spool calls for silver<br/>• Product description on the site is listed as Grey, so they might have to correct the label so that there is no confusion<br/>• Color is a touch lighter compared to other grey filaments sold. Picture on left is from this filament.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Product printed with this filament looked good with no visible surface deformation or loose strings. As long as you are not mixing 2 different spool of grey to assemble product, you should be fine. Overall it’s a good product.</span>

<span>First I need to state i am new to 3D printing. I recently purchased a Creality CR-10s Pro. Love the machine when it works. I have issues with my machine's X_Gantry sagging on the side with the X- stepper motor/filament extruder installed and need to zero it out before every print.<br/><br/>This isn't a review of the machine. This is a review of the SUNLU PLA Silk Black Gray Filament. I am doing a large multi-unit job for work  (each piece is 280mm x 280mm x 30mm) so needed a lot of filament. My original supplier was out, so I searched the interwebs and found this brand. I have been wanting to try Silk style PLAs, and since the price wasn't much more expensive, I decided to give it try and bought 3 spools. When it came in I decided to print one of the sample models included with my printer. It printed absolutely awesome. In fact one of my grandchildren still plays with it. Just before I started the job prints, my cooling fan shroud broke, so I printed a new one with this. It printed beautifully, but as I was installing it it came apart at a middle layer. Upon further inspection, I noticed it starting to have layer adhesion problems through the print. I ended up having three complete separations. I was able to glue them back together with CA glue, but what a pain in the @$$.<br/>I became nervous about success with the job prints. No surprise the first 6 attempts failed to even adhere to the build plate. I stopped using the SUNLU PLA Silk and returned to one of my personal standard PLS spools and it printed with minimal errors (any errors were mine, beginner remember). I tried it again with a different color standard PLA. Again same results, printed with minimum errors.<br/>I contacted SUNLU requesting guidance and they told me the print head temp  and build plate temp () need to be higher than normal (210-230C and 60-80C respectively) for PLA SILK vs. standard PLA. Also the print bed NEEDS PVA glue to aid with adhesion. Finally, thinnest print height is required. They recommended .1mm layer height.<br/><br/>I made the changes. First print had some very minor bed adhesion but the print was able to recover and finished the print very nicely. Print number 2. No Bueno!. First I noticed one corner not adhering to the print bed. At first it didn't appear to be bad and though the print would recover. Unfortunately after 24 hours I noticed several other locations lifting up as well. I stopped the print and removed the damaged print. The complete first layer wasn't even attached to the bottom of the print the lines just fell off in my hand. I checked all my settings and everything seemed fine. I decided to do a thorough cleaning of the build plate and make sure I had good PVA glue coverage before restarting. I decided if it didn't work this time I was going to return the 2 unopened spools for a refund. Third print finished this morning and looks absolutely amazing. Even better than the first large print with this filament.<br/><br/>Lessons learned:<br/>1. Be sure to verify recommended print temperatures on the box. They're not printed on the spool's label like everyone else. My fault. Felt really stupid when I found them on the second box.<br/>2. Be sure everything is a trammed and level as you can possible get them.<br/>3. Be sure your built plate is as clean as you can possibly get it<br/>4. Use higher temperatures than normal PLA. My temperatures ended up being:<br/>  a. Printhead: 215-220C (anything higher made the sheen of the SIlk appear dull).<br/>  b. Build plate: 65-70C, (70 was required before I gave it a thorough cleaning and used PVA glue).<br/>5. Layer height: .12mm (one of the magic numbers of my machine. Look up magic numbers if you're not familiar with them. Make printing appear nicer.).<br/><br/>Though I feel some of the errors with my first prints were my fault, I am giving a 3-Star review due to the overall difficulty I had with finally getting a usable print. Comment about the tolerances, the two spools I have used so far are within the stated tolerances.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this filament? Sure but only with the caveat there are issues. Once these are overcome the prints looks fantastic.<br/><br/>Sorry for such a long review and thanks for taking the time to read the entirety of this. I hope this helps you decide.<br/><br/>Update 7/10/2020:<br/>All I can say is I am changing my mind about this filament. I just finished unit #4 and thought it looked amazing while it was still on the print bed. However, once I removed it, the first layer immediately started peeling from the print. I have followed all the recommendations of the company and experimented a little myself. 3D printing is supposed to be fun and exciting. This is not fun and exciting. Congratulations to all the users who have had good luck with this filament. I, myself, will not ever buy it again. Nor can I in good conscience recommend it to anyone. When it prints well it is beautiful. But I no longer feel there are any consistent methods to print this filament. Due to the size of the units I am printing for work, I only get 2 units/1kg spool. I have to go back to standard PLA. Good luck.</span>

<span>I have been trying to find an alternative to white PLA from Hatchbox. I tried several and found this to be the best, but it took some tinkering. I have two Ender 3 Pros and a CR-10. In Cura, I printed at 200-degrees to a bed of 55-degrees and at 65. I printed mostly Dungeons and Dragons terrain and tiles. I was able to print at 65 mm/s and was still able to crank up the speed on the printers to 140% and still had consistent results at Standard Quality. Initially, I had issues with under extrusion and adhesion. My glass bed has a glue-stick rubbed onto it too. I've been happy with the filament.</span>

<span>I was printing out models for my classes while at my desk and I’d have to look over now and then to check on it but even with glue on the bed it still wanted to pull away. I made a few good prints but over and over the filament kept snapping from being rolled weirdly. Now this would be okay for someone on a budget but this could definitely become discouraged from the hobby and I’d say try a different filament for your first filament, maybe try this one later for troubleshooting.</span>

<span>I love Hatchbox filament; consistent and great quality regardless of whether it's their ABS or PLA. I have used many other brands; Hatchbox is my go to. Size is pretty dead-on and I have had no clogs or significant warping (with the ABS) on an open-bed Taz 6 and (2) Crealty CR-10 3d printers (purchased on Amazon). On an aside, I did not think I was ordering 3.0mm ABS but PLA;. Amazon....do all your filament customers a HUGE favor and PLEASE STOP working the search results. Clicking "3.0" for size and "PLA" after searching for "hatchbox filament" filters nothing...it's a must that buyers double-check the results. Amazon will still recommend sizes and materials you asked not to see. That comment should be directed elsewhere but in 2 years I haven't found where to leave such feedback so be aware.

<span>I too am using this in a Lulzbot TAZ 5. I found this filament printed best at lower temps. I'm using 227 hotend and 105 bed temp.<br/>To be fair the label on the side does say to use a temp range between 210 and 240. Since 240 is the default for TAZ ABS, I tried this setting but found it too hot (got some blobbing on Octopus print).  Filament is 3mm not 2.85mm so do make sure to set this in your setup profile.<br/>See photos for example results. I printed the Benchy and chip clip at 0.15 z layer height.</span>

<span>I've started with the red. Honestly it lasted for two prints before I used it all. Great brilliance, good adhesion.  These are great amounts to test colours and bridge gaps. I'll be going back to buy a full spool of red</span>

<span>I really like the new AmazonBasics PLA.  All the colors are good and very consistent throughout.  The diameter of the sections I tested are also very consistent.  This is not cheap Chinese filament, but made in The Netherlands.  However, it has the price to match quality filament as well.  So while I believe the price is fair, It's hard for me to justify buying this in larger amounts when I can find US made filament of the same, if not higher quality for the same price or even lower.  But some of the colors are really nice, like the gold.  It has an antique look to it and I will purchase a full spool.  So I can easily recommend buy these samples because you can try all the colors and may find something that you really like.  I did, I like the gold!</span>

<span>Definitely worth buying if you're new or moderately experienced with 3D printing and just looking for an affordable assortment of colors. There's a great mix in there and so far they've all performed like a normal PLA filament. Some are a little stringy but nothing you can't clean up after the print. Would buy again! It's fun to have cool unique colors for small parts.</span>

<span>Anyone complaining about filament not sticking, stringing, etc. needs to have some patience and fiddle with their temperature settings until it works out.  Once you figure it out for a given filament (of any brand or even sometimes batch), it will work.  Make sure your Z axis compensation is also spot on as perfect temperatures with a bad Z axis compensation value will result in your first layer never sticking.  I have been able to get all of the filaments I have tested in the pack so far to stick without issue (sometimes too well, but better than the alternative) and without any stringing.<br/><br/>Since not all printers a 100% the same, you may need to tweak the settings below a hair to get optimal performance.  If you hear a clicking sound from your extruder (that is it not able to push the filament through the nozzle because it is not soft enough), try bumping up the nozzle temperature 1-5 degrees until it goes away.  The secret to no stringing is to set this as low as possible to where your extruder is silent.  This is true at least on a CR-10S Pro V2, not sure if this applies to others as this is the only printer I have :)<br/><br/>These are the settings I have found work for my setup:<br/>  - Creality CR-10S Pro v2 (firmware version 1.70.1)<br/>  - Cura 4.6.0<br/><br/> -  Z Comp: 2.30 (configured via the LCD when starting a print and during leveling)<br/><br/> - Cura<br/>  - Cura PLA defaults except for the changes listed below for the colors<br/>  - Cura printer defaults (Creality CR10S Pro since there is no V2) at "Staqndard Quality - 0.2 mm" (turning on supports as needed)<br/><br/> - Regular colors (i.e. Brown)<br/>  - Nozzle Temp: 205 C<br/>  - Bed Temp: 60 C<br/><br/> - Neon colors (i.e. Neon Orange)<br/>  - Nozzle Temp: 210 C<br/>  - Bed Temp: 65 C<br/>  - NOTE: The neon colors look a little dark while being printed and don't go back to their original neon color until after they cool.<br/><br/>I haven't gotten to the glow or the 2 translucent ones yet, but I will update my review once I get to them with temperatures I found to work well.</span>

<span>The filament looks good, the color is pure. Adhesion seems pretty OK. The fatal issue is that the size is not right, its diameter is bigger than 1.75 so that it will stuck at the hotend and not able to melt into the nozzle, I guess that is also why some users have to increase the temperature to crazily high in order to print. Tested the temperature tower and it showed it should work in 190-205 without problem, again, the bigger size makes it not able to print.</span>

<span>**1.17.22 Update**<br/>Ive gone through both rolls of the white and finally ran into the issue others have been reporting. The last 60 or so meters are wound so tightly that the roll stops feeding.  I ended up losing 3 multi hour prints on two different printers due to this. I'll not be getting Solutech again for a while as this is just unacceptable. Ill be unspooling and rewinding the last spool to see if that helps at all but will be switching to another brand for the time being.<br/><br/>**1.17.22 Update**<br/>I buy Solutech pretty much exclusively as my printers are calibrated for their filament and I don't have to dink around with finding new settings. The prints always come out great and I almost never have an issue with adhesion or under extrusion any more, that is till today. Something about these two rolls is different as my normal print temp of 203 was badly under extruding and not getting anywhere near enough filament to the print bed. I upped the temp to 206 and things were fine again. I'm not sure if it's just these rolls or if something actually was changed about the formulation used.<br/><br/>Regardless, Solutech is an excellent brand and offers a great variety of options. The only request that I have is an addition of a TPU and wood grain filament!</span>

<span>A friend of mine had been using 3D Solutech filament and I noticed how awesome his prints turned out.  I had been given some 3D Solutech Real White filament from him and then bought a spool for myself soon after.  I received it very quickly with Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>The filament was printing great at first, and looked amazing, but ended up being a lemon spool where the filament was knotted multiple times within the spool, and rendered the rest of the spool un-usable.  Oh well, these things happen..<br/><br/>I contacted 3D Solutech support directly and received an immediate response and was shipped a replacement spool right away, free of charge, no questions asked.  I got the replacement spool quickly within a couple days and it printed great as well, with no snags or knotting issues.  The only issue, was this white was a 'translucent' white, and not the opaque 'real white' that I ordered.<br/><br/>I sent 3D Solutech another e-mail letting them know this, and they sent me another replacement spool, free of charge, directly from their office to help fix the problem.  I haven't seen this kind of customer service in a long time from any company I've dealt with.<br/><br/>Absolute A+ Customer Service!<br/><br/>Filament wise, 3D Solutech is probably the best value for the money and quality you can receive.  The colors are amazing and brilliant throughout the entire line, the filament is always within spec and prints flawlessly.  Minimal oozing and very little retraction is needed as well as being usable within a wide range of temperatures for slower/faster printing.  I have not had a single issue with clogging, moisture, or brittle filament either.  And if I did have those issues, I'm sure their support team would fix the problem asap!<br/><br/>The Real White filament is VERY VERY white and opaque colored with a nice shine to it.  It looks great with anything you print and has got to be one of my favorite filaments to print with, bar none.  If you want a 'True' White Filament, this is definitely the one to go with.<br/><br/>The first replacement roll I had received that was a Translucent White also had to be one of my favorite filaments as well.  It was a perfect translucent color, and looked awesome when printing lithophanes.  I wish they actually had this color for sale because it's definitely one I miss after using up the entire roll.<br/><br/>When anyone asks to recommend a filament, 3D Solutech is the one I recommend first off, even if it's not on their dropdown list to vote for.  It's by far the best quality for the money you can get, without a doubt!  The multiple stickers they include in each package is just icing on the cake!  ;-)</span>

<span>I bought this brand of filament 3 or 4 times to date. The first few times they were great. Gave me no issues. This last roll, however, is pretty much useless. It's the "Real White" PLA, which I've used before. When I got this roll I loaded it up and started running the usual filament calibration tests. Couldn't get a good result. Tried a benchy and the thing literally came apart in my hands. I figured maybe the roll had too much moisture. No big deal, popped it in my filament dryer. It dried for over 24 hours and still, it's popping and snapping more than Rice Krispies. Under extruding like crazy. So I'm writing this review as a warning. Spend the few bucks more and get a different brand. I don't know what happened. Because I had good results in the past I gave 2 stars. If I was basing it on this one purchase it wouldn't even warrant one star.</span>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>Is there a 3D printer that prints multiple colors?</h3></h3>
    

There are multiple 3D printers that can print in multiple colors, including the DeltaWASP 20 40 3D printer, the FlashForge Creator Pro, and the Lulzbot Mini.
<h3><h3>Are dual extruders worth it?</h3></h3>
    

Dual extruders can be useful for a number of reasons, such as printing with two different colors or two different materials. However, they can also be more complicated to use and may not be worth the extra hassle for some users.
<h3><h3>How many extruders can a 3D printer have?</h3></h3>
    

A 3D printer typically has one extruder, but there are some printers that have two extruders.
<h3><h3>Is it better to 3D print multiple parts at once?</h3></h3>
    

It depends on the part's size and geometry. Printing multiple parts at once can save time and filament, but it can also lead to better quality prints.
