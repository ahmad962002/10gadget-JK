<span>I purchased this laptop to replaced my old ASUS laptop,I needed something faster and runs smoother however I do have to add more ram because it does slows down and sometimes freeze. I wasn’t intended to use it for gaming I just wanted it for normal internet browsing,and also using it when I’m live streaming for twitch that’s about it. It’s a beautiful laptop I definitely like it very convenient for me.</span>

<span>This laptop is such an upgrade ...my absolute favorite is the multiple -colored backlit keys that scroll ever so gently while I'm working...pretty jewel tones add a super -rich touch...the keys are so great to see and access...the laptop has a good solid weight to it...the sound is really great...the HD quality is there for sure.<br/>I could go on and on about this laptop, but you need to buy it and enjoy it for yourself.</span>

<span>I got this product on sale for $599, and it is more than worth the price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Battery life is fairly decent. The only time the battery would burn itself was when I was using additional monitors and graphic intense activities at the same time. Even when the battery may be low, the charge speed is very powerful, and you should have full charge in an hour even if your using the laptop.<br/>-Processor is a beast. i5 10300H has the firepower to run some games that normally require high specs. Dark Souls III runs very smoothly on normal settings, haven't been able to test Elden Ring yet. (This may require more ram.) I'm also able to hook up a monitor, among other peripherals, as well as have other things open, like Discord, without a problem.<br/>-Screen. With 144hz (or 144 visible frames per sec.), you don't need additional monitors to see just how good your games are running.<br/>-RGB Keyboard. Can change how the lights appears, as well as their intensity, or turn them off if you don't need them.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-RAM. With only 8gbs of RAM, you may yourself upgrading to something more using the extra empty RAM slot. Luckily, this laptop is designed to be easily upgraded with a poppable bottom. All you need are screwdrivers that fit and a RAM cartridge of your choice.<br/>-Storage. Again, with only 512gb of space, you may find yourself upgrading using the empty extra M.2 SSD spot. One thing to keep in mind is that this laptop will only support up to Gen 3, so make sure to save some money and not but a Gen 4 SSD, as you will not get the full power out of it.<br/>-Graphics Card. The GTX 1650 isn't exactly the best graphics card out there, but it gets by for meeting recommended settings on older games, while meeting minimum requirements for newer more graphic intense games.</span>

<span>I recently purchased this laptop on a lightning deal off of Amazon. I have to say, it was well worth the money! In my short time owning this laptop, I've put it through multiple gaming tests, workload tests, and just day-to-day usage. As such, I will write a pros/cons list to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of this laptop so you can decide for yourself if it's a worthwhile purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Keeps up with most modern games, even with the dated GTX 1650 GPU.<br/>-It's FAST. Oddly faster than most higher-end laptops I've purchased in the past.<br/>-I actually really enjoy the typing on this laptop. It's not clicky, but not entirely silent. It's nice!<br/>-It's incredibly customizable. You can change the color of the keyboard, the pattern the lights show, and even control the fan speed from the keyboard... which leads me to my cons list.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-The fans in this laptop are stupidly loud. As in, I feel like my laptop is taking off from a runway like an airplane. While gaming, it's not so much an issue because you typically wear a headset. While working, however, it can be annoying at times. And God forbid you have to take this laptop to a college class or into public, because people will probably look in your direction to figure out if it's indeed your laptop making so much noise or if there's a tornado headed in their direction. Using an app to determine fan speed and decibel level, the fans are at a constant 50 decibels while gaming, which is pretty freaking loud.<br/><br/>-The screen could be better. It's not a bad screen by any means, but colors are just kind of in the middle of the spectrum.<br/><br/>In summary: Buy this laptop if you're comfortable wearing a headset all the time. If not, this laptop probably isn't for you.</span>

<span>I am happy with my purchase of this hp laptop. With the Amazon Prime subscription, I paid $169.00 altogether. This price includes taxes. The reason why I purchased the laptop is for college. My 2011 laptop runs on Windows 7, and I needed a back-up computer for classes and binge-watching Netflix. For any student I would recommend obtaining the free Windows 365 subscription and signing on later with your school email. I received a prompt to add a credit card at the beginning for the 1-month subscription to 365 with the setup tutorial. If someone were to skip this there are alternatives for adding a credit card. It is possible to download the 2016 Word addition for free as well.<br/>I enjoyed the voice activated tutorial at the beginning; I was able to set up my Wi-Fi password quickly. Also, I downloaded Google Chrome as well. The sync properties on Chrome allowed me to sync my favorites and history from my 2011 laptop. The laptop is so fast; it takes seconds to load the homepages and Word documents. Just for fun I purchased a very cheap, 20-inch television from the thrift store and hooked the hp laptop up via the HD HDMI cord slot. Now there are two screens. This is helpful for writing papers and binge-watching Netflix. So far, the laptop works great, and I would recommend this product for anyone.</span>

<span>Seemed like a nice little machine for the money, but it’s got its problems. Won’t stay on all the time. Other times the screen just goes black while it’s on and won’t come back on until it’s been off for a while. It’s definitely getting sent back this week.</span>

<span>This was the first gaming computer I ever bought, so I had no idea that the plugs were different from regular computers. When I first plugged it in and tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I thought I got a bum computer! I called the number on the package and was told that gaming computers have different plugs than standard computers, and that I had to push the plug into the back of the computer all the way until I heard a click. I thought I had, but when I pushed on it again I heard the click and it started right up.<br/><br/>Onto the computer itself... the graphics are great, the speed has worked well for all the games used so far (Minecraft, Bloons TD6, etc.), the picture is vivid, and I have no complaints so far!</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>My son sent me the page for this, knowing what my desired specs and budget were.  Then I read the reviews and was almost scared away.  He talked me into at least trying it and I am so so glad I did!!<br/><br/>I love everything about it.  I am not a gamer, the games I play generally do not require high specs.  However, I do photo and video editing, and a lot of multi-tasking.  This laptop works well for everything I do.<br/><br/>I have not experienced any problems with the display, you do have to make sure the cord clicks into the back, and the keyboard has a nice feel to it (I type a lot).  My only cons are the battery life (3-4 hours), and I do wish I could adjust the light on keyboard.  I don't mind the red, but do find it annoying that it doesn't light up until the first keystroke.  I often use the computer in a dim or dark room, so finding that first key is annoying,  There should be a light up key.Like hitting space to light up and it doeant make a space if used before typing anything else.  That is a minor thing tho.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I am very pleased with this laptop and hope it lasts me as many years as my previous one did.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>This is my first time to purchase a gaming laptop, so far I’m not a serious gamer but sometime play ETS2 by my 2017 PC.<br/>After serval days of watching reviews in different brands or different model of ASUS. Finally I decided to get 3070Ti version rather than 3060 or TUF series.<br/><br/>Design: No objection on the Ports and RGB position, they are friendly and eyeballs attractive. Keystone, hi-tech design to lock or recover. Never though it happened in a computer.<br/>Performance: Excellent, even this is “noisy” cooling FAN during “turbo” mode, that is acceptable and reasonable. Moreover, this is just feeling warm on the keyboard, NOT hot. The display is also surprising to me, I don’t think this is FHD when watching Netflix or Disney+, this output like 2K. The 300Hz/3ms is great, my games is “running smoothly with clear image”.<br/>Setting / Changing: Easy and Fast response among different performance modes. Hot keys presented individually but not just the normal speaker volume, monitor brightness, they are GAMING setting.<br/><br/>Room of improvement:<br/>Armoury crate: better if adding more description of the function or to align status, some using on/off but some is option.<br/>Loudness of speaker: these 4 speakers are<br/>no significantly giving Dolby Atmos.<br/>Power cord: better if providing multi adapter for different countries, like UK or Japan style.<br/><br/>I didn’t read any instruction before enjoying my ASUS, just tested / tried what I can find from it, the overall is easily to be understood and to personalise your needs.<br/>IMO, this is best CP ratio of a performance Laptop with users-in design. Also, you can receive a warranty extension from ASUS for the review.<br/>No regret at all. Will recommend someone who is looking for a performance or gaming laptop.</span>

<span>Maybe it's because I'm upgrading from an ancient desktop but this computer is blazing fast, runs everything at high settings and high framerates. Battery life is low if I'm running games with high graphics. Storage is only 512 GB which, after I had installed seven games and my Spotify collection, was 97% full already. No camera or BD/DVD/CD-Rom drive. Touch pad is ok but it's better to just get a mouse. Computer runs hot so make sure you have something between your legs and the laptop to counter the heat. My biggest complaint is that UPS was supposed to ask for a signature on delivery but they just left it on my doorstep. Thankfully I was home at the time and watching for it.</span>

<span>The laptop seems to work okay but I would hesitate to buy one again.  From my perspective:<br/>Cons.<br/>1.  Slow to boot up.  My previous laptop was less expensive, had a slower processer, and booted up in half the time.  It was an Acer.  The Acer did fail hard though.<br/>2.  Hot.  When holding on my lap it gets warmer than I like.  It needs a better cooling solution.  I buy a laptop for use on my lap, not a desk.<br/>3.  Hard to upgrade.  I like to add a second hard drive for backing up data.  This laptop has a spot but you must break the warranty seal and it isn't very easy to split the case.  Be careful to not crack any of the plastic case.<br/>4.  On the pricy side.  Given my experience so far I think this laptop is over priced.<br/>5.  Keyboard is minimal, I like a few of the numeric keys that are missing on this keyboard.  My old Acer was the same size and had the keys so they could fit.<br/>Pros.<br/>1. The display seems nice and clear, though similar to my older Acer which I also liked.<br/><br/>Overall right now I would not purchase this laptop again.  However if it is significantly more durable than my old Acer I will be happy with my purchase.  If Acer's were more durable I would have bought another one over the MSI.</span>

<span>Spilt a drink across it immediately so now the keyboard is sticky but that's only complaint about it lol. Got this as a gift for my daughter who's beginning to get into more resource intensive games. She was pretty floored how well it handled all the games she plays (Mostly through Roblox) on max settings. It really does look good and loads them much faster now as well. If it breaks due to my catastrophic cluts moment, I'll probably buy her the same model again ($600). Might upgrade to one of the higher end graphic card models</span>

<span>I bought this because it was on sale, I play some lightweight games (Emulators, WoW) and I use AutoCAD for engineering classes. I needed something that had some "umpf". This computer is perfect for both CAD software and Video Games. The computer itself is very solid, clean and looks really cool. The screen is beautiful. I really like that the keyboard is back-lit red; I do a lot of homework late at night (I'm an expert procrastinator) and it's nice to be able to actually see the keys. It doesn't seem to have any overheating issues, I've been playing WoW off and on and the fans barely even make a sound. Very happy with this laptop!<br/><br/>Make sure you get a good case for the thing, wouldn't want your new baby to get hurt.</span>

<span>First off, I want to acknowledge what a great value overall this laptop is. It is specced well for the price point, and the white with teal only lights is drool worthy imo. Their needs to be more laptops with color options besides every shade of black, and 20k shades of grey. It literally turns heads in the library when I take it out lol. The plastic made case doesn't feel cheap or low quality at all. When I got it I upgraded to 24gb ram from 8gb. I didn't know the 8 was soldered onto the mobo, and that's my fault for not doing enough research. Also when I got it I added a 2nd 1tb wd black ssd, along with the nonamer brand one it came with. There's no Xtra thermal pad for the 2nd m.2 slot  that comes with the laptop, and there definitely should be. We'll see if heat is an issue down the road for it.Adding this 2nd ssd , unbeknownst to me they are put into some sort of raid mode,by the bios,not 0,not 1, and it can't be changed. The bios is absolutely atrocious. Almost nothing can be tinkered with.  even in advanced options(f7) anything interesting is greyed out i.e. graphics options,storage options, secure boot stuff. it's despicable that you can't change any of this stuff, and really bent me jaded me on this laptop abit. If your braindead and just want to game, this is optimal. If you want to squeak every bit of performance, and optimize YOUR laptop like I have my whole life, this isn't that laptop.ASUS cuts off every avenue for enhancement, and they use the Intel dynamic tuning, and Intel management engine to put a kibosh on any attempt to subvert this garbage. The screens good not great, sound is good not great, also im pretty sure they turn off some of the VM features of the i7 chip this laptop came with the vt-x. So power users need not apply here. 'Nuff said.</span>

<span>This laptop is for someone who wants a laptop to take around and do productive work on and also play modern games at high settings. There are others with faster GPUS, but hardly any that can claim 6-9 hours of battery life like this one. There are tons of battery saving features, like a dedicated key to change what power profile to use. The 144hz screen auto sets to 60hz on battery so save battery life. Gaming on a AAA game at high settings, 30 fps, I get around 2-3 hours of battery life. Less demanding games can go more. Other contemporary laptops i've used can really only game for an hour or so while on battery. You can also set the battery life to be capped at 80% or 60% to extend it's usable life. I usually keep it on 80% and still have long battery life. And it comes in at a hell of a competitive price.<br/><br/>#CPU<br/><br/>The cpu is a bit lacking when compared to other 8 core laptops, but it's a good tradeoff for the lower TDP (and less power consumption). It is more than capable for most peoples work though. It cannot be undervolted like any new intel chip, which I did not know until researching it.<br/><br/>#GPU<br/><br/>The 3050ti has been able to run any game I throw at it on high settings, and older games can be ran easily on my 4k monitor and the native 4k resolution.<br/>It can get fairly loud when gaming at high performance for awhile, I game with headphones so I don't notice it when i take them off. But this will be an issue for really any gaming laptop, especially one this thin.<br/><br/>#Ports<br/>Thunderbolt 4 can be connected to external docks and external GPUS. Allows 100w usb c charging so you can run laptop off one cable, but keep in mind this is less than the 200w power brick, and if you are gaming at high performance, it will slowly drain the battery unless you also have the power cable connected. I also got a 50$ external 20000 mah battery with 65w usb charging which can bring the laptop from 10-80%. Nice!<br/>It is annoying how the ports are all at least half way down the machine, as the top half is for the fan outputs.<br/><br/>#Upgradeability<br/><br/>There are 8gbs of ram soldered onto the board, and an additional slot, which I throw a 16gb stick in for 24gb. There is an additional m.2 slot which I put another 512gb ssd in. Speaking of which, the SSD is crazy fast. While looking up benchmarks for other laptops, this one easily beat them all. I don't remember exact numbers but it's there.<br/><br/>#Display<br/><br/>1080p, 144hz. Good color reproduction, and clear sharp images. Does not look washed out or anything. Not the brightest for working in sunlight though, but it's usable.<br/>The screen cannot tilt back 180 degrees, more like 140 ish? I use a laptop stand so I cant have it as vertically tilted as I like, but for 99% of people this is a non issue. The hinges feel solid and don't seem like they will crap out or break off like other.<br/><br/>#Keyboard &amp; Trackpad<br/><br/>The backlit keyboard (one color, changeable brightness with keyboard keys or using software, also has different modes like breathing) is solid. Key travel is not shallow and has a good click. I do not notice a difference in quality with my Mx master key keyboard.<br/><br/>The trackpad is decent. Not glass, but precise and not an annoying texture. Not much to say on it. It gets the job done.<br/><br/>#Design and build<br/><br/>It is marketed as a 'tough' laptop and while it doesn't feel much different from a normal laptop (and isn't metal, it's some sort of hard plastic polymer), I have had 0 damage in the 3 months i've owned it.<br/>The Tuf Dash f15 is solid, yet lightweight and not annoying to lug around. It is thin and not too heavy, and has similar dimensions and weight of most high powered ultrabooks.<br/><br/>#Bugs Glitches &amp; Software<br/><br/>This is the first laptop i've had where I have not encountered really any bugs or glitches. I have had BSOD but I am almost postive these are from the Dell TB16 thunderbolt dock i'm using. Even these have only happened 2 times in 3 months.<br/>The laptop is ran off of Asus Armory Crate service, which has features such as profile switching, game optimziation, system tweaking and more. It can be accessed via a dedicated key. It is not super lightweight of a program, but not overly consuming either. You can close the program in task manager and the laptop will not have any issues, just some features are closed off.</span>

<span>It was great at first, now I have to restart my computer for my keyboard to work, when my monitor goes into rest mode I have to power it off with the power button, and now my graphics card isn’t even showing up in my system, it’s using my cpu as my graphics card… I paid a grand for my computer so I wouldn’t have to go through the struggles of building one myself, and not have to worry about it being crap in less than a year.

<span>Well, it really is premature to write a review about a laptop on the day it was received but I was loving how it felt in my hands that I just had to say a few things about it.<br/><br/>It is by far the best, fastest laptop or pc I have ever owned. I was so impressed with how fast programs seemed to download and install. It was pretty amazing to me. Even in comparison to a relatively new and powerful laptop owned by my wife, this was far quicker and snappier.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in finding out that it uses a proprietary charger. I was really hoping it would be a usb c charger. Can't win them all.<br/><br/>I had to settle for a non touch laptop. In order to get the other components, the graphics card and the processor etc, I wasn't able to find a combo with a touchscreen so I had to settle for this. But this is not a negative on this laptop.<br/><br/>Even coming out of the box you could tell it was premium. The packaging was really good and protective. It even came inside a soft cloth bag. First time I've had a laptop come that way.<br/><br/>The screen is sharp and very clear. Obviously, I still need to test it and put it through it's paces to see how beautiful things will look but the few video clips i put up sounded and looked great.<br/><br/>Update: I reduced the rating by 1 star all related to 1 thing. Battery life. I lowered the refresh rate on the screen to 60hz with intent to increase it if and when I game. With settings like this, the laptop seems like it would run for around 5 hours but that's an estimate. And that is not bad. Throw in something that uses the gpu and you get very little. In fact, I was running a golf simulator program called e6 and casting the screen to a 2nd laptop screen. In that mode, this laptop died in about an hour. I shouldn't be surprised though as nobody would game on battery power... Not for a serious gaming session. I still thought I'd get more than 1 hour.<br/><br/>Other than that, the laptop performance is spot on and pretty amazing. Crisp and snappy... Fast. Coming from a 6 yr old unit... This thing feels amazing in comparison. Startup is done in a matter of seconds and away you go...</span>

<span>So this was listed as very good condition. Under Amazons description for that all essentials to operat and in good working order.<br/>It came to us on time but its was well used to the point that the keys where wore off the screen was broken or creased you can see it in the pics the charger was a European plug and the unit would not power up(could not plug into power) but batteries where completely dead.<br/>Sent the unit back and 8 days after they received it i am still waiting on my refund of over a thousand dollars very disappointed in Amazon right now</span>

<span>The most recent reviews are kind of mixed so I decided to add one. Many years ago I was a pc gamer, I’m talking AMD phenom 2 black edition and dual ati 4850 days, overclocking- I considered myself a power user… I wanted to get something that I could game with but mostly use for work and college. I’m not naive to the fact that battery life would be terrible, so plugging it in and battery isn’t an issue for me<br/><br/>This laptop is great, I haven’t had any issues with it. It’s fast I play mostly COD but I’ve also tried flight sim, horizon, really any game I could that I thought would stress the CPU and GPU. It runs everything, really great.<br/><br/>Typing on the keyboard is fine, trackpad is fine, everything you open pretty much opens instantly, price is great, etc..<br/><br/>I wish I would’ve got one with a 2k or even 4k screen, but it isn’t really a deal breaker as the screen is really good.<br/><br/>The one thing I’ll agree with everyone is that it gets very hot, but I think a lot of the expectations are that it should be cool. When you’re using word, PowerPoint, etc, heat isn’t an issue but gaming it gets hot, like very hot to the touch toward the top of the laptop, which is to be expected. I do have a cooling pad and it helps some but again it’s to be expected.<br/><br/>If you’re on the fence this is a great pick, I was torn between a laptop with the 3070 vs this one with the 3060. This has the higher TGP of 105w vs a lot of the 3070s with the lower TGP, from the research I did this one with the higher TGP results in the 3060 being faster than the 3070s around the same price range.</span>

<span>I do a lot of video editing and it's relatively okay for that. But when it comes to just everyday work it's not easy to use. The cursor jumps around so you'll be typing in one place, but your cursor jumps somewhere else.  So then you've got to figure out how much chaos you created in your document and try to fix it. It's very annoying.</span>

<span>Purchased this laptop because I didn't want to use my gaming rig for work and other basic tasks.<br/><br/>Build quality is far better than I  expected at this price point. Sure, it would be great to have a solid aluminum case instead of just the top, but that is to be expected for the price.<br/>Took it apart as soon as it was delivered so I could add a 8gb ram stick and a second ssd.<br/>Installation was super easy.<br/>Kudos to acer for adding the ability to install a 2.5" hard drive with provided hardware.<br/>Not many other rigs at this price point that have a second drive option.<br/>You can also upgrade the nvme drive if you want to.<br/><br/>Backlit keyboard is also a huge plus and it is the perfect brightness in my opinion.<br/>Keyboard is comfortable to type on and the addition of a 10 key is another bonus at this price point.<br/><br/>Screen is nice and bright with no glare. Honestly a much better picture quality than I expected for a sub $500 laptop.<br/><br/>It has all the ports you need to get the job done.<br/>2x usb 3<br/>1x usb 2<br/>1x usbc "Out only unfortunately" You have to charge the laptop with included charger.<br/>Lan/Ethernet<br/>Headphone jack<br/><br/>Performance is where this laptop really shines.<br/>I am dual booting the stock windows 11 and linux mint.<br/>Both run flawlessly and super fast.<br/>Hasn't slowed down at all with multiple apps and browser tabs running at once.<br/>Everything runs just as fast as my desktop gaming rig.<br/>Would't run any high end games on it of coarse since it is not built for that and has no deddicated video card.<br/>Pretty sure you could run minecraft or wow/diablo on lower settings.<br/><br/>Battery life is also amazing.<br/>I am getting about 8 hours of usage before I plug the battery in at 30%.<br/>That is with full screen brightness, wifi and bluetooth enabled.<br/>It took 10 hours to completely drain the battery after the first charge.<br/><br/>I would recommend this laptop to anyone that wants a solid rig at a great price for everything other than gaming.<br/>It is also very light for a full featured laptop, so it would be a great choice for school or business for someone that needs/wants to carry around a full sized laptop.<br/>I don't think you could find a better laptop for a student at this price.</span>

<span>Even though my first experience with a gaming platform was the Magnavox Odyssey, and my first ownership of a gaming platform was the Atari 2600, and my first computer was the Commodore 64, I have kept up with technology the entire way since then. I have found it disconcerting and annoying that we the people have allowed things to become the way they have. There is no way apparently to even get this laptop started without an email address providing your name personal information and an internet connection. All of these things lead to an invasion of my privacy. Although it seems free to allow every large company on planet Earth to know everything about everybody, it isn't free. There will be penalties there will be consequences. Science fiction has provided many scenarios, but that's why it's called fiction. The reality of the thing is that's pretty soon we will not be able to make a decision by ourselves. I've noticed that some people already cannot do anything without checking out a video first. Everything and everybody is tracked. I use my phone to check my credit card account, my bank account, the TV listings and some internet browsing. I recently installed a tracker blocker made by Duck Duck Go. The aforementioned use of my phone produces 3,000 blocked trackers every 7 days. It is disgusting and creepy. I cannot leave my house or dozens of or maybe hundreds or thousands of companies know where I am and know that I'm not home and know that there's no one at home because I'm gone. At any time you can stop by and do what you want because they know I'm not home. This laptop has language written by Microsoft that tells me how much they are helping me by allowing them to track me. And in so many words, that's not true. Many people, and it was seeing the younger generation, does not see the problem with this. I hear people say, "everybody does it" as if that makes it okay. It is not okay, but my laptop is more than 10 years old and I needed a new one. I can repair my old appliances and some of the old electronics. I can repair older cars, in fact my new car is 20 years old. Unlike the people on TV, I do regular maintenance and I do not have breakdowns. Everything today has programmed obsolescence. There was a time when durable goods meant 16 to 20 years. Today, durable goods last 2 to 4 years. My refrigerator is was purchased at Sears by me in 1995. It still works. My washer and dryer was also purchased in 1995 and they still work. I will be lucky to get four or five years out of this laptop. I am sure windows will be more than happy to sell another copy of their software on some company's laptop. In a time wheen people are more and more aware that the resources on planet earth are finite, we manufacture goods that will end up in a landfill.</span>

<span>I don't know who designed to install the speakers underneath the laptop, but that was beyond stupid. The sound quality is horrible, especially if you don't have it sitting on an elevated surface. Other than that I'm happy with it, but if you plan to listen to a lot of music without a headset, look elsewhere.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop both for school and casual gaming and I’m very pleased! I’ve always built my own desktops to spend less for better parts but needed a laptop for school. After looking at some in the $500-$700 range I found this one and after a look over and reading some reviews I decided to buy it. I managed to purchase the Nitro 5 9th gen for $600 + tax. (Sale) decided to get another 8gb of DDR4 and a 500gb M.2 for all my games. The storage that comes with the laptop is more than enough for school work especially with most files being in the cloud. I got a crucial 8GB DDR4 2666 SODIMM for ram and a WD Blue 3D Nano 500GB SSD (which I have installed but have yet to set up)<br/>With both of these upgrades the laptop runs great! Now that you know a little about what’s been done to the laptop and it’s intended use (in my case) let’s jump into some pros and cons after 3 weeks of use.<br/>Pros:<br/>•Good specs for the price<br/>•Easily upgraded<br/>•PLENTY of ports<br/>•Runs great<br/>•Full keyboard (takes some getting used to)<br/>•Not too heavy<br/>•Easy to use temperature/fan software<br/>•Good battery life when on power save<br/>•Good quality on the webcam<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>•The bottom of the screen is a little flimsy<br/>•While gaming the CPU runs 74°C-80°C which is a little hotter than I’d like but to be expected in a laptop<br/>•Does need to be plugged in for peak performance but the same goes for all/most laptops<br/>•Charge port is on the right side of laptop towards the middle which can be minor inconvenience when using a mouse<br/>•Not a huge fan of the red but beggars can’t be choosers and at least it was done well.<br/>•Took about a week to come in IIRC but no biggie<br/><br/>As you can see the cons are mostly just nitpicking little things I don’t particularly care for. That’s because overall I’m very happy with this device! There are just some minor things but not at deal breakers. I usually don’t bother with writing reviews this long but I know there are people in the position I was in a month ago. Love the laptop so far and don’t think you will regret your purchase! Unless you get a bad unit, which I can’t speak on because I got a good one. I’m sure ACER is more than willing to replace faulty units. Hope I was able to help with your decision! Best of luck in your laptop search! Will update with any issues or new findings.</span>

<span>I play games that demand a lot out of a computer and didn’t have any problems playing any games at medium to high graphics. Pretty nice download speeds<br/>Solid for the price, storage is low so I ended up getting an external drive and the fans can be loud but with a head set on you don’t even notice it. I’d recommend this laptop</span>

<span>I tend to prattle exhaustively so I tried to divvy up my numerous opinions into sections you might find relevant.<br/><br/>Now/Future = I've been very pleased with this laptop, and I do consider it a great deal for the six hundy spent (on the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H). Not only does it perform splendidly as it comes "right out the box", but it's also upgradeable in the near future as tech advances and my finances allow. I've been using it for hours on end everyday for almost one month.<br/><br/>Multitasking = I can run WoW (weeeeee!!) while simultaneously streaming music on Spotify in my web browser. Beyond that, I can also minimize my game and music to do a quick Google on whatever boss I'm trying to squelch as I solo dungeons with my Night Elf Demon Hunter. No lag or stuttering while multitasking whatsoever. Nice. B-)<br/><br/>Graphics quality = It comes with 2 graphics cards, so be sure to check your in-game settings to make sure the best card is selected. Streaming Netflix and running WoW are lovely in a way I wasn't able to appreciate on my previous HP laptop. My only concern is that once in a while I've seen a rolling screen dim from top to bottom for a split second before it returns to normal. It has only happened a couple of times in the past month I've owned this, so?<br/><br/>Pre-installed software = I had to find workarounds to disable Bing and Microsoft Edge, but in the end I can now use the search box on the start bar and it opens Google results in Chrome. Those being my preferred search engine and web browser. It wasn't terribly difficult as an amateur tinkerer.<br/><br/>Heat = Sometimes I use the laptop on my actual lap (go figure), and when I've been immersed in my addiction for 4-5 hours, it gets rather warm. Almost hot. The pre-installed Nitrosense app allows you to manage the fan settings in order to allay this. Also of note is that the heat escape is on the right side, which means south paws keep their leading hand cool and us orthodox boxers get a warm periodic reminder to move our hand away from the keyboard. In plain words: the heat from the fans blows directly where one would naturally rest one's hand on a mouse (if you use one, however, a mouse is not included).<br/><br/>Keyboard = The keys are comfortably spaced, appropriately sensitive to touch, and all are in working condition. The value of the number pad on a laptop cannot be understated!! The red backlight on the keyboard by default times out after 30 seconds. Finding the right key to strike first on an all-black keyboard after the backlight turns off was obnoxious to me. After some searching, I found that this too is changeable in the Nitrosense app. Weird place to put it, but ok. Hit the "(N)" key in the top left of the number pad, then click the Settings gear inside Nitrosense, and click to toggle off the "backlight off after 30 seconds" option. This might not be available on every model, but take a gander.<br/><br/>Battery life = The battery lasts for a decent amount of time when simply browsing and streaming music: several hours, give or take. But I prefer/recommend plugging in the power cord when I know I'm about to sit down for a long session of questing. ("Just one more quest!!")<br/><br/>Port/Cable management = Speaking of the power cable... It must have been a desperate decision to seat it on the righthand side of the laptop in the middle. The configuration of the internal hardware almost certainly has to be to blame for this. It seems like they tried to offset this inconvenience by making the power cable with a immediate 90 degree bend so you can swivel it (hopelessly) out of the way.<br/><br/>Final summation = I listed things things that I believe could be improved which were mostly cosmetic in nature and were either adjustable or could be lived with. But on the whole, this laptop has been a game-changer for my usual activities and has truly been a "best bang for your buck" experience. I recommend it for anyone who is maybe moderately into gaming but mostly wants a very reliable and delightful experience.</span>

<span>I really enjoy this laptop, It's super quick. Loads into windows under 4 seconds.<br/><br/>I added a "<br/>Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 260-Pin SODIMM Laptop Memory (HX426S15IB2/8)" ram module for making the Ram 16GB total, this will work best with the shared GPU memory.<br/><br/>YOU WILL NEED MORE RAM FOR HEAVIER GAMES<br/>The onboard GPU memory is shared with your ram when in gaming mode.<br/><br/>I played space engineers, which requires around 5GB of VRAM for medium gameplay, it leaked into my actual ram, but with the hyperx upgrade there was only slight FPS drops but not enough to affect gameplay. Ram is important.<br/><br/>I recommend windows 10 Pro 1909, don't use 2004 on this laptop will die really quick in Win 10 2004. Lasted about 3 hours under full load, whist 1909 lasted around 7 hours under full load, close to expected battery life.<br/><br/>The Intel CPU Turbos to 3.98 Ghz while plugged in, if you set it that way.<br/><br/>If you plan to install linux, the NVME will not be detected at boot time, to fix this, head to bios and on the first tab or second tab press "CTRL" + "S" to bring up a setting and change and disable intel optane firmware to use nvme in linux, as when you boot a non windows OS, the nvme will be placed into sleep mode.<br/><br/>As for a extra nvme slot, i picked up "Western Digital 250GB WD Blue SN550 NVMe Internal SSD - Gen3 x4 PCIe 8Gb/s, M.2 2280, 3D NAND, Up to 2,400 MB/s - WDS250G2B0C" from many other users, as this will take full advantage of the laptops firmware and hardware. You can pick higher space storage, but as a light gamer, this was enough for me.<br/><br/>As for the 2.5" drive, i picked up a "ST1000LM024 HN-m101Mbb" It's a 1TB Mechanical Drive with decent write and read speeds for lighter games, and game storage. Granted it is slower, but for this laptop its perfect and I can get full R/W speeds that were advertised. If you notice, it's the same drive inside the XBox 1 - 1st Gen, so You can game on it as well, not as fast load times, but its fast enough to still enjoy a game.<br/><br/>Besides the battery life, this is a really good laptop if you go out to a friends house for a night and do some moderate gaming like a LAN party, or a small road trip, or sitting out side for a few hours.<br/><br/>I do not recommend taking this on a flight. Unless you get an extra battery.<br/><br/>As of this message, I am using this as my main pc, and quite enjoy it, the Intel i5v9 is great and the GTX 1650 plays most games on Medium/High at 50/60fps.<br/><br/>Also another note to stay on 1909, is that windows f--ked up the NVIDIA auto select method for Intel Graphics and GPU graphics, so some games will default to intel CPU instead of NVIDIA.<br/><br/>Also, This laptop can play COD: Cold War at High settings with 48/55fps under heavy scenes and a perfect 60fps on normal fighting.</span>
