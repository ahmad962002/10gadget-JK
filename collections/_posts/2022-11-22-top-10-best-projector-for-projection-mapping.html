<span> My family plans to buy a projector by considering reliable brand, bigger screen, space wise, multiple use and easy to carry on. After some research, BENQ GV30 is the ideal projector for us.<br/>I have used this innovative BENQ GV30 for a while. Here are the reasons why we choose it and some benefits to share.<br/><br/>1. GV30 is a stylish and creative projector. We are simply in love the shape and design. It sits on a magnetic stand that keeps it from rolling away and lets you rotate it up or down to adjust the image height.<br/><br/>2. GV30 offers 135 degrees of projection angle with auto focus and vertical keystone. Thanks to the effective auto focus and keystone, the projector can reliably and efficiently adjust to find the best viewing angle most of the time. This makes GV30 can be a multi-angel projection in where you want easily. We can even project video on the ceiling and lay on the bed to watch it. That’s really cool.<br/><br/>3. GV30 includes an Android TV dongle inside and Wireless projection for multiple OS and devices. (Android phone/Chrome browser/iOS devices) It also can airplay. That is very easy and convenient.<br/><br/>4. Audio quality and volume are both impressive for the GV30's size and price. It has built-in speaker and can also be served as a capable Bluetooth speaker. The clear sound profile means that your content is perfectly hearable even at low volumes, and extra bass leads weight to more intense or impactful scenes. Also, if needed, you can connect the external speaker via Bluetooth. We connect our BOSE speaker via Bluetooth. Easy-peasy!<br/><br/>5. GV30 really makes a projector truly portable. It has a finger-sized loop makes you easily to carry from room to room. We will use this projector for our son’s Halloween party and funfest in the backyard. Our neighbors will be jealous!<br/><br/>Overall, we enjoy using this projector. Especially, kid has a great time with friends!<br/>If you are looking for a portable projector, we highly recommend BENQ GV30!</span>

<span>The wife and I took this to out last camping trip to watch movies late at night in our tent. Picture quality was fine since we had a small picture due to tent size. We charged it the day before leaving and when in use, had it connected to a  10,000mah portable charger. We saw 3-4 movies like this. Also used our hotspot from our cellphones and had an Amazon Firestick connected to out hotspot and projector. Worked great. Would recommend for this type of situations. Also, speaker quality isn't great but it is loud which worked for us.</span>

<span>Purchased this projector since it was within my budget of less than $200 with a $40 discount and was not a mini projector. Since it was my first projector, I can't compare it to other projectors, but have to say that it functions pretty well.<br/><br/>Benefits:<br/>1) Pretty bright<br/>2) Large screen size (70 to 80 inch screen)<br/>3) Somewhere between 720P and 1080P, but overall clear and crisp image and video quality.<br/>4) Fairly easy to set up<br/>5) The sound was pretty loud coming from the projector, but I still preferred the sound system in our basement.<br/>6) Comes with a remote<br/><br/>Drawbacks:<br/>1) The projector heats up a little so the fan is a bit loud to cool it.<br/>2) Although it is mentioned that 4K videos would be displayed, I didn't see the quality displayed.<br/>3) The HDMI cable that was sent had a few issues so it was disconnecting often.<br/>4) The lens focus isn't perfect, so you can still see a little blur.<br/>5) Not wireless so manual connection via a physical wire is needed.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Picture quality, compactness of equipment, low noise and heat due to a laser source (not a lamp) and most important of all, being able to adjust projected image to a rectangular area using 4 corner keystone adjustment so the projector doesn't always have to be placed center to the screen being projected were the key reasons we decided to go with this projector. It's been more than 6 months and we have been very satisfied with our purchase and using it almost everyday.<br/><br/>We had compared the picture quality to a couple of high end Optoma projectors which had higher brightness (lumens) and allowed daylight viewing but were bulky, noisy and also needed to be positioned close to the center of the projected screen as their keystone capabilities were very basic (not as versatile as 4 point keystone). The other thing EpiqVision mini has which is not available on any projector at this price range is its medium throw capability. This allows the projected image to be around 150-180 inches from 10-12ft away and that made the Optoma's projected screen look comparatively small. Epiqvision mini also has additional zoom capability that allows you to further increase the screen size and fits the description of home theater better than others. There are 5 preset picture options.  Dynamic has the most brightness, Bright Cinema is which we use more often for evening and nighttime viewing. Other options include Vivid, Cinema and standard (I think).<br/><br/>This projector only has 1 HDMI, we are using chromecast with google TV so there isn't anything that we feel needs connected other than this. Similar devices such as roku would also work fine. We have been using netflix, prime, pluto tv, youtube, peacock etc. This projector is not as bright as the optoma 4000 lumens one but it is bright enough and works quite well with curtains pulled down during daytime and with dynamic picture setup. It also has a normal audio output jack that can be used with any speaker setup. There is also a notion of having to buy a white screen for projection. Although I purchased a screen, I am directly projecting onto our wall that is ivory in color. There is a color balancing that can be used to adjust the color based on screen/wall color. I would suggest trying that first before purchasing an additional screen because that seriously obstructs the range of throw of this equipment in my opinion.<br/><br/>One last thing. Saw someone complaining about the mount plate so was a bit skeptical. I ordered one from audio general website although they were out of stock but received it in 2 weeks. We are using the mount and a tripod to set the projector off center, next to our nightstand and the 4 point keystone works great. Very happy with the purchase and have been living the dream of a home theater experience to the fullest.</span>

<span>Its been 6+ months with this and I am very happy with my purchase so far.<br/>Pros:<br/>Small, lightweight,easy to hookup in ceiling<br/>Great picture quality. I project it directly to wall (as i dont want to reduce the projextion size) at about 120+ inch image size and it looks spectacular. No complaints.<br/>Works perfectly ok with lights on. You can easily watch. However, lights off blows you away.<br/><br/>Cons;<br/>Less connections, single Hdmi<br/>Contrast may have been slightly better.</span>

<span>Love the color, the image, the easy set up. Only had it for a week but so far so good. Hopefully it is as durable as is colorful. The only gripe I have is with the remote control. it doesn't have a way to select the Bluetooth device to connect to external speaker. It could not be done from the unit itself either. Not sure how to do that. Area of future improvement: 1. attach a handle to the unit for easier carrying. 2. provide carrying case for portability 3. have a manual 1.7 magnification adjustment knob to zoom in/out 4. built-in microphone on the remote control to do voice command instead of blutooth connect to an external google or amazon speaker/mic device 5. increase lumen to 2000 instead of 1000. 6. bult in battery to make this truly portable that could operate this device for 4 hours. I would pay $300 more for all these improvements. For now I 'm happy about this unit's picture quality and hope for a version 2 of this great projector.</span>

<span>Originally I rated this a 3 star projector. But, the execution here is truly phenomenal. The complete package comes in at one extra star. And, I've updated my prior review. After even more testing I found that the black levels are... acceptable.  It has good traits. It has bad traits. The good do outweigh the bad.<br/><br/>In short: if you intend to replace a TV with this projector, then by all means pick it up. I was sporting a 10ft screen (120" diagonal) and at first glance, with some ambient light, I was very impressed. The color is truly excellent, as others have noted. It is so excellent it shines in bright ambient light, catching the eye and filling in the image. The color is what makes this LED projector shine (pun intended). It is lovely.<br/><br/>The problems begin when you lower the lights for a bit more clarity because... well, there isn't any. The exact same image you saw with ambient light? That's nearly what you are getting when the lights are low. There isn't any extra dark hiding in the shadows. It's going to be good color and only acceptable dark forever.<br/><br/>In its favor this projector sports 30,000 hours of lamp life. This is near-TV levels of lifespan for the light source, normally the trouble area for projectors. It touts being rainbow-effect free, though I oddly thought I caught some here or there. Did I mention it has magnificent color? It has LG's WebOS built in and can capably stream many, many wonderful apps in full 4k (not Disney+ or Hulu at this time). It is light. It is svelt. It has the back-lit magic remote.<br/><br/>But, it has poor, poor black levels, requiring you to wash out the picture to bring them up in HDR (far better performance in SDR). It has decent, but not great, input lag for gaming (40+ ms for 4k, 50+ ms in SD). It isn't the greatest optically (mine had minor focus uniformity issues). It isn't truly all that bright, despite the incredible color brightness. Strangely, that will affect you more in the dark, it seemed to me, than in the daylight. Also, the brightness is more an issue with the desired size of my screen (120"). At a smaller size the brightness may be far more tolerable.<br/><br/>Like I said, it has good and bad traits. This projector is good. I preach the black levels, especially with HDR content. But, it is by no means the worst projector I have ever used.<br/><br/>4 stars,</span>

<span>I have been using a pico projector for three (3) years and it finally took a dirt nap, on the eve of receiving my next replacement. My setup was perfect; a middle of the road tripod for support, Bluetooth speaker (JBL Charge) with transmitter for sound, 26100 power bank (anker) for power, and an iCODIS G1 Mobile Pico Projector for image. I could watch video on a remote island for up to 10 hours without a household power supply.<br/><br/>After the lose of my current pico projector I decided to find a temporary replacement while I wait for my Phillips PicoMax to be build and shipped I stumbled upon this Kodak Luma 150. The Luma 150 had all the makings to be a great upgrade to my previous G1, which lacked some features but was a solid unit for the last three (3) years. I was excited to see that this unit would charge via micro USB as my G1 did, big plus to extend the viewing time, offer wireless connection for my laptop and phone, an HDMI input, and USB &amp; microSD.  I was even more excited to see keystone correction, even if it was just vertical only, step up from the G1. It did lose points for not having a remote, but I figured this was temporary and it was not greatly needed, although it would make navigating the SD card easier.<br/>Now that I have received my unit and had a chance to get hand on with it I have some insight to help any potential purchaser and am open to information to change my experience. The unit is of solid construction and great portable size. I will highlight my positives and then address my negatives.<br/>The Good<br/>The focus wheel; smooth yet firm to ensure the focus remains where you want it and able to adjust in fine increments. The touch buttons; good reaction time, although you must push the center button to activate the controls. Tripod mount; perfectly located in the center. Image quality; good brightness (best in low light rooms), good picture quality (note the native resolution is 480). USB/MicroSD; Works great supports my video library (avi), however only supports FAT32 (32 GB or less)<br/>The Bad<br/>Vertical keystone correction; missing, this feature does not appear to be installed on the unit I received, however when you go to the Kodak website for this product this feature is not highlighted. I contacted Kodak support and I was told it should happen automatically within seconds, however, they could not tell me what the angle correction was for this unit, leading me to believe this is not available in the Luma 150. Menu; When you start the unit you are greeted with a menu offering your inputs, wireless, video, image, and HDMI. This unit lacks a settings menu, for video (brightness, contrast, etc), Audio (stereo, level adjustment, etc), and other features. Volume control; (minor peeve) the volume is on a scale from 0 to 100, which is great however it increases in increments of 10 giving you 10 levels of volume only. I suppose this is adequate but why not just have the scale from 0 to 10, only makes sense. Speaker; (unimportant in my opinion but reviewing it still) the on board speaker is barely loud enough (at 80) or it is crackly (at 90+). I ma not sure why pico projector manufactures even bother with a speaker, it wastes space and only works if you holding it next to your ear. I have found a Bluetooth speaker with transmitter or one that plugs in work the best and is needed. HDMI; (this possibly was only my experience) I usually us my Roku with my pico projector and when I connected it to the Luma 150 my Roku stick it did not display an image and heated up beyond safe ranges. Then I attempted to connect my DVD player this time no audio (likely a incompatible codex between each device).<br/><br/>In conclusion, I will be returning this device and wait out the three to four weeks until I received my PicoMax without a pocket projector. This unit has a good purpose and someone other than my-self may be in need of this purpose, But Buyer beware that the advertising of Auto Vertical Keystone correction is false.</span>

<span>I may be easily impressed because I made a big jump up from a $100 projector to this. That said, the picture quality is fantastic. The keyframe adjustment is digital so itdoes not reduce the quality, which was an issue on my last projector. The brightness auto-adjusts so we turn the light on so the picture is still clear. I repeat, this can be used with the lights on. Audio is great. If you want a full movie quality experience with perfect sound balance, definitely hook it up to some high quality speakers, but the projector speaker alone is good, loud enough to be heard throughout a 1400sqft house with the doors all open (which I don't need it to do).<br/>Very worth it. Had it for only a month so I can't speak to the lasting power, but the warranty seems good and the fact that replacement bulbs are available is a plus.</span>

<span>Picture Quality 10-10<br/><br/>The picture is great, very good colors and the blacks are very good too. The image is pixelated when sitting up close so the text is not anywhere as clear as a 4K, you will see a difference. 1080P is not bad, but a 4K resolution is far superior. I use a 106” screen and I sit about 8 feet and the image fills up the entire screen only at 5ft which is awesome! Compared to the Optoma UHD50X the Ht2150ST blacks are way better but the difference between 1080P and 4K is clear if you sit close to a huge screen. The input lag is low for this projector and for 1st person shooters its great but not anywhere as close to a 120hz monitor however so dont expect to be as good as your monitor will perform, also gaming on a huge screen on FPS shooters is hard because of the size of the screen.<br/><br/>Build Quality 9-10<br/><br/>The build quality is very good! Compared to Optoma projectors including the HT143X/243X/UHD50X all look very similar but they are nothing special and look quiet cheap. This Benq model just looks great.<br/><br/>Packaging 10-10<br/><br/>Benq packaging is very good quality, foam, projector wrapped in its own carrying case definitely better than the competition.<br/><br/>Noise 10-10<br/><br/>The noise on this projector is barely noticeable. Benq Ht2150ST was very humble and quiet during all operations compared to the Optoma UHD50X which was much louder and was one of the main reasons I disliked the Optoma.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>This is a great 1080P gaming projector with dark blacks, quiet operations, quality build, quality packaging and an overall better value compared to an Optoma UHD50X for $1,500. However 4K blows 1080P image out of the water when you sit close to the screen but when you are further away than 10 ft the clarity becomes less distinguishable between 4K and 1080P.</span>

<span> I have had this projector for 2 weeks now and I have to write about this again. BenQ TH671ST DELIVERS!! I have used this outside multiple occasions and most recently, tried it in my sun room in very poor (bright/daytime) conditions. This projector is so bright, you don't have to wait until the night is completely dark. My family and I have been watching at time of sunset (about 30 minutes prior to dusk) and wow!!! Amazing. pics and vids I have uploaded really doesn't do it justice. Much better in person!! After this past Friday's movie night outside, we got ate up by mosquitoes. So until we figure out a better solution (i.e getting some good repellent) we decided to take it indoors. We don't have a place to put our Camp Chef OS144 screen in the house, however, our sun room made a perfect place. Using the latches of the Camp Chef screen, we were able to hang it up on the curtain rods! Yes, I could have made the screen a bit tighter, but I',m not that picky. If this was a permanent place for the screen, I would have set it up the right way. As you can see in some of the pics and videos, there was much light during the day. However, BenQ TH671ST took it as a challenge and it kicked ass. However, we were able to make it much darker later on by simply closing the blinds and we ended up putting a dark bed sheet over the door to block out the sun on the side of the screen. It worked great. We were also able to simply place the projector directly on the floor in the sunr oom! Worked flawlessly! I could have perfected the projector so that it matches up directly with the screen, however I just wanted to start watching and not mess with it, haha. Outside, we used the EcoBoulder speaker. Inside, we simply connected the Bose Soundlink speaker! Great sound for indoors!! Simply love our set up outside and we now have a place in our sun room for inclement weather!!<br/><br/>Next time, I can't wait to try rear projection outdoors!!!</span>

<span>I got this to try out projectors and make sure they'd work for me (replacing my TV in living room) before deciding which one I actually want (an Epson LS300) and for the price this seems perfectly fine.<br/><br/>Projecting it into a pull-down EliteScreen, 84". During the day (no direct sunlight but a good amount of ambient light from windows) it's just alright - low contrast but watchable, picture quality (as far as colors, contrast) is acceptable, not particularly good.<br/><br/>At night with no ambient light, it's good! Not incredible or impressive, but no complaints. If I was on an under-$1000 budget &amp; had an always-dark room for this I'd be happy with it.<br/><br/>The UI for the menus and everything is very outdated feeling, and the perspective doesn't correct so if you use keystone (perspective) correction on the picture, the menus will be skewed.<br/><br/>Built-in sound is fine, recommend using an HDMI switcher with optical out to connect real speakers and to connect more than 2 input things.<br/><br/>Edit: Updating this after thinking more about it/using my LS300 to a 3-stars (considering the price) - even with the focus adjustment I could never get this to focus the entire view at once, the upper 1/3 was always blurry, &amp; the image quality (not the projection quality but the colors and contrast) is really bad, impossible to adjust to look good</span>

<span>Upgraded from my 3-yrs-old optoma HD27e, I don't regret to buy it. The 4k picture density is unbeatable in a 100" screen when compare to normal 1080p projector.<br/><br/>It's brighter than HD27e. So in bright mode it is a little bit too bright for movie and the fan noise is quite obvious (but just like hd27e, it is still acceptable). When playing movie, it is good to turn the brightness mode to dynamic. The contrast would be enhanced. In this mode, the projector become very quiet. Since I don’t need to adjust the keystone correction, the enhanced gaming mode is perfect for me. It provides real 4k gaming with very low input lag. Comparing the input lag of my dell s2721dgf gaming monitor, I don't feel any different. No downsampling this time, the 4k picture quality remain the same under this mode. It's the real deal for me since I'm looking for a 4K projector which is good in response time so that i can enjoy both, watching 4k movie and playing game.<br/><br/>The HDR quality is quite acceptable within projector compatibility. According to my research, I think optoma has made some adjustment in HDR remapping so it is better than previous models. The only drawback is that it has some wired bug to set it in non-HDR mode with google Chromecast. If I turn the “Match content dynamic range” off in chromecast, the color wash out. So I need to keep this function on to avoid the bug . That means I can’t turn off HDR content in chromecast.<br/><br/>Overall, I’m very satisfy with this purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Amazing 4K picture quality<br/>Sharp focus<br/>Enhanced game mode improves input lag quite obviously<br/>Enhanced game mode can output real 4k@60hz, no downsampling.<br/>Dynamic eco mode is useful to enhance contrast and lamp life.<br/>HDR quality is quite acceptable.<br/>The projector size is small and light weight.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Enhanced game mode don’t allow keystone adjustment<br/>Some wired bug in non-HDR mode with google Chromecast. (fixed)<br/>No Len shift. Only digital.<br/>Some bug in remote control when HDR is on.<br/>No ARC/eARC<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Updated May 3, 2021: Chromecast is updated the firmware and the bug is fixed. Once you’ve installed the new software,  you’ll be able to dig a little deeper into video settings than was previously possible. In the new “advanced video controls” area of settings, you’re now given the ability to choose your preferred dynamic range format. You can always stay in SDR mode now.</span>

<span>This is my 2nd Optoma Projector. The projector itself is fantastic. I was however very disappointed in Optoma’s tech support. I was having a problem with the picture pixelating and cutting out. I called Optoma tech support and was forwarded to a waiting line where a recording told me how important my call was. Every 20 seconds or so it gave me the option of staying on the line or leaving a message. After 30 minutes I gave in and left a message with the re-assurance that they would get back to me ASAP. They never did! Fortunately I was able to figure out that the problem was with the HDR setting on my amplifier. I’m not sure everyone will be able to figure this out, so if you buy just be aware it is a great projector but tech support is terrible.</span>

<span>To provide a reference point, i upgraded to this projector after owning an Optoma HD26, a 1080P projector for several years. While pleased with the HD26, i wanted more image clarity, more lumens, darker blacks and brighter colors; As movies like the dark knight, with so many dark scenes were almost unwatchable on the HD26. I use my projector for about 6 hours+ daily, it is ceiling mounted in the living room, and  is the sole living room viewing option. The HD26 was a workhorse, i replaced at least 6 bulbs and 2 color wheels throughout its 6 year run. If i hadnt dropped it on the floor from ceiling height while uninstalling it, it would still be working great. The optoma UHD35 mounted up to the same bracket i had installed for the HD26, with a different mounting plate. I get the exact same screen size that i enjoyed with the HD26 with no changes to the mounting bracket location. The throw is perfect for my scenario. Once i turned on the projector, i was floored! The image quality, even at 1080p is instantly recognizable, it is superb. All images are crisp and detailed. The color range is astounding, this projector produces VIBRANT colors. At 4k it  is definitely impressive, offering more detail, more color and a more detailed image. I compared this projector to the uhd38 uhd50 and ben qs entry level projector, i found this to be the best entry/buget level projector for sheer value:<br/> 3600 lumens, 4k, and a bulb rated at 15,000 hours in eco mode are a few of the key specs which helped influence my decision. I dont feel that this projector is a budget projector at all, while it is one of the more affordable options, it is a very capable projector with plenty of wow factor built right in.</span>

<span>So I planned to have this sitting slightly to the left or right of the screen, and use keystone to correct the angles. Do not make my mistake - do not try to do it with this projector.<br/>The UX for correcting picture is awesome and it’s very easy to do, however distortion is the price you will pay. And you’ll pay dearly. Using this with 100” screen even a couple % of correction make me want to barf.<br/>On the bright side: it is very bright and responsive. I ended up actually decreasing the brightness for regular evening viewing.<br/>This thing is virtually noiseless(sitting right next to it) but produces quite a bit of heat.<br/>All and all - awesome piece of equipment, but be sure to plan your installation front and center of the screen in a well -ventilated area.</span>
