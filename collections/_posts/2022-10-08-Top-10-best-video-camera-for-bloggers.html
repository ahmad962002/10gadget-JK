If you're a blogger, you know that quality content is key. And what better way to produce quality content than with a high-quality video camera? When it comes to finding the best video camera for bloggers, there are a few things to consider.

First, think about your budget. Cameras can range in price from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. Decide what you can afford and then start narrowing down your options from there.

Next, think about the features you need. Do you need a camera that can shoot in high-definition? What type of lens do you need? Do you need a camera that can shoot photos as well as videos?

Once you've determined what you need, start researching the best cameras that fit your budget and needs. There are a ton of great cameras out there, and the right one for you is waiting to be discovered.<table>

<span>Let me start out by saying that I've used dozens of cameras over the past few years as a bit of a gear head.  I've had full frame DSLRs, full frame mirrorless, APS-C options, micro 4/3's, etc.  Most recently I had the Fuji X100V.  Having a growing family I realized that while I love taking pictures of my kids growing up, what really captures the interest of everyone is capturing videos.  I could take 1,000 pictures from a family trip and the things that the family will want to see is the video, not the pictures.  For this I realized that having a more compelling video option was needed.  In addition having a 7 year old girl, she's starting to want to make her own videos, which I post to her private YT channel.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Having a compact option with a decently fast lens.  The lens could be wider, it could be longer.  There's a lot of could haves.  Why not ask for a 12-500 mm lens?  For what it is, it's a good compromise, has a decent enough range and fast lens, which is needed for a 1" sensor.  The 24-200 would've been too slow to shoot indoors without an external light.<br/>- The front flip screen.  It makes talking head videos easier to shoot, putting it on a tripod and still having a hot/cold shoe for an external mic or a light source is fantastic.<br/>- Button layout.  Having a record button, having a tally light are great.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- I would've loved to see a better use of a touch screen interface.  Canon has it right for the most part, Sony could be much better.<br/>- I would've loved to have a mode dial and/or more front dials.  But given a choice between what we have in the ZV-1 or a larger body/more expensive model, I'm ok with what we have.<br/><br/>Things to note<br/>No, the stabilization is not the best.  On standard it's not great.  On active it's better but crops in.  This is why I say for certain types of vlogging, like on a tripod or talking head video it's fine.  If you're expecting to walk around and talk to yourself, you'll want to invest in a gimbal.  No, the battery isn't the best.  Luckily they're tiny and you can find plenty of generic options.  No, you don't get a charger in the box.  Most cameras these days are not shipping with one.  No you won't get the ultra thin depth of field from this, it's a 1" sensor, there are limitations.<br/><br/>For the price, the size, the features, it's the best option that I've found at the present time.  It's not perfect, but any camera enthusiast will tell you that there isn't.  It's about weighing the positives and the negatives and find the one with the most plusses and the least amount of negatives for your needs.  Think about it, if the perfect camera existed, you'd have no compelling reason to upgrade to the next model, so in a way you have to think that manufacturers intentionally withhold a little here and a little there.</span>

<span>I was excited to have received the ZV-1 Sony Vlog Camera. I saved the first use for the day I went hiking on a trail. This is my experience: Setup was extremely easy after charging the camera up! Battery and sd card goes in the same access port. Wind screen and the bluetooth remote tripod can easily attach to camera.<br/><br/>The bluetooth remote tripod accessory is worth praising in itself. Easy to maneuver, you can swivel it a full 360° and tilt it forward and backwards to a max 90° which is more than enough. Using the tripod, you can zoom in/out, record and take a photo. Conveniently enough, it has a provided lock function to prevent accidental touch. When attached to the ZV-1, with a grip weight of 7.6 oz., you don't feel the stress on your hand and arms even after carrying it for 2 hours during my hike.<br/><br/>There are some great functions to the ZV-1 that one looks for in their vlogging experience. You have the LCD screen which allows you to see what you are recording which I can tell you is necessary. Another feature I find necessary is the soft screen effect. Especially since you're filming in 4K mode, you have to look good for the camera. My skin isn't perfect and this feature helps me not shy away from placing the camera too close to my face. Oh; and speaking of "close", we need to talk about the "Product Showcase" aspect of the ZV-1. This means the ability to focus on what the camera owner is trying to show its viewers. It is superb in this camera as it quickly focuses on the item I place closest to the lens in front of me. I tested this in the outdoors where there are many distractions in the background and it performed really well. This function will work great in product reviews. There are a lot of other functions, modes and setting one can adjust for their preference but as someone who has been mostly using a phone, it can be a bit complicated to understand. Luckily, it has an auto-intelligence mode that will adjust the picture/recording settings for you so you don't have to fret. I will learn to understand the technicalities as I go on.<br/><br/>Another note to takeaway from my experience is about the battery life. After a full charge and being periodically used for picture taking and recording during my 2-3 hours I spent outdoors, the battery was already drained. I recommend having backup batteries for that matter. While my phone can do many things the ZV-1 can, there's also things only the ZV-1 can do. I'll be switching to the ZV-1 for my vlogging needs!</span>

<span>Could someone help me figure out how to upload a video to my laptop that is longer than 6minutes and 50 seconds long. I have a 12 minute video that will play on the camcorder but will not fully download on to my laptop. It plays fine up until 6:50 and then there is nothing.</span>

<span>First there was fast shipping from Amazon, this time, every time.  A strong, neat box held my new camcorder which I was so<br/>eager to try out. Contents were 2 batteries, a multipurpose usb/AV/Charger cable, a nifty padded bag w/belt loop, and a usb wall power device, and of course-a manual. I popped open the rectangular door underneath the camera and inserted a 32g SD card with the contacts facing the short end and clicked it in. Then I unwrapped a battery, pulled back the small spring loaded lock latch and with the arrow pointing up on the battery, I leveled it and slid it about an eighth of an inch and let go of the latch. Now, I hit the power button, went to the menu utility and formatted the SD card. After this, you are ready to read the functions in the manual and set up a couple of parameters such as still picture resolution and movie size. I chose 5 mp for still shots and chose the middle setting for AVI movies. I tried everything out for pictures and movies and it all worked well. If you slide your finger to the right of the menu button and push that button, you will be able to review your shots. There is also a menu setting for holding a snapshot-set this on the max of 3 seconds to glimpse your pictures before they disappear from sight. Well now, all was going along fine until I tried to connect to my computer. My computer was not installing this device correctly. So, after reading about why USB devices might not install correctly, I also asked a question about this procedure on Amazon's product page. The seller responded lightning fast with the correct procedure to install the camera's driver. It worked and I was able to see the camera as a drive and view files. And while you are connected to your computer, the battery is also charging. This battery is lithium and it hangs in there for the long haul! If I can add pics and movies later, I might do so, but you will see some movies that others have posted. My advice is to use that strap so you don't drop the camera. For still shots, you have many resolution choices. You will find one you like, and with a 32g SD card, you can shoot a heck of a lot! I got this unit at the right time because my hummingbirds will be here within 3 weeks.  I get 2 to 3 dozen a year, and yes they drive me crazy. They empty 4 12 oz. feeders 2 times a day. I already know that I will<br/>get great pics and movies with this camera. I really don't know how you could ask for more for the money. Happy shooting!</span>

<span>Good for beginners or those who like the vintage-y feel. Should come with two battery packs and a cord in case you want to connect the camera to a TV. My order was initially shipped without the batteries and wires, but customer service made the process super easy! Thanks Tenise!</span>

<span>We are pleased with this camcorder and it's a good value for the money, especially a Sony (although it was still made in China).  I purchased extra batteries and a 32GB SD card to complete the package.  The "feel" of the camera is not upscale like most Sony products.  Aside from that, I have no complaints.  We got tired of taking lower quality family videos on smart phones and the ZOOM feature with a REAL camera lens is worth the money.  It's not a pixelated zoom like those found on phones.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Preface: I've had the camera for about 2 months now and I must say it's packed with a lot of robust and versatile features though the image quality is just okay. Let's be real, it's a small chip camera so it's naturally bad in low light and fairly grainy on cloudy days. Try to keep the gain as close to zero as possible as anything above 6dB is almost unusable, so noise correction software like Neat Video will be a must with this camera and is something to consider if new to your work flow. I already had Neat Video plugins for Sony Vegas which I have been using with my Sony AX100 for quite some time and it works well at cleaning grainy footage from the X1500 too. The Sony AX100 and 700 are very comparable to this camera, so I will be using that in my review. I am also amused by the negative reviews that complain about the manual and customer service...it's 2020 folks, learn how to Google for the full manual which is very detailed, helpful, and available on Panasonic's website.<br/><br/>Value: Buy used. This product is $1699 new, which is close to $500 less than the Sony AX100 released in 2014 when adjusted for inflation. It's clear by the reviews that a lot of people haven't taken the time to learn this camera and immediately returned it, so there are quite a few good new cameras showing up already on the used market, and quite frankly I'm jealous I did not wait to purchase one used to save a few hundred bucks.<br/><br/>Target audience: Not sure who Panasonic had in mind, but I'd say this camera is best used as a B cam for a news crew; for wildlife and bird watchers because of the long zoom, and general hobby level or semi-pro videographers (me) who want a compact run-and-gun rig and aren't always doing commercial work. That is not to say you can't get film quality shots from this camera if you know what you are doing, but I would recommended it for general ENG or documentary scenarios where you just need to get the picture and move on. I don't consider the reviews of live-streamers of any relevance to people who actually take these cameras out into the field.<br/><br/>Pro features: First off, finally getting Panasonic's robust scene file management and user buttons in a compact prosumer camera is outstanding. And compact and lightweight it is! Programmable user buttons are a must (take note Sony) and really allow customization and ease of use. User 1, 2 and OIS (3) and 5 are conveniently located and I've provided an image for my settings. I changed AE (4) to Zebra as I don't use any auto settings. User 6-12 are in the menu only and I don't find this useful, but it's there if need be. As far as Scene File, I find CINE D with KNEE mode at MID to be most useful, adjust detail and chroma as needed for your grading output.<br/>4K-60p and 10 bit H.265. Finally! 4K-60p on a prosumer build that Sony has neglected for years. I film a lot of trains, sometimes high speed Amtrak trains and high shutter / frame rate combos are a MUST. Finally some good news for budget action shooters.<br/>Oh the ZOOM range, obviously another gain of small chip sensors giving you up to 600mm (35mm equivalent) of zoom. It's a bit excessive though, unless you're a birdwatcher zooming into a tree, most of your daylight shots in practice will be marred by heat distortion, so I think a 1" sensor with less zoom range would have suited a lot more people.<br/>Let's not forget that there's a full color correction menu that allows you to dial the camera in to almost any setting to make the image look like another camera. Watch Barry Green's tutorial on this, though I suspect most people will leave this untouched.<br/>The LCD monitor is bright and adjusting to 2 is good for outdoors. It may take awhile to get used to what the image looks like on the LCD versus what the camera is really capturing, I recommend setting Zebra to 90 and KNEE to MID to avoid unnecessary over-exposure and testing this a few times over before taking it on a day of shooting.<br/>The dial knob to set gain and shutter speed is similar to the Sony AX100 and fairly straight forward, though I haven't found a way to turn off the ICON which is annoying since I only want to adjust gain and shutter and WB. Having another ring is useful and I programmed one for IRIS which took this out of the dial knob thus making it quicker and easier to use.<br/>The variable zoom speed seems good, but you need to enable fast zoom separately which is bizarre, I made User 5 this setting. I use the Magnus VC-20-SCP LANC controller and so far so good (albeit it only works when set to Sony, how about that?)<br/>The full manual available online as a PDF is very detailed, and unlike a physical manual, you can use control F to quickly find what you need.<br/>Gain settings can be adjusted by 1dB at a time, unlike the Sony which jumps 3dB at a time.<br/>Rolling shutter effect is not noticeable, which is another benefit of small sensor size that are capable of faster vertical scans. I've shot a few wide shots of 110 MPH Amtrak trains and could barely tell any distortion. The Sony AX100 is awful with rolling shutter, but that's a sacrifice with larger sensors.<br/>Focus settings are robust, auto focus seems surprisingly good for Panasonic. I am still experimenting with this, but the area / touch screen focus is really cool. If you set an area focus, you can also lock it into manual mode so if you pan across an object it won't refocus; however, in scenarios where you want it to change focus leave that on auto and if the area is panned onto an object closer or further away it should adjust without touching the screen, though it isn't always responsive. Again, play around with it.<br/>Lens hood design is really handy with the switch to flip it open. I like this a lot better than a cap that you can easily drop and lose. Of course, it comes off if need be.<br/><br/>Cons: Small chip sensor is bad in low light, obviously. I found that using any other scene file than the CINE settings showed grain or weird discolorations/artifacts even in the dark areas on sunny days. You will need to spend a lot of time dialing in the camera for your needs, but it's highly customizable and I assure you if you take the time the settings are there, I too was very frustrated at first. They really over-hyped the performance of this camera, but compared to older sensors this size, it is a major improvement.<br/>The fast zoom doesn't stay enabled when you turn off the camera and turn it back on. Seriously? Fix that in a firmware update please.<br/>There is an LCD level and frame size indicator, but no grid lines like in the Sony AX100 for quickly framing rule of thirds, I hope they add this too.<br/>No 1/50 or 1/90 shutter speed, which I found very useful on the Sony AX100.<br/>Grainy above 3dB gain, as well as no negative gain. Negative gain to -3dB would be very helpful when trying to get shots of high depth of field when opening the aperture wide.<br/>Depth of field. Well it's okay but you really need to zoom in to get any decent bokah, that's the other downside to small chip. But at least your wide angle shots will look in focus!<br/>Audio quality through 1/8" jack is BAD and UNUSABLE. I plugged in a RODE Stereo Videomic X directly to the camera and no matter what gain settings I used on the mic with the camera gain at -30dB the grainy noise of the audio was unusable. Same thing happened when used through the XLR inputs on the detachable handle, which I immediately return and renders it useless. I am now recording into a Tascam DR70D with no issues. An extra $200-300 budget for an external audio recorder is a must with this camera. Perhaps I got a bad unit, but don't take the chance. The audio quality of the on board mic is actually very good which is highly unusual, though these are hard to shield against wind and other noises, but I've found some instances where it was worth mixing into some of my tracks since I have a huge custom windshield on my Rode mic that sacrifices some quality and range at the ability to cancel out up to 30 MPH wind gusts.<br/>4K images are very soft compared to Sony. To be honest, the quality seems like 2K or upscaled HD, but it's better than any HD images out of the Sony AX100. I'm getting used to it. It by no means is bad but for such a high bitrate you'd assume the detail would be greater. Perhaps it was engineered a little softer to not reveal just how grainy this camera is in low light. People complain about blurry spots when in wide though I haven't noticed this ruining any shots, it seems if you manually set the iris and close it a little more this reduces or goes away entirely.<br/>Image stabilization. I put this is a con because it's a two-way street. The handheld image stabilization is pretty good even at zoom. I don't have a gimbal, but I suspect that combo would be very robust. As far as on a tripod, it's not that great with or without OIS on. I wouldn't use OIS on a tripod unless getting a static shoot at zoom, but, it seems as though cameras are being designed more for handheld use (WHY?) rather than on a tripod like they should be. I don't know enough about image sensor and stabilization design, but over the years cameras like these on tripods are a lot more prone to vibrations and little bumps and jar the image thus losing a lot of professional quality, which is probably due to how the sensors now "float" in the camera. Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise as maybe I should just ditch the tripod and get a gimbal, but I cannot fathom why a camera at this price point, on an ash wood tripod designed for vibration dampening no less, picks up distortion so easily.<br/>H.265 is a gift an a curse, at least for now. Not really a con of the camera, but keep in mind these files are huge and you will need to budget in plenty of hard drive space for primary and back up storage, especially when most editing software currently cannot smoothly play back H.265 (even with high end computers) and you will need to spend time making proxies into H.264 which I do with the free version of Davinci Resolve. This is something to keep in mind as part of added workflow, but the benefit of the archival quality of H.265 is great. It's just like 2006 all over again when we struggled to play back HD, lol.<br/><br/>Conclusion / TL;DR: In my opinion this is NOT a camera to be used on auto with out of the box settings, I wish camera companies would stop trying to push that. Learn manual folks, or don't film at all. If you never used a camera similar to this and are upgrading from a small home video camcorder, it will take you a LONG time to learn, longer than the 30 day return period, but it's worth it. Two months in and I am still dialing in settings and learning new things and that's after coming from a similar camera like the Sony AX100, it gets better as it goes, trust me. Price point is good, but I never thought I would be buying small chip in 2020. Despite some decent pros of this, I think Panasonic would have satisfied a broader customer base by making this a little brother to the CX-350 and packing a 1" sensor into the design for better low light and DoF performance, and don't say it can't be done because this camera is basically the same size as the Sony AX100. This camera feels like a 2015 design that got delayed until 2020, but the user interface and customization to almost any application is there. Panasonic clearly thought about a wide range of users and engineered the UI of the camera well, but what good is all that if the image quality isn't quite there? Now, it does come down to picking the right tool for the job, so I hope these points I outlined help with that decision. Overall, a solid 3.5 or 4 star camera, though I might grow to like it more. Lost a star for sure for the unusable 1/8" audio jack (see above), so you will need to budget an external audio recorder. The camera as a whole really needs a firmware update though, but as is I would still recommend (save money and buy used if you can!).</span>

<span>The image stabilization works great.  Yet, I put it on handheld as a way to practice how to take steady video and another way around it is using a gimbal.  Stabilization works very well and I don't notice a reduction in image quality.<br/>One thing that was recommended from Panasonic that I don't think many people are aware is to get a memory card with minimum v60 and v90 max with 300/400 mbps write speed.  To take advantage of this camera.  Lowlight performance suffers somewhat if you don't have much light in the area you're at.  If it's fairly lit, it's decent enough as long as you're not expecting outrageous amount of low light like some DSLRs are able to produce.  After all, I do own a DSLR and could use it to record for night filming.  So why I chose a digital camcorder over my DSLR</span>

<span>The amount of time it took to receive this product was relatively staggering, but after receiving it I found that the product was up to my standards of satisfactory. The stage light that comes with it works great, the image looks good, and I have not been able to fully test the mic quality but from the 8 second test footage I took on my own showed that the mic worked very well. This product is wonderful if you're getting into stuff like YouTube or vlogging of some kind. Thanks for the awesome product!</span>

<span>Not what i expected but wow it is nice for the price. Use a different camera for photos but this one is youtube gold. Ended up returning it but would easily buy again for good if i wanted a second camera for just vlogging.</span>
