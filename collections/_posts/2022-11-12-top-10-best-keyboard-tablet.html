<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I was debating on getting a third party keyboard for my galaxy tab but decided that I didn't want the hassle of charging a detachable keyboard. There have been many reviews praising the galaxy tab and Samsung keyboard combo, so I gave it a try. I bought this keyboard used for a small fraction of the price and I'm happy with the results. It was used but pretty much like new. The only visible use was seen in the torn up packaging, but everything works fine. Not much to complain about a tablet keyboard, its keypresses are adequate but the track pad is not the most responsive which is a small annoyance. The keyboard is easy to detach which is both a blessing and a curse because it makes it easy to convert back to a regular tablet and easy to hold but it can come off easily when in use, which sucks. The best part about this keyboard case is the back cover. The metal hinge is strong and durable and gives you so many viewing angles that stay stable the whole time. The worst part about this is the lack of protection around the edges. I like to protect my tablet that costs a couple hundred dollars, and this doesn't act as a protection at all. I'm buying a slim tpu case to at least cover the edges and will alter it to leave the side connecting to the keyboard free. We'll see if that works, but as a standalone keyboard and back cover this item is pretty good and performs well.</span>

<span>Bought the keyboard about a month ago.<br/><br/>Works really well. No complaints. The keys are perfect and the special keys for the Tablet are a big help.<br/>The built in stand is great and folds open.<br/><br/>I was concerned that with this only being magnet, that is, being held by magnets, that the case would come off easy. So far it has not. Seems to work great.<br/><br/>As far as protection goes. I guess it depends on which way it falls. But it is sure a nicely designed case.<br/><br/>Also keeps the Spen in the proper position for charging!!!  Just open the S-pen slot and your pen is ready to go. Love that Larger S-pen. The Case was designed to hold it great.<br/><br/>Really, if you want to use your tablet like laptop, this is the one. Also I would guess it saves battery life, as it uses no Bluetooth.<br/><br/>Samsung products are expensive. I had to wait to purchase mine.  But the quality is always there!  Samsung is the "Apple" of the Android world. I prefer Android over Apple, but that is a personal choice.<br/><br/>The touch-pad is really cool, I was looking for keys for right or left click, it is built into the touch-pad!<br/>To get the full use of the touch-pad, I suggest you google Samsung on this one.  There are tips.<br/>Such as you basically just swipe the touch-pad, like you would the screen.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good keyboard and case. If you want to go cheap, I suppose the next best, is to buy a cheap case and buy a cheap bluetooth keyboard and a bluetooth mouse. I had to do that, until I could buy this one.<br/><br/>It is worth saving up for though, to get the Samsung Tab S7+ case.<br/><br/>Finally, everyone forgets about Samsung "Dex" feature. Make sure you understand what it is.  You swipe down from the top and turn on "Samsung Dex". Basically it mimics a Windows 10 experience. You can open multiple apps, like on Windows 10. You can tile them and many of the keyboard shortcuts work.<br/><br/>This is the feature that makes your tablet with the Keyboard, like a True Laptop. Looks to me, that the specs of the Samsung are just as powerful or more powerful than many laptops.<br/><br/>Samsung Dex, with the right HDMI adapter also lets you hook up the tablet to a full-sized screen .<br/><br/>But this is a review about the keyboard. So, try out the Dex mode. For those apps that will not open full screen, there is a setting called "Samsung Labs" experimental. Which works just great.<br/><br/>The only thing I had to do on some of them, is some apps do not want to rotate into landscape mode. But you can find apps to force that in the App store. Rotation control type apps.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think the keyboard works great. Has a great feel to it. Get used to it, and I think you can leave your heavy laptop at home.<br/><br/>With Word and Google Doc apps, I think the keyboard allows one to to do it all.<br/>But that is just me personally, I love the way it syncs with my Samsung S21 Ultra phone.<br/><br/>This is the keyboard you need if you want the full experience.</span>

<span>Now,i am giving this a 5-star rating. I made a mistake when i said you will you have to pay for the return. But not so. The return is free. I have tried that keyboard case with pad and that evenlights up. I have finally settled for this. This is directly connected to the tablet and very convenient. I returned the keyboard with pad because there are some issues with the bluetooth connection. If you need a keyboard for your Samsung tablet, this is it. No frills, no connection concerns. It just works.</span>

<span>I would not have purchased this new even at the discounted price.  This refurb/return keyboard was in near new condition shipped in a poly sleeve and tyvek packaging without instructions.  Even then it arrived in good shape and in very good condition.<br/><br/>The keyboard attached to my Samsung Galaxy Tab FE positively and once the pogo pins made contact, the typing experience was fairly decent.  There is the cutout in the back to magnetically attach the S pen for ready access.  There is also a cutout in the raised plastic spine for secure longer term storage. It'll  function decently in your lap but the single position is better suited for use on a tabletop.</span>

<span>The key board is lightweight (1/2 lbs),  it functions also as a protection for the iPad as well as a stand. I use it now all the time rather than the virtuell key board on the iPad. Even when I hang out on my recliner I use it, I set it on a pillow or the yoga cushion on my lap to get the angle right. On my desk the angle is fine. It turned my tablet into a desktop computer in miniature, which I really like. I rarely remove it now from the iPad, but this is very easy to do, it connects and disconnects with ease, magnetically/magicly.<br/>I feel that I hack with more effort on this keyboard than on my previous one (for my old Samsung tablet) because of the way the keys respond, a little less springy as I would like but I assume that is the price I pay for it’s smallness, which ich really like. (Also I do not write books or papers on it, but definitely longer letters.)<br/>I bought it from amazon warehouse as it was somewhat damaged /scuffed? (not that I can see), so the price was good. The smart functions I am still learning. I am not familiar with Mac computers, I assume that a person who has a Mac would be familiar with the short cuts and smart functions.<br/>I had to search the  internet to find out how to get the German umlauts etc. I like it pretty well and I am glad I got it, I would recommend it to a person who looks for an external key board for her iPad.</span>

<span>This keyboard does work &amp; fit well and it holds onto the iPad better than my previous keyboard. My only complaint is that the numbers are too close to the screen and my knuckle frequently touches the screen while typing causing annoying things to happen. They should have designed it with an extra inch of space up there. Also doesn’t have a back cover, which I needed to purchase separately. The back of the iPad is easy to scratch and needs a cover.</span>

<span>I haven't had this keyboard too long. It is a replica of one I replaced after 3 years of use. I really enjoy everything about this keyboard except it has already stopped working twice.  I've had to disconnect/reconnect it to my iPad at the most inopportune times!!! The reason I replaced my last one was because of the same issue-but these things are built only to last 2-3 years anyway. I put up with the first one's issues for at least 1 year before I replaced it.<br/>I truly hope it was a fluke. This should not have happened just months after purchase.<br/>That said, I did A LOT of research and this just simply was the one for me.</span>

<span>First thing out of the box, my tablet with a cover on it would not fit the slot in the keyboard, so I used it with the tablet off to one side. Other than that the keyboard is very good and connected easily to my Android tablet. While using it I found that adding a Bluetooth mouse is essential. Even with the mouse I had trouble navigating and frequently had to use the touch screen. The downloadable keyboard app might address these issues but I have not tried that. Ignore all the whiners. If you really need a keyboard for your devices this is a very good choice.</span>

<span>Updated 5/16/2016<br/><br/>I said I be back. I've had time to experiment with this keyboard and have become more impressed. It still keeps its 4 stars though. The lack of instructions really bothers me. There are so many features on the keyboard but no way to know them because they don't include a manual or they forgot mine. Luckiest I found a Logitech manual at Logitech.com. Believe me that helped a great deal. YouTube also offers a few demos. Secondly: do not turn off the keyboard. You'll be forced to reconnect to the Bluetooth each time. The batteries are said to last up to 2 years or 1 million keystrokes. I believe it as my wireless Logitech keyboard has been going now for more than 3 years on the same 2 AA  batteries. Thirdly: is there such a word ? You only have to depress the connection button until the blue light stops blinking.  So the only things I don't like is it's not backlight capability and it lays too flat making it pretty rough on the wrists. Other than that I'm in love with the keyboard and have no trouble giving it a great recommendation.<br/><br/>This is a very preliminary FIRST IMPRESSION review of the Bluetooth K480 by Logitech. I'll be back with a revised review after I get to know the keyboard and it's features.<br/><br/>It works!. I purchased the Logitech keyboard for one reason. I due to some medical problems find myself in rehab hospital quite often. I like to stay in contact with friends, write in my diaries, check and write E-mail and correspond by using a word program loaded on my iPad. I find the iPad much easier to use while in hospital as it's much more portable than my notebook due to size and weight not to mention the accessories. Using the built in iPad keyboard is fine for brief notes and E-mail but not for writing a long email or even an Amazon review. . I decided to break down and purchase the Apple keyboard for the new iPad Pro 9.7. The day I was going to the Apple site I thought I would check out pricing here at Amazon. I alway check the specials and on this day they were offering Logitech products in the Warehouse. Being a long time fan of Logitech I decided to look what was on sale. At the end of the list popped up the Bluetooth keyboard which caught my immediate attention. Bringing the description up and reading through the reviews and of course the pricing, under $25.00, Check the price. I found three different prices here at Amazon. From the $24.95 I paid to two different prices. One of the descriptions is for a refurbished keyboard so be careful.  I decided to go ahead and order this to see if I could save about $125.00. I figured Apple wouldn't starve if I went a different route. Now I have seen other companies offer keyboards for the iPad but nothing was being offered for the new iPad Pro that I could find and as a long time satisfied user of Logitech keyboards, mice and other products I felt relatively safe with the purchase. With Amazons return policy it even makes it a safer buy. The keyboard arrived actually a day early using Prime Shipping, there were other items ordered, which has only happened once before which was a surprise. The package is the standard Logitech white and ocean green retail box well sealed without all the plastic and was easy to open. I know that's not too important to most of the shoppers here but those with certain handicaps will be appeciative. It's simply protected by a plastic bag and cardboard raised platforms. There is the guarantee sheets and surprisingly no instructions. Looking closely the instructions are posted on the keyboard in very small print. '<br/>Logitech includes 2 AAA Duracell batteries installed which is a nice jester as who really uses AAA batteries. Enough about packaging.<br/><br/>The keyboard is heavy. Actually heavier than my wireless Logitech keyboard K350 which was a little disappointing. I'm sure to the iPad users this could be somewhat annoying. The great thing about iPads is they are so light. The keyboard is not a standard layout either. This should not be a problem as anyone using a notebook or ultra notebook knows it's almost impossible to put the full keyboard features found on regular desktop keyboards in a smaller configuration. It will take a little practice but indeed is very usable. My keyboard has all the functionality but just an a different layout. The letter keys and function keys are pretty standard. There are extra keys for different features. Some I'm still trying to understand and am sure I'll get to know them when I start using on a regular basis. As mentioned, Logitech included the batteries which like all Logitech products are placed in the bottom. I found the battery door easy to remove but had a horrible time replacing the door into its tracks and cutouts. Doesn't seem to align properly and took way too long to replace. Perhaps it is my unit and hopefully you'll have an easier time. The keyboard sits flat with no way to raise for easier viewing. Sitting straight up in a chair and the keyboard flat make you lean over and after awhile my neck and back started acting up. I think if the keyboard had a couple of adjustment legs it would have been a better design. There is a slot to place the iPad either vertically or horizontally. Once again there could have been a better design. The iPad can't be tilted back and sits straight. Wit the keyboard flat and the iPad straight it's for me impossible to use as is. There is definitely no way the iPad if in a case will fit the slot. This is another design flaw. I use a UAG case which has a built in tilting feature so it will not cause any problems. To solve the above mentioned problems I have propped the keyboard temporarily with a few posted notes pads and I'm using the built in tilt feature of my case to make it work a bit more comfortable. I found that the weight of the keyboard is actually benificial. It stays in place while typing. I have one wireless keyboard that I use that I have to chase all over the desk because of it being light weight and have to use a rubber backed place mat to keep it steady. You'll have no trouble with this keyboard shifting. The setup was simple. I went to the settings, clicked Bluetooth and while pressing the IOS key on the keyboard my iPad found and connected. No codes or anything. You do have to push the IOS key continually to connect I found. There is an on off switch on the bottom of the keyboard which if turned off after using requires Bluetooth connection again. A real nice feature is the multi connection knob. You can connect to 3 units at the same time. I had the old iPad the new iPad Pro and the iPhone all connected. By turning the control knob you connect to whatever unit you choose and it worked flawlessly. The keyboard is not back lit which I'm sure is because of the price point. Should cause no problems in a well lit room under normal use. I have a rechargeable and portable lamp by Boyon and purchased at Amazon which I'm sure will come in handy. The keys have a great feeling and react very well with light pressure. Even with my fat fingers I found the keys easygoing due to the good spacing. I've only tried the keyboard with messages and a brief test letter using Microsoft Word on the iPad and iPhone and both programs worked flawlessly. As stated I've just started exploring the keyboard but I'm quite excited. I'm sure the Apple keypad and the other more expensive boards when available will most likely be lighter and yes have better features but for the price of this keyboard I feel you can't go wrong. I'll be back after some further use with additional information.<br/><br/>The keyboard like all my purchases are at full Amazon retail. No free product or discount was offered for this review. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I reply to all reasonable and pertinent questions.</span>

<span>Update I paired my iPhone 8Plus the day I received this but haven't 'dialed back' to it since then, using my iPad Air instead. Just now I 'dialed' to my iPhone and it paired right up. I didn't have to do a thing but pair it that one time. I'm so happy with this keyboard! and it still types like a dream! YAAAY!<br/>---<br/><br/>I didn’t want this keyboard at first because it runs off regular batteries—I’m used to keyboards that are rechargeable. So I looked at this keyboard for quite a while before ordering it—So glad I took the chance to order it!<br/><br/>1. Logitech makes quality keyboards in comparison to many keyboards I’ve owned. And believe me, I have had quite a few of them, most of them clunkers. I had a superb Logitech that I unfortunately and regretfully gave to a friend when I received a more expensive, but not better I later found, keyboard from another company. I miss that Logitech so much!<br/><br/>2. This keyboard types like my laptop keyboard, and that’s a good thing as my old workhorse laptop types well. It’s a good sized keyboard; keys well-spaced. There is an actual delete key! Yay!  The keys themselves are large enough so that if you have big hands/fingers you will be happy about that; I have small hands and does well, too. Easy to see what’s what with the keys, function-wise.<br/><br/>3. Pairing was SUPER easy. I paired my iPad Air 2 first. Bluetooth connectivity was fast and simple. I then turned the dial and paired my iPhone 8Plus next—same thing, super easy and connected fast. I then dialed back and forth between the two without any problems at all. Awesome!<br/><br/>4. Even when you turn off the keyboard, it automatically pairs when you turn it back on and I’ve tested this over and over and zero problems.<br/><br/>5. NO KEY LAGGING OR SNAGGING OR STICKY KEYS OR DELAY! This is one of the more important concerns for me. The last keyboard I had lagged, had sticky keys, and dropped letters letters right out of the box. This one types like a dream and I am a super fast typer—really fast. I have had no missing letters, lagging behind, delays, sticky keys —nothing, just perfect typing.<br/><br/>6. I like the slot where you can put your tablet/smartphone and have easy access to them. Though if you put your older iPad vertically, the home button can be a little low.<br/><br/>7. This keyboard feels substantial. It doesn’t feel cheap.<br/><br/>8. Comes with the keyboard, 2 batteries included. There is not an instruction pamphlet but you won’t need it. If you look at two of my photos, there is a strip across at the top that shows you how to work/pair it—you can remove this strip once you do this.<br/><br/>9. If I had any ‘negatives,’ it would  be: The on/off button is on the bottom of the keyboard. Not a huge deal and not a deal-breaker, but if it were on the side, it would be more easily accessed without having to remove your device first, turn it over, and turn it on/off.  As I stated above, I wish it were rechargeable, but I will use rechargeable batteries. However, it not being rechargeable perhaps is why it was more affordable.<br/><br/>10. This does not come with a cumbersome case. I’m all so OVER cases with attached keyboards or keyboards that fall out when you pick up the case. I can pick up my iPad or phone out of the slot and use it that way, or use it with the keyboard. Though this keyboard is a bit bigger than some, I don’t mind it—really, if you add a case and keyboard to your tablet, it’s going to be about the same size.<br/><br/>I LOVE MINE! If this keyboard keeps on working as it is now, my quest for a good keyboard is over, and all for less than $30 (at time of this review). HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my reviews. Hope it helps with your shopping decision today!</span>

<span>Title of the product is misleading as I did not receive a physical screen protector to apply to my tablet (unless they meant that the case itself protects the screen). One drawback is that you can only prop up your tablet at one angle, which is to be connected to the keyboard. I personally dislike the cutout for the S pen, there is another area to place the pen but it won’t be charging (as seen in my attached image). Also, if you’re not careful, the back cover of the case can easily detach from the tablet.<br/><br/>I’d say that this case is a downgrade from the s7 book cover keyboard case. That model has a track pad (mouse), you can remove the keyboard while simultaneously protecting the back of the tablet, you can adjust the angle of the tablet and there is a flap covering the s pen area. Not completely sure if it would work for the s8 tablet, so please purchase with your own caution. I only got this model for the s8 because it was on sale, but overall I’d say it gets the job done with average protection and the keyboard works well.</span>

<span>Well, I tried really hard to like this item. It is my second attempt at a Bluetooth keyboard case for my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1. (The Fintie was horrible). I have a Logitech for my iPad Air and it works great so I paid extra for this one in hopes that money would get me quality. There wasn't a Logitech version available specifically for my new tablet.  First, the case is a hard shell and it's really large because it is universal case intended to fit many tablets. It's a pinching mechanism that adapts to the size of the tablet. It works sort of okay, though it is clunky. (Logitech raves how they are patenting this novel design.) The tablet side fits snugly into rather deep holes near the keyboard so that is a plus. You need to develop a wrist movement to disengage it to close. The keyboard is run on two batteries and is not re-chargeable. The batteries are supposed to run for a very long time. Mine died after two weeks. Before that the keys began to get stuck on the keyboard and would make long lines of t's and such that I had to press the delete button repeatedly to stop. Also, it began to switch at random between the Bluetooth keyboard and the tablet keyboard. This makes smooth typing difficult as you can imagine. Lastly, when you close it there is no cushioning so the two sides slide around a bit while you wrestle the elastic banding into place.</span>

I would have liked it better if the angle of the iPad were adjustable. 3.5 months later I got a rapidly flashing blue light and no connectivity to the iPad. Changed the batteries,  just in case. No help. Followed steps to reset the keyboard. No help.  Reset the iPad. No help. Tried connecting the keyboard to another device.  No help. Now replacing the keyboard. Disappointed.</span>

<span>This looks  nice in the photo but in reality  feel cheap and very low quality seems like it could easily break. There is also no trackpad. I am returning it because the corner holders are so huge that they interfere with one of the side buttons. Definitely not worth $50</span>

<span>Buyer be warned: this keyboard runs off button batteries, so conserve yours by turning the keyboard off when not in use. The plastic shell feels unfortunately cheap given the original sale price of $60. The "feet" that grip the bottom of the tablet are supposed to nestle into grooves on the keyboard, but if you don't get them in exactly, they scrape loosely over the keyboard, which doesn't feel secure. However, I do like the adjustable grip system for the tablet as it feels sturdy.<br/><br/>I don't regret the purchase, but I know I will be replacing this case with something more substantial. Unfortunate as I was hoping this would be permanent. I did, sadly, get what I paid for.</span>

<span>I waited a long time to post this review, which will be short and simple. I’d been thru three keyboards immediately before this one. None would stay paired to bluetooth.

<span>I am actually typing this review from this keyboard.  I bought this 2021, Review: 2022.  I use it as my iPad for my digital sketch pad, POS at art festivals, and my brain at all the times in between.  So this case goes everywhere.  I’m not as gentle as I should be on my technology, and occasionally forget that my iPad is in my bag when I kneel down on the ground or plop myself somewhere, this case as protected my iPad perfectly.  I use the Apple Pencil constantly, the holder on that outside is still strong and well sewn.  The control I have from the keyboard is so much easier than going into settings each time.  Honestly this case has doubled the productivity I have with the iPad.  I will not even dream of using any other case.  I love that it magnetically detaches, the magnet is strong enough that I don’t accidentally separate the parts too often.  My ipad once slid of my counter, and I caught it by the keyboard before that too fell over the edge and it stayed attached.  Lucky accident though and wouldn’t count on that ever again.  My only question is how to clean the edges, which are just not starting to show grime after a year of traveling to shows with me.  No complaints.</span>

<span>This keyboard case worked with my iPad right out of the box, probably because it’s an Apple accessory.  3rd-party keyboard cases that I’ve used in the past needed to be paired with the iPad via Bluetooth, and sometimes I experienced a lag in my typing and dropped connections.  This keyboard is decent, and what I type immediately appears on my iPad screen with no lag-time.  However, the keys are a bit stiffer than I prefer and they’re not backlit, which makes typing in low light pretty difficult.<br/>Unlike most other iPad keyboard cases on market (even the Apple one that I used with my old 2nd Gen iPad Pro), this keyboard case doesn’t have a “snap-in” mechanism that secures the iPad in the case.  Instead, the case has magnets that stick onto the metal back of the iPad.  However, the magnetic mechanism isn’t entirely fail-safe, so oftentimes, when I pick my iPad up by the “spine” of the case, the iPad falls out of the open side of the case.  If, like me, you typically use your iPad on soft surfaces like a sofa or bed, then this might not be much of an issue.  But if you’re a “road warrior” who tends to use their iPad on-the-go or you’re someone who’s rough on their mobile devices and needs a very protective case, then I wouldn’t recommend this keyboard case.<br/>Lastly, for some odd reason, when I have my iPad in the 2nd position (with the device more slanted/tilted) vs. the more upright position (for typing), the iPad tends to slip out of the notch and fall flat on its back.  That’s pretty annoying when I’m watching videos, which I do with the iPad tilted further back in the keyboard case.<br/>This keyboard case basically does what mainly need it to do, and the issues I’ve had with it aren’t major enough to warrant returning it.  However, if I had to do it again, I’d probably pass on this Apple-branded keyboard case and try a 3rd-party accessory instead, which would probably offer better value for money.  This keyboard case is too expensive to have all these shortfalls.<br/>Grade: C+</span>
