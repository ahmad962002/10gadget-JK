<span>I like this camera after only a bit of messing around with it I figured out the basics and what each button did. All things considered i did know what to do with the iso, aperture, etc. but that you can just figure out on YouTube or by asking anyone that uses a camera</span>

<span>This camera is my first DSLR and it has been an incredible experience shooting in a variety of contexts and formats. I brought this camera on my trip and used the automatic presets for the majority of the trip but started learning from YouTube how to manually adjust each camera setting and realized how powerful this camera can be during photo shoots.<br/><br/>If you’re looking for long range high-depth shots, the lens that comes with this camera will be a let down. I suggest researching lenses before purchasing this camera so you can understand the full scope of costs associated with what you’re looking for as accessories can quickly up the costs. Additionally, consider purchasing a camera bag and definitely purchase an SD card.</span>

<span>Came broken at first (Dead pixels on image sensor). I ended up getting it from Microcenter for an even cheaper price and the camera is awesome. I love it. I would recommend getting sensitive electronics in person as I have had issues with order ordering stuff online coming broken. With than being said, thing is great!</span>

<span>For me The zoom was great !

<span>I  bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use.<br/><br/>Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion<br/><br/>She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , "I love this camera", . "I love this camera". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail.  I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great.<br/><br/>Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special<br/><br/>1.  The camera has an excellent grip, it  feels good in the hands. Easy to use.<br/>2.  Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200<br/>3.  Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof!<br/>4.  Great zoom range. From 25 to 600<br/>5.  EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better<br/>6.  Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera<br/>7.  Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons.<br/>8.  Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light<br/>9.  Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums<br/>10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process?<br/>11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD<br/>12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent.<br/>13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use.<br/>14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions.<br/>15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise<br/>16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens.<br/>17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters<br/>18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter<br/>19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail.<br/>20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app.<br/>21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers.<br/>22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images.<br/>23. Good quality macro images possible.<br/><br/>What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved.<br/><br/>1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited<br/>2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images.<br/>3. Could use a headphone jack for video.<br/>4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens.<br/>5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap.<br/>6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy.<br/>7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens.<br/>8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy.<br/><br/>If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you,  consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..</span>

<span>My husband and I relocated to Michigan this past spring and it didn’t take long to realize that my I Phone11 camera was woefully  inadequate when it came to capturing the beauty of the Upper Peninsula! I did my homework (lots of reviews from several sources!) and settled on the Panasonic LUMIX FZ300. It’s my first ‘real’ camera and I love it!<br/>There is a bit of a learning curve if you’re a beginner, I got it in May and I’m still learning how to use all the settings, but there are YouTube videos by Graham Houghton that are very helpful! The zoom is, in my opinion, incredible, the picture I took of the frog eating a minnow is amazing…you can see the grains of sand on his fingers! I had no idea that frogs even HAD fingers! It was worth every penny!</span>

<span>I've only had this camera for 2 or 3 weeks so my experience is limited, but so far I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>I had a fairly cheap digital camera before this (GE X550), and I was looking for something that was a step up while trying to stay to $500 or $600.<br/><br/>This camera has a lot of fancy features. It has what you'd expect from any camera that's above the point-and-shoot level. You can set it to full auto exposure, manual, aperture priority, or shutter priority. Etc. The features you'd expect to find in any DSLR or mirrorless camera.<br/><br/>It has a bunch of handy features. Like a burst mode, where as long as you hold the shutter button down it will keep clicking pictures. (Choice of speed ranging from, don't quote me on the numbers, I think something like 5 shots per second up to maybe 20.) Auto-bracket mode: Click a picture and it will automatically take 2 more, one with a slightly darker exposure and one slightly lighter. (How much darker or lighter is a setting, and while I usually use 3 you can also do 5 or 7.) Image stabilization that works very well. I did some night shots hand held with shutter speeds of 1 or 2 seconds and they came out with no obvious blur. Option to have a constant brightness on the viewfinder or to have the brightness reflect what the picture will look like. One thing that you may think of as cute fluff but I think is pretty handy: You can set it so that the image shows up on the LCD panel, in the viewfinder, or you can have it use the LCD panel but then automatically switch to the viewfinder when you put your eye up to it. Or to me handiest option of all: the LCD panel folds out (I presume to protect the screen), so if the LCD panel is "open" it uses that, if it's closed it uses the viewfinder. Auto focus or manual focus. (It has a feature they claim will keep a moving object in focus, I haven't tried to use that.) Lots of other settings and options that I haven't played with much (or don't understand :-)<br/><br/>It doesn't have changeable lenses, but the built-in lens has like a 20X zoom.<br/><br/>Aperture ranges from F/2.8 to F/8.0. Shutter speeds range from open until you release the button to I think 1/4000 of a second. There's a choice between electronic and mixed electronic/mechanical shutter. If you use the electronic shutter the shutter speeds can be even faster but there are some limitations with it. (The "mixed" mode opens the shutter electronically but closes it mechanically.)<br/><br/>The camera will also take video. I've only played with this briefly, mostly I wanted a still camera, so I can't say a lot about that.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of "creative" options, like you can take pictures in sepia tones, very high contrast, soft focus, etc.<br/><br/>The menus can be accessed with buttons to scroll around or by using the touch screen. The controls you're likely to want to use all the time, setting the basic mode (S/A/M/P etc), shutter speed, focus, zoom, couple of others, are buttons or knobs. Common options are quickly reached from a few main buttons, like ISO speed, white balance, and focus mode. And there's a customizable "quick menu", so if you routinely use some feature you can set it to be reachable fairly easily without having to scroll through all the menus.<br/><br/>Drawbacks I've noticed:<br/><br/>You can't swap lenses. It's got a zoom lens that's permanently attached.<br/><br/>It's ability to give a shallow depth of field is limited. If you like to take portraits, for example, with a blurred background, you may have difficulty achieving this. I want to play with this some more.<br/><br/>I'm sure a professional photographer could point to more limitations but that's all I've really noticed so far.</span>

<span>For my entire life I’ve loved photography but have never owned anything more than your average point-n-shoot cameras in the $100-200 range (my last one was a low-end Panasonic Lumix). Or for the past decade I’ve only used the camera on my iPhone. I was lucky to receive a few Amazon gift cards on my recent birthday so I finally bit the bullet and bought this one. And may I just say...wow. I couldn’t be more pleased.<br/><br/>The main thing I’ve always wanted was a camera that could shoot with good depth of field. You know, where the subject being photographed is in sharp focus but the background is blurry, giving the object a more realistic, 3-D look. This camera does that spectacularly, even in fully-automatic, auto-focus mode.<br/><br/>I’ve also always wanted a camera that can take great low-light / night shots. My iPhone camera was actually not bad for day-to-day photos but it took HORRIBLE night shots. The moon, for example, was always nothing more than a blurry blob no matter how still I  stayed. Not so with this camera! The dark shots I’ve taken thus far have all been nice and crisp/clear rather than grainy.  Overall I’m very, very happy with my purchase and I haven’t even used the extra telephoto lens that came with it yet! There is still so much I have yet to learn about its many features so I know it’s only going to get better and better once I learn what all its many options can do.</span>

<span>Great camera for photo journalism or amateur photographers who love taking photos. I highly recommend using manual focus tho, it really does get you the picture you want. Also recommend looking over the manual and watching a couple of youtube videos to learn the camera more. Best way to learn is to go and try it. Also, essential that the bundle comes with two lenses, adds to versatility, you won't regret it.</span>

<span>Bought this camera two days before trip to Yellowstone and Jackson hole. This camera had the two things I required. EVF View finder, and wide angle to long lens. And a long lens it does have!<br/>  After receiving it on the first day I charge the battery and went into the backyard to take some pictures. We Are blessed to have a beautiful pond in the backyard and a Male Mallord duck just happen to be standing out on a rock at 25 feet. Took a couple pictures of him and then zoom right into his face including his beak head and neck. The clarity was outstanding and the color unbelievable.<br/>  I am also an RC pilot so the next day took it out to the RC airfield.</span>

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>This is the third Kodak I've purchased in the last 10 years. The first two were Kodak Share's and were great, but no longer produced. When I say the third camera a person has to realize that I use my camera heavy duty 7 months out of the year. I'm a field appraiser and do real estate tax appraisals for three different counties every year. As I'm doing my work I take pictures of any new structures or anything that would affect value of properties. Often that can mean as many as 50 per day. They took lots of wear &amp; tear but held up really well. The first I dropped on a concrete walk. Needless to say, not the fault of the camera. The last one developed a problem in the spring lever that holds the batteries causing it not to stay closed well. I've spent the last three weeks with packing tape holding it shut! 🤣<br/>Then I decided to try the new PixPro, which I ordered through Amazon with very quick service from the dealer. It's so closely made to my others that I don't think it will take any time to master! And even better magnification! 40x where my others were only 20x. I use this feature a lot as many properties are inaccessible with a normal range.<br/>My only problem that is preventing using it right away is the camera to computer downloading. With my previous cameras I could download my pictures with the days pictures dated and numbered 1 through the end. I could delete those pictures then start over the next day with 1 . I've not figured out how to master this and am planning on calling the company for help. Right now, if I delete 12 and delete, the next day will be 13, etc.<br/>I know there are lots of $$$cameras out there but for my use, Kodak can't be beat! I'll follow up with my service form the dealer if my concerned can be addressed.</span>

<span>I bought this camera for a photography class.  If I use manual settings and can get the ISO as low as I can and the depth of field as high as I can, the pictures come out pretty darn good.  Most of the time I just use auto.  Any motion will cause motion blur.  My iPhone 8 doesn't have this problem.  It also tears through batteries like no tomorrow.  I was planning to use this to capture pictures of my child for years to come.  Now I will just sell it on facebook marketplace and count my losses.</span>

<span>I just wanted a camera that would zoom farther than my phone to take pictures of the wildlife on our property. This has been great.  Didn't notice that an interface cable was not included for downloading pictures to my computer. So if you want that, be sure to order separately. Great little camera.</span>

<span>I bought the Canon SX420 IS camera to take with me on trips where I fly to a destination.  I have a DSLR and lenses I use at other times, but unless I am specifically flying somewhere to take photos, it is too much to carry with me.  This camera does a fine job, once you get the hang of it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Small, packs into carry on luggage, lightweight, comfortable in the hand<br/>- Good images in bright light with very good color balance and moderate sharpness.<br/>- Very good optical zoom<br/>Cons:<br/>- Sometimes the light metering doesn't get it right, especially in backlit situations.<br/>- Sometimes has difficulty focusing, especially at high zooms<br/>- Images quickly become grainy at high zooms or in low light (not surprising with this size lens)<br/>- Lacks some modes like aperture priority it could easily have with just additional firmware<br/>Other:<br/>- Hard to see back display in bright light, but that is not unique to this camera<br/>- Battery life could be better, but this is an easy fix, just buy a couple of more batteries<br/><br/>On my first trip, I took a couple of hundred pictures with it, mostly outdoors in good light.  I find the AE ("P") mode to be the best along with auto everything else and evaluative metering.  I thought I would miss the lack of aperture priority and shutter priority modes, but since it has a relatively small aperture range, I am not sure how much those would help.  The results I got when reviewed on a computer were quite good. The color balance appears very good and the sharpness reasonably good.  I have read other reviewers saying the images are so poor they returned the camera.  I think that means they are overly picky, had higher expectations than they should have for this type of camera, and/or they don't know how to use a camera.<br/><br/>While some may think of it as a "point and shoot" that doesn't mean you will always get the best results if you just point it and push the shutter button.  Learn how to better control the focus to get better results.  I suggest using the smallest focus area, single shot as opposed to continuous auto-focus, and learn how to push the shutter button halfway to get the focus at the distance you want before shooting. Even DSLR and high-end mirrorless cameras will focus on the wrong thing (often the closest object in the focus area) if used incorrectly.  As a side benefit, using single shot auto-focus will significantly extend battery life.<br/><br/>If you want a small flexible-use camera that you can take along with you to get some decent shots, this is a good choice.<br/><br/>Edit:  I added a couple of examples of unaltered photos from a recent trip to show what the camera can do.<br/><br/>Update 6/11/2021:  This camera is a memory card killer.  I have now had it somehow "read lock" 2 32GB memory cards, and there is nothing to do with the cards except throw them in the trash.  NO, it is not the switch on the card, checked and double-checked.  Even low level disk management Linux commands cannot reformat the cards once they are in this state.</span>
