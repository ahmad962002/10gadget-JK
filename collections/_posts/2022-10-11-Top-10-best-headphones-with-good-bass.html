<span>Audio is subjective, I am satisfied with the purchase and audio experience these phones provides. I brought the 500B - Mids and Highs are better that the Crusher series, they are not as recessed and don't distort with higher volume. I keep my bass setting in 2 or 3 depending on the recording and satisfies my basshead cravings without compromising as much on overall sound. They remind me of original Kannon's with haptic feedback that is different than the typical phone drivers pushing air, these seems to have a middle ground. BT Pairing and playback has been flawless with multiple devices. For my small melon and having eye glasses they are very comfortable.<br/><br/>In the end I think this is a decent solution than having wired phones and all the plethora of amps/dacs/Eq devices and software tweaking etc as a bass head at a fraction of cost particularly when on sale.</span>

<span>They sounded great for the first 5 minutes, but an audible and distracting crackling sound can be heard while audio is played and is especially heard when pausing said audio. They feel great and sound great besides this. I'll probably return them because of that issue, though. It's just too distracting.<br/>Edit: I've found out that this is only when the bass is turned up. Even just one tick will cause the rhythmic crackling sound. Probably won't return it, but it is something to take note of for a product that boasts really good bass, but at this expense.</span>

<span>As a indie music producer, I recently bought these to give me a idea of what my music sounds like being played on big system without disturbing the neighbors. These headphones are great! I like the fact that you can adjust the Bass to a level that's comfortable for you! They sound amazing!<br/>DJ DDK</span>

<span>Kinda bang for the buck.<br/><br/>It fits well and is a comfortable fit. It’s light and has a nice feel. Not too bad on the wallet. Feels real loose when you first remove from box and hold the headphones. But once it’s on your head, it’s pretty sealed with no wiggle.<br/><br/>I have a few headphones options, but my old over the ear headphones were starting to wear out, and I just wanted something that had some serious bass and comfort for long work hours where I need to drown out area noise (I work from home as a lot do right now) where anything from loud music, screaming kids (not mine) and construction are all going on at all hours.<br/><br/>They are easy to sync with your favorite devices. They hold calls well. I enjoy the big bass which can be adjusted to three levels.<br/><br/>You can listen to music and have the cans rattling your skull or enjoy a podcast with clear vocals all the same. I like them for movies as it picks up the background music and effects without drowning out the dialogue.<br/><br/>Overall very happy with my purchase.</span>

Feel the bass in your bones with Crusher Evo — the latest advancement in the famous Skullcandy Crusher line. Patented Adjustable Sensory Bass technology is an experience that you can’t get in any other headphones. And now, you can even customize the sound to your unique hearing through a quick audio test in the Skullcandy App. So you’ll hear the music exactly the way it was meant to be heard. Critical controls — call, track change, volume, and Crusher Bass — are conveniently located with easy-to-use tactile buttons. Tile finding technology lets you “ring” your headphones if they’re ever lost or misplaced, so you’ll never return home without them. Rapid Charge capability provides 4 hours of listening time on just 10 minutes of charge, and a full charge lets you feel the music for an amazing 40 hours. Crusher Evo is also travel-ready. It folds flat to fit perfectly into the included travel case.

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I watch a lot of movies on my iPad and was intrigued by the idea of having headphones that provide a tactile experience via low frequency effects.  However, these type of product promises are more often a disappointment than not. The sheer number of positive reviews is what convinced me to give them a try ... and I'm so glad I did.<br/>When the bass control slider is all the way down (off), these are very capable headphones for casual listening with a basic, reasonably flat response.  When you begin to introduce even a small amount of sensory bass boost, you realize that these headphones are something very unique and special.  In my case, movies and games come alive with a sense of being in the middle of the action.<br/>Above and beyond the experience is an excellent build quality you can see and feel the first time you touch them.  They are indeed a little heavier than most headphones of this size, but that's the small price you pay for the additional sensory hardware built into the ear cups.  I find the headphones comfortable for several hours at a time.<br/>I for one am glad I purchased mine and find it very easy to recommend them.<br/><br/>Are the Crusher Evo's worth the price paid?  They sure are!!</span>

<span>Firstly the box was very weighty. The headphones feel great, though I found they sat weird on my head and it took a minute to find how they sit best for me. The headband isn't very padded. The pride decal on the headband looks very cheap. It's a nice touch it just doesn't look like it was executed as well as it could have been.<br/><br/>The bag is nice feeling pleather with embroidery details and a rainbow strip at the opening. The inside is super soft and has two pockets for cords, etc.<br/><br/>The headphones have little to no noise canceling, BUT they also don't seem to bleed sound so you can blast your music and won't disturb others. I had my music with the haptic bass all the way up and my wife said she maybe heard a tiny sound but she had to strain to try and head it.<br/><br/>Sound quality is great as expected from Skullcandy. Know WHAT sort of sound experience you like. Skullcandy in general tends to lean into bass more then high range so that's to be expected.<br/><br/>The Haptic Bass is the key feature here. Having music at a reasonable volume and the haptic base slider even just a little up gives a nice physical bass feel that enhances bass in music. Turning the volume and haptic bass all the way to the max will vibrate your soul. General agreement in my household is you lose out on the high and mid ranges with it turned up. The bass drowns out a lot and you get a more muddy sound. Personally I was looking for something that would be more bass heavy and don't care about losing the highs in exchange for heavier lows. With the bass turned off you can watch a show and it sounds just fine.<br/><br/>Final thoughts if you're looking for headphones to give you a heavy bass but also work well for basic listening (podcasts, shows, etc) these are perfect.  Overall I am very pleased with them. Fingers crossed I don't wear out them out to fast.</span>

<span>Noise cancellation is one of the most important features for a headphone. It is not just about the sound quality but also about the noise cancellation. The goal of noise cancellation is to cancel out all of the external unwanted noises so that you can enjoy your music and movies in peace, without any interruption. However, that wasn't the case for this head phone. I'd be honest that I still liked it very much in spite of the not-so-great Noise cancellation. Thus I still gave it a 5. The price for such quality including design also deserved a 5.</span>

<span>I really enjoy Skullcandy Crushers. They are wonderful headphones in terms of the sound quality and the adjustable bass is an unrivaled listening experience<br/>I used to have an older version and then switched to the Venue line and I missed the Crushers so much because I love a strong bass.<br/>My two issues are that these aren't good for canceling noise. They do if you're listening to music loud enough and have the bass up,  but at a normal volume you can hear everything around you.<br/>Also these ones are a bit uncomfortable on the top of my head. Not sure how or why since the material is squishy but I end up with a sore spot on my head after wearing these for a while.<br/>If you're not looking for noise canceling and you want a SOLID sound quality, these are a great choice.<br/>The blue looks amazing and I enjoy the velvet touch texture too.</span>

<span>I have to say that the all the other headphone I had try this are the best by far!!! The sound is incredibly, and the bass quality is the best I have heard, they compare to the Bose noise cancellation that cost 3 times more that this ones, you would not be disappointed!!! Very very excellent music quality!!!</span>

<span>I have had these for about 2 months and now safe to say they are the best headphones I have ever purchased. I have air pods too. Wore these on a plane and heard nothing other than my music! The bass slider is incredible and the bass sound is deep. I can't even put the slider more than half way up! Battery last for weeks and they fit well...a lil tight on the ear but would rather thay then loose. Only complaint is the wires could be pulled out easily which would render them useless..only 4 stars due to length of time owned</span>

<span>The Skull Candy Crusher Wireless is a great set of cans for multiple uses. Let me say, first, we have bought 3 pairs of these in less than a year. First pair was for our 15 yo son, second pair was for my husband, and the third pair I finally bought for myself (early Xmas gift). The fact we have 3 pairs of these should say it all! All 3 pairs we bought are in black. Too many reviews had the white pair breaking, so with this last purchase, I felt there were not enough reviews with enough time on them for the new colors to make me feel confident they, too, would not break in the same spot as the white ones. So, black it was. One can never go wrong with black in headphones!<br/><br/>The first pair was bought in early May, for a 15 yo who is not always super careful with his stuff. They've been dropped, and used every single day by him and are still working perfectly, still charge just as fast and the battery still lasts forever. They have held up to his clumsiness and look as if we bought them yesterday, though they've been dropped and dinged here and there. My husband got his the 3rd week in May and he uses his constantly. He works from home and is on the phone a LOT. Conference calls, broadcasts (radio/YouTube for interviews), and phone calls/video calls with friends both here in the States and globally. As for my husband's use - they DO work with Skype on a cell - we have Note 9s, and they DO work with Skype via the computer (for reference, he has an Asus Rog). He had to go into Skype and tell it to recognize these particular cans. They didn't work at first, but he did finally get them to. They work on all of our other call apps, WhatsApp, Wire, Signal, VSee Etc. They work with our regular phone calls beautifully too. They also connect to our Bluetooth unit we have hooked into our TV. They both connect even though we have the same headphones. We had some trouble getting 2 identical headphones connecting at first. One would automatically pick up, then we had to activate pairing mode on the headphones then press our bluetooth button on the tv unit and then it found them. Took a day to figure it out, but we did it lol! They work AWESOME with that! If you turn the bass all the way up or 3/4 of the way up, I swear, it seriously feels like you are sitting in a movie theater. The sound quality is awesome for watching tv. Often, one of us will fall asleep and to avoid waking the other, tv gets muted and headphones go on. Now, we use them even when we are both awake because they make for a great experience with the upgraded sound for the tv! Our son just keeps them connected to his phone or he uses the auxiliary cord and plugs them into his switch when he plays it. Sure beats ear buds. Plus, our son says earbuds are super uncomfortable for him and refuses to use them, so that's why we initially bought these for him.<br/><br/>The battery life is CRAZY GOOD! This is one of the reasons we went with these 3 times. They charge up from fully drained fairly quick (a few hours) and the battery lasts FOREVER. This battery, by far, is the best out there. Nothing else to say - battery life is AMAZING.<br/><br/>Side note - they sound even better when you go in to your cell and tweak the audio settings to your liking. On our Notes, we both had to download a good EQ/audio app and we tweaked from there. He did the same thing on his laptop, and again, amazing sound. Hes a bit of an audiophile, and while no - these aren't the top cans for an audiophile, but he is very impressed with the sound (music/tv) for the price. He actually loves these and prefers these cans for calls, watching TV, and listening to music over his top dollar Sony Noise Cancelling headphones and over his even higher priced Sennheisers. He got these because he needed a good pair with a good mic and sound for calls (as people were complaining over hearing him with the Sonys), and true cans for audiophiles, well, you can't really use them for phone calls lol. He has an expensive pair of Sennheiser cans, and once tweaked, honestly, these sounded better to me than the $400 ones. But - my ears are super sensitive to treble and it hurts my ears. So the highs not being very pronounced with these is perfect for me. The mids are definitely recognizable and neither of us have any issue with sound nor do we miss anything. When watching tv you pick up on all of the little background things you never notice. With music, you can actually hear the singer take the smallest of breaths where you couldn't before. Again, ours are tweaked for our phones and computers, BUT they are NOT tweaked for our tv, it's impossible there and we still catch every little thing.<br/><br/>So far, the hinges are holding up. Before we purchased these for our son, we actually went to Best Buy and looked at all of the models and different brands. Skull Candy, overall, were the best for the money and comfort out of all their in-store models. When we compared these to the Venues, we went with these because they feel far more substantial than the Venues. These are heavier and feel/seem to be made sturdier than the Venues. It seems to me the only differences in the two models are - ear pieces twist out on the Venue not on the Crusher, Venue has noise cancelling and Crushers do not, Crusher has the added bass adjustment &amp; Venues don't, and finally, the Crusher seems far strudier/a bit heavier/better made than the Venues and are cheaper than the Venues.<br/><br/>I dont think these would be ideal for jogging or running...but I dont run anymore unless it's for my life - so, I dont run. Lol. If you put them on and tap the outside of the can, you can hear it "reverberating". And I've seen other reviews about hearing that while running due to the jolt of the "bouncing" of the body while jogging. That would irritate me. They are a little heavy, but you get used to that quickly and they are super comfy so the weight never was a bother to to me nor my husband or son. We all wear glasses/contacts. They do not hurt my ears where my earpieces are. The cups are super cushy and they only get softer/better over time. Keep in mind, these are NOT noise cancelling. But, my husband often listens to loud music 2 feet away from me and I can't say I can readily identify what he's listening to unless I got closer, so again, it's not a noticeable issue for me. When our toddler comes and crawls into bed with us, if we are watching tv, we have them on pretty loud, and it doesn't bother her a bit, even when she's got her head on my arm. Noises bother her if she's trying to go to sleep. She would, very loudly, have said something by now if she heard any sound from the headphones, or heard it loud enough. She has not.<br/><br/>I have paid 3 different prices for these each time I purchased them. 120 for our son, 108 for hubs, and I picked them up on Cyber Monday for 79.99. Even at 120, I would buy them again and would've happily paid it for the 2nd and 3rd pairs. They are holding up really well, have great sound, and fold up for smaller storage. They come with a nice little bag that holds them, but if you want any kind of real protection so you can throw them in a bag and go, I would invest in a hard shell case for them. The bag won't protect them other than keeping them put away when not in use at home. The charge cord is good and seems to be good quality and the aux cord it comes with is really nice! The part under the jack is like a box and causes less stress on the jack and plug so it wont short out as easy. I really love the design of the auxillary cord.<br/><br/>If you aren't too terribly rough on headphones and plan on using these for a range of things - like calls, music, &amp; hooking into the tv - these are DEFINITELY the cans for you! They are WELL worth their price, whatever that may be. I would just invest in a hard shell case and take care of them. Most of the breakage issues I saw in reviews were with the white ones. Other colors, in my opinion, dont have enough reviews with enough time in use to be confident that they wont do the same thing the white ones seems to do. We have had zero issues with our 3 sets in black, with one son who isnt always as careful as he should be with the more expensive stuff he wants lol, and they've held up to him perfectly. These are definitely worth your hard earned money! Skull Candy did good with these!!! I would give them my money again if I needed a 4th pair for any reason. Just go on and buy them!!!!</span>

<span>i was super skeptical because usually i buy more expensive things in stores but they were on sale and i’m so glad i did. i was saving up for a much more expensive pair and i think these are super good headphones, they’re super comfy and i think they look cute too.</span>

<span>I've been using them for a couple of months and I have no complains. They do exactly what they are meant to do. I love that I can fold them and put them away on their pouch. The aux cable allows me to use them on planes and my computer when I don't have time to charge them. The sound quality is good, there are definitely more expensive headphones out there with better sound quality, but overall this headphones' sound quality is really not bad at all. I saw some people complained about the durability. To be honest, I don't have that problem, I am not using them in a rough way leaving them in the sun or anything. I had them for 3 months now and still look brand new. If you have a small head like me, the adjustable headband is great and fits really nice. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants an over the ear pair of headphones.</span>

<span>I use these for listening to music and podcasts as well as noise cancelation on flights and when I’m reading and am very happy with them. They fit my smallish head comfortably. I’m sure there is a reason behind it but it is frustrating to ne that the included charge cord is exclusive to only these headphones and that it is only 3” long. Super awkward and if I lose it there is no other cord that will fit the charge port that I can use. My old Hesh 3’s at least used a universal style charge port. Now I have to keep track of a new style just for these which has proven more than once already to be a pain. Otherwise they have been a great upgrade and replacement to the old style.</span>

<span>I use these for teleconferences, so it is important I can hear the details. The high quality sound is improved by the effective noice cancellation. My cohort and clients have never mentioned I sound “tinny” or “far away” as they have with other headsets. They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and I can get 3-5 days of work out between recharges. Highly recommend, especially for the price point.</span>

<span>First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..<br/><br/>That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.<br/><br/>Active Noise Cancellation:<br/>Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..<br/><br/>They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..<br/><br/>Quality:<br/>The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!<br/><br/>Functionality:<br/>A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..</span>

<span>Wow.  I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.<br/><br/>I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous.  I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.<br/><br/>Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers.  The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive.  The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great.  My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.<br/><br/>After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year.  I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?!  Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.<br/><br/>Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.<br/><br/>I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable.  I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great.  MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!<br/><br/>Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy.  After that, I put on my go-to sound check song ("Sacrilege," by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.<br/><br/>I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care.  The "silent note" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately.  The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.<br/><br/>The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.<br/><br/>So I tested the ANR.  I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again.  The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys.  I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys).  THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.<br/><br/>With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys.  Period.  It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.<br/><br/>In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere.  I mean it.  They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR.  They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8" jack.<br/><br/>Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies.  I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application.  If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away.  If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.<br/><br/>That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.<br/><br/>There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.<br/><br/>1.  The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears.  Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight.  It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in.  If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.<br/><br/>2.  The battery life isn't that great.  To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them.  However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without.  My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48.  Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.<br/><br/>3.  They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs.  This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have.  Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).<br/><br/>Hope that helps you make a decision.  I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.</span>

<span>Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.<br/><br/>I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.<br/><br/>Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.<br/><br/>I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...<br/><br/>NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------<br/><br/>Sound Quality ---- 8/10<br/>These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as  most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.<br/><br/>DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORS<br/>I only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.<br/><br/>Comfort ---- 10/10<br/>These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.<br/><br/>Features ---- meh, not much to talk about<br/>Really the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.<br/><br/>Aesthetics ---- 6/10<br/>Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.<br/><br/>Connectivity ---- 6/10<br/>Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.<br/><br/>Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10<br/>You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!<br/><br/>Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)</span>

<span>I'll be quite honest that I first bought these when trying to find one of the cheapest reputable noise cancelling headphones that I planned to use exclusively for mowing.  I have a 3 acre lawn and spend hours mowing each week and the regular headphones just had to be jacked up too loud to hear over the drone so I finally jumped on these.<br/><br/>These headphones have been nothing short of great for me.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of people griping about options that may be missing and no app support and yada yada yada but the truth is, these offer a large amount of bang for the buck.  Noise cancelling and great, but not perfect when comparing to Bose headphones (shocker, right?)  Ears do start to sweat a little after an hour or so but that's not extremely surprising either.  Plenty loud, especially if you turn off the noise cancelling.  Perhaps this is par for the course, but I was slightly disappointed at how much bass you lose when you turn on the noise cancelling.  They actually shocked me at how much bass they have when comparing to other headphones 4 times their price.  I wouldn't go as far as to call them boomy but they do have a good punch.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, i've liked these headphones so much that i've had to keep moving them between the garage and the house as I use them to watch movies late at night when I don't wanna wake the rest of the family up.<br/><br/>They are a great budget friendly pair of noise cancelling headphones with a great battery life.  I'd buy again!</span>

<span>I've recently found myself using neckband earbuds more often, and I picked myself up a pair of Sony WI-C200 earbuds. They were great, but they didn't have the punch I was looking for in my "on-the-go" earbuds. Because of this, I picked up a pair of these earbuds, the Sony WI-XB400.<br/><br/>They fit great in my strangely shaped ears, they fit around my abnormally huge neck well enough to suffice, and their sound is EXACTLY what I was looking for.<br/><br/>Sony's EXTRA BASS lineup of audio has always carried a reputation of "punchy bass without sacrificing other aspects of sound quality" for me. I've always been able to get aggressive bass from Sony's EXTRA BASS lineup of headphones, but never have seen a sacrifice in mids or highs as a result.<br/><br/>These earbuds are no different. Their soundstage is clear, well-balanced, and crisp, with some seriously spicy lows that I love.<br/><br/>For an on-the-go earbud, I would recommend these to anybody. They sound fantastic, they fit great, their battery life could be better but it's definitely acceptable, they're comfortable, and they seem to be built very rugged. Sony has a fan in me for these earbuds! I will use these until they crap out for sure, then probably buy another set.<br/><br/>(P.S. Forgive my ugly mug in the photos 😂)</span>

<span>I have no choice but to rate this 5 stars. For a price of a regular food order for delivery… you’re getting Audiophile sound (I been a producer for years trust me) Incredibly unreal battery life. I literally have videos playing all day at work in between tasks and they last a few hours even after work. The only two cons that exist are that the microphone isn’t high quality, but for the price it’s understandable. The only other con is that for working out these don’t cut it for me, they fall out of my ears just by moving around. The mic and battery compartment is heavy. Here is my recommendation to Sony, first of all hire me I’d love to work on your headphones line. Secondly, let’s make a $60-80 headphone upgrade and add a premium microphone, let’s add ear hooks so it can stay in ears. Let’s also make the design a bit more comfortable. Lastly let’s increase the battery to 20 hours of playback, we can market it like a beast! Overall this is the best value you can find in the wireless headphone market. There is no better value nothing in this price range can even come close trust me I tried a lot. You will not regret buying these.</span>

<span>Got them at the end of april, used daily and sometimes at night, they worked great,  unfortunately today i lost the sound in the left side.  It seems to be down at the plug not near the earphones.  Im not sure i want another pair, seems expensive for three months, but then, i used them pretty heavily.</span>
