<span>i actually bought this as a camera mount for my compound bow. it works fantasticly. the mount has rubber on the inside so it stays at the angle you put it at it tightens down nicely but it does take some time to get it really secure. the width adjustments are great too they allow you to gets the best fit unlike othe mounts where its one size fits most. ill have to do a littl emore messing around but for the most part money well spent</span>

<span>A must for enthusiasts who roam the unknown path of cycling while capturing everything in its path....WHAT A DEVICE!<br/>I LOVE THIS. Picture yourself riding your bike thru the trail videotaping your adventure just you'd reply it in your head but with 100% detail vivid picture and crisp sound coming from your well placed camera (I could indicate what brand and model but I'd rather not as I'm told by AMAZON) anyway it playbacks just like you were standing holding the camera with your own hands...The mount is SUPERB tool as important as my camera. I was able to film my afternoon ride like a PRO. the camera sways and turns just like I rode the bike. HANDSFREE yes and the vibration as the bike entered uneven ground was BRILLIANT like the screen tells you the earth was moving....ahh thats all I have to say as I must plan another bike video diary for tomorrow.<br/>ps the video of my shadow casted on the ground infront of me while the sun was behind was like a major epic motion picture as i pushed the bike hard thru twists and turns...riding towards the sunset. LOVE to RIDE.<br/><br/>Thanks USA GEAR &amp; AMAZON!</span>

<span>I use this camera for streaming my sons baseball games on Gamechanger.  It works well to get the entire field in the shot but I would like a zoom function to be able to zoom in on a close play.  It will allow you to store the video on a memory card, but you have to remove the card to copy it off.  The built in USB port seems to only allow for charging, this means I have to carry around a media adapter as well which is annoying. It has decent battery life, I can usually get almost 2 games (7 innings each) on one charge unless they go into extra innings. The microphone needs some work as any amount of wind sounds like a hurricane.  The app is decent, though I mainly use gamechanger. Due to the design its a bit difficult to get it to stay leveled when trying to use anything but a tripod to hold it. Fence mounts that are available are all pretty weak in design especially if its only netting.<br/>Overall I would recommend but Id suggest some accessories are all but required to be useful for live streaming games.</span>

<span>Future generations will never know how horrible cords and bulky cameras were. The Mevo Start is the future of compact wireless cameras, today. I can now sync multi-angles easily and discreetly place the devices in the set for high resolution capture. The cropping and exposure capabilities in the software are simple and super impressive. I love these cameras. I could not be happier with my purchase. Many thanks to those at Mevo and Logitiech.</span>

<span>We bought this chest strap  as an accessory for the GoPro Hero 4 Black we recently bought. There are a MANY aftermarket options than I considered before choosing this one from Nordic Flash. (We also purchased the head strap </span>

<span>from the same company). I based my decision on the excellent existing reviews on Amazon, and the fact that the quality of this chest strap looked far more durable than any others I've seen. The one year warranty is a big plus. It's great to see a company stand behind their brand by offering some sort of warranty these days, especially on a low cost item like this.<br/><br/>The product arrived quickly in a cool reusable zip top bag. For items I've received in the past that were made in China as this is, instructions are usually comical at best and "lost in translation".  The instructional brochure contained the company's contact information as well as clear detail on how to adjust, wear and use the chest strap. I also received an email from the company following up to see if I had any questions about my purchase.<br/><br/>The chest strap was a cinch to setup and start using. Camera fits flawless and securely, and you can tilt and securely lock it anywhere along the available path with the provided aluminum screws (3!!) vs pre-set options I've seen in other options. No problem finding the right angle with this strap!<br/><br/>The strap itself is full adjustable and has soft stretchy elastic material. I would like to note that my husband had a broad chest and shoulders, and although it fits him comfortably (and doesn't move when he does) he said it felt maxed out as far as the circumference adjustment goes.<br/><br/>While we haven't officially field tested this strap, it was put through the motions at home and didn't budge. It's comfortable when on and doesn't "crawl" when you move if you have it cinched down tight against you. If it's not tight enough on you then it will probably move a bit if your shirt does. (Hope that makes sense)<br/><br/>I'm really happy with this purchase and feel I got more than my monies worth. Great quality, price and proactive customer service.</span>

<span>This chest mount gives you everything you would expect from a quality chest harness.  Adjustable straps, and a whole bunch of connectors to attach your go pro in any angle you desire.  The only negative i found was when tightening the knobs, sometimes it would not be tight enough until you get an EXACT connection with the screw and screw holes.  Sometimes it would be so frustrating that i would need to use the go pro provided knobs.  That is not a deal breaker though.  For this price, i would recommend this product to anyone looking for get a different approach to their go pro vids.</span>

<span>Great harness! I've had this product for about a year now and it's traveled with me on a lot of adventures. I love using it while hiking, walking downtown, etc. The footage does tend to be a bit shaky when you use this, but it's to be expected when using harness like this since it's so close to your body and can pick up your bodies movements. That doesn't bother me though, because I get tons of shots on tons of different mounts, tripods, etc. this harness just gives another different perspective when filming and is a nice piece to add to your GoPro equipment.<br/><br/>As far as the quality of the product, it's honestly probably close to one of the best off market GoPro products i've gotten off Amazon. I love that the screws are aluminum and not plastic. I feel like my camera is more secure when I use this harness than any other i've used with this camera. I would highly recommend.</span>

<span>My husband finally took this out to try it today. He's yet to return, so I will add to my review later. The camera was easy to attach to the unit. I found that the bottom nut that keeps the unit from facing down felt tight, but did not keep the camera in an upright position. I will see if that's an issue upon his return. We also found that the fit is a bit snug just with a t-shit on. If you plan on putting this over a personal flotation vest, I think you'll be out of luck. My husband is of muscular build, 5'9" 180 and this fits pretty snug over a regular shirt. Edit: First outing was a success but the camera did not stay put as mentioned above. It kept tilting down. It's a bit disappointing but it didn't ruin his video..</span>

Cam v3 is the 3rd generation of Wyze’s flagship camera, Wyze Cam. Like its predecessor Wyze Cam v3 lets you see and record 1080p video right from the Wyze mobile app. New to Wyze Cam v3 is its waterproof design allowing for outdoor installation with an IP65 rating. Wyze Cam v3 also takes advantage of an all-new Starlight Sensor which allows for extreme low-light performance and shows great detail in the dark. With Wyze Cam v3's color night viewing, night time video recording appears as if it’s day time.

<span>Ordered one from Amazon, $35. Like that camera can sit inside on window sill, flush to the glass of the window, and perfect video picture, night vision is spectacular (have read some ambient light outside is required). No need to worry about batteries or wiring, it plugs into the wall. You also do not need a subscription for just basic usage, but it will only film an event and notify you once every 5 minutes if you opt for no subscription. For $15/year, it is unlimited with no 5 minute pause between even detections. Has a micro SD slot (micro SD card not included), we just used one we had, but not necessary for camera operation. It can also be paired with other appliances through an IFTT app like a garage door.<br/>The MAJOR ISSUE is that even though you may set your detection area, the detection is via a change in pixels (where Ring, Blink, etc. are infrared and detect a heat source) and we receive an EXCESSIVE DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS when the sun sets and shines through the leaves or at night when car headlights flash across the detection area. We have also read where people receive excessive detection notifications when it rains or bugs attracted to light, but we have not had an opportunity to put it to the test with these. The only solution to minimize these notifications for these non-events is to move the camera or to set up rules to silence events during certain times of the day. For the cost, we decided we can live with this. Our walk around for now, is to just have one family member's phone receive alerts. And the other family members must block the alerts for this specific app in the settings of their phone (not within the app, or it blocks everyone's notifications).<br/>Only the initial person who sets up the camera on the app, can make a lot of the changes to the camera within the app. And other family members are just shared access to the camera and can set up their own rules. The initial person who did the set up will receive notifications a split second before the people it is shared with.<br/>Ordered a 2nd one that was supposed to be new, but WAS OPENED and still had the UPS stickers on it with the customer's name and address who had returned it. So returning the 2nd camera and ordering a replacement, hopefully this one will be new.<br/>Realize with any electronics that receive updates (like with cell phones, fitness trackers, etc), they do not have an infinite life due to technology restrictions so another reason to go for this budget friendly option. I believe Wyze retired support for their 1st model after 5 years.<br/>Price on Wyze website was $29.99 ($57.98 for 2) plus $5.99 shipping, but decided buying it from amazon would make sure we had free returns with Prime. Wyze is a company started by former Amazon employees and it is based in Seattle.<br/>Update: very sensitive to raindrops on the window, birds, neighbors' lights turning on and creates an event and notification.</span>

<span>I bought this as a test against the blink can. And this one is 100 times better. The unfortunate thing is that the detection is very sensitive so things such as lightning bolts, Moths/bugs, And the suns rays can set off the motion detection. Sounds like thunder, and doors opening and closing also get Detected and send you with notifications frequently. The good thing is you can change the sensitivity of the detections and it helps a lot. The bad thing is you do need a subscription for this device if you want it to record videos or small clips.  If the notification goes off and you miss the person in the cam it doesn’t save so you will have to be super quick about it if you’re not going to buy a subscription it is worth it though. The night vision is also very bright and better than the other cameras I’ve tested. All in all worth it.</span>

<span>This is truly a junky camera that will become a totally inoperable brick after the first upgrade patch.  This glaring patch problem has happened to me several times and each time Wyze has done nothing to resolve the problem.  Microphone and speaker are unusable static.  So-called new and improved night vision is a joke. Wyze used to be a good bargain because you didn't have to sign up for monthly services now they require you to sign up for monthly expensive services for their junk camera.  Junkie product with increased prices makes it a horrible value. The only thing Wyze wants to do is take your money and give you nothing in return.  Stay away from !</span>

<span> EDIT: I uploaded a video of the camera's sound quality in action, so if you view the video turn on your sound BUT KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN (initially). No need for bleeding ears.<br/><br/>During the Wyze portions of the video I was sitting roughly 20 feet away and six feet below the camera; There should be no feedback at that distance.<br/><br/>During the iPhone portion (where I filmed the same space as the one the V3 is normally set up to film) I was roughly six feet away and six feet below the camera. The point was to capture the same sounds in the same room.<br/><br/>All the videos were taken very early in the morning, with no traffic or human noise outside, and with what I'd call regular ambient interior noise (the humming of appliances, the running of a computer in the vicinity, etc). No other people were present to make noise inside.<br/><br/>The first portion of the video is the sound that the V3 produces when I am viewing the live feed. It was screen-captured with my iPhone.<br/><br/>The second portion is a comparison demonstrating the sound my iPhone picks up in the same general space, at the same general time, in the exact same conditions, and with the exact same ambient noise in the background as in the first portion; This is not to show how much better the iPhone's mic is than the Wyze (obviously it's better) but to give you an idea as to what noise and sounds were actually present in the room while I was viewing the V3's live feed of the same room, and capturing it with my phone camera.<br/><br/>The third portion is the same space with the same ambient noise, plus conversation from the television that is eight feet from the V3. I chose a scene that sounds a lot like regular conversation, set it to conversation volume, and it has some light score that comes in at the end.<br/><br/>The final portion is what my iPhone picked up in the same space during the same time and conditions, and while playing the exact same scene/conversation on the TV at the same volume as while capturing it on the V3. If you listen VERY carefully you MIGHT be able to pick up a word or two in the V3's video that you can compare to the iPhone's. Maybe. It took me three tries. Hint: listen for the word "Garrett".  Hope the video helps you make a more informed purchasing decision!<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Picture is ok. Night vision/low light is very good. Motion detection is spot-on. The camera looks good, design-wise.<br/><br/>Why the one star?<br/><br/>Because that's where the good ends.<br/><br/>The problem is the mic/sound quality is appalling bad. That's such an old, tried-and-true tech I have no idea how they managed to bungle it so much, but managed they did.<br/><br/>Maybe they are using the very cheapest, most absolute garbage quality components on the face of the earth, which sucks, because better components don't cost that much, especially wholesale. They're just squeezing every penny out of profit and selling garbage wrapped up and promoted as quality.<br/><br/>Frustrating.<br/><br/>So, what sound does it pick up?<br/><br/>From what I've read online there are various audio manifestations/issues ranging from nearly no sound at all, all the way to my problem, which is the sound picked up becomes a garbled, distorted, feed-backed  jumble of sometimes jarring noises that maybe sort-of could be interpreted as words (in the case of people taking) but nearly nothing's decipherable by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>Pet noises, like barks, meows, growls, etc. are literally non-existent. If it picks it up at all it's just converted to "noise".<br/><br/>All other sound is just as bad. Sometimes there's these random-seeming staticky "bangs" every once in a while. Who knows what that is.<br/><br/>I hate it.<br/><br/>You hear that developers?<br/><br/>I. Hate. This. Camera.<br/><br/>And I wish I didn't because otherwise I like so much about it.<br/><br/>But, alas,  I need sound so I am able to use the function where you talk to someone through the camera and hear them when they respond. I also need to be able to hear what's going on with my pets.<br/><br/>I need to be able to hear when the camera's motion-detection is tripped and the cause of the trip has moved out of the line of the camera but is still out there rustling and bumping around, or otherwise making noise out on my porch and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>If I had children I wouldn't be able to hear them, or speak to them through the camera. or hear when one is crying.<br/><br/>So, be forewarned, if any of the above is one of your needs/goals you probably won't be able to do that with this camera. Buy elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's incredibly stupid they didn't fix this problem before releasing the V3. A lot of people online report the V2 being awful as well, so the developers knew. That means you shouldn't put off buying one for when the next gen comes out (whenever that is). They probably won't fix it.<br/><br/>The worst part, I think, is it doesn't support the use of an external mic, which would be such an easy solve. There's no input port and the simple hardware and software to support that, and that really is stupid AF. If it did allow the connecting of an external mic all I'd have to do is plug one in and I would have the sound I need. At least then I wouldn't be writing this scathing review. It would be a win-win for everyone!<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>Finally, apparently contacting customer support is a total waste of time, and the people you talk to (bless their hearts, it isn't really their fault) have no tech experience or understanding whatsoever of how these things work. I don't know about you, but I find that exhausting. If one were to spend the time necessary to troubleshoot all the garbage products we wind up with one would never have time to do anything else, and even with that effort 95% of the time it results in no improvement, and no resolution. I'm tired of it. Just make a solid product, and when something goes wrong, replace it or refund the money, don't make anyone jump through hoops.<br/><br/>Finally, fix the issue, fast. And don't repeat it in the next iteration.<br/><br/>Long and the short of it is I need a camera with a functioning mic and/or that has an input for an external mic. The end. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even at the price-point these cameras are at.<br/><br/>I regret buying these, as now they're going to be tossed after I buy another brand (according to message boards even cheapo Chinese no-name brands have a better mic than these things!). What a waste of time, money, and resources.</span>

<span>This is a nice simple camera that most will find entirely adequate.  Installed the Sena camera app on my phone and had no difficulty linking wifi, updating the firmware, and setting the camera and SD card up. Clamp on camera mount was secure on my Bell modular helmet.  I like the loop mode for commuting and general use. It generated 3 minute long videos and overwrites the earliest ones when the card is full. Only downside is the non user serviceable battery only runs the camera for about 2-3 hours on a full charge.</span>

<span>After testing this product around the home, I took it on a drive to the store and back. I mounted it on the viser, checked my phone app to make sure it started recording, and upright. Then shut off my phone and away I went. When I returned home, I turned off the recording and took it into review.  To my surprise it had recorded the entire 31 minutes flawlessly.  That being written, I only had the prism recorder without the external microphone. I was less than 8inches away and reviewing the recording I could barley hear my voice speeking at a regular volume but closing the door and opening it I could hear. The next update will be from a motorcycle view with the external microphone. All in all I think it was a great buy for a starter.</span>

<span>The quality of the video is very good, the noise and the mic are not much quality, and the setup is head pain in the beginning even if you contact tech support, I finally found the way to connected to my phone just turning off the Data of Internet of my phone and vuala! the Wi-Fi Connection connects the camera with my phone easily.</span>

<span>Best Feature: Simplicity of operation. It can be operated easily, even when wearing heavy motorcycle gloves. It's impossible to NOT know whether the camera is on or off. The mount is the best one out there. With a power bank (Anker, etc.) in your pocket and a long USB cable, you can run the camera all day. At the 1440/30fps setting (use the Sena camera app), you'll be changing out a 64Gb micro SD at just over four hours. I primarily use mine to pull screenshots for stills when I travel as I don't want to go down the video editing rabbit hole. Yes, a 4K version with image stabilization would be nice but they'd have to double or triple the price. Bottom line, the Tube WiFi is a great little piece of kit. If you're thinking about getting in the game, the tube is an inexpensive way to get your feet wet.</span>

<span>For my entire life I’ve loved photography but have never owned anything more than your average point-n-shoot cameras in the $100-200 range (my last one was a low-end Panasonic Lumix). Or for the past decade I’ve only used the camera on my iPhone. I was lucky to receive a few Amazon gift cards on my recent birthday so I finally bit the bullet and bought this one. And may I just say...wow. I couldn’t be more pleased.<br/><br/>The main thing I’ve always wanted was a camera that could shoot with good depth of field. You know, where the subject being photographed is in sharp focus but the background is blurry, giving the object a more realistic, 3-D look. This camera does that spectacularly, even in fully-automatic, auto-focus mode.<br/><br/>I’ve also always wanted a camera that can take great low-light / night shots. My iPhone camera was actually not bad for day-to-day photos but it took HORRIBLE night shots. The moon, for example, was always nothing more than a blurry blob no matter how still I  stayed. Not so with this camera! The dark shots I’ve taken thus far have all been nice and crisp/clear rather than grainy.  Overall I’m very, very happy with my purchase and I haven’t even used the extra telephoto lens that came with it yet! There is still so much I have yet to learn about its many features so I know it’s only going to get better and better once I learn what all its many options can do.</span>
