<span>Sounds directing horn on each bud can be rotated. As shipped, in my experience, the horn outlet contacts bottom of ear channel. This caused irritating pressure. By grasping the body of earbud and outer edge of sound directing horn with finger pressure I was able to realign the output toward the top of ear channel. The relief was on the spot with an improvement in overall enjoyment. I was pleased with sound quality. No microphone, an wire adapter was needed for fitting Galaxy 9 and Lenovo laptop.</span>

<span>Don't expect the most amazing sound quality from these - these are not noise isolating. They serve my purpose well - to listen to things (video games, music, podcasts etc.) while still being able to hear what is going on around me.<br/><br/>And to be honest the sound quality is better than I expected. Due to the fact that they don't seal in your ear, there is a lack of bass, but the mids and highs actually sound quite nice!<br/><br/>I wish more headphones had the ear clip these days. These can become a tad uncomfortable if you try to push them into your concha too hard, I find they are best just resting behind your tragus and antitragus.</span>

<span>I been buying these cheap sports ear buds every year for the last 4 years. I work maintenance so they usually last a little over a year before I do something and break them. They have never been the same brand, yet I feel they are all made by the same manufacturer. Honestly, I just find this style for under $30, make sure they have the water resistance and press buy, but they are all look and operate the same regardless of the name of the brand. I think one manufacture makes these and then just lets other companies toss their brand on it and that's fine saves me from trying to find exactly what I purchases the year before.<br/><br/>So this review is for every headset that looks like this pair and has the same features.<br/><br/>With that said, they keep getting better every year. They have always been comfortable and come with 4 total size ear moldings for a good enough fit, I get ear fatigue very easy and highly dislike earbuds in general, but the ear band keeps them in so I can worry more about comfort than them falling out.<br/>The initial connection to my phone has gotten so quick, the mic quality has become better where my contractors don't even know they are on a headset (compared to my first pair where I had to turn it off to talk) the battery life has always been amazing for the price, I get a full 8 hour day worth with plenty of juice left to spare. I wouldn't go for 2 days though unless they're only in use half the day. They aren't the loudest but you'll hear your music while using power tools, you'll just also hear your power tools also. I do get "jump scared" a lot if someone comes up behind me and doesn't yell. These also have never failed me in the rain either.<br/><br/>All in all if you want a cheap pair of "throw away" headphones and you like the "sports loop" and the wire that you can drape them over your neck while not in use, then these are 5 stars. Just don't overpay, as I said, you can find these same pairs from $20-$50 all over Amazon and I fully believe they are all made by one manufacture regardless of the brand. I pay (on average) $25 for these.</span>

<span>I have purchased a similar pair of Bluetooth headphones from another company that was at the time considered an “Amazon Choice” because of their high ratings and economical price point. I have actively used them for the last few months and was asked by Otium to try their product.<br/><br/>Shipping was fast (I received the headphones in two days), and the next morning opened up my shipment to try the headphones out.<br/><br/>Packaging was simple to get into—no tape or plastic wrap covering the product; only a cardboard sleeve with the box that contained the headphones. Upon opening, everything was neatly packaged, and there was no damage to any of the inner contents.<br/><br/>The zipper case containing the headphones displayed the Otium company logo on the outside of it, was black in color and had a carabiner attached to it so you could carry it on a backpack, purse, belt loop, or anything that you could think of to connect it to. Inside the case was the headphones, and two additional sizes of earpieces and a plastic cinch to keep the wire between the right and left side of the headphones from flopping around. Also, in the box was a USB cable to charge the headphones, a warranty card that gives the customer an additional 6-month free warranty for buying the product and an instruction manual explaining the use of the headphones, including troubleshooting, and also what is allowed and not allowed with the waterproof feature of the headphones, which I will get to later in this review.<br/><br/>The first thing the instructions suggest is to charge the product entirely, which takes 1-2 hours to charge. When I plugged the USB into my laptop, it only took a little less than an hour to charge the headphones fully. The one thing I noticed immediately about the headphones that the ones I had purchased a few months earlier were that the part that wraps around the ear to keep them in place was stiffer than my previous ones. I liked that because the other headphones had a very flimsy ear wrap.<br/><br/>Connecting them to my iPhone X was simple and easy. You hold the power button down for a total of eight seconds to pair to your phone. Then, you go to your Bluetooth settings, and either the name “Otium” will appear (depending on your phone), or you will need to type in a password for it, which is “0000”. After pairing your headphones to your phone, you are ready to go. You also have the option for “multi-pairing” to two devices, which I thought was a cool feature!<br/><br/>As far as the buttons, the power button (located on the right side) turns on/off the headphones, pairs the headphones to up to two devices and answers/ends/rejects phone calls/redials the last number called. You can also transfer/pause/play audio with the power button. The volume controls allow you to mute the microphone/turn up and down the volume and move forward/reverse audio tracks that you are listening to.<br/>You can talk up to 8 hours, which I will admit I have never tried, and they state that the standby time is close to 220 hours, which is all dependent on usage.<br/><br/>The headphones sound great! The voices come in clear, and there is a decent amount of bass, which I tend to like. The earphones stay in my ear, which is another feature I appreciate, considering that the Apple earbuds and other headsets I have tried in the past have not fit well in my ears (I must have a larger left ear canal, because that is the side that all of my earphones would fall out of!). The wire connecting the earphones stays out of my way, and I usually don’t use the cinch, because I am a bigger person in size, and do not like having something constricting in the back of my head. The ear wrap is comfortable around my ears, the only downfall is that they are not adjustable for different ear sizes, but they are flexible to fit around different ear sizes of most people. The earbuds allow a for some noise isolation – another great feature! The volume sounds pretty good at different levels; it becomes just a little distorted at higher volumes. I’ve seen a few negative reviews that have mentioned that they have difficulty pairing to their phone after a period using the Bluetooth headphones, but I have not used them long enough to experience that problem. The box does give information on how to contact them if there are any technical problems, so if anything does happen in the future, I will try to reach out to them and see how they handle customer service issues. Finally, the price point is perfect! With other higher-end headphones on the market, for an economical pair of headphones, these are great!<br/><br/>The only negatives are first, the volume buttons. I’m used to holding down on the button on older earbuds due to my age (LOL!), and I keep forgetting that it will skip to the next song or go back to the previous song. However, I’m slowly getting used to repeatedly clicking to turn up/down the volume, so it is something that is a minor complaint that I can quickly get over. Secondly, I was listening to Amazon Prime Music on my iPhone through these headphones and paused the music to hear what my wife was saying at the time. When I went to play the music as instructed in the manual, it would not restart the music. I had to open the app and manually press the play button to continue listening to music. That was frustrating. If I was driving down the road while listening to music, it is inconvenient to go to look down at my phone and keep driving down the road and risk having an accident happen. I did try listening to a podcast and tried pausing and playing using the same process, and it worked, so it is a software issue, which I hope Amazon would fix in the future.<br/><br/>Now, I told you that I would mention what you can get away with when it comes to water. The instruction manual states that you can get away with splashes, rain, snow, incidental exposure to water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes, and believe it or not, showering! Seriously! Who showers with headphones on?! I am nervous to try that, but it would be interesting to see if it would actually withstand a shower!<br/><br/>Situations it cannot withstand when it comes to water is swimming or any type of watersports, which makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>I would honestly recommend these headphones for the ease of use, quality and price point! I gave my wife the headphones I previously purchased and have used these full-time! These are great headphones! Buy yours today!</span>

<span>I have little to complain about other than the volume governor it apparently has in it. I expected to use it while doing woodworking and metal crafts. But the volume cuts off too low. It seems to have an adequate amount of noise cancellation and the batter recharges in a reasonable amount of time and I don't have to worry about one of the buds disappearing. I would lose both or none with the connector wire.</span>

<span>I have purchased these twice already and both times they only lasted about 6 months. I like the sound quality, I like the noise cancellation feature and they are very comfortable to wear and I could get about 10 hours out of a single charge but I can never get them to work more than six months. They start off great but then they eventually will start to disconnect to my phone and then reconnect several times within a few minutes. then the next day they work fine. I know from that point on the will just eventually stop working. I can turn them on to connect to my phone but then they immediately turn off.  Also if I pause them they restart again automatically about 3 seconds later.  I tried the factory reset ( which I read in the manual ), hoping that would help but it didn't.  Now all this things don't start happening until a few months in.  They work well to start with. I bought my last pair in April 2022 and I need to buy a new pair. Even though I have had issues with them I do like them  and I will be buying a new pair today.  I think for the price they are worth it. Maybe I am too rough with them but I really don't think so. I do use them while at work so they are used 5 days a week for at least 8 hours a day.  Maybe six months is all I should expect from them ??<br/>But again, I do really love them, just wish they lasted longer. off to purchase another pair.</span>

<span>I wear hearing aids and when I play music through them I lose all mids aand bass. I thought I'd give this a try. The first time I put them on tears came to my eyes. I heard songs that I wrote and recorded in a way I only imagined, I had no idea they came out so good. The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is the bass still has room for improvement, they are too tight and become uncomfortable after a little while and finally you cannot lay your head back and rest.

<span>Yeah, this is the TLDR review :)<br/><br/>I wasn't looking but ran across these bone-conducting headphones and was a little skeptical even though I understood the concept and it seemed solid. I vacillated between options at several different price points before deciding to start roughly in the middle. Also, this brand has a pretty solid reputation from what I've found. I found the idea interesting, and I chose these over a couple of others in the same price range.<br/><br/>I am a music composer and producer and I have a studio in my home, so I'm always looking for different ways of auditioning my compositions in different environments and on different equipment, so I basically saw these as just another way to hear how my productions sound. I also like to use binaural beats and thought this would be a good option (assuming they worked well enough) and I can do that while keeping my ears open to my surroundings.<br/><br/>Now, I always pay attention to packaging, even though I realize some manufacturers try to be slick and put a lot into the packaging and not much into the product. Nevertheless, these come in a nice box with a quality feel to it, so that was the initial positive. If you're like me and have never seen this type of headphone before, you'll probably think they look a little weird, as I did. They have a nice, quality feel to them and seem sturdily built. I got the blue ones, because of the blue strip I think looks cool, but I didn't realize they come with several other alternative strips so you can have a different decorative design if you like.<br/><br/>One thing I worried about, and it turns out I needn't have, is how much pressure they would apply on the area where they are designed to sit, which is right in front of your ear canal. Too much pressure there would likely cause headaches. The pressure is barely noticeable within a moment or two of putting them on. The frame between the two 'speakers' is rigid titanium so it keeps a permanent curl that maintains enough pressure to be able to hear them consistently no matter how you move your head. That frame though, will sometimes hit the collar of my shirt and change the angle and pressure of the pads, but not by much and not enough to negatively affect the overall sound to an unacceptable degree, and least to me.<br/><br/>And speaking of sound...<br/><br/>They sound amazingly good considering how they work. I thought bass would be too thin but it's not. It's not going to rattle your chest, but it's surprisingly deep, fat and present. I've listened to several of my songs that are at various stages of completion and they all sound true to the level they're at. A polished, fully mastered tune sounds, well, polished and fully mastered! Also, when I listen to binaural beats, even with ambient sounds mixed in, they sound clear and immersive. They are able to get loud enough that ambient sound is not distracting from what you're listening to, unless of course it needs to be (e.g., urgent or emergency situation).<br/><br/>I haven't yet turned them up all the way (haven't needed to) or used them with a phone call, so I can't comment on either right now. They charge via USB-C, which I prefer, but charging time is a little long considering you only get about six hours of use on a full charge. I would have preferred around 10-12 hours ideally. They can't be used while charging (connecting the cable turns them off), but I can't imagine who would need to anyway. Pairing them with my phone was no more complicated than pairing any other Bluetooth device; you just have to remember to start with them OFF when you want to pair them. They come with a nice little drawstring bag for storage, but though I'm not likely to use it, it's a nice touch.<br/><br/>If you want a richer, more immersive sound, you can just plug your ears; a pair of simple foam earplugs will do. Of course, you will lose the advantage of being able to hear your surroundings clearly, but that may be what you want from time to time. Some brands come with earplugs, but these did not.<br/><br/>There are two reasons I deducted one star: charging time vs battery life, and the fact that the frame sometimes hits my collar and slightly moves the pads. I would only have deducted a half a star for both issues if I could have. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend these to anyone wanting to check out this relatively new tech. I don't know how close to the quality of these I could have come with a cheaper set, or how much better a more expensive set would sound. I just know I'm very satisfied with these. Give your ear canal a break and try them, I think most people will find them surprisingly effective.</span>

<span>Fantastic device.  Finally something for those who can't tolerate "in the ear" devices.  I never could  tolerate beyond a half hour before the ache set in. Have always needed some earphone with wire- cumbersome and in the way. This Shokz is great, comfortable, secure and can wear for hours.  The sound is great and I really like the very low profile compared to larger, ear or  headphones.  I wear these while biking, running and working out. Even  while mowing the lawn. Only this activity requires full volume and adjust them to sit over my ear canal as opposed to sitting just in front of ear. Controls are useful and simple. Three buttons for on-off,  volume, battery check and a pause that stops podcast or audio in case you need to interact with the world.  Despite not being on or over the ear,  you get plenty of sound to overcome ambient noise. Of course, you can lower volume if you need to hear your surroundings. 5 stars!</span>

<span>They fit nicely and the sound quality is fine (not great). The case is sleek and has good motion.<br/><br/>I have three main complaints:<br/><br/>1 - The charging case just picks and chooses when it wants to charge the buds. Sometimes I'll take them out and they say like 25% after charging all night in a fully charged case, and I haven't been able to figure it out yet.<br/><br/>2 - The range is pitiful. If my phone is in my pocket and I crouch (AKA, my thigh is now "blocking" my phone) the earbuds will start going spotty. Not great for working out. Frustrating.<br/><br/>3 - The buttons are weird. For me, the buttons are for quick access to actions you use a lot or need quickly (without digging your phone out of your pocket), like pausing, skipping songs, or changing volume.<br/>"Pressing either earbud once will pause the music." Great.<br/>"Pressing two times on the right will up the volume while doing so on the left earbud will lower it." Also great.<br/>But then we get into: "press and hold left earbud to launch and play Spotify"? That's something you do before you even put the earbuds on, tbh. Plus, it's literally one tap to launch Spotify. And what if you don't use Spotify?<br/>"Press and hold right earbud to share audio between two skullcandy Skull-iQ enabled products"?? Never going to need this in my life. Waste of a setting.<br/><br/>For real, there is no skip or shuffle shortcuts? I ruined my run trying to figure out how to skip songs because I figured it must be possible. Nope!<br/><br/>I would be fine if I paid $20-$40 for these, but for $70 I just expected more.</span>

<span>These earbuds have great sound quality, &amp; their ability to stay in place during sports, outside work, &amp; exercise. However the app is specific to your location (USA),  if you live outside of that, then you cannot use the app &amp; you loose the other quality features of the earbuds like active noise cancelling, voice control for touch less features. Skull Candy does not advertise this UNLESS you go into a few pages of the help &amp; support site, where it tells you about the app. Very disappointed that I cannot use the app &amp; the active noise cancelling feature,  but still happy with the earbuds &amp; their ability to stay in place during sports, outside work, &amp; exercise.</span>

<span>So far from what I've been able to hear out of my new<br/>Skullcandy earphones is that they help cancel out noise in the background. they most certainly do help stay in your ear instead of constantly slipping out like I've had problems with some of my other earphones and so far seem to be good earphones. Not Great but good. And here's two reasons why. 1 is that the sound quality while pretty decent could be better. 2 is that the base isnt that good, it's alright at best but if you really like to hear the base these might not be for you. Although from what I've read on other comments there appears to be an app for these earphones that might be able to help that I have yet to try</span>

<span>I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.<br/>I'd give these a "4 1/2 stars out of five"<br/><br/>On the good side:<br/><br/>1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone.  I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want.  Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional.  But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/>2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.<br/><br/>3)  As for the fit:  these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out).  The fit is perfect.  (See my notes further down for the "comfort")<br/><br/>4) I've rarely had problems pairing.  I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone.  I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.<br/><br/>OK, the "not so good" side:<br/><br/>1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.<br/><br/>2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life).  You "can" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.<br/><br/>3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure.  Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.<br/><br/>Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears "breathe".<br/><br/>Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5.  The three things I mentioned are not "deal breakers" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours.  As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Also, there is no ANC.  Yes, there's "noise reduction" but not cancellation.  I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC.  However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.<br/><br/>So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them.  I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking).  I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.<br/><br/>I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if "the grass is greener" with another set.  I have to be honest, after buying these,  my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.<br/><br/>Most reviews I've read are positive on this product.  Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive.  I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.</span>

<span>I received this product on July 17th and started using it.  About one week ago, the right earbud just stopped connecting to my phone.  I have done everything the Beats website says to fix the issue - cleaning, resetting, making sure it is properly set in the charging base, etc. - and nothing has worked.  The right earbud is effectively dead.  I now have to bring it into the Apple store to get it fixed - just two months after purchasing this item.  For the cost, I shouldn't have to be doing this.  My Bose earbuds are two years old and continue to work without any issues, ever.  I bought this set of Beats Pro because they loop around your ear.  They really need to ensure that the product is good.  I'm not an Apple person and this only sours me towards the whole of Apple products.<br/><br/>Buyer beware that this product, whilst good, may have issues.<br/><br/>Just received the product back from Apple.  My experience with Apple left much to be desired and reinforces my avoidance of Apple in favor of Samsung.  The Apple store was terribly unorganized, which did surprise me.  They don't stock this product in store, so I had to wait three days to get it back from their "repair" shop - which actually replaced the item since it was nonfunctioning.<br/><br/>I dare say this will be my last Apple product.  But, the earbuds are good and now doing what I paid for them to do.</span>

<span>I have had my Powerbeats Pro for about a week now and after a bit of a rocky start and an adjustment period, I find them to be almost perfect headphones. When I first put them on, I was wildly disappointed. They were uncomfortable and sounded tinny with no bass at all. I genuinely believed I would be returning them and getting second gen Air Pods instead. But, given how excited I was for the Powerebeats Pro to come out and the cost, I decided to put in a little effort and give them a chance. It wasn't until about 3 or 4 days in that I decided to keep them.<br/><br/>So, if  you are like me and think your new Powerbeats Pro sound like garbage when you first put them on and you wonder if all the positive reviewers are high, experiment with all the tips before dismissing the headphones as crap. In-ear buds need a good seal to sound good. I have freakishly small ears so I always start with the smallest tip available when trying out new headphones which usually works for me. Not this time. It sounded awful and I was briefly outraged that I had paid $250 for garbage. It was counter-intuitive, but I finally tried the biggest tips instead which gave me a good seal and let me wear the headphones without having to go as deep into my ears which made them more comfortable too. Once I found the right fit with a good seal, I discovered that yes, in fact, these things do actually have some nice ear-thumping bass. I think the bass is better than original Air Pods but also not overwhelming as Beats products have a reputation for being. It's satisfyingly skull shaking without being distorted and is balanced out nicely by clear highs. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I won't listen to any old crap either. I like a little bass and good clarity and the Powerbeats Pro deliver.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with these is comfort. As I mentioned, I have freakishly small ears and while I have been using Air Pods for a couple years, I was doing so with discomfort. I put up with a little paind because of the convenience of function. I love the automatic connection, the ability to use one bud at a time and charging on the go in the case. So, when I first read about the Powerbeats Pro, I was expecting something that would have the convenience of Air Pods with better comfort and something that wouldn't fall out of my ears all the time. Generally, I do okay with headphones that have different sizes of silicone tips so I was expecting the Powerbeats Pro to be a comfort upgrade. Initially, they actually hurt my ears more than Air Pods, especially my right ear. I fully blame this on my freakishly small ears. I'm one of those people who often finds "one size fits all" to be laughably ridiculous. Again, I was determined to love these things so I tinkered a bit to find an acceptable level of discomfort. The largest tip allows me to get a good seal without having to put them in so deep, relieving some pressure and cutting down on pain. When I first tried them, I could only last about 20 minutes before the pain forced me to take them out. After adjusting to find a good angle and replacing the silicone tips with Comply Sport tips, I'm a lot more comfortable and can last 2 or 3 hours before I feel discomfort. Even then, I would call it discomfort and not outright pain. It's discomfort I can live with and not any worse than what I experience with Air Pods. Also, my discomfort is only in my right ear instead of both like I get with Air Pods. Since I go with one bud a lot of the time, I'll just use the left one. No biggie. I can't blame the manufacturer for my tiny ears which is why I'm not taking away a star.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the fit is very secure. I have worked out in them several times and they don't budge. I never could work out in Air Pods because they fell out all the time. I can also wear these while laying down which I couldn't do in Air Pods without them falling out periodically. Also, the connection is great. Original Air Pods used to randomly lose connection or not connect when they were supposed to. The chip upgrade in the Powerbeats Pro seems to have resolved this little annoyance. They connect faster and after a week, I haven't experienced a drop or glitch once.<br/><br/>The Powerbeats Pro do come with a tradeoff when it comes to the size of the case. If you are used to carrying around Air Pods in your pocket in their tiny case, forget about it with Powerbeats Pro. The case is significantly larger. It goes in a bag or purse without taking up a ton of room but it's too big to fit comfortably in a pocket. The extra battery life for Powerbeats is nice though. I frequently use one bud at a time and used to drain an Air Pod and have to switch ears regularly. I'm using the Powerbeats Pro the same way and haven't drained a bud yet. I'm okay with the bigger case since the better battery life makes me feel secure about leaving the case at home when I need to go bagless.<br/><br/>So in summary, these are the best sounding buds I have used. They are super convenient, easy to connect and won't fall out of your ears. If you have normal human sized ears, they will probably be comfortable and the battery life is great. You have to deal with a bigger case but the positive improvements over Air Pods make the size trade-off worth it. If you don't hear the bass, try different tips and twist them around a bit before you give up. Hopefully you won't have to work as hard at it as I did to find your happy place with Powerbeats Pro but the effort has been worth it. These are really great headphones and worth the price.</span>

<span>I looked at quite a few [in ear] buds to find something that I could use for running that would stay in my ears and provide a good sound seal. I settled on the PowerBeats Pro because it met all of my requirements for good sound, relatively inexpensive and connected easily to my iPhone. Of course you never for know sure if the reviews you've read will meet your use case, but the Pro did. The volume controls are easy to use during running and if I get a phone call, the music stops and I can answer the phone. So I can highly recommend these buds for runners and non-runners alike. The battery lasts forever so that is a major plus.</span>

<span>Hey fellow Amazonians!<br/><br/>I have bought so many different pairs of wireless buds and given them all away.  Either they weren't loud enough, sounded terrible / I sounded terrible on calls, or were downright uncomfortable.  The JBL Endurance Peak 2's are SO close!<br/><br/>Wear ability:<br/>These are great and feel light.  I don't have the feeling that they'll fall out.  The speaker portion isn't ungodly big and they're just mostly comfortable.<br/><br/>Battery Life:<br/>Not impressed. With their large frame, I would expect a much longer on-ear time.  Their claimed 6hrs is definitely with the volume on minimum.  I like to use ear buds to sleep with.  They may last 4hrs realistically at sleeping volumes.<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>These are not bass kings.  They are decent in the midrange but fail in the bright highs and lows.  Voice calls are super clear however.  Don't expect to get these loud either.  I sleep with these at 75% volume.  The mic does pickup amazing for calls.  They're better at picking my voice up than my built-in laptop ones on zoom calls.<br/><br/>Ergonomics (Touch Buttons):<br/>These are cool but, they don't pickup my fingers all that well so it looks like I'm batting my ears to get them to function.  They did pickup better when my fingers were sweaty.  The slide function only works on the right ear bud and I will say, that's the best function of the whole thing.  The swipe function picks up so well that the residual heat on my pillow turned my volume up/down.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I like these ear buds.  I'd recommend them at $79 or less just for the comfort and trust factor (as in they won't fall out.)</span>
