<span>I purchased the JBL Go 3 recently to take to the beach or outdoor gatherings.  I'm blown away with the actual speaker size compared to the sound output.  We recently used it at the beach where you would need to turn it up a bit louder just to hear past the crashing waves, etc.  The JBL performed like a beast!  The sound was crisp at higher volumes and the portability allows for you to hang it from your chair...no problem!  I'm a new JBL fan!!  Definitely worth the money.</span>

<span>Needed something to travel with and this little unit fit the bill. Small, easy to pack and light weight. Looks nice also and easy to operate. No brainer operations.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Wow the sound quality is absolutely INCREDIBLE in such a small form factor. JBL never disappoints! And it was on sale for $30 so that's a literal STEAL. Love that it charges with type-c that's such an added bonus, and it's water proof. I can't get over the sound quality, my face was like :O when I first started playing music on it. 10/10 recommend!</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got this so I can play music when I'm getting ready in the mornings or cleaning the house.  This little device packs a very powerful punch.  It's full, rich sound is amazing considering it's small size.  My phone speakers just weren't cutting it and I needed something with a little more oomph.  This does it.  Setup was quick and easy.  It took a few hours to fully charge.  Haven't used it long yet so cannot comment on the battery life at all.  I do wish you could adjust the bass and treble settings on the speaker, but you cannot.  That is the only reason for the 4 stars at this time.</span>

<span>I have been on the hunt for finding the perfect bluetooth speaker for my needs.<br/>UE makes great stuff. I first tried their hyperboom which was an awesome speaker that sounded great. It's just pretty big and cumbersome. Great for if you don't wanna move it around a lot.<br/><br/>I downsized to this one. The size is perfect and has been great in many different scenarios. You can really toss it around and not be concerned with damaging it at all. The fit and finish is top notch along with the form factor.<br/><br/>Right out of the box though I wasn't very impressed with the sound quality. They advertise "thundering bass" or whatever, but I was underwhelmed even with the most bass heavy songs with the speaker placed in a corner to help reverberate the sound.<br/>I figured it might just need some breaking in before it starts to sound better, but after a couple weeks of using it every day it had no change in sound quality.<br/>Overall it really doesn't sound horrible, but I'm picky with my audio and speakers and headphones, etc. It's probably fine for the vast majority of people out there.<br/><br/>After almost a month of using it, it started to develop some pretty bad distortion on the bass when played at even medium volumes. Some songs were exceptionally bad with the low end distortion.<br/>I had not used the speaker in any water or had it ever been submerged so I can rule that out as to a possible cause to it.<br/><br/>I also feel that after a month of using it, the battery life doesn't seem to be what it first was out of the box. Maybe this is because I'm using it louder environments where it needs to be played slightly louder, but this is just my observation.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this speaker, but I've moved on to now try the anker soundcore motion boom with higher hopes.</span>

<span>It's fine when I'm using it to play music from Spotify, but when I try to use it for a phone call or play a movie through my PC (with all volume settings maxed out on the PC, meaning windows volume, app volume, and media player volume) it's often not loud enough to hear what people are saying.</span>

<span>I’ve been a hardcore JBL fan for years. I have a pair of Flip 5 (my go-to), a Clip 3, two Go 2, a Go 3, a Charge 2, and an Xtreme 3. The Go 2 is actually my favorite balance of sound, portability and still having speakerphone with a mic, from which JBL is going away. All of these are fine, but I thought I would try something new. Boy am I glad I did. My Sony XB-13 is my new favorite of the bunch.<br/><br/>XB-13 vs Go 3:<br/><br/>XB-13 doesn’t play as loud, but the sound quality is far superior to my Go 3. More bass. Clear, more robust sound.<br/><br/>XB-13 has phone speakerphone with microphone, while Go 3 does not.<br/><br/>XB-13 battery lasts for days vs Go 3 which lasts for hours. XB-13 battery level works in the Apple iPhone battery widget, which Go 3 does not. In fact, the Go 3 has no level indicator except low when the white light turns red.<br/><br/>XB-13 cylinder shape better and more portable than the Go 3 rectangular brick, in my personal opinion. It also seems to radiate sound better for 360 degree listening vs Go 3 which is completely directional. This is a weird one, but the XB-13 plays quieter when I want to. Often, I wish the Go 3 had a 1/2 volume level.<br/><br/>XB-13 about ¾ the size of a soda can. Go 3 about the size of two decks of playing cards back to back. They weight about the same.<br/><br/>XB-13 looks and feels like slightly better construction than Go 3. Better tactile feel from buttons.<br/><br/>As of this writing, XB-13 is $48, while Go 3 is $49.99. Regardless of any sale price or discounts, I would still purchase the XB-13 over the Go 3.</span>

<span>I read some unfavorable reviews regarding sound quality, but that did not discourage me from trying. Two perspectives regarding my purchase were considered. Price and size. I was not expecting BOSE quality sound for the price of these. The sound is adequate, battery life is great, portability great, price (Prime Day purchase) great. These meet my expectations of what I purchased them for. I have not paired them to create stereo sound (you can pair these) but I am confident they would sound better, I don't need to try, if I want hi-fidelity sounds I use my stereo system.</span>

<span>It's an adequate speaker for this price point.  I'll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine.  I do not feel like I wasted money, but if/when I buy another of these types of speakers it won't be a JBL.  It's been at least 3 years since I've bought one of these BT speakers and my last speaker was just as loud/clear, cost less, had features that just worked, and even came with a lanyard for easy carry.  This thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands.<br/><br/>-Volume and Sound Quality:  It's loud in a room with no ambient noise. My music is mostly 90's rock like Metallica, Pantera, White Zombie.  I like loud music and for my private office it's perfect.<br/>I'll mostly listen at 1/3 volume so I can think, but it's nice to jam out sometimes. At middle volume level the sound is the best (lows vs highs) above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise.  You could use this in an environment with ambient noise, like a warehouse or kitchen, but you would need to stay around 5' if you want to really enjoy what is playing.  After 10' it's probably going to sound more like noise than music.<br/>-Phone Connectivity is simple for music just push a top button, but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker I had in the price point.  There are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this, the manual certainly is no help, but it's not what I needed it for.  I just liked it as a nice side feature I used sometimes with my last speaker like this.<br/>-Battery Life is fine, I haven't done complete testing on this.  It does have a pretty significant battery in it for the "charge your device" option, but 20 hrs?  Maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music.  I won't need it for longer than 4hrs most of the time, so I doubt this will come up as an issue for me.<br/>-There's an app but it does very little for this speaker.  Most "useful" feature is a digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker.  Thankfully for it's main function of BT Connecting and playing music it's pretty basic and simple.  If you go the route of multiple speakers, reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work.  It is not intuitive, it's a series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with, and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews.</span>

<span>I was debating between the JBL charge 4 and a different version of the JBL and I’m so glad I went with this one! The sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely. JBL speakers on Amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop! The quality is amazing and it’s so load for how small it is. This one doesn’t come with a case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality I haven’t had any issues or scratches and I’ve just been throwing it in a tote bag! The charging port for your phone is so nice too, and chargers relatively fast. If you’re debating between this one and a pricier one I would go with the Charge 4!</span>

<span>Not into the latest commercial fads but I am very impressed by these radios. The size and sound is about the same as a high end radio. This streaming radio has an unlimited operating range along with solving many of the problems associated with "bad reception". Truly a revolutionary breakthrough for the still strong radio listening audience. Living in NYC I am now able to clearly listen to one of my favorite radio stations from Massachusetts along with one in my area that has a weak signal. I love its portability along with its apparently long rechargeable battery life. Have listened to higher rated more costly products of the same size but honestly hear very little difference. I own a much higher end, powerful, stereo system for a more engaging musical experience. A well designed, water resistant, portable unit that can be used at home or outdoors. Have fun finding some of your out of area (online) radio stations and enjoy this wonderful new technology...</span>

Ready for adventure, Beosound Explore is a tough, waterproof speaker designed for the great outdoors. Durability is part of Beosound Explore's core DNA. The tough outer shell is made from hard anodised aluminium, making it our most scratch resistant portable speaker yet. Built to withstand a fall of up to 1.5 metres or submersion in a metre of water for up to 30 minutes, Beosound Explore is a waterproof and dust resistant speaker that’s ready to accompany you on any adventure. Whether you're relaxing at the beach or taking in the views on an adrenaline-filled hiking expedition, your Bluetooth speaker can be confidently placed beside you thanks to the non-slip rubberised base. Crafted to be flexible and ultra-portable, it’s lightweight and easy to carry too. The grab-and-go design is perfect when you're on the move. You can even attach Beosound Explore to the outside of your backpack by hooking the included carabiner to it. The dual 1.8'' full range drivers deliver a huge musical punch and rich bass for such a small speaker. The grill is cut in 360-degree lines, which not only looks great but also helps create True360 omnidirectional sound. You can place your Beosound on a rock behind you, in the middle of a circle of people, or use the strap to hang it from a tent pole and the sound performance will be equally authentic. The elegant and minimalist control panel is on top of the speaker for easy access and the push buttons have been designed to work in all conditions, even if your speaker is covered in sand, water or a dusting of soil. The powerful battery offers up to 27 hours of playtime at a normal listening volume, making it easy to enjoy music when you're exploring in the wilderness or away from easy power sources. You can also stereo pair two Beosound Explore speakers for a more spacious sound, ideal if you're away with friends or hosting a garden party. No matter where your adventures take you, the uncompromising sound quality of the Beosound Explore will get you there.

<span>I love music and think bass has been over-emphasized over the years.  I also live in a space with shared walls.  The music coming out of this thing is solid and sweet sounding.

<span>So I ordered this speaker because I was recommended by a fellow musician friend.<br/>The sound quality is superb, HOWEVER, it lacks on bass, to a point where it’s useless. I’m a musician and I usually don’t want too much of anything, but there is absolutely no bass! And don’t be fooled by the comments recommending to use the app to add more bass, that adds barely anything. So even with blasting the bass on the app all the way up, there is no bass at all. I don’t expect a small speaker like this to have a nice sub level, but having no bass at all, it sounds like only your treble (highs) would play back the music and there is no body to the sound.<br/>I still have it 5 stars for overall because they handled the return very professionally.</span>

<span>I’ve seen too many bad reviews on this one so I wanted to give my opinion. First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc.  You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesn’t really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.<br/><br/>I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.<br/><br/>If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious. I love it!<br/><br/>I forgot to mention… the build quality is superb!</span>

<span>Yeah, I get it, when you don’t pay a lot you aren’t gonna get a lot. This plays for hours on a single charge and can get pretty loud without much distortion. But the promised bass is lacking and I’m a bass guy. Bluetooth connectivity is easy to my iPhone and iPad. Overall, a decent product for the price.</span>

<span>I needed a BT speaker for a family member who is hard of hearing. It woks perfectly with the Amazon Firestik 4K. If the BT speaker is turned on the Firestik pairs automatically and mutes the TV. If the BT is off, the Firestik routes the sound to the TV seamlessly.<br/>The battery lasts a really long time. I think it needs a charge about once per month.<br/>The sound quality is good and the unit is nice and heavy. Gives it a full sound.</span>

<span>All together the speaker is really good. It’s quite loud which is good but it has a weird thing where you can hear it really well when you’re in front of it, but when you’re anywhere else around it, it’s very quiet. Might be because it’s not a two way speaker. But yeah, very worth the money!</span>

<span>I've had this for a few months now, and I'm super happy with it.<br/><br/>I use it for both Zoom and phone calls, and both with my Macbook and phone, and it works seamlessly for both. A lot of Bluetooth devices suck, but this happily and quickly connects to my phone with no problems. The battery life is good, too. I think you could a day or more of active use out of it.<br/><br/>I've never had anybody have trouble understanding me and calls and voices sound good. You can use it as a generic speaker and it works well for things like podcasts. Music is fine although not stellar, but it's not exactly designed for that.</span>

<span>I started searching for a wireless bluetooth speakers to use for conference calls/video calls which occupy. most of my day during our current work-from-home status. While my office uses Skype for Business and is migrating to Microsoft Teams, we also have videoconferences on GoToMeeting, Webex, Zoom and others. Based on those needs and not wanting to spend a tremendous amount of money, I decided to buy the Jabra Speak 510 especially after a colleague told me he had been using it with good results.<br/><br/>Delivery was swift and I excitedly connected the speaker via Bluetooth to Dell 7290. Unfortunately, my colleagues complained that my voice was hard to hear and somewhat garbled. Thus began my interactions with the Jabra Support team. The details follow below but the bottom line is that I was extremely pleased with both the Jabra telephone support and email responsiveness. After following the steps outlined below, I have now used the device without any issues for the past week and I am very satisfied with the product.<br/><br/>First steps suggested by Jabra Support:<br/>1. Make sure  install the latest firmware through Jabra Direct software before using the device.<br/>2. Jabra does NOT recommend using Bluetooth to connect to a computer; they strongly recommended to connect the Jabra device via USB only.<br/>3. While speaking to Jabra Support via phone, we also reviewed my audio settings on the Dell laptop including sensitivity of the microphone.<br/><br/>**These first three steps suggested by Jabra Support did improve the sound of my voice and colleagues no longer complained. However, I started hearing some periodic crackling and interruption of audio for about 2 seconds very intermittently. It sounded like interference so I moved all of my other devices and cell phone away from the Jabra but the audio problems persisted.<br/><br/>So, I called Jabra Support again after an exchange of emails to make sure I was not using a USB hub because they recommend against that, too. During the phone call, we reviewed several options including trying a different USB port and trying a different computer. And, if that didn't work, Jabra Support agreed that they would replace the device.<br/><br/>Next steps:<br/>4. I tried a different USB port on the Dell. Same problem.<br/>5. My personal computer is a MacBook Pro 2017 (15") which only has USB-C ports. So, contrary to Jabra's advice, I used the Jabra with my MacBook (Zoom) using a USB hub not expecting it to work. However, the device worked flawlessly - good sound on my end; no issues with my voice on the other end.<br/>6. Therefore, I decided to try the USB-C hub with the Dell (which also has a USB-C connection). And...the microphone and speaker are working very well; I've had no complaints from my colleagues and there have been no audio issues.<br/>7. I've also used the USB option with my iPhone and that works well - no issues. To be clear, you can't stand 5 feet away from the device and expect people to hear you. However, if it's on your desk and you are sitting, it works fine.<br/><br/>Using this set up for the past 3-4 days, I've had multiple calls and videoconferences using Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, GoToMeetings, Zoom and Webex. The integration with the mute button only seems to work for Skype and Microsoft Teams (i.e., setting mute on the Jabra device turns the appropriate icon on the screen to "mute"). However, it's pretty easy to know when you're on mute with the Jabra device (red LEDs around the speaker) so even if the icon on the screen isn't showing mute, when the Jabra is muted, you should be "safe."<br/><br/>I haven't tested the battery life fully but it seems to be good. Volume is definitely sufficient. It's not intended to be used for music but for a quick interlude between meetings, it's adequate. I have used the smart button the device with Siri on my iPhone 11 Pro and it works well. The device can be connected to your computer via USB and via your phone via Bluetooth at the same time and it seems the range for the Bluetooth connection is surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Bottom line - I was very close to returning the Jabra 510. However, the excellent support from Jabra and a little experimentation paid off. The Jabra 510 is now a very welcome and comfortable option to the various Bluetooth headsets and other wired headsets I have tried.</span>
