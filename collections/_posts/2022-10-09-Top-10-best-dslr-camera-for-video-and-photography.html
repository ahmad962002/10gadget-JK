When it comes to finding the best DSLR camera for video and photography, there are a few things to look for. One of the most important factors is the camera's ability to shoot in low light conditions. This is because shooting in low light can create some beautiful and cinematic results. Another important factor to consider is the camera's autofocus system. A good autofocus system is important for both photography and video because it ensures that the subject stays in focus at all times. Lastly, it is important to consider the size and weight of the camera. A smaller and lighter camera is easier to take with you on your travels.<table>

<span>Nice build quality, the pictures come out really good with just the kit lense, definitely recommend for any beginner who has never tried photography! Videos suck, but with some editing and good lighting, you can get a video that is good enough for small businesses. I bought a used T7 and the one thing I would change is the eye lense is very blurry, I have to take most of my pictures on the digital display because with the eye lense, you can’t tell if the person or item is in focus. 4/5 camera, if you have the money definitely buy a new camera or go for the cannon M50 or the M50 mark II.</span>

<span>I've loved cannon since I traded up years ago from my beginner point and shoot. This camera was a treat for myself when I decided to start my bucket list and visit Scotland.

<span>I found this camera to have less zoom capability than the Canon PowerShot SX 70 HS, but much easier and more intuitive to set from the menus.  It has similar capabilities overall. It is somewhat better for macro photos but is not as good for landscape in my experience.  It has good innards and a Leica lens.<br/>It is a bridge, or hybrid camera and is very handy, but does not have the capabilities of a DSLR.<br/>There are better YouTube tutorials for this camera, than the Canon PowerShot SX 70.</span>

<span>I've been a hobby/amateur photographer for about 10 years now. I went from a simple point and shoot to an early Canon Rebel, which was probably the wrong move in hindsight. Having to switch lenses all the time for a day out with the family for "snaps" got so annoying that I stopped bringing a camera and relied on our phones.  Phones can take photos, sure, but unless you're a latest model smartphone user (iphone and pixel) the photos are only ever going to be good enough to share on social media, and *maybe* good enough to print 4x6.<br/><br/>I wanted to get back to shooting photos, but I didn't want the hassle of carrying a bunch of gear with me if we were just going to an amusement park, or at a picnic. I looked at Canon bridge/superzoom cameras, (all I had ever owned) but at the 400 dollar range, there was always something about the cameras that I didn't like. Nikon was no better. My sister bought a P900, with it's 600mm zoom, so I looked at that, but I wasn't impressed with the video features (something I have an interest in), the stabilization, lack of hot shoe, and the aperture settings on the lens.<br/><br/>Shopping for cameras means compromise. A bridge/superzoom camera is a compromise. You get a small sensor, and you're stuck with the lens that's on it.  With the constant f2.8 Leica lens, I started looking hard at the FZ300, and found that it's a VERY popular camera worldwide. Graham Houghton has a ton of tutorial videos on YouTube for the camera, and a user's guide on Amazon that dives super deep into the camera's functions and features. If you want to get creative with photography, and want to have an inexpensive all purpose camera, the Panasonic Lumix FZ300 is an excellent choice. The 4k video is great, but most people will only ever use 1080p. The nice thing about 4k is that it can be downsampled to 1080p to produce super clean video.  What is really neat about the FZ300 is the 4k photo mode, which gives you burst photos at 30 frames per second. Great to get action shots of your kid's sports, or wildlife action.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Convenient all in one camera for quick snaps<br/>Plenty of "creative" modes<br/>Full Manual control for advanced amateurs<br/>Fast f2.8 glass<br/>4K video, Photo modes<br/>TILTY FLIPPY TOUCHSCREEN. You'll fall in love with this feature. I did.<br/>Image stabilization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>12MP is small for 2019, but about max for this sensor size<br/>24mm isn't very wide angle<br/>Small sensor (typical with most bridge cameras at this price)<br/>High ISO performance is weak (typical for sensor size)<br/>Battery and memory card slot on the bottom interferes with tripod quick release (there is a solution)<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Fantastic performer for the price. Not as compact as a 100 dollar point and shoot, but a wonderful start to a photography hobby, or for someone who wants a GOOD camera without the headaches of interchangeable lenses. With the addition of the 4K video, it's perfect for someone who is interested in photography and videography. You can step up to the FZ1000 or FZ2500, but you lose zoom range, but gain MP and sensor size, but you're paying DSLR prices for those cameras. If your budget is $1000 and you want a great camera, look at Canon and Nikon APS-C size DSLRs with 2 kit lenses.  If your budget is $4-500 you really can't beat this little gem.<br/><br/>Recommended Accessories:<br/><br/>ALZO liberator offset mount (moves tripod mount out of the way of the battery door)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019E67Q4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>K&amp;F Concept 62'' DSLR Tripod, Lightweight and Compact Aluminum Camera Tripod with 360 Panorama Ball Head Quick Release Plate for Travel and Work (TM2324 Black)<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015CGRREI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br/><br/>Extra Batteries<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TVNR9/?coliid=IDXG6N4V47V09&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Advanced accessories:<br/><br/>Circular Polarizer<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZCAU/?coliid=I2YVFP9ZRSCDFH&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>Variable ND filter<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQB9L81/?coliid=I15IBTBRTJNRHJ&amp;colid=3AROT89CSYJ9V&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</span>

<span>This camera is a great starter camera. I used it as my starter and it is amazing. The focus, 4K shots, nightime view, quality, and zoom is amazing if you're starting out. It produces great photos for a long time. The battery life could be longer but that doesn't take away from how amazing this camera has been for me. 5 Stars. 100% reccomend to starters and/or sports photographers</span>

<span>I have a few cameras and I’ve been using digital cameras since the 90s. Most of them are fairly similar and user-friendly. I’ve only been using it for two months and I’ve already had a lot of problems setting it for macro and for close-up shots. If you go into the settings and start changing things you’ll notice that there is so many settings that you really don’t need or would never thing to use. I don’t want to have to take a course to use a simple digital camera. Even though I have taken a course! As with most digital products it’s all in the software. I would say this has a poor user interface and confusing directions and you can blame it all on the software. I’ve taken some very beautiful pictures with this. But I’ve also spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t focus on macro. If you just want a Camera to take nice shots I would probably steer clear of this one. Get a Nikon.</span>

<span>Canon makes a lot of "Prosumer" level cameras and with the USA Vs. International branding it can get very confusing.<br/>For me it came down to the following "Have to have" points:<br/><br/>24 MegaPixel resolution:<br/><br/>24Mpx allows me to take one product picture and still have enough resolution to zoom in on a portion of the frame and still have Amazon spec (3k x 3k px) image size (resolution). I have an older Rebel (from the late 2000, plus a Rebel SL1 that I borrowed and an Equivalent Nikon from the mid-2010s. This is the only camera that allows me to take a single product picture and still have sufficient resolution to post on Amazon and other places. With the other cameras even the RAW version was not large enough to satisfy Amazon requirement for picture size (so I had to upsample my pictures) after allowing for a modicum of cropping. With the SL1 and the Nikon, I had to take 2 to 3 additional pictures to have a decent resolution sample of the product's smaller features. My old Rebel is about as useful as a hole in the head these days. A shame. This camera is amazing when it comes to that.<br/><br/>Hinged Touchscreen:<br/><br/>The older SL1 Rebel is a nice camera, but feels cheaper and it has a fixed LCD screen. Since I shoot many products on the floor, with the camera at 90 degrees, being able to tilt the LCD screen for framing saves me time and resolution. I can close in tighter than I can with the SL1 because I can see the product better.<br/>Even handheld shooting reminds me of the old days with my Rolleifles and Hasselblad. I don;pt kn ow how much fre hand photography I'll do, but being able to get a lower POV without thrashing on the floor is nice. I remember spending $500 many years ago just to have a periscope viewfinder on an old Minolta film camera I used at the time. This is better.<br/><br/>Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connection:<br/><br/>This is the first thing I tested when I activated the camera and it works great. It lets me name pictures with a handy YY-MM-DD-filename format, which keeps all my pictures in Chronological order and they go into a folder properly named directly on my computer. With the Nikon I could do the same thing using an Open Source program, but I had to connect with a USB cable and frankly having one less cable in the studio is a blessing. Especially a cable connecting my laptop to the camera since I am continuously moving from behind the computer to the stage to place new products on it. I don't know if I'll use the bluetooth to my phone, but my wife might and it's nice to have.<br/>BTW, another thing I bought is a 2 batteries charger so now I have 3 batteries ready to go at all times. It's must for serious shooting.<br/><br/>18-55mm Lens:<br/><br/>I almost didn't buy a camera with a lens, because I already have a legacy of Canon lenses, including one that at the time cost me about three times what I paid for the camera body.<br/>I wasn't thrilled about the 18-55mm lens because it is the same as the one on the borrowed SL1. It's actually useful for some of the shooting I am doing these days, but the lens feels cheap. The manual focusing ring on the SL1 lens felt like a cheap plastic toy that came with a happy meal.<br/>GOOD NEWS: when I received the new camera, sporting the exact same lens, I was thrilled to find that in this new lens the focusing ring behaves much better. While the other lens' focusing ring spins with almost no friction, the one that came with my camera is smooth and offers just enough resistance for proper manual focusing. I do wish it was a bit wider, but it's a lot wider than other lenses I have and it's very useful. I don't know if I got lucky or what, since as best I can tell, they are identical lenses, but the one that came with this camera has excellent manual focusing.<br/>All in all, I made a good choice because I can work with this lens for some of the shooting I do. I needed another 50mm equivalent lens like I need a third eye. I have a collection of them. Having this zoom is going to make my life easier and save me time when shooting many products one after the other.<br/><br/>Stability Control:<br/><br/>Sometimes I have to shoot hundreds of products in a short time. While I have a pretty good tripod setup, it's in a small, hot room with lots of cables, lights reflectors, etc. I always shoot at 200 ISO, maybe 400 on a bad day so the exposure tends to be wide open and shutter speed very long.<br/>Well, the stability control on all my lenses (of the digital generation) is very impressive. I had to shoot a number of T-shirts very quickly and given that it was 110 degrees inside the room, I simply could not bother to set up the tripod and do the usual "Leopard military walk" to change subject, align them, etc.<br/>I decided to shoot them handheld. I was always good at it, but in this case I need to do it with my arms extended and the camera pointing down. Shutter speed 1/15. Crazy. Anything below 1/60 looks like a drunk was behind the lens.<br/>I thought "no way I could end up with a sharp picture" with that setup, but I did. Even with the older SL1 (and no tilting LCD) I tested the handheld and tripod mounted version of the same picture side by side. Obviously, the tripod mounted one had better depth of field so it was as sharp as it could be, but I could only tell the difference if I enlarged things like the stitching of a coat. Once compressed and uploaded to a web site, the difference was not only negligible, it was invisible.<br/>I am adding more lights so I can use a faster shutter speed, but I know that push come to shove, I can handhold the camera at 1/15 and get very sharp pictures. The Smithsonian may not be calling me anytime soon, but these pictures are not for museums.<br/><br/>Video:<br/><br/>This is the only disappointment, but not really a critical problem since I will seldom use the video feature and if I do, it's certainly good enough for my purposes. Somehow, I thought the camera could shoot in 4K, but instead it only shoots in 1080p. I think one has to spend an extra $300 to get one that shoots in 4K. Bummer, but again, not a big concern for me and the video quality (on my 4K 32" monitor) is still excellent. 4K would have been better but whaat the hell. I was already $200 over budget with the camera.<br/><br/>Software and Interface:<br/><br/>The camera interface, while not winning any prizes, is serviceable. I have not explored every little crevice, but it's a lot better than my old Rebel and looks better organized than the SL1 I was using until my SL3 arrived.<br/>I had to shoot with a Nikon for about a year (provided by my client) and that camera had a pretty bad interface, plus Nikon did not include remote shooting software with it. Or, I should say, they didn't include it for free, which I think is criminal.<br/>My older Rebel did and I was happy to see that this SL3 does too. Installation was a breeze as was connecting it to my desktop.<br/>Now I am curious to see how it will handle connecting to my devices. I have a Desktop, a Laptop, a Music/Video production laptop, 2 ipads and a iPhone. I am slightly concerned about using my laptop as a remote control and repository for the pictures. I need it to easily switch from one computer to the other without too much fussing. I will update if this proves to be cumbersome, at which point I will slave the camera to my laptop instead of my desktop and save directly to my cloud drive, that way all computers will receive the same picture (I shoot with my laptop, I do post-production on my desktop and sometimes I master video on the other laptop attached to my music studio. It can be confusing)<br/><br/>Other than the above, it all seems serviceable and I am really happy with this camera.<br/>It's a plastic body Rebel, so if you are a war correspondent, maybe it's not the camera for you. If you need 4K video, again, you want to spend a bit more for that.<br/>But if you need excellent pictures and the features I listed above, this camera will do the job.<br/>If you are thinking "Do I really need the tilting LCD?", only you can answer that question. If you are a tourist or need to be light product shooting, maybe not, but for me it was important enough to pick this camera over the T7, which has pretty much similar characteristics but no tilting LCD.<br/>I did a few shooting sessions with the SL1 and I missed the ability to tilt the LCD every single shot, and I am very experienced at shooting handheld, framing the photo in my mind. Someone with less experience (or not as steady hands) would have to take a lot of shots before ending up with a decent one.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: It's a good camera for photographers. Videographers may want to look at the next camera up for 4K (assuming I am correct mine doesn't do 4K)</span>

<span>I have been using the Canon for about a month now. Great entry level camera for a budding professional. Good grip, good design, good controls, hard plastic body looks like it will last. Touch screen works great! Love the old school viewfinder and it is the reason I bought it. That is the reason for 4 stars also. The viewfinder only works for taking photos! You cannot take video thru the viewfinder. You have to use the touchscreen. I bought camera for action photograph and videos. The photo part is perfect, the video part is unusable for my special circumstances in video of RC aircraft in flight. Bright days just blind the touchscreen. Also no 24fps in Full HD mode. Still a great value for the money. Pic quality is super. Love viewfinder for photos but won’t work for videos. The Dual Pixel auto focus is awesome on video to keep face in sharp focus. The audio on camera is just so so, I added external mic and it is a world of difference better. Love the fact that I can use legacy Canon lenses or the newest, as my budget allows. I got the 18-55 STM kit lens and it is a fine starter lens, especially for video (wide angle since the camera crops, especially with 4K video), it's silent, fast and relatively accurate. I also got a "nifty fifty" prime Canon 50mm lens that is Super for portraits and just to walk around with taking photos. I also got a Canon EF-S 55-250mm STM lens for excellent shots of RC planes in the air far away. I couldn't have gotten as far as I have without watching MANY Youtube reviews and hints/tricks videos that make it much easier to understand how to use the MANY features of this camera. The battery life is long and I have shot all day and never run out of battery. I don't like that 4K video is so cropped but I just stand farther back and it is OK. Also, the audio levels will show on the lcd screen but you have to go into the settings and take it off of Auto and put it in Manual to get it to work, it should be on by default Canon! The 9-point AF works great for moving objects (like planes) and I don't know why people complain that it is not enough. In conclusion...I love this camera! It is much better for photos than for video but I just bought a DJI Ronin SC gimbal to make the video portion much better, including Active Track, so I'm hoping that will work out fine. I know everything is going mirrorless but this is a great camera that works in the old world and in the new and should be all I need for the foreseeable future as an amateur and light-weight professional photographer.</span>

<span>For better quality images and more artistic control over what a Smartphone (SP) or Point-and-Shoot (P&amp;S) camera offers—the proven Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera is the way to go, and the highly-rated Canon EOS Rebel SL3 is specifically designed with DSLR newbies in mind.  The SL3 and native EFS lenses incorporate desirable features found in both P&amp;S and conventional DSLR cameras, while shedding some of their less-favorable characteristics.<br/><br/>Mirrorless cameras are gaining traction w/similarities to DSLRs, and like the SL3, offer a smaller form factor.  However, reviewers identify some growing pains, e.g., poor battery life, overheating, and a lack of native lens options.  An adapter is required to use Canon’s EF or EFS DSLR lenses.  But the bulkier, heavier (and costlier) EF lenses somewhat negate the benefits of having a more compact camera, while the more compact EFS lenses (designed for crop sensor DSLRs) limit the full capability of Mirrorless full-frame (FF) sensors.  And unlike the SL3, there is presently no comparable Mirrorless model that offers more simplified operation and convenient features SP and P&amp;S users prefer, and anyone new to DSLR/Mirrorless cameras will appreciate.<br/><br/>For portability and price SP and P&amp;S cameras can’t be beat, but that comes with compromises.  Some of the more expensive P&amp;S cameras come w/megapixel (MP) counts and video capability similar to the SL3 (24.1MP for photos; 4K@25fps or Full HD@60fps video).  However, the result is a bulkier P&amp;S and pricing similar to the SL3 DSLR—but w/o the SL3’s additional features and technology that also factor into image and video quality:<br/><br/>• The SL3 has a much larger sensor (APS-C) than all but the most expensive P&amp;S cameras, e.g., PowerShot G1 X Mark III, which uses the same sensor.  But the Mark III is more expensive than the SL3 +EFS lens, and is bulky for a P&amp;S camera.<br/>• The SL3 and native EFS (or optional EF) lenses are better equipped to handle motion (photographer’s and/or subject) and dim lighting, w/fast, accurate autofocus, including auto-tracking of moving subjects.<br/>• With the SL3, there are numerous compatible EF and EFS fixed, wide angle, and telephoto lenses to obtain the best quality imaging to best match your subjects of interest (e.g., urban settings, architecture, portraits, landscapes, wildlife, etc.) and shooting conditions (i.e., dim lighting, darkness, action, etc.).  SP and P&amp;S cameras rely on a single lens for all applications—sort of like the handyman who is a jack of all trades, but master of none.  (FYI the biggest complaint among PowerShot G1 X Mark III reviewers is its integrated lens.)<br/>• The SL3 offers the flexibility of add-on accessories to further improve image quality, e.g., lens filters and hoods, a boot for supplemental flash, etc.<br/>• The SL3 can save images in JPEG and RAW format (even both formats simultaneously).  RAW format provides the greatest ability to post-edit and enhance photos (w/capable photo editing software), as the files contain everything captured by the sensor w/no camera processing or compression.  RAW format is preferred by many photo pros and nerds, although anyone can use it.  RAW files are very large, so large memory cards are in order.<br/><br/>The SL3 is equipped with convenient features that SP and P&amp;S camera owners are accustomed to and prefer:<br/><br/>• Form Factor:  Although not as compact as P&amp;S, the SL3 w/EFS lenses is the most compact and lightest DSLR system on the market, making it easier to handle and carry while also enabling use of a thinner, lighter strap and smaller case.  The SL3 also has great ergonomics including a deep, rounded, rubberized finger grip that can accommodate a wide range of hand/finger sizes.<br/>• Automated Settings:  Like most cameras, the SL3 is equipped w/“Auto” mode to determine aperture, speed, ISO and if necessary, flash.  But Auto mode can’t effectively adjust settings for all shooting conditions, e.g., moving subjects, low contrast, etc. or desired outcomes.  The SL3 has an additional “Scene” mode to better optimize settings for scene of choice, e.g., portrait, landscape, handheld night scene, close-up, sports/action, and others.  (These selections can be made on the touchscreen w/o opening the menus.)<br/>• Sharing and Downloading:  The SL3 is equipped w/built-in W-Fi, Bluetooth, and HDMI and USB ports.  You can also transfer files using a memory card reader.<br/>• LCD Touchscreen:  A large 3" LCD touchscreen provides menu navigation and the option of shooting in Live View vs. viewfinder, and snapping photos by touching the screen vs. shutter button.  The screen displays focus point(s), which can be moved by touch to adjust composition, and displays shooting mode, settings and other info (e.g., battery life, remaining shots), and allows quick adjustments to key settings w/o opening menus.  The screen is fully-articulating to enable selfies, vlogging, and taking difficult shots.  Turning the screen up or down allows me to compose tough shots w/o kneeling, laying down, or standing on something.  Images can be reviewed by swiping across the screen.  You can adjust the screen’s brightness and touch sensitivity.<br/>• Convenience and Practicality: Those new to DSLR/Mirrorless cameras will find a fairly steep learning curve that can be intimidating, w/manuals that can resemble a textbook and assumptions that you know more than you probably do.  The SL3 helps bridge this gap with simplified menus, fewer seldom-used settings, pop-up descriptive/tutorial info (that can be modified/turned off), scene-specific automated settings, and other helpful features.<br/>• Battery Life:  The battery can support up to 1630 shots using the pentamirror viewfinder w/screen off, or 350 shots in Live View.  I could not find related specs for video, but some reviewers indicate battery life is very good shooting video.<br/><br/>Capability:  The SL3 is still a capable, versatile DSLR, and a great camera for mastering DSLR/Mirrorless basics if you later desire to move on to a more advanced (and more expensive) camera system.  However, many will likely be content with the SL3 for years to come in providing sufficient artistic control and quality photos/video.<br/><br/>Bang-for-the-Buck:  The SL3 w/kit lens costs more than typical P&amp;S cameras, but less than the large majority of DSLR and Mirrorless cameras (w/kit lens or equivalent).  At this time, the SL3 body can cost from $550 to $650, or $750 for the kit (w/EFS 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens).  Most intermediate-level DSLR/Mirrorless kits or bodies w/kit-equivalent lens will set you back double or more.  For the cost savings, you can buy 2 more EFS lenses for the SL3 along w/capable photo editing software and money left over for lens filters, hoods, strap, case, and more.  And if you lose or damage the SL3 and/or lens, it will cost much less to replace them.<br/><br/>Additional Considerations:  The SL3 and EFS lenses are built to withstand more physical abuse than most P&amp;S cameras, and are generally as rugged as the more expensive DSLR/Mirrorless systems.<br/><br/>TRADE-OFFS<br/>To reduce size and weight while providing a feature-packed DSLR system at an entry-level price point, Canon had to make a few trade-offs, but made sensible ones:<br/><br/>1.  Fewer Setting Options and Features:  The SL3 is not loaded down with seemingly endless setting options and nice but largely unnecessary bells and whistles found on more expensive DSLR and Mirrorless cameras that photo nerds and pros may desire, but the average person not so much.<br/>2.  Smaller Sensor:  Cameras w/smaller sensors can be made smaller, lighter, and at less cost, and in turn, so can their native lenses.  Most full-sized DSLR/Mirrorless cameras use a “full frame” sensor equivalent to yesteryears’ 35mm negative frame size and “field of view” (FOV).  The SL3, along w/most entry level and some intermediate DSLRs use the ASP-C “crop” sensor.  This sensor is still much bigger than those in most P&amp;S cameras, but FF sensors are tops in capturing detail, especially in low-light, along w/expanded FOV.  APS-C sensors offer an advantage over FF in Macro Photography, e.g., landscapes and other distant subjects, as they provide greater depth of field, i.e., sharper foregrounds and backgrounds relative to your subject.<br/>3.  Structural Composition: Smaller camera systems use less material, and less-costly ones use less expensive materials, though the predominant composition of most all DSLR/Mirrorless cameras and lens is polycarbonate (PC).  PC is lightweight and less costly to make, yet very durable and resistant to abrasion, scratches, dents, and shock.  You can often find more metal on costlier models, and even exclusive materials like magnesium alloy and/or carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (Sereebo).  But their application may have as much or more to do with brand/model distinction than anything else.  Metal is still used on all DSLR/Mirrorless cameras and lenses where essential, e.g., lens/camera interface.<br/>4.  Lens: Compared to the SL3’s native EFS lenses, Canon’s EF series are designed to take full advantage of FF sensors on all Canon DSLRs (including the most expensive pro cameras).  EF lenses utilize better optics w/higher grade glass that enable lower F-stops w/wider apertures to improve light gathering, and an ultrasonic motor (USM) for focusing, which is a bit faster than the SL3’s stepped motor (STM)—although STM is preferred for video due to smoother AF.  These attributes also make EF lenses bulkier, heavier, and more expensive (some lens cost more than the camera itself).  EF lenses will fit and work on the SL3 (no adapter necessary), but FOV will not expand due to the smaller sensor.  It should be noted most EFS lenses are highly rated by the majority of AMZ reviewers (I own four EFS lenses and concur), and like the SL3 camera are very good quality and a great value.<br/>5.  Weather Sealing:  The SL3 is not fully weather sealed, so avoid using in rain.<br/><br/>THE GREAT EQUALIZERS<br/>Despite some trade-offs, you will likely be surprised at the quality of images the SL3 and EFS lenses produce (along w/easier portability and handling, and lower cost).  A few photos taken w/my SL3 system are attached.  (FYI, photos of the fox and squirrels were taken through a double-pane window.)<br/><br/>1. The SL1 served my needs well for 6 years, but the SL3’s imaging and other features have markedly improved w/tech upgrades typically found in more expensive DSLR/Mirrorless cameras: 1) A DIGIC 8 Image Processor improves imaging speed and detail (esp. in low light), 2) the Dual Pixel CMOS AF improves focusing speed and accuracy, 3) improved ergonomics, 4) a new vari-angle screen, 5) improved resolution from 18MP to 24MP and from HD to 4K video, 6) longer battery life, 7) other improvements.  Remarkably, the SL3 sells for only $50 more than the SL1 (still sold).  The pricing and the fact the SL2 was sold for only 2 years before debut of the SL3 may indicate Canon felt its dominance in this market niche slipping due to new offerings by competitors.  This may have precipitated loading up the SL3 with advanced features it may not have had otherwise, and/or bringing it to market faster than originally planned, and w/o significant mark-up.  Ultimately, SL3 buyers greatly benefit.<br/><br/>2. Regardless of camera and lenses, advancements in Photo Editing Software can significantly improve image quality by compensating for underexposure, less-than-sharp imaging, noise, low contrast, inaccurate color rendering, etc., while also providing tools to simply enhance photos.  For more information on Photo Editing Software, see “TIPS” below.<br/><br/>SUMMARY<br/>Full-frame intermediate or pro DSLRs best meet the needs of photo pros, nerds, and anyone who wants the latest/greatest features and better/best artistic control and imaging.  Of course, these systems are larger, heavier, costlier, and more complex.<br/><br/>Mirrorless cameras offer a smaller footprint and will eventually outsell DSLRs, but for now are still going through growing pains, and present models do not offer the native lens choices or simplified operation and features the SL3 does.  Mirrorless cameras are priced similar to FF DSLRs.<br/><br/>The Canon EOS Rebel SL3 camera system may be your cup of tea if you’re mostly interested in:<br/>• Sharing high quality photos on social media or similar applications<br/>• A camera less complicated than typical DSLR/Mirrorless<br/>• A compact/lighter camera system designed for portability<br/>• Convenient features found on SP and P&amp;S cameras<br/>• A quality DSLR system at a fraction of the price<br/>• Producing common-sized, quality prints<br/><br/>TIPS<br/>1. Lenses:  Instead of purchasing the Canon SL3 kit w/EFS 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens, consider buying camera body separately and put the savings toward the highly-rated and more versatile EFS 18-135mm telephoto STM AF lens.<br/>2.  Lens Hoods and Filters:  Being relatively cheap, hoods not only reduce flaring and other undesirable light effects, perhaps even more important they protect the lens from drops and scrapes that are inevitable.  A hood has saved my lens on more than one occasion.  Also invest in a quality UV lens filter, which also provides physical protection for your lens.  Make sure the diameter (mm) matches your lens.<br/>3. Save Images in Max Resolution:  You’ll be surprised at how many Hi-Res photos you can save on a moderately-sized card.  You can always reduce file size later, if desired.  Image cropping itself reduces file size.  Hi-Res provides maximum detail to take full advantage of editing software, and less likely that cropping or other editing will result in graininess, pixelation, or loss of detail.  Hi-Res is also best if you want (or may later want) to print photos.<br/>4.  Photo Editing Software:  Invest in quality software to clean up photos and even remove unwanted objects (e.g., people, utility poles/lines, vehicles, etc.).  You can also enhance images to make them “pop.”  I chose PhotoWorks (not FotoWorks) after much research.  It’s powerful yet easier to use and cheaper than more well-known, but typically bloated and less user-friendly offerings, many that require recurring subscription fees.  It’s much better than anything you can get for free, and far more than any editing or enhancement features found on cameras.  You can edit both JPEG and RAW files, and convert RAW to JPEG format after editing.  Dual mode allows you to see changes alongside the original, and when you decide to save your edited photo, it automatically saves the original along with it.  I was skeptical at claims it can effectively remove utility lines from a photo, but it does, and well.  I have a lifetime license for PhotoWorks Ultimate w/pro-level tools and ability to transfer the license to another device.  This version costs $80 at this time.  You can also download a free version to try out, or purchase a subscription for less, although these versions are missing some features.<br/>5.  Used Cameras/Lenses: Sellers typically rate condition by “physical appearance.” I purchased a “used, like new” lens only to discover there was no electrical communication between camera and lens, w/error code indicating it needs “servicing” by Canon.  These items are generally no longer under Canon warranty.  Sellers often stipulate you can return it within 30 days, but you may have to pay for shipping.  At the very least, you may be largely inconvenienced and back to square one.<br/>6.  Pricing and Sellers:  Canon (and other camera manufacturers) tightly control pricing so they can’t be sold for less than what Canon directly sells them for (if Canon is still selling the item).  To get around this, many sellers include “free” add-ons, e.g., lens filters, strap, case, cleaning materials, lens hood, etc.  Know these items generally come from the bottom of the barrel as far as quality and value.  What’s more important is who the seller is and what their (not the product’s) ratings are.  Click on the seller’s name where it is highlighted in blue to find out (if the rating is not posted on the product’s page).  If their overall rating is not in the high 80s or above, it’s best to look for another seller.  Also, avoid sellers that are new or w/only a handful of viewer ratings.  While many are legit, others have re-entered the arena under a new profile/name after terrible reviews caught up to them and cut into sales.  Also avoid foreign sellers and foreign versions of the item.  Often these items are not under warranty, even if new.</span>

<span>I'm one of those photographers who while on a budget still likes to have toys to play with. This camera is one of those many toys I've purchased over the years. It was never intended to be a daily shooter for me just something I took out on occasion to take some pictures with for fun. Like, for instance, the train yard not far from my house is a fave place to go take pics. The tracks that lead to them and yard itself provide some fantastic opportunities. Lots of great shots. It actually does perform quite well and I was pleased at the quality of the resulting pictures.<br/><br/>But there is one major drawback and that's the processing time between shots. And if you're the type of person who wants to take that next shot immediately this is not your camera. I used it in sport mode the time at the yards so I'd get get between 3 and 5 shots per click of the shutter. And the downtime between shots is anywhere between 5 to 20 seconds. So you get this spot on shot of a bird sitting on the caboose and then want to get a shot of the bird closer up you'll be waiting for a few moments. Which will likely mean the opportunity is gone by the time the camera is ready again. This makes it nearly impossible to use in a setting such as sports where you have to be ready at all times.<br/><br/>That aside the pictures you get are pretty great. The zoom is fantastic (especially with a tripod) and will get you close to places that you normally can't get too. I'd say it's definitely worth the money. I'm very pleased with the purchase overall. But definitely upgrade the included memory card.</span>

<span>Oct. 2020: If you're photographing foliage with a lot of stems &amp; leaf edges, turn off/down i.Resolution. The "i" isn't that intelligent &amp; makes some nasty over-sharpened halos in some spots. My advice, if you like the overall look of the jpeg, shoot raw+jpeg &amp; process the raw using the jpeg as a guide. This isn't needed all the time. Only some scenes have this problem.<br/>8/14/2020 I never played with the weird 4K burst modes. I just mucked with them today. They tend to hang up the camera. They don't seem to offer much over the regular drive modes. They take up two programmable buttons I can put to better use.<br/>7/18/2019 Low light. No camera of this type is going to do well in natural light at last light (9 PM here.) This one is noticeably worse than my SX720HS. And that's bad.<br/>6/29/2019 With an upgraded SD card, I tried the high speed video. The 240 fps VGA mode worked like a dream. To access it, you have to have the camera on [Cinema Camera]M mode. WARNING: Objects in camera fall 1/8th as fast as real life. :)<br/>6/24/2019. With hundreds of pictures down, I really like the flip screen. I also like the auto bracket. I tend to keep it on 1/3 stop; 2/3 seems to be a bit wide. I've turned off the touch screen. Moving the focus position with the tip of my nose whenever I use the EVF is right out.<br/>6/21/2019. Video playback seems to be twitchy on this model. Apparently some cameras, some times have trouble playing back some videos. Check your memory card specs. Even with a high end card, playback is chancy. Recording is fine. Playback on a PC is fine.<br/><br/>6/17/2019. The only serious negative about this camera is the slight increase in size and weight over my old SX720HS. It's about twice the volume. It has reasons for that, with the added features, particularly the tilt-screen and the EVF.<br/><br/>I really like high-end, 1/2.3"-sensor, long-zoom, point &amp; shoot cameras. This one is pretty close to the limit. Much more and you have to go to 1" sensor designs, which hurts your zoom range. I currently have:<br/>-Canon SX280HS--great camera, still has features no one else has, terrible for videos (I don't care), battery hog (I do care)<br/>-Canon SX720HS--basically the SX280HS perfected. I wouldn't normally upgrade this soon, but for,<br/>-Panasonic ZS70--this camera, which I got for very short money (thanks Amazon warehouse)<br/><br/>* I wasn't that interested in the  flip-up screen, I don't do selfies or vlogs. Boy was I wrong. It allows you to snake the camera into positions that would otherwise require a contortionist.<br/>* I was interested in the EVF. It's good in dim light, but I'm used to eyeballing pictures from an external screen. Still a plus, but less of one than I thought.<br/>* I was interested in the powerful bracketing functions. Still interested, but I'll need a bit more study to make it work.<br/><br/>Generally, I shoot in P mode or M mode. Both modes work fine on this camera. The autofocus is better than on the two Canons. The focus modes take a little experimentation to find the one that works best for you, but they all seem to work. 'Standard' color balance is fine. I need to play with 'Natural' a bit to see which one I prefer. The attached photos were all taken on standard. All on a single sunny morning walk after a rainy night in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>First impression? This is a really good camera, even at the list price.</span>

<span> I'm going to give a review based on what I expected the camera to do, and there are a couple of reasons why I think it's a hands-down camera and who should use this kind of compact camera. It may not be for everybody, but I think I like it more than any other compact camera. I'm not going to complain that there are a limited number of features and they are not on par with features that you'd normally get on any high-end DSLR or mirrorless camera. I think it's just enough for me and those who have recently ventured into the photography world. I've been using this point-and-shoot camera for about a month and a half and these are my thoughts on it.⁣<br/>⁣<br/>An intuitive UI and a foolproof system⁣<br/>⁣<br/>When I first bought it, I had a lot of things going on in my mind. How the heck should I utilize this fancy kind of camera? Until it landed on my doorstep, I did a little unboxing and tested it out right off the bat without looking at the manuals. Toggling all the settings and features is a lot easier than I thought it would be. It all goes down to how patient you are with all the settings set to your liking. A very responsive flip-out screen makes everything seamless in focusing on subjects and tweaking exposure and ISO. You don't have to worry about the settings you use even after turning it off because it'll go back to the previous features and settings you set to. ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>Portability⁣<br/>⁣<br/>The purported weight of 11.36 oz or 322 g seems like a little burden to carry around in your pocket or fanny pack because it's very lightweight without a case on. I don't have to carry a huge backpack on my shoulder and whenever I have something to capture, I just take it out and shoot right away. Easy peasy!⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>Who is qualified to use this camera?⁣<br/>⁣<br/>I'd say most of the beginners who are on a budget are looking for the perfect camera to start off with and not for claustrophobes. ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>Focus accuracy and image quality⁣<br/>⁣<br/>The focus in the AF mode is quite spot on when there is sufficient light on the subject that you're going to capture. If not, it may be out of focus for a moment, and it'll refocus again. The AF Macro and the Macro Zoom are incredibly impressive when taking pictures of bugs and flowers with sharp details around them, and the focal point where the light enters through the lens is not too terrible when shooting in a low-light condition with minimal blemishes and grainy elements. Equipped with a 20.3MP, the output from this camera is insanely good under some circumstances where there's enough lighting. If you're into those kinds of portrait shots, this camera may not be good for you as the maximum F-Stop is only set at 3.3, but you can put a fake depth of field in the background using an advanced software called Luminar AI. ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>All in all, it's an impeccable camera for avid photographers with a reasonable price tag compared to other point-and-shoot camera brands and this one is affordable. Ease of use, portability, and great features are what I'm looking for when buying a low-budget one, and this camera does cut it and I highly recommend it!⁣<br/> ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/> ⁣<br/>⁣</span>

<span>We purchased this camera for work purposes and have to say, it does do the job. I was able to zoom a pretty good distance (more than what is actually needed). The flash is not the best BUT after walking the property and taking random photos - the camera did pick-up lowlight areas and did brighten the scene, so the photo did come out clear and brighter. I wouldn't recommend this camera for a person who is experienced and is used to a more sophisticated DSLR camera as it would be a disappointment to you. This is great for someone wanting to learn how to take photos and doesn't want to carry multiple lenses around at the same time. Although these cameras were purchased for work, I did catch some pretty nice shots. The main caveat I will say is the LINK123, APP. Unfortunately, the app does not always function when you want it to. Also, it would be nice to be able to open the app without syncing your camera to view older saved photos in your camera gallery.<br/><br/>Overall, if you would like an introductory camera with pretty neat options - I would recommend this camera.</span>

<span>I'm very impressed with my new Canon 90D camera. I used it a few times in my studio, then took it to a local park for a quick test. Attached are two of the shots direct from the camera. Although not well centered in the shot, I think you will agree with the colors and resolution. These were just test shots using a Canon EFS 18-135 lens with the camera set to take Jpeg. I normally use the RAW format and I wasn't that interested in getting perfectly centered photos this time. No flash for either shot, and an overcast day.</span>

<span>This might be the camera I have been waiting from Canon for some time now, however the verdict is still out.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>I have been into amateur photography since the film days and once I got into digital photography I was a Canon shooter until 2017 when I discovered Pentax K-1.<br/>I have also used mirrorless like Olympus E-M10 Mark II, Panasonic Lumix G9, Fuji X-T100 and Canon M50.<br/>Since I started shooting with Pentax I pretty much abandoned all my Canon gear, including 5D Mark II, however I kept using Canon 70D mainly for air shows, nature and lately for birding as well as movie shooting.<br/>I got more into birding lately and I was looking for a good alternative to a DSLR for this purpose. Tried Panasonic G9 with 100-400mm lens but it was not a match to Canon 70D and Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary. I really got a great copy that is tack sharp wide open at 600mm. This lens alone and 100-400L trombone was what was keeping me from dumping Canon for good.<br/>Since I have been looking for something to upgrade my 70D for birding and air shows, I will be reviewing this camera mostly from this point of view.<br/><br/>FIRST IMPRESSIONS<br/>The build is very similar to 70D. The major difference I noticed the most is the grip, which is protruding more and it is more comfortable to hold the camera with a big zoom lens.<br/>For people with smaller hands it might be somewhat of an adjustment but it fits me just right. Other than the grip, the joystick and few buttons placed slightly differently, it feels really like the same camera.<br/>The menus changed slightly but it took me no time to set it up pretty much same way I had 70D set up.<br/><br/>SHOOTING PERFORMANCE<br/>I just received it today (9/12/2019) and went outside to shoot some comparison hand held shots with my Sigma 150-600mm.<br/>Since it was late the light was getting more and more challenging. Stationary subject for now and auto ISO max 3,200 on both 90D and 70D with 6.3 aperture.<br/>First thing I noticed was a difference in the shutter sound and I must say I like it much more than the one of 70D. It is more subtle yet sounds pretty assuring. I know this is more intangible quality but I like it. Never paid too much attention to this until 90D.<br/>The second thing that stood out was that 90D was suggesting slightly different shutter speed at the same auto ISO and aperture. 90D would also sometimes pick slightly different auto ISO as well. In general the numbers looked like 90D is slightly more sensitive than 70D.<br/>Have not had a chance to test tracking yet but I tried burst RAW only shooting and with Lexar Professional 1667x 128GB SDXC UHS-II at the maximum 10 frames per second rate the buffer filled up in 3 seconds. At 3 frames per second rate (slow burst mode) the buffer filled up after 19 seconds. After that it became very random, from 1 per second to 4 per second frame rate.<br/>In more realistic bird shooting simulation when I usually shoot 4-7 frames and take a second or so of brake between bursts, it took almost a minute or so for the buffer to start slowing the shooting down.<br/><br/>OCTOBER 2019 UPDATE:<br/>Went out birding several times and in real time shooting situation I think the buffer only slowed me down once over several days. This is really good considering this thing does 10fps. So far so good.<br/>I also tried some BIF of hawks and eagles flying around and I must say that the viewfinder performance in tracking mode seems much better than 70D. This all with my Sigma 150-600MM C.<br/>Soon the air show will come to town and I will give 90D run through with my Canon trombone 100-400L.<br/><br/>AIRSHOW UPDATE:<br/>Went to airshow with Canon 100-400L trombone and results are what I was waiting for.<br/>Previously I shot airshows mainly with my Canon 5D Mark II as somehow the quality was better than 70D.<br/>Now I can leave 5D behind and just use 90D from now on.<br/>Autofocus performance in AFC mode was spot on and out of thousands of photos maybe few were not completely up to snuff.<br/>I also attached some samples from the shoot.<br/><br/>PICTURE QUALITY<br/>With the limited time I had to test so far I must say that the sharpness is there and the extra pixels make quite a difference. I did some comparison shots between 70D and 90D and must say that at the same zoom there is much more sharpness to photos.<br/>Colors seem identical so far. I usually use DxO to process photos but 90D profile is not yet available for DxO yet so I only used Canon's DPP.<br/>The noise level at 3,200 ISO seems more pleasing on 90D than 70D.<br/>I was looking for something with more resolution to shoot birds in case I need to crop.<br/>My full frame Pentax has pixels but there is no lens that could compete with the reach of Sigma 150-600mm on the crop sensor.<br/>I will post updates as I do more testing. Over next couple of weeks I will be doing more testing of actual birds and maybe some challenging birds in flight. I will also try some 4k videos.<br/>I will also try testing some macro photography, including macro focus stacking as 90D has the macro bracketing function built in (although only in Live View shooting mode).<br/><br/>OCTOBER 2019 UPDATE:<br/>Went out birding several times and the resolution bump makes a big difference. Much less cropping penalty, gets me closer to those smaller birds.<br/>Picture quality very good and in focus hit ratio very good also.<br/>I took my old 70D to do some comparisons with but I failed at that because as soon as I started to shoot birds with 90D I never put it away. It was that much of a difference.<br/>Photos attached to this review are only processed with Canon DPP.<br/><br/>CONCLUSIONS<br/>It is too early to tell just yet but this seems to be shaping up to be what I was looking for birding, nature and macro photography.<br/>It may also become my travel camera as well since it is not very heavy and with two EF-S lenses it does not take that much space in the backpack.<br/><br/>OCTOBER 2019 UPDATE:<br/>As of now only Canon DPP recognizes RAW images (had to be upgraded) but I suppose this will change soon enough.<br/>This is okay for now but I hope DxO Photo Lab will add it to their camera lineup soon.<br/>Still happy with the camera. Big upgrade from 70D for birding.<br/><br/>LATEST UPDATE:<br/>DxO has the profiles now and they work great.<br/><br/>Battery life is improved with the slightly more capacity of new LP-E6N.<br/>Old LP-E6 batteries also work just fine and the number of photos on one battery charge depends on how you shoot.<br/>For example, at the air show I shot almost 3.5k photos, most in bursts at 10fps and the new battery lasted me for all of them.<br/>You need to carry spare, because you will forget there is even battery there and eventually you will run out, usually when least expected ;-).<br/><br/>The multi controller (aka joystick) is very useful and welcomed addition.<br/><br/>Low light performance is improved over 70D but not by much.<br/>However, considering that this is 32.5 megapixel APS-C it is not very surprising. In Canon world it is an equivalent of 86 megapixel full frame, which by the way does not exist. Therefore, expecting low light performance of full frame cameras would be like expecting technological miracle.<br/>For low light birding I use Pentax KP crop camera but that one is 24 megapixels.<br/><br/>Cropping is double edged sword. If the subject is close enough but small, then cropping helps a lot and produces amazing results. However, when subject is pretty far away, cropping might be detrimental to the photo quality due to atmospheric conditions but that is just physics.<br/>Just wanted to mention this so no one expects miracles.<br/><br/>Still keeping the camera, even after briefly considering putting pre-order on Canon R5.<br/>However, for birding and air shows with the current lenses available (at reasonable prices) full frame will not work for me as well as 90D does.</span>

<span>The 90D works similar to the 70D it is replacing.  Functions are faster, the screen is fabulous and controls are in similar locations.  Photos taken in CR3 format are around 32 to 35 MB each.  The Canon Digital Photo Professional MUST be version 4.10.50.1 in order to open the CR3 files.  Photos saved from my 70d as CR2 files, when saved to JPG post editing, took 10 or so seconds to covert and save.  It takes 30 seconds for the same action with the CR3 file. EACH FILE.  That excess time is going to be an issue as I take high school football photos and if I have to post/convert/save 300+ shots each game.... well, time is time.<br/><br/>I will experiment with just JPG shooting this week... but really like being able to adjust the photos as a RAW.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the photos... day shots are fabulous.  rapid and accurate focus.  Face and eye detection work well.  Night shots are coming this weekend..<br/><br/>Night football photos at the high school is better than the 70D, but I am VERY disappointed with the focusing.  It is slow and inaccurate.  I have used both of the "spot focus" points and find no difference in accuracy.  My 70D was better at proper focus than the 90D is.  I use a Canon 70-200 f2.8 lens.  The photos that do focus correctly are better than the 70D.  BUT, focus ability compared to the 70D is POOR.</span>
