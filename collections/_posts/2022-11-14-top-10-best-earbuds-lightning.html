<span>Every ear bud I have tried to wiggle and shove in my ears popped right out. That includes a pair of Apple Air pod pros I received as a gift.  The only ones that worked were the over the ear type and I could never really find a pair with good sound.<br/>Then the generous person that bought me the pros exchanged them for the Air Pod 3's.  Like magic they sort of sat in my ears and did not come out!<br/>  While I liked the 3's they became a bit uncomfortable after about 15 minutes or so.  A friend suggested the 2s and that was the pair for me. They are smaller than the 3's and felt good no matter how long I wore them.<br/>Comparing the sound between the 2's vs 3's.  The 3's had a fuller sound but the Air bud 2's still sound good for listening to music, and are loud enough to drown me out when I sing LOL!  A couple of negatives negative is the longer stem but that's not a big deal but what is important for me is mot having a volume adjustment on the pods.  Despite that I plan on getting a second pair when I find a deal on them.</span>

<span>I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.<br/><br/>Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.<br/>I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.<br/><br/>I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.<br/><br/>First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.<br/>But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.<br/>I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.<br/>I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.<br/>I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.<br/><br/>So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.</span>

<span>I bought these my senior year of college and I am so happy that I did. Going to the gym and dealing with the chord from the older iPhone earbuds got pretty annoying. These were super easy just to pop in without dealing with any chords. I also love the ability to double tap to skip a song while in a workout or if I’m not near my phone. I’ve owned these for about a year now and they have never fallen out of my ear unless I accidentally knocked it out by hitting it. The battery life is amazing! One day I realized they were dead, plugged them in before I took the trash out, and they were just about up to 70-75 when I came back. It charges super fast, but the case does die fairly fast when not plugged in. The ease of use for answering phone calls, being alerted for texts, sending texts, accessing Siri, and so much more definitely make this purchase worth it for me. I used these almost every day in college and definitely feel like I got my moneys worth!</span>

<span>So, I hate everything Apple just because 1) they charge too much for their crap. 2) their proprietary non-sense with making everything difficult and not customizable is just stupid.<br/>That being said, this is hands down the best set of  ear buds I have ever owned. I can't use the kind with the little rubber tip that goes in your ear, no matter what adapter I use they fall out and the sound quality is terrible. These babies are perfect, fit in my ear great and sound amazing. Bass is spot on and I will probably buy another set to have on hand when the battery finally dies on these.<br/><br/>****Still hate Apple though*** Hahahaha!!!!</span>

Only Skullcandy headphones are custom-tuned to deliver music you can feel. From the lyrics in your soul to the bass in your bones.

<span>I like these headphones but sometimes when I try to use the button to skip or pause it sticks so I find myself having to click more.  It is not a deal breaker or a huge problem but I have found that I use these only for calls now to avoid dealing with it sticking when I listen to music.  Other than that they work and the sound is good for the price.</span>

<span>I love Skullcandy headphones!, bluetooth and wired. I had a pair when I had an android phone and bought a pair to use with the apple adapter until I lost the little doohickey :( These earbuds are great, the only stipulation I have is actually Apple’s fault but it is something to note. I listen to my music really, really, really loud, and iPhones do have a health/safety feature that affects the maximum volume, but when used on other devices, the beauty that is Skullcandy really shines through, it’s still really loud but for those who know where I’m coming from, it’s audio just isn’t the same as when used on android phones.</span>

<span>These have great sound quality for a wide variety of music.

<span>Noise cancellation is non-existent on these so don’t believe reviews that say “good enough” if you are looking for that. I can hear everything going on and they are basically the same as the lightening wired cord ear buds that used to come in the box.<br/><br/>They are a little heavy but possibly that provides better sound, which is probably better in general due to the lightning connection (lossless).</span>

<span>UPDATE July 2 2017:<br/>At some point, I ended up using these as my primary headphones. After adjusting to them, they are actually very comfortable. The first several times I wore them (see my original review, below) they weren't that comfortable but I evidently didn't give them enough of a chance.<br/><br/>1. They are very comfortable to wear even over long periods of time. I use them as my headphones for all day at work and they don't bother my ears.<br/>2. They stay in just fine working, walking, etc. I haven't tried them while jogging but I've yet to have much issue with them falling out or coming too loose.<br/>3. The sound is great for the price. It's not "Bose" or anything obviously, but the sound is much better than my Coby earbuds and roughly equivalent to my SoundBot. In short, it's balanced and clear without sounding super bass-y nor tinny.<br/>4. I've just learned today that they are very durable! I was looking all over for them and couldn't find them so I just used some other headphones and what do you know - I had tucked them in a shirt pocket and accidentally washed (and dried) them! I thought for sure they were done for. The cable even felt a little bit softer, but nope! I plugged them into my laptop and started up a video and they still worked. They didn't sound any different than before I washed(!) them. They were very tangled but I can live with that.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones now after giving them more of a chance myself. And, if you're like I was initially, try giving your ears a little more time to adjust.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW (November 2015):<br/>I read several reviews before buying these and got intrigued. My ears are small or shaped weird - especially my left one. I don't know what it is but I have never found ear buds comfortable. The original kind that have a Hershey Kiss speaker shape that goes in your ear - those are the worst. The soft in-ear kind are significantly better, but still not comfortable to me and they have a tendency to fall out. I prefer regular over the ear headphones but those aren't so acceptable at work.<br/><br/>I bought a pair of SoundBot headphones that were super comfy, but after awhile the left side broke. It still works, but jiggling the wire pauses songs, skips songs, and even turns the volume up or down (which there isn't actually a control on the headphones for). Wanting to find a replacement (and not be locked in to one specific brand of style), I tried these.<br/><br/>For starters, they are cute. I mean, for ear buds. The blue is a pretty blue, it is a bit brighter than say, royal/Superman blue.<br/><br/>Also, they do actually stay in my ears pretty well. The ear piece sort of hooks into the shape of your ear in a similar manner as the SoundBot ones, locking it in place. It isn't stuck in there however, and still relies a bit on the shove-it-in-your-ear factor.<br/><br/>The cord is decently long, a comfortable length in my opinion. However, it is thin. I feel like it could easily have a similar problem within a few months if I don't take extra good care of them. That said, there is no control for anything on these headphones so hopefully if it started getting damaged, it would have no effect.<br/><br/>The sound is very good, especially for the price. I have a pair of cheap, Coby ear buds and the sound quality on those is noticeably lower than any others I have tried - so these are better than that, at least. These I would say are a notch below my SoundBot headphones and a few notches above the Coby. I would say my SoundBot headphones are about on par with my original Galaxy S5 headphones for sound quality,  if that helps.<br/><br/>One thing I dislike is that I can easily hear background noise through these headphones. It isn't crystal clear, but in a noisy office, I find myself having to turn the volume up further. It isn't to say that they are SUPPOSED to have noise-cancel, but I got used to it with my Galaxy S5 headphones and especially with my SoundBot ones. Galaxy S5 headphones block out the majority of background noise, and the SoundBot ones block out all but the loudest. Even without anything playing, they have a noise-cancel effect.<br/><br/>OK, now for my primary complaint. All other factors the same, I would be very satisfied with these headphones if they were only more comfortable. It's strange, too, because on the right ear it's perfect. On the left ear, painful. I have avoided using my Galaxy S5 headphones because they aren't so comfortable to me, but I actually practically retired these ones in favor of those. I don't know what it is about my left ear. I tried switching the medium/default tip for the smallest and I might say that's even less comfortable? I can't quite put my finger on it. The speaker hole is narrower - it's an oval, not a circle, giving almost an appearance like the latest iPhone headphones. I thought that would have been perfect, and it is on my right ear. My right ear could probably wear it all day, but my left ear can't stand it.<br/><br/>So, I know I have talked most this review about my broken SoundBot headphones, but that's only because they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever found. For me, comfort takes precedence over pretty much all other features (save for price) because I just can't stand wearing most ear buds. That said, here is the fib ranking:<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>1st/2nd: Galaxy S5 and SoundBot (tie)<br/>3rd: These Panasonic headphones<br/>4th: Coby<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>1st: SoundBot<br/>2nd: Galaxy S5<br/>3rd: These Panasonic headphones<br/>4th: Coby<br/><br/>Appearance:<br/>1st: These Panasonic headphones<br/>2nd: Galaxy S5<br/>3rd: Coby<br/>4th: SoundBot<br/><br/>Price:<br/>1st: These Panasonic headphones<br/>2nd: SoundBot (by a few dollars)<br/>(I can't rank the Galaxy S5 because they can with my phone and the Coby came as part of a set with other headphones)<br/><br/>Features/Functionality:<br/>1st: Galaxy S5 (play/pause/skip/phone and volume)<br/>2nd: SoundBot (play/pause/skip/phone)<br/>3rd/4th: These Panasonic headphones and Coby (tie - no controls)<br/><br/>Overall, if my left ear wasn't so sensitive I would probably love these. Because it is so sensitive, I find them almost unusable. Otherwise, for the price and general quality, I would recommend them for less finicky ears.</span>

<span>[*UPDATE* at the end] ~<br/>[original review]: Here's the thing: I really did not wish to be in the market for a set of earphones/earbuds or whatever these things are being called these days – but given the fact that I'd grown tired of barely being able to hear spoken-word audio through my smartphone speaker, whether it was during phone conversations, trying to listen to online programs, or hearing GPS directions while motorcycle riding, I decided it was time to invest in a "workable" set of something that could be plugged directly into my ear canal.<br/><br/>Given that I'd had no interest in investing in audiophile-grade equipment at the requisite audiophile-grade prices, my main concern was finding something somewhere within that delicate balance of "Quality-enough" at just "Cheap-enough," and it seemed to me at the time that these just MIGHT have fit that bill: they did have the "Panasonic" name going for them, after all.<br/><br/>But even I, who actually WAS trying to "cheap-out," was impressed with the crispness and clarity, as well as the unexpected comfort, of these buds. Again, they are not anything to go for if you're looking for Top-of-the-Line type quality or heavy-duty performance... but if all you're looking for is something simple and basic, and yet packs a surprising amount of audio quality, I can easily imagine less stellar choices. My only rating demerit being in regards to the uncomfortably thin wires which easily snag on things and get annoyingly tangled upon themselves – but hey... ya gits wutz yoo pays for, correct?<br/><br/>I'd purchased two sets of these together – the other of which being with the added microphone feature: I've yet to test out that second set fully, but the audio output quality on that set matches this one, so there does seem to be consistency in that department.<br/><br/>Definitely a "recommend" for someone who does not require much but who still appreciates those little pleasant unanticipated surprises that occasionally accompany such decisions.<br/>_____<br/><br/>["update" addendum]:<br/>After a series of hours'-long phone conversations using the "microphone" variety of these ear buds, I was so impressed with the results that I'm literally right now, as of the typing of these very words, in the process of ordering a SECOND "mic-equipped" set – one to be set aside strictly for "in-house" phone calls, and the other as a "travel set" in case of ever needing to make/receive phone calls outside of the house or while on the road.<br/><br/>Still the same concerns relating to the ultra-thin wires, but still strongly recommending for those on a budget or who just want something simple, yet who BOTH are looking for something reliable and of surprisingly good quality.</span>

<span>In just the past several years the difference between the least expensive IEM headphones (in-ear-monitor, or "earbud") and the "high-end," premium-priced models (some costing as much as $1000.00 and requiring special fitting by an audiologist) has been reduced to a degree sufficient to "fool" the most discerning listeners in a blind-fold test.  Of course, any failure to differentiate the "cheap" from the ultra-high end brand would immediately be blamed on numerous variables, which are likely to affect a listener's judgments about an "earbud"-sized phone more than is the case with full-sized headphones.  With IEM phones there are always questions about the size and materials of the ear-tips, and the particular "seal" that is achieved while listening.  Moreover, the judgment is always necessarily highly "subjective" and relative to listeners' personal tastes.  If it's not a blindfold test, the preference may come down to listeners' susceptibility to makers' promotional material, the added "designer-quality" features (including packaging), and lots of elitist hype supported by technological jargon based on physics and acoustic principles.<br/><br/>Oddly, listeners tend to disregard the source material and its limitations, regardless of the technology of the transducers (i.e. phones or speakers) used to reproduce the frequencies of the source material.  Yet, more often than not, the source material is compressed to the size of an mp3 file with a bit rate of 128 kbps as compared to a non-compressed WAV or AIFF file of 1411 kbps.  So unlike the high fidelity systems of the 1970s--AR3 vs. KLH "sealed" speakers vs. McIntosh and JBL combinations of woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters in a single gigantic cabinet--all designed to transmit the "non-compressed" signal embedded in the grooves of a long-playing record--the "stakes" in today's audio comparison/shoot-outs are far lower and less significant.  Instead of "which system can reproduce the full frequency spectrum?", the question has been reduced, merely, to which system sounds best while translating the limited information of an MP3 file into sound that is most pleasing to the perception of the listener?<br/><br/>With practice and with certain types of music that has been recorded by certain engineers, I'm now able to distinguish between Apple Lossless compression (files of 768 kbps) and common MP3 files (128 Kbps), but the perceived difference is neither habit-forming nor behavior- changing.  I'm still inclined to go with whatever "sounds best" to my ears.  Invariably, I'm impressed by the phones or speakers that, to my sensibilities, best represent the "sounds in nature," ie., the actual, pure and non-distorted, non-altered sounds of instruments recorded individually and in ensemble contexts as well as the complete range of the male and female human singing voice.  But when listening to an engineer like Rudy Van Gelder, who distorts the sound of the piano and enhances the sound of horns to offer the listener clearest access to all of the instruments being recorded, the headphones or speakers can do little to rectify the imbalances found in the source material.  It's when listening to the engineers who recorded "Kind of Blue" at Columbia Records or to the recordings of Roy Dunann for Contemporary Records that my ears perceive the truest, most "natural," deepest and most complex sound of an instrument, or instruments, or the human voice--IN SPACE.  Without regard to "context" (or what some listeners refer to as "ambiance") there is no longer a standard of reference, or a "sound in nature," which necessarily will have 3-dimensional realism, or depth.  Instead, the sound is manufactured and altered long before being picked up by various amplifying speakers in earphones, headphones, or elaborate speaker systems.<br/><br/>In the case of these Panasonic phones (costing $5) and the Sony phones (costing $10--though there are times when the prices are reversed, depending upon matters such as color and supply-demand), the consumer can be prepared to hear full-fidelity music, with clear reproduction of textures and pitches, from the double bass through the piano (and its overtones) through a percussion kit (including bass drum, snares, crash and ride cymbals, and the hi-hat's "chic chic" sound on the off-beats), to the human voice itself (in this instance, Roberta Gambarini's).<br/><br/>I compared the two phones with each other as well as with phones in the $50-$100 area (Sony MDR-EX300LP, Altec Titanium Backbeat UHP326) and phones in the $200 area (Sony MDR-EX700LP).  I suspect that the latter phones not only "wear longer" (due to better construction, thicker cords, etc.) but "wear better" (I can listen to music for several hours without any sense of discomfort or mounting pressure in the ear).  But as far as initial impressions go, the sonic differences are too small (and subjective) to be worthy of mention. The Sony phones are very slightly smaller and more lightweight, which may account for my sense that the music I was hearing from the Panasonics had fuller textures and more body, especially in the mid-range.  To put it differently: with the Sony phones I was hearing music played with stunning, pristine clarity while standing at the BACK of the music room;  with the Pansonic phones, I was down front, practically a hostage to the crack of the drummer's sticks, the pedaled overtones of the piano, the bassist's articulation of the strings (not merely the bass's tones).  Very likely, the same effect could be achieved with the Sony phones by using smaller ear tips (for a tighter seal) and turning up the gain (the Panasonic earphones are a trifle more "efficient"--i.e. sensitive--than the Sony phones, which require turning up the volume to reproduce the same resonating textures.  The Panasonics use a special, "ergonomic" angle along with an "angular" tip that ensures deeper insertion of the tip into the ear canal, thus accounting for some of the added "body" I was hearing in the sounds of the instruments and vocals.  Some listeners many prefer the more conventional ear tips of the Sony phones.  (Both phones provide two additional sets of tips, which are, in both cases, constructed with a stiff center, along the lines of Sony's acclaimed "hybrid silicone ear-tips").<br/><br/>I'd recommend ordering these Panasonic phones for $5-6.  If you like them, order another set before they wear out and the price goes up.  If you don't, order the Sony phones and keep the Panasonics on hand for the inevitable day that they fail (providing you don't accidentally step on them first).<br/><br/>[Ignore the aficionados' advice to "burn in" the phones, even before wearing them.  Even with high-end, costly phones, that's merely reducing the average lifetime of the phones for listening.  Moreover, either of these ultra low-priced Panasonic or Sony phones is ready to go into action from the moment you extract a pair from the box.  (Feel free to ignore the crumpled up instructions and warranty.)]</span>

<span>The janitor recently stole the pair of Skullcandies I usually left at work.  I wanted a good music listening pair to replace them.  I recently bought several "cheapish" ear buds, one 20 dollar set, and a set of JVC flat headphones recently.  I couldn't decide based on reviews alone, so tried several different options.  I know it was silly.  I should have just spent it all on one "nice" pair, but I thought it would be fun, and it actually was.  Besides, why give the Janitor such a big target.  ;p  I also discovered different roles for the buds I bought.  They nearly all have a place in my collection.  :]  Win win.<br/><br/>I'm no audiophile, or sound professional.  Evenso, I bet I'm like a lot of you.  I want nice sounding music to accompany my day while quieting the environment.  I hope these comparisons will be helpful so you don't have to buy a bundle of buds, and can maybe zero in on a set or two that will serve your tastes best.  I enjoyed comparing and contrasting, and actually noting quit a bit of difference.<br/><br/>The buds/phones I tried are<br/><br/>iLuv iEP322ORG [orange] in-ear Ultra Bass ~6 dollars<br/>Panasonic RPHJE120K [black] in-ear ~6 dollars<br/>Yamaha EPH-20Bu [supposedly blue but actually purple] in- ear ~20 dollars<br/>JVC 10HAFC earphones ~3 dollars<br/>JVC "Flats" on ear headphones black ~12<br/>Skullycandy "Ink'd" in ear buds ~15 [already owned, but in for comparison]<br/>Sentry Wind-Ups in-ear buds ~5 dollars<br/><br/>iLuv:<br/>I chose the orange iLuv's because it was the cheapest color on Amazon.  I enjoyed their sound overall.  They are the most bass heavy of the group.  However, they leave the highs and mids a little neglected.  They also reduce ambient sound decently, so you can focus on what you are listening to.  So while these are not the most balanced, your teen will probably love the sound.  They are also on the "loud" side.  Even at minimum device volume these came in the loudest.  As such, I will probably put these in with one of my DS systems' carrying cases.  It will be great for those, and be on hand so I won't have to scrounge around for a pair, when I want to hear the game and not my wife's TV programs.  These also won't be my work or walking pair, because they don't look very adult [again, your teen will probably love them], and they produce the second most "cord noise" in the group from the cords rubbing on your shoulders or clothes while you are walking or exercising.  If I had nothing else to compare to, I think I'd have been very happy with this set.<br/><br/>Panasonic:<br/>The Panasonics were probably the quietest of the group.  Sound is relatively balanced, with no real extremes.  Bass seems light for an in ear bud.  They are now my go to bed buds.  I can put my device on minimum volume and easily go to sleep.  The iLuvs and Skullcandy were too loud to be comfortable on both my phone media player and iPad mini's lowest setting for sleeping.  The Panasonics are also small enough, that they weren't uncomfortable for side sleeping.  These also produced the least cord noise from movement, so should be good to walk, exercise in.  Noise reduction was decent and reduced my wife's snoring several decibels.  This might not be so great for outdoor exercise, where you may want to hear your environment for safety.  I may even get a second set or carry mine back and forth so I can walk at lunch break in these, since I have a protected area to walk [no cars, etc.].  The lack of cord noise really makes the difference here.<br/><br/>Yamaha:<br/>I was curious about what I would get by going a little upmarket.  Granted it's not much of a jump at "only" 20 dollars.  The Yamahas were probably most similar in sound to the Panasonics or JVC flats.  They had a good all around balance and were more full than the Panasonics.  Bass is not prominent, nor is it missing.  They sound best with Classical music in my experience.  On the down side, they were advertised as "blue", but Yamaha's idea of blue is very clearly Purple.  It's not a major issue, but be aware, if you choose this color.  Cord noise seemed on the loud side, compared to the JVC buds and Panasonics.  I probably would not want to do anything active in them.  However, if I could "only" have one bud, this might be it.<br/><br/>JVC HAF10C earbuds:<br/>For only around 3 dollars you shouldn't normally expect too much.  Agree?  Well, I already had a blue pair [ 4 dollars at retail] so knew what to expect.  It's a testament I bought another.  This pair was black, and I far prefer the gorgeous blue plastic set, but would not pay a couple extra dollars on Amazon for that choice.  I know it shouldn't matter, but I REALLY like blues.  Anyhow, the most unique feature of this set is the clamshell case you get.  It allows you to wind your cord and protect the buds.  I wish higher quality buds would do this.  I'd pay a couple extra bucks for it.  The case does not work well for most in-ear buds, I would guess.  I am able to get the above Yamahas in one case [why I ordered an extra set], but it is not a perfect fit.  Larger buds probably won't fit.  The buds themsevles have a durable hard plastic casing and should be quite durable.  Sound is actually nice, for non-in ear buds.  For the price I doubt you'd find better sound.  They are also on the quiet side, and not being directly in ear, you could probably give these to your kids without the threat of hearing damage you might get from louder and in ear buds.  I use these to walk, talk radio, and some music.  Unlike most in-ear, I can wear comfortably all day if I loosely cradle them on ear.  While outdoors, they allow you to hear the environment, including wind, which is a downside.  Fortunately, they do not generate the cord noise that is such a pet peeve of mine.  Great all around value.  I don't know that the value can be beat for the quality of plugs, and the very well designed case.  Being so cheap, I also don't have to fret too much if the Janitor decides to steal this pair also.<br/><br/>JVC "Flats":<br/>These are on ear headphones, so probably not fair to compare to ear buds.  Still they were part of my purchase, so I am including for contrast.  At only 12 dollars, I was very surprised how crisp and clean these sounded.  They delivered a balanced spectrum, without sacrificing bass as I'd expected.  They do not isolate noise as well as in-ear, but you do get some reduction without having to turn your music WAY up.  For straight music listening or watching a video, I might choose these most of the time at home.  They do not seem to generate cord noise due to movement, but are bulkier than what I want to walk in.  They also fold "flat" making them a nice travel pair for people who don't like in-ear buds.  I keep mine in an inexpensive ipad mini neoprene case, for example.  Would be easy to take on a plane.  I have a big head [really], despite their diminuitive size, they adjusted to fit very comfortably.  I can wear for long sessions, without bother.  Can't go wrong with these.<br/><br/>Skullcandy "Ink'd":<br/>This may not be a fair comparison either.  I think these had the greatest "retail" price when they were new, but I bought them on sale at Ross stores for about 15 dollars.  These are a few years old, so might be an older make than what is available now.  However, I am still surprised by how good these sound to me.  Of all the ear buds in my collection these are probably my favorite for music.  It figures, after buying several, the one I had still sounded best to me.  It has plenty of bass, without sacrificing the overall quality like the iLuvs seem to.  However, it is still one of the loudest of my collection, and is uncomfortable to sleep with on my devices.  My radio is more sensitive and can tune more quietly, but I rarely use that to sleep to.  This set also probably produces the most cord noise of any ear buds meaning they won't walk the beat with me.  It also features metallic red and white buds, white cord, and the companies trade mark as a red skull.  While I think they look "cool" the skull and colors all look a little childish.  They are not as garish as the iLuvs, but they are certainly second in my comparison.  That said, there are more sedate colorings available, however they all have the contrasting skull logo in some fashion or other.  As such these will mostly be used privately.<br/><br/>Sentry Wind-ups:<br/>These were my least favorite.  I was drawn in by the promise of a nifty carry case again.  I might have kept just for that, if they'd have worked.  However, the cord winder was rather difficult to accuate, at least for my biggish hands.  Also my pair of buds may have been defective.  The right bud produced only half the volume of the left.  I took back to Wal-mart asap.  At only 5 dollars, I didn't expect much, but I did expect balance across left and right.  I would presume that was a single item issue, but I did not want to get a second pair to find out.  Sound was more hollow than most I tried, not even measuring up to the 3 dollar JVC's.<br/><br/>There it is.  I hope you've these comments helpful in finding your pair.</span>
