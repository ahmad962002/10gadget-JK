<span>After researching several all in one soundbars (no external subwoofer).  I purchased this Samsung as an Amazon Warehouse Deal.  The unit arrived in excellent condition (packaging was scuffed as disclosed).  This Samsung was the only small soundbar I could find that had both Dolby Atmos and DTS-X capability along with Alexa built in (most others only "work with" a nearby Alexa device.  I plugged the unit in, attached provided HDMI cable to my TV's ARC connection and it instantly linked up - sound is amazing.  It also connected flawlessly to my home WIFI through my existing Samsung Smart Things app.  With the app you really don't need the included remote control.  The sound will surprise you - there are apparently 3 tweeters and 4 powered "woofers" inside the small cabinet.  There are also 4 passive radiators so you literally have sound coming from the front, each end for surround effects and from the back (2 passive radiators).  The other thing I have noticed is that the soundbar actually works better than my 1st generation Echo for all the Alexa functions.</span>

<span>I waited a while before giving this review. We purchased this sound bar for our 50" Samsung Frame tv. My wife wears hearing aides and was having trouble hearing dialogue especially when there is background music or sound effects with the built in tv speakers alone. I researched stand alone sound bars for hours and decided on this one recommended by Samsung for one stand out feature and that is the Q-symphony feature where it works in combination with the television speakers at the same time. This is our first sound bar we've ever had so I can't do a comparison, but I can say that it makes a huge difference in watching tv. You hear so much more and it is so much more "real" sounding and my wife can now make out the dialogue much better than before. Some movies have too much special sound effects that blur dialogue no matter what you listen with, but that is a Hollywood problem and not a speaker issue. The surround sound effect works so well that I have to pause it once in a while to listen for something in the other room or outside that I thought I could hear, but it is just the surround effect throwing sound all around (something we're not used to). Also, I had trouble setting it up and was frustrated until I found buried in the print that you have to do a restart if whatever it was wasn't working, and it has worked flawlessly since. Samsung needs to improve it's set up manual for sixty something neophytes like me.</span>

<span>Pretty simple to hook up and get going, gets pretty loud, perfect for a bedroom. The remote is a little weird though, there's no volume indication when you turn it up or down, could be my tv, however the remote's volume buttons are more a kin to flip switches than they are buttons. It works but again, is annoying. Still, id recommend this sound bar.</span>

<span>Aesthetic: The soundbar looks beautiful and compliments the room very well. Probably the best looking sound bar I've ever had. Soft round edges are very welcoming.<br/><br/>Performance: So far the performance has been a great. Listening to music fills a pretty large room and kitchen. It get's loud and the bass is noticeable. I'm very satisfied with the performance considering the price I paid ($270). I'm not an audiophile, but I do enjoy having high quality speakers and this sound bar doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Connectivity: I've read reviews about connectivity issues, but I haven't experienced any. The soundbar is super easy to set up through the Samsung app and I haven't had a problem connecting through spotify or any other platform.</span>

<span>On its own its gorgeous. Covered in a cross Grey fabric with hidden lights and stylish controls right on top, as apposed to hard black plastic. The virtual immersing sound fills the room with a punch that comes from everywhere. Along with the vocal clarity of the center speaker and flawlessly paired with the s9100 wirelessly paired rear speakers and you are covered in virtual dtx sound. Yea ... that's not the one I got. Mine had to have the power plug removed for 5 seconds then reinstalled to get the unit to see the HDMI-ARC connection that had the be performed every time the unit turned on. Pairing to the rear speakersbwas automatic but the advertised control of rear speakers didn't happen. There were just too many glitches to justify keeping such a sweet sounding piece of art. Perfect for a mid size livingroom or bedroom. Remote is straight forward. It will also control libraries of music and i believe samsung TVs. But the unit glitched controli g rear dpeakers ad advertised. Samsung support tried with a firmware update but did not provide the cure to the problem so I reluctantly returned it and stepped up the ladder to the HW-A650. With luck it will perform as advertised without problems.<br/>So...affordable impressive sounding system that looks gorgeous with plenty of volume to immerse you in beautiful sound I hope to be specific to my glitch, but, after that it was heaven.</span>

<span>This was at the low  to mid point in pricing. The sound quality is acceptable as an adjunct to your tv's internal speaker but if you think this will provide a rich sound.. it doesn't. The speaker on the tv (a pioneer plasma) my Samsung replaced was better than this one. I did buy a "like new" product and did get a 50 dollar discount.. so I paid 175 for this until instead of 225...<br/>Now for the good<br/>This was child's play to hook up..

<span>TL;DR - Soundbar is top-notch but the subwoofer is wireless and problematic. My best advice is to upgrade to a soundbar/woofer combo with a wired connection.<br/><br/>My experience<br/><br/>I was very excited to upgrade my home entertainment system with this SAMSUNG HW-B650. The package arrived on a Friday and I got everything set up via BT and HDMI for movie night. I followed the steps for pairing the soundbar (success) and connecting the subwoofer (set ID). Unboxing, teardown, and set-up happened in about 30 mins or less. I was so eager for some bass/low end in my home entertainment system. The subwoofer showed solid blue light but no air or low-end frequencies were coming through it. I tried various subwoofer tests and rap videos with bass drops. I even tried my PS4 to see if I could trigger the subwoofer through Game mode. NOTHING.<br/><br/>Troubleshooting<br/><br/>I performed the manual connection steps for the subwoofer. No change - solid blue light. Tried adjusting tone controls and turning bass settings to +6. NOTHING. Tried using BT, HDMI, and Optical connections. No difference. Even went as far as upgrading the firmware with the July 2022 version, performing a factory reset on my Samsung 43 TV and a factory reset of the soundbar. Worth noting that I tried different power sources - plugging the woofer and soundbar into independent power outlets, with and without a surge protector. NOTHING.<br/><br/>Samsung Tech support call<br/><br/>Fast forward to this week, called Samsung support. Did troubleshooting with Samsung tech. After about 45 minutes, the outcome was a subwoofer replacement (estimated 10-20 business days). I hope I am making the right choice by going through the manufacturer instead of Amazon. I guess I will find out soon enough. Fingers crossed that this is just a faulty/wiring issue with the subwoofer. I am posting this to make others aware of the challenges with this product and maybe to spare you from the 4+ hours of frustrating troubleshooting, disappointment, and emotional/psychological exhaustion. So, much for movie night :(</span>

<span>We bought a new TV.<br/>Boy was I disappointed - the sound volume was pitiful!<br/>So we got this sound bar to amp up the volume, Not exactly the results that I wanted.<br/>When we play older DVDs on our new TV, without the sound bar the volume was too low to hear at all if there was any background noise (even a neighbor mowing his grass, or trucks going by). With the old TV, these same videos would require max volume, but we could hear it if maxed out. With the new TV, and with no sound bar, the background noise would wipe out the volume and we'd have to replay a segment.<br/>With the sound bar, we are back where we were with the old TV -- just barely enough volume at Max.<br/>Maybe I was expecting too much, but I got more Watts than was recommended for the size of our room, and it just isn't enough!<br/>If anyone has any suggestions for getting better performance (other than getting a hearing aid!) - I'd appreciate the feedback.</span>

<span>I'd been looking for a soundbar to replace my Samsung 2.1 I've had since 2016. I wanted something with Atmos, even though not a lot of content. I've been through 4 other soundbars, 1 was 5.1.2, two 3.1.2's, and one 2.1.2. The problem I was running into was that the center channel putting out the voice always sounded completely separate from rest of the sound, which is distracting to me (if it doesn't bother you, the LG SP8YA is an awesome deal and great sound, great atmos). Like having the music coming from two speakers and the voice coming from an Amazon Echo. I would be looking right at the center channel.<br/><br/>This Samsung, which was my last shot, doesn't have that problem. The voice doesn't sound divorced from the rest. If it's something with harder to hear voice, I can quickly change a setting or two. The Atmos is decent, no better or worse than other Atmos soundbars I've heard (I tried Carnival Row for this). I played a bunch of shows I've rewatched before, like Survivor, Masterchef, and the Amazing Race, and sounds great. Playing Expedition Unknown, I heard audio I've never heard before.<br/><br/>Music wise, played a few songs I always use to set up sound, Steely Dan's Aja and Black Sabbath's Heaven And Hell, and sounded pretty good. I'd still use my receiver for those, but, nice to see this hit the notes.<br/><br/>Some complain that the bass module is not strong enough, and, granted, I'd rather use the one that came with the old sound bar, but, it does well enough. Highly recommend this soundbar.</span>

<span> It's good enough to be top-rated by Consumer Reports, in my opinion. I'll give some tips on why or why not to get it, and what it is:<br/><br/>* I wouldn't get it if your TV doesn't have HDMI eARC capability. If your TV only does HDMI ARC, I'd save a fair bit and get an ARC (not eARC) soundbar.<br/><br/>* If you're going to also stream music to this soundbar from your phone, iPad or other device, this is a good choice. Very fast &amp; easy Bluetooth pairing.<br/><br/>* If you will stream music directly from your router (Wi-Fi), you're in business because it does that too.<br/><br/>* If you want an included Bluetooth subwoofer of excellent quality, it's a good choice. Of course, at this price you will be using a subwoofer, I expect. You'll like the subwoofer.<br/><br/>* Operating power consumption is 28W, whereas regular speakers on average use 100W. The soundbar and the subwoofer each draws .5W in standby mode. But use a high quality surge protector with it, because it doesn't have a surge protector built-in. I know this from calling to check since the manual didn't mention it.<br/><br/>* If you prefer traditional surround sound, consider that this unit uses Dolby Atmos (or you can use DTS:X). Which one is preferable probably depends more on the room than anything. Dolby Atmos is right for me which is one reason I selected this Q-series soundbar.<br/><br/>* This soundbar features 4K Pass-through and HDR.<br/><br/>* Handles Alexa voice which may come in handy depending on how you roll and your views on privacy.<br/><br/>* Remote control, included, is quite intuitive as expected of Samsung, one of the major brands for soundbars.<br/><br/>* If you're going to mount this soundbar, be aware that the brackets are designed such that they're 24" apart. Believe me, this is a heavy soundbar, something I would not personally mount on drywall with mere anchors, but that's me - I don't like creating large holes in the drywall to accommodate anchors; I want to secure something with weight to studs to be more secure. Because the studs in my wall are 16" apart, I'm going to buy brackets separately and use wood screws to put them into the studs. And I'm going to use nano tape to make sure the soundbar is truly secure on the brackets I'll select. At any rate, Samsung doesn't provide screws for the wall. The only screws they provide is for affixing the brackets they include to the soundbar. See my photos to know exactly what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>* This is an appropriate soundbar if your TV processes Dolby Digital Plus, but not if your TV only processes Dolby Digital. You want to be able to get Dolby Atmos which isn't possible if your TV doesn't use Dolby Digital Plus.<br/><br/>* You can later add 2 back speakers that will connect with Bluetooth to this soundbar. Samsung sells those, of course. I called Samsung to ask about how this soundbar decodes sound for the back speakers, and the guy I spoke with had to get with his manager who concluded I would need to call their expert on this. I was provided the number to call the expert which I will probably get around to in a couple months.<br/><br/>* The soundbar itself has 8 speakers. It uses a lot of technology to make extremely sophisticated sound that justifies the price. I'm delighted with it.</span>

<span>Problem with this is the volume changes depending on what you're using it for. Playing games or streaming from a gaming system it works GREAT! Watching cable thru a DIN cable  always seems to be iffy. Sometimes you have to turn the volume to 100 just to hear other times it's just okay. Another problem sometimes the remote disconnects from the bar and you'll have to unplug the sound bar and do a hard reset. Overall when it works it's great.</span>

<span>I own a Samsung q600 3.1.2 channel soundbar. I bought these speakers to go with it to make it a 5.1.2. At first they weren’t working well at all. The volume was so low you could barely hear it. Then I figured out how to raise the volume through the soundbar so I turned it up to the max of 6. (-6 to 6) and it still wasn’t great. I almost returned them and then I figured out the problem! My tv and devices were set to pcm audio. I changed it to both the dts and the atmos setting instead and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. The speakers work excellent now! My surround sound system is perfect with these additional speakers. I see many people having the same volume issue. If you are, I suggest looking in your tv audio settings and changing it from pcm(which I think is default) to the dts or atmos (must be using hdmi eARC)I use the dts but I’ve gotten similar results from both. Good luck I hope this helps and enjoy !</span>

<span>I purchased these speakers to go with my Samsung HW-Q700A sound bar, and they worked quite well once I got them set up.  I had no difficulty in pairing them from about 15 feet away from the main sound bar, and they both sound and look good.  My biggest compliant was the documentation.  Both the sound bar and the speakers from Samsung come with little to no documentation, and there is no way you can figure out how to use them on your own as the controls on the sound bar and the remote are not intuitive at all.  I downloaded the full manuals which provided a lot more information, and also found a few videos which helped a lot.  The power cords that come with the speaker set are way too short to be of much use, but there are cords with the same plug readily available on Amazon in 8, 10, 12, and 15 foot lengths.  I had hoped to route the cord through speaker stands that I purchased for them- but the plugs were just too big.  I ended up cutting the cords in the middle then splicing them back together in order to keep a neat appearance on the stand.  My only suggestion to Samsung on the design would be to try to find a smaller power cord that can more easily fit in a speaker stand pole.</span>

<span>I’m giving them 4 stars because the wires that Samsung included are useless. They are really short and the angled receptors don’t fit through any stand on the market to conceal them. Sure, the angle conceal the connection to the speakers themselves, but that angle makes it impossible to conceal the actual wire in any stand, for the people who don’t want to see any wires. Buy a couple of wires when you buy this set.<br/><br/>It’s hard for me to rate their audio performance since it’s the second set of speakers I have owned, and I haven’t tried the  Dolby Atmos yet, so I’m giving them 5 stars on Sound Quality in advance, but will update if I notice anything. Keep in mind these are $300 rear speakers, plus the $600 retail price of the sound bar, so this set (soundbar and speakers) should compete with the Sonos bar in audio quality at least.<br/><br/>Volume control gets 1 star deduction because it’s not readily accessible as it should be (you’ll have to navigate through the settings of the soundbar with their small letters on the corner to find the volume of the rear speakers)<br/><br/>As I stated before, do yourself a favor and buy the 10 ft two-prong non-polarized wires on Amazon, so you can send through any tubes or plug them where you need them.</span>

I wanted something that takes up minima space, and had better clarity than TV speakers. I got this on sale for around $110, and for the price the A550 works well. It pairs with the sub so you can place the sub where you want it and you don’t need to worry about routing wires. It also pairs with your phone so you can play music from it. The soundbar looks clean and doesn’t have annoying lights. You can mount it on the wall if you want.  It’s just a soundbar, so be aware it is not as “full” sounding as having 5 physical speakers for 5.1. It can use HDMI ARC, HDMI, or optical and BT for other devices.<br/><br/>Gripes:<br/>1. When using Optical the sound cut out. Not sure why, but I switched to HDMI.<br/>2. Installing updates requires downloading a file to a certain type of flash drive, and then inserting into the soundbar. There is instructions on it, but some of my flash drives were incompatible.</span>

<span>Unfortunately this perches was spoiled by seller sent only one speacker at the time even though I ordered two so another one came later and the second speaker came in t only one box not two original boxes as the first one. Box was completely destroyed which make me think that this product was returned but sold as a brand new. I really hope that this speacker will work will work with no problem. Also you cannot save previous settings on this speaker if you have more than two you will have to connect through group play but every time you press power button and will decide to listen to the music through more than two speaker again you will have to set it again. I only had the speakers for a few days but I already experienced loss of connection between the speakers during group Play. With 2 speakers is no problem us both can be played from your phone and don't need to be interfere with each other but if you have three speaker you will have to use group Play and connectivity is not perfect sometimes it's disconnects itself.</span>

<span>this is our second SEREONIC  speaker in 8 years. Our first one lasted through 2 T.V.s &amp; only had sound issues at the end when it started cutting out randomly. For the first month our new 2nd unit  was great, but then the sound started cutting out randomly, we've been constantly trouble shooting for the past month. we finally bought a sound bar to test with our T.V. &amp; found that there is no sound cutting out with the sound bar. We tried everything that Sereonic suggested but nothing helped. We realized that one of the things that had changed in our livingroom, since we first started having problems with our Sereonic ( 1st and 2nd unit) was that we had gotten a very large heavy ottoman around the same time that we began experiencing issues. when we moved the ottoman (which was at the same level as the base, but much lower than the speaker) there seemed to be no sound issue. Also, when we moved the base and the removeable speaker top part away from the ottoman so that there was a clear line of sight (for the signal) it seemed to resolve the issue.  (Mind you the ottoman was NOT squarely/directly in between them in the 1st place but rather on the very near peripheral so it never occurred to us that it might be a problem to begin with ) Please note: Our TV &amp; Sereonic base &amp; speaker are less than 10 feet away from each other. Another thing we had tried unsuccessfully was  keeping the Speaker &amp; base plugged in right next to where we sat (instead of having the base next to the TV across from us &amp; just the speaker sitting next to us-which was our normal way of using it.) this did not seem to make a difference-we still had sound cutting out. So in the end it was all very puzzling  &amp; though it seemed nonsensical, we felt like it must be the ottoman interfering somehow &amp; now we have had no problems with the sound cutting out</span>

<span>It's well designed. There's a switch on the back with 3 equalizer (treble, normal, bassy) settings, which works well with the speaker system.  The wireless pairing was already done when I got it.  I charged it, used the phono audio inputs..............and it just works.  As a big consumer, lots of things I buy don't always work like the manufacturer says, but this does.</span>

The Bose TV Speaker helps you hear your TV better. It’s a small sound bar that clarifies speech and improves overall TV sound. Inside the TV speaker there are two full-range drivers angled to deliver wide, spacious sound and a center tweeter specifically focused on elevating vocals. Built-in Dolby decoding helps further enhance this compact TV speaker’s audio capabilities to deliver a more realistic and satisfying listening experience. Designed with simplicity in mind, this small soundbar only uses a single connection to the TV via an optical audio cable (included) or an HDMI cable (sold separately) and has you up and running in minutes. At just over 2" tall, the Bose TV Speaker is a compact sound bar that can be placed just about anywhere. And small LED lights on the front of this small soundbar turn on and/or change color for visual confirmation when certain features are enabled. They also blink in acknowledgement of volume changes. The Bose TV Speaker has HDMI-CEC, which allows the TV and this small soundbar to communicate when connected with an HDMI cable. Meaning when you turn the TV on, the TV speaker will automatically turn on too. With this technology, you can even keep using your current TV remote to control the volume of this compact soundbar. However, the Bose TV Speaker comes with its own remote. And on it, you can enable “dialogue mode” on the TV speaker to elevate vocals even more or press the “bass” button for some extra depth. This compact soundbar also is a Bluetooth soundbar. Simply press the Bluetooth button on the remote to pair your device to this Bluetooth TV speaker and wirelessly stream your favorite music or podcasts. You can also expand your system at any time by adding a wired subwoofer to the Bluetooth TV speaker for a more home-theater-like experience. The Bose TV Speaker is compatible with the Bose Bass Module 500 and 700 and requires the Bose Bass Module Connection Cable or a standard 3.5 mm audio cable, sold separately.

<span>After about 7 years the sound on one of the two original versions of this speaker box I have started cutting out and had to be constantly unplugged and plugged back in, but it served me well.<br/><br/>As my placement for this is in a bookcase that is too narrow for a longer soundbar, I was glad to find this model to replace my original one.  As an additional bonus, this newer version now allows me to stream music from my MacBook and iPhone.<br/><br/>My only issue was that the included instructions were quite limited on how to use this box — unless a sheet was missing — and I finally found online that it is easy to switch back to TV sound by hitting a square icon next to the power button.  It should have been obvious to me, but I’ve always like written instructions.  (Don’t ask me what I think about putting stuff together from that big Swedish retailer.)<br/><br/>The sound on this Bose system is much richer than the already good sound on my Sony 4K TV.  I also am glad that this box has a digital optical Orion , as I use the two HDMI connectors that are buried in my wall to connect my Apple TV and DVD player.</span>
