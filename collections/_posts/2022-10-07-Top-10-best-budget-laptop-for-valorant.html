The ASUS Laptop L210MA is designed to help you be productive all day — even when you’re on the move. This compact and lightweight 11.6 inch laptop is powered by the latest Intel processor and provides long lasting battery life. With eMMC storage and pre-loaded Windows 10 in S mode, it offers full compatibility with a wide range of software and peripherals. It’s the best laptop for people on the go. *The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 (Gen 1 and 2), and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to  system configuration and your operating environment.

<span>If you're working within the limitations of this platform, then there's really nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>It's an excellent throw-in-a-bag-and-go laptop.  No bells and whistles (except the numpad/mousepad), excellent battery life, and a surprisingly robust plastic chassis.  One charge usually gets about 10 hours of useful life, and that's without extreme battery saving settings in use.<br/><br/>The num-/mouse-pad is great.  The caveat to that is that it's mostly useless unless you have an external mouse, or are only using it in spreadsheets.  Having to toggle between functionality makes it mostly useless, otherwise.  But (!!) it does give you a one-hand numpad, which is unheard of in other laptops this size, so that's pretty incredible in its own right.<br/><br/>It should go without saying:  unless you're talking about solitaire or minesweeper, you shouldn't be trying to game on this thing.  That's not what it's for, that's not what it's good at.  But for basic productivity, it's hard to argue with this thing for usability and utility, especially at this price.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>Aspire 5 with 4gb RAM 128gb PCIe NVMe SSD drive notes (long, so you may want to skip this review):<br/><br/>Aluminum cover, plastic housing.<br/><br/>Left side ports - Ethernet cable, HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Headphone jack.<br/>Right side ports - Kensington computer lock port, USB 2.0.<br/><br/>Notably missing - no port for SD cards at all.<br/><br/>Not a touch screen, but nice in color and clarity. (Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).<br/><br/>The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.<br/><br/>Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port.  Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).<br/><br/>Windows "S" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home.  It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to "S" version.<br/><br/>To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry.  You may want to Google instructions to verify):<br/><br/>Go to Settings.<br/>Then select Update &amp; Security.<br/>In the left sidebar, click Activation.<br/>Then click “Go to the Store.”<br/>Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.  These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.<br/><br/>The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).<br/><br/>If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS.  Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify.  See below on how to get into BIOS.<br/><br/>The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5).  You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade.  A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected.  If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.<br/><br/>The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes.  Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.<br/><br/>The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing.  Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word.  YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord  at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.<br/><br/>The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.<br/><br/>The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with "5.94gb usable".  The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display.  If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed).  16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed.  For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable.  YMMV.<br/><br/>How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers.  I found them quite simple.  Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover.  Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar).  Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.<br/><br/>"Bloatware" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk.  The "Microsoft Office" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.<br/><br/>After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications.  I have 78gb of free space left on "C" drive.<br/><br/>The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb).  I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface.  If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line.  I also found the "Full 1080 HD" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off.  So I did.  If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker?  THAT one I would leave in place.  As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information.  (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).<br/><br/>A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off.  If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles "Airplane Mode" on/off.  Note that the "function" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.).  To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the "Fn" key simultaneously.  Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open.  If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS.  To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).<br/><br/>For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14" range (11" for road trips).  That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop.  At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad.  Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers.  YMMV.<br/><br/>If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ce<br/><br/>HTH<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Jim</span>

<span>This is considered a budget computer, but for us computer geeks, this is the base for several "premium" models. I can't really write a review of the computer out of the box because before I ever turned it on, I installed a 2nd RAM card, then when I booted it, I signed into my account which changed it from Windows 10 S mode to Windows 10 Pro since I have several Windows 10 Pro product keys associated with my account.<br/><br/>With that being said, this computer outperforms what it is meant to do. Is this going to be the strongest computer you can buy? No, not at all. However, this computer has edited large videos for me in minutes, I can use my music notation software on it with no lag or freezing (Sibelius), and it does actually process games at the higher resolutions. I've tested games as demanding as Forza Horizon 4 and it, surprisingly, performs with no issues. It does run hotter, of course, but not exactly "hot". Heavier usage draws down the battery, but that can be said for literally any electronic device.<br/><br/>I purchased this to replace my well-aged HP G60 whatever model that was that I purchased 12 years ago and just kept updating. Up until around July 2020, it was still up to specs to work from home, something I actually bought that computer for 12 years ago. Finally, an update to most of the work at home platforms finally rendered that old beast useless. Ironically, I used the stimulus check from back then (2008) to purchase that computer. With that laptop in mind, I premium laptop to me is one that I can upgrade and repair easily. The HP G60 line did that quite well. Now here in 2020, I purchased one of these for someone else at first. During setup, I noticed the slot to add another SSD, I added the second RAM chip for that one as well since I already knew about that, but I also noticed how easy it was to work on it. We booted it up, put a Windows 10 Pro key on it as well, and from the start, I was impressed with the performance. I was so impressed that I bought myself one.<br/><br/>This thing is super lightweight. The keyboard does have slight smaller keys which takes all of about 20 seconds to get used to. This is because it fit a full number pad on the right of the main keyboard, something that is a must for me with a laptop. One thing I absolutely don't find at this price range is the backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: with the backlight turned on for the keyboard, your battery time can be reduced by as much as 50%. You really don't need it if you're used to typing on pretty much any keyboard, but it's nice when you do need it at night in the middle of a shift. The button to turn it on and off is located pretty much at the center of the top row (F keys). Just to the left of that is the button to turn off the track pad. Very nice placement on both of those.<br/><br/>The graphics seems to use a combination of resources that gives you 5 GB reserved just for graphics processing. Not bad at all. This must be what pushes it to be able to do a lot more than expected for this price.<br/><br/>It's nice going into the Microsoft Store to check the system requirements on games (Halo series, Forza Horizon, etc) and not see any red indicating the computer doesn't meet the requirements.<br/><br/>For working from home, this is excellent for those resources that might require a proprietary desktop that you have to load and run via USB. It also has a built in ethernet port, which is usually required for those particular work from home platforms, but it also performs flawlessly on the 5 GHz wifi networks for the rest.<br/><br/>As a digital nomad, I also have to upload and edit and create videos. This thing surprisingly gets through Adobe and other applications with ease and renders videos quite fast.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a quick purchase for me to replace my aged out HP and then I'd get another good laptop later on, but I'm probably just going to buy a couple more of these.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>I've noticed two things that improved performance. First, I downloaded the full AMD Radeon Software (it comes with the "lite" version) and that opened up a lot of performance tweaks on both the cpu and gpu.<br/><br/>Also, I'm noticing the battery time listed must be an overall average. When I'm just browsing, watching a few Youtube videos in the browser, and doing stuff like writing product reviews, with the brightness turned down to the lowest setting and with the backlit keyboard off, I seem to get between 9 and 10 hours of battery life from a full charge. Not sure if that's normal for this device, but it's what I keep noticing. Make sure you also turn off bluetooth and location and all that other stuff you're likely not using because those can draw the battery down quickly. When I have the brightness up, keyboard lights on, playing games with the Xbox controller connected via bluetooth, working (headset in, running work platform software), the battery time can be as low as 5 hours from a full charge.<br/><br/>I don't allow any sleep or hibernate functions. Those tend to kill a hard drive. There's nothing I'm ever doing that can't just be saved so I can properly shut the computer down. Sleep and hibernate modes can also do some strange things to batteries, usually causing software glitches that can wreck even the best batteries. They can also cause data fragmentation... all in all, I just don't use those functions on any computer, and for all I know, it could contribute to the better luck I have with laptop batteries and having never had hard drive failure.</span>

<span>I would just like to note that this model only has one RAM slot, not two, as the Q&amp;A answers from Acer have stated. I purchased two 16GB modules on the basis that I would be able to take out the 4GB module and then put the two new ones in, giving me 32GB total. However when you take the back cover off, there is only one RAM slot on the motherboard. I don't mean one FREE ram slot, just one slot, period. It's empty, which means I was able to put one of the 16GB modules in, making for a total of 20GB, which isn't bad, but it's annoying to do your due diligence and read everything you can about a product, including statements from the manufacturer, only to find that the reality is different. My guess is that earlier models did in fact have two RAM slots, but since Amazon mixes models together on the same product page, it can be impossible to know exactly which model someone is talking about. Whatever, it is what it is, just know that this particular model A515-46-R3UB only has a single RAM slot. I don't even know where the other 4GB module is, maybe soldered onto the motherboard elsewhere, but I looked everywhere and I couldn't see any other places to put a second RAM module. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am a software developer and I have built my own PC from motherboard up, so I know what a RAM slot looks like. This only has one, so be warned.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me about this was the arrangement for inserting a 2.5 hard drive. In my case I wanted to put a 4TB Samsung SSD, which fit just fine into the frame, and then you screw the frame into the case, which is fine. The bad part is the little, itsy bitsy ribbon cable that have to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. First, I had to look up a youtube video to even know what I needed to look for on the motherboard. It's a tiny little slot covered with a white rubber cover, which you lever up, and then slide the end of the ribbon cable into it. The problem is, there's no positivity to the connection, like you have with the larger size regular SATA cables. No "click", because the cable is just a flexible, thin piece of plastic. There's not even any way to really know if it's aligned correctly. So you just fiddle around with it, not knowing if you're damaging the flimsy thing as you try to push it into a slot which gives you zero tactile feedback. After many attempts to insert it, only to feel it lift away without any resistance (meaning it hadn't inserted at all), eventually I got it to "stay", though it wasn't quite straight, that was as good as I could get it. Horrible design, if you ask me. I don't see that they couldn't have made the port a "real" one, there was plenty of height inside the case to be able to accommodate it. But again, whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, I wanted to put Debian on here, since I assumed that the latest version would work with the hardware. Not so much. The Wifi hardware in particular just would not work at all, even with Bullseye. And when I tried putting unstable on there, it stopped dead during install asking me to supply a number of firmware files which appeared to be related to the Wifi hardware, but I couldn't find those files anywhere online. Very frustrating.<br/><br/>Eventually I ended up installing Ubuntu instead, which isn't ideal since I like my development environment to be the same as my server, which is Debian. But I decided to try it, since I know that Ubuntu tends to do a better job with strange hardware drivers. Sure enough, it went without a hitch this time, and the wifi worked.<br/><br/>So now I have an Ubuntu laptop with a 4TB SSD and 20GB RAM, and it seems ok so far, so I'll probably keep it since other options out there seem to have their own issues - either the screen is bad, or the keyboard, or whatever, there's always something. At least this laptop seems to have a nice screen, the keyboard isn't too bad, and 20GB, while not what I wanted, should be enough to do what I want in reality. The webcam seems a little grainy, but I'm not a big webcam user anyway, so.<br/><br/>All in all it's a pretty good deal, if you know what you're going to have to deal with and are willing to fiddle around a bit. The one RAM slot, tiny trashy hard drive cable, and driver issues with Linux (at least the Wifi), everything can be worked around to some extent. I guess it just depends what you are willing to put up with.<br/><br/>I was thinking about posting a photo of the motherboard to show the single RAM slot, but it's all screwed back together now (11 tiny screws) so to be honest I can't be bothered. Just take my word for it, there's just the one RAM slot, not two as all the Q&amp;A seem to say. Be warned.</span>

<span>This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.<br/><br/>Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.<br/><br/>The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.<br/><br/>The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.<br/><br/>This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.<br/><br/>Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.<br/><br/>Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.<br/><br/>Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.<br/><br/>The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.<br/><br/>I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.<br/><br/>The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.<br/><br/>This boots in about 15 seconds.<br/><br/>It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.<br/><br/>This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.<br/><br/>I can't sing the praises of this enough.<br/><br/>Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.<br/><br/>Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.<br/><br/>This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.</span>

<span>This computer was bought by my parents as a gift for me, as my school required us to have a laptop, but then suddenly at the open house they said that our computers would most likely not work w the wifi and that the school was gonna provide us w laptops. I thought this was really stupid, but bcs of this I got to use the laptop for personal use, like games etc.. And it works wonders, it loads genshin impact perfectly as well as Roblox, league and final fantasy 14, my only problem now is that for some reason it will start to suddenly disconnect from the internet, but other than that its perfect.</span>

<span>I got this on Prime Day as a backup/secondary laptop. When I received it, I wanted to give it a good, solid test run, so I used only this laptop for everything I did for about three weeks. I found it to be surprisingly fast and I had no problems at all running my usual stuff--many tabs open in Chrome, Word, streaming video, email, music, etc.  The screen is average/above-average. The keyboard is quite nice to type on! The trackpad is okay, but I did have some irritating moments where it wasn't always as responsive as I needed it to be. The battery life, sadly, was sub par for me. Even keeping the screen brightness turned down to no more than middle of the road, I couldn't really get much more than 3 or maaaaaybe 4 hours. I tinkered with settings to try to help the issue, but in this day and age, I feel like I shouldn't have to reduce everything to the bare, bare minimum to squeeze out 4 hours of battery life. Not when I can get a full day of use on my other laptops without charging.<br/><br/>I did have some Windows 11 glitches with it (several times it wouldn't let me log-in with fingerprint but it also wouldn't let me log in with my pin either and I'd have to reboot), but that's par for the course and hopefully as updates come out, those will be corrected. And that's operating system stuff, not a hardware issue. I'm only pointing it out for people who might be buying this laptop for someone who would find issues like that particularly frustrating.<br/><br/>If you need a solid laptop for light use, you're not going to be too mobile with it, and it'll be mainly plugged in, this is a decent everyday budget laptop. If you need something with more robust battery life, however, this may not be the best choice for you.</span>

<span>Edit: This was originally a five-star review. I'm still really happy with my purchase, but I ran into stuttering on YouTube videos and unimpressive/inconsistent download times that I couldn't seem to fix. Come to find out the wifi cards that come preinstalled on these laptops leave something to be desired. This isn't a big deal if you have an ethernet cable handy, but it would likely be a massive pain for anyone meaning to, say, write an essay at a coffee shop.<br/><br/>I swapped out the wifi card in my old laptop for the one in this one and it works flawlessly. I can't vouch for it, but I've read Intel's AX200NGW wifi card is a good replacement for the one that comes stock in these machines. If you're going to be adding RAM or an extra HDD anyway, swapping out the wifi card isn't too difficult; the tiny connectors are just really finicky. I could live with the wifi as it was, but I don't have access to a wired connection as much as I'd like. If that's you, be prepared for a bit of tinkering.<br/><br/>Everything else I said stands.<br/><br/>Edit 2: Elden Ring runs great on this.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I paid a little under $750 for this laptop. Out the gate, I added 32GB of RAM, which cost me around $150. That's overkill - 16GB is perfectly serviceable on this configuration, especially without a secondary SSD, and 16GB would cost roughly half that. I wanted to future proof my purchase and make it simple to switch out my secondary mechanical drive in the future.<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend swapping the RAM for two 16GB sticks (you want them to be the same variety to get the most performance and bang for your buck) and the 8GB my model came with is only just enough for Windows at this point. If you only intend to run Steam and some games, it might do. If you have a Chromium-based web browser running in the background, forget about it. Trust me - extra RAM will save you a lot of headache.<br/><br/>My model didn't come with easy access panels on the back for adding an HDD or for changing out the RAM. Luckily the screws are fairly easy to remove, and the panel came off pretty easily with a plastic pry tool. (Amazon sells the kit I use - it's really handy to have on hand in case you ever need to get inside your machine. Search "Syntus Electronic Repair Tool Kit with Magnetic Driver Kit, 80 in 1 Professional Precision Screwdriver Set with Portable Pouch for iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Gaming Console, Controller, Black")<br/><br/>There's two M.2 slots and one SATA slot. I wouldn't recommend mounting a second M.2 drive - one, I'm not sure how you'd safely mount it in this revision. Two, if you watch Linus Tech Tips video on the performance difference between a SATA SSD and M.2 drives, you'll see that the average user isn't going to notice a difference between the two types of SSDs. Frankly, my 7200rpm mechanical drive loads things really quickly on this laptop, so I'm not even in a rush to upgrade from that. Games like The Witcher 3 run perfectly fine off of it. (And honestly, if you're on a budget and don't want to deck out this laptop with the best kit it can handle, 2TB 7200rpm mechanical drives can be had for around $40-$80 these days.)<br/><br/>The build quality is fantastic. You can tell which parts of it are a little cheaper than others - I'd be careful with the plastic tabs when you're prying the bottom off; take your time with it - but it feels solid the moment you take it out the box. The back of the IPS panel is mounted to metal. The bezels are designed such that it's entirely feasible for you, as the user, to open up and work on your own hardware. From a right-to-repair standpoint, this machine is as good as it gets in this price range. Even if you have no interest in working on it or ever opening it up, you can take it to a local computer shop and be rest assured they can easily get to whatever they need to work on.<br/><br/>The screen is the part most likely to fail on a laptop over extended use. I haven't cracked open the bezel on my unit because my screen was in perfect working order and after a nightmare I had with a different laptop, I just wanted to get back to using my computer. Looking up tutorials and images online, every model of this computer I've seen uses screws to hold the screen in place. No glue or anything like that. In the event that you or a technician ever needs to swap out the screen for a different one, it should be a fairly simple process.<br/><br/>And again I return to build quality - I've noticed very little light bleed when I'm running various applications. This is not the best ips panel I have ever used, but let me stress again - for the price? It's amazing. High refresh rate. Everything is crystal clear. Good contrast. It's been a joy to do photo editing work on it.<br/><br/>For gaming - I use Linux as my daily driver, and removed Windows from this device as soon as I got it set up and made sure there weren't any malfunctions or defects that would warrant calling the manufacturer or returning it to Amazon.<br/><br/>If you're curious whether this makes a good Linux machine - yes, with some caveats. My model - 15ACH6 - did not have working wifi out of the box in Pop OS or Manjaro.<br/><br/>I initially wanted to use Pop OS because it has great hybrid graphics support (better than Windows, if you ask me) and it comes pre-packed with tools to help maximize your laptop's battery life. However, making the wifi work wasn't a simple fix. There are several methods; the least complicated one for me was upgrading the kernel. Problem is - Pop OS is an Ubuntu-based OS and isn't designed to have the kernel upgraded independent of the operating system.<br/><br/>Long story short - I got Pop OS working perfectly, but getting the kernel upgraded was just the first issue I had to solve. I also had to change the power management settings so my wifi wasn't throttled, and my printer was detected but wasn't working properly out of the box.<br/><br/>Manjaro makes it easy to upgrade the kernel, and I was up and running within an hour. The thing that took the longest was waiting for all the updates to install. The only thing I had to do to make full use of my hardware was update the Nvidia drivers, manually install the Optimus Switcher (look up "How to setup Optimus Manager on Manjaro! | DenshiHelp" on YouTube, especially if you use KDE) and adjust the power management settings.<br/><br/>If you're a Linux user or you're Linux-curious, Manjaro is your best bet on this thing if you want a relatively painless experience. (This is also why I bought so much RAM - if I absolutely have to use Windows for any reason, I want the extra memory to run a VM.)<br/><br/>Mind, this shouldn't be an issue in the future. The latest version of Pop OS at the time of this writing is 21.10. If you get this same model of this laptop and newer revisions of the major Linux operating systems have been released, it should be a fairly seamless experience regardless of which one you choose.<br/><br/>I also want to note - in terms of getting this laptop to boot from USB, this was by far the most painless experience I've had. Any other laptop I've had has fought me tooth and nail when I wanted to remove Windows and install Linux. Part of that's the AMD architecture - in my experience, AMD respects their users more than Intel or Nvidia does, so if that's important to you, this is a great machine. If you've ever heard of Intel's Management Engine, AMD's equivalent - the PSP - can be just be switched off in the BIOS. Not once has this machine tried to tell me - its owner and end user - what I can and cannot do with it.<br/><br/>But back to gaming - I didn't try to run anything on Windows, but I can tell you just from the hardware specs you're going to have a great experience with anything released from 2018-2020, and the GTX 1650 would be a respectable graphics card even in a desktop at this point thanks to the current market. You most likely won't be running a game released in 2022 on Ultra on this laptop, but you should be able to get admirable performance on medium-to-high settings running something that just released.<br/><br/>On Linux running Proton - The Witcher 3 runs flawlessly for me on the highest settings using the current experimental version of Proton through Steam. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, runs flawlessly. All the indie and retro-style platformers I threw at it - Cuphead, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, Blaster Master Zero - flawless. Streets of Rage 4, Mother Russia Bleeds, Terraria, Celeste, Knights of the Old Republic 2 - those are Linux native so they ran for me as well as they do in Windows. Most of your older RPGs like Fallout: New Vegas and Morrowind will run amazingly on here regardless of what OS you're using.<br/><br/>I won't sugarcoat it and tell you that gaming on Linux is every bit as good as gaming on Windows. It's not. If you want to play the latest multiplayer games with your friends or you like to hop around and try different games when they come out without having to check if they work and without having to tinker, keep Windows on this machine.<br/><br/>For me - I have always been about 5 years behind the curve, my favorite games are in 2D, and I refuse to play games with excessive DRM (here's looking at you, Denuvo) or invasive anti-cheat (that is a security timebomb waiting to go off) so my experience switching from Windows to Linux has been relatively painless as a gamer. Valve's Proton is at a great place right now, and if you look up anything that's Steam Deck verified you should have a good time. You've got hundreds - if not thousands - of games at your disposal regardless of what kind of OS you're running.<br/><br/>To end this off - I am in love with this laptop, and I would gladly get another Lenovo machine in the future. The 8 gigs of RAM it came with is a little lean, but it's an easy upgrade, and you will definitely want to add a harddrive anyway. The IO is a little lacking at a mere two USB 3.0 ports, but - they're both USB 3, and you can attach a USB hub. (Just don't run an external HDD off it as most USB hubs don't draw additional power from the slot.)<br/><br/>The build quality is rock solid. The specs are respectable enough that it will breathe new life into your older games and allow you to play most newer titles. You can easily do photo and video editing on this. It's set up to be easy to clean, maintenance, and repair. All in all, for less than $800? This thing is a steal.</span>

<span>Quality feel, responsive and easy to upgrade. I don't play a lot of demanding titles, but this pc preforms well in games like WOW, Minecraft Dungeons, ESO and Genshin. It works nicely for office work and other media consumption as well.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Keyboard has a nice tactile response, and the typing experience is enjoyable even if a little truncated. That is to say that the 10 key (numbers pad) is a bit on the smaller side. It feels natural after a few hours of typing. It is backlit which is also nice.<br/><br/>The screen, to me, is more than bright enough and the colors are vibrant. Not as good as my desktop monitor but way better than any of my budget media/office laptops.<br/><br/>It was very easy to upgrade as well. Included the bracket, connector, and screws to mount a 2.5 inch drive.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>There is a lack of ports, which I knew when I bought it and is not a deal breaker but is worth mentioning. Two usb a (3rd gen), one usb c (data only), an hdmi, a combo audio jack and a proprietary power port. A third usb a (even if only 2.0) would have been nice, on the opposing/lefthand side as would a car reader. I also don't understand the lack of usb c charging in this day and age but that seems to be a common issue with gaming laptops (at many price points) so I would hold that against it.<br/><br/>It did not include a standoff of adding a second M.2 NVME even though there is a slot for it. Not the end of the world but odd, nonetheless.<br/><br/>Battery life is nonexistent. 2-3 hours of mixed use and less than an hour when gaming.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>I must say that I am happy so far. As I said, it was easy to upgrade and is quite responsive both in office work and at gaming. If what you are looking for is portable gaming setup, this might be for you. Or you want to do some light media editing. It also does office/schoolwork and media consumption well, as it should. Makes a great alternative to trying to buy a graphics card for your desktop at the moment too.<br/><br/>Quality seems to be there; it is your use case that will decide if this pc is for you. Want a portable gaming setup that can do office/schoolwork, some light editing and media consumption? Then this might be for you. On the other hand, if you want a work/school pc that can game on the side I might look for something with good integrated graphics that is lighter and has better battery life. That call is going to be on you.<br/><br/>As long as you understand what you are buying, I think you will be happy with this laptop. I know I am.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)<br/>Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:<br/><br/>- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).<br/><br/>- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.<br/><br/>- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.<br/><br/>- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)<br/><br/>- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.<br/><br/>- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.<br/><br/>Some of the cons:<br/>- The power adapter is a very small "pin" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.<br/>- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.<br/>- No Thunderbolt Port<br/>- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)<br/><br/>So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.<br/><br/>So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop just to have something "mobile" when I want to get online or do some "light work" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)<br/><br/>I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.<br/><br/>The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GB<br/><br/>It does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.<br/><br/>It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothly<br/><br/>It came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).<br/><br/>It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!<br/><br/>I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!</span>

<span>Ive inly been really using this laptop for like a month and a half but Its a good laptop. For rreference though My last laptop I had was used when I recieved it and "on its last legs" and started having noticible issues once it turned 11 years old...I enjoy doing video editing and that over a decade old laptop was no longer covering it so I decided to inest in this laptop. With its core I7 processer of 16gb of ram its doing really well amd seems to not struggle at all for what I do and or need. Its a good computer cabale of doing lots of work and the battery life is superb. I ran a couple of stress tests on it and it preformed well. The one downside is that because its windows 11 alot of stuff that was free and or included on windows 10 or lower is not included , most of the software thats available on this laptop is consistent of free trials or trying to get you to make a yearly purchase to use the programs such as the microsoft suite ( which will run 99$ a year or the price of like 9.99 a month). And the free trials are short lived or require you to put in credit card info...so I would suggest anyone who gets this laptop to be ready to either pay for what use to be free or start doing research on free open source software that is comparable to whatever programs you may want to use that are no longer free on the windows platform. Windows 11 isnt really bad its just different. As for the hardware I suggest doing your research before buying this laptop, and make sure you get the correct processer type for what you do, core I3 or below will not cut it in most cases try core i5 or higher and get atleast 16gb of ram aka memory to be on the safe side for anything other then really light light computer use. Also since this is a thinner laptop it has no cd rom and can in some cases overheat a little as it needs some ventalation when in use if doing heavy duty work which is to be expected for its thinness, and my very slight complaint is that while doing heavy duty work it can get to humming a bit too loudly for my taste but nothing that is too terribly concerning. I reccomend this laptop and I love it thus far.</span>

<span>This laptop is pretty good. Keypad has a weird layout, and the keyboard lacks proper Home, End, PageUp, and PageDown keys. Oddly enough, Shift+Home works if you do LShift+RShift+Home, while LShift+RShift+End does not work and is just treated as End.<br/><br/>Probably the most baffling spec about this laptop is its 4 GB of memory. I highly advise to spend an extra $15 on a SODIMM DDR4 chip (preferably 2667 MHz), because 4 GB is nothing nowadays, especially with the increased minimum requirements of Windows 11. Everything was loading pretty slow and programs like JetBrains Rider could barely function because they're constantly fighting for the physical space. Once I popped off the bottom cover and doubled the RAM, everything started going pretty fast afterward. Probably increased its impressive battery life even further.</span>

<span>For clarity, this review is for the 15.6" GTX 1650 version, not the 17.3" GTX 1650Ti version.<br/><br/>Positives!<br/><br/>This laptop is perfect for me and what I need right now. I am currently in between homes, over the road a lot for work and have all of my stuff in storage, including my main PC, so I bought a laptop so I could continue doing work and gaming while on the go.<br/>This laptop is not top of the line by any means, it's no $2,000 laptop with an RTX 3080 or anything like that, but if you want a good mid-range laptop that can get 60FPS on some everyday gaming, this is as good as mid-range laptops get in my opinion.<br/>Even on my main, much beefier PC, I've never been one to crank up the settings and enable raytracing, 4k etc. I'm more of a framerate type of person and this laptop does a great job getting high frame rates if you're willing to adjust the settings accordingly. The screen is a clean 1920x1080, lovely quality (though the brightness isn't that great), comes with an NVME 512GB hard drive which is not a bad start if you're not trying to install a Call of Duty game with 100gb patches, but that leads into another glowing positive - this thing is upgradeable and I love it! One of the hardest things about picking a laptop for me is the eventual obsolescence, so in the few times I've bought a laptop in my life, I prefer ones you can upgrade which will allow you to skirt by the expected lifespan for a bit longer.<br/>Overall, my complaints a few, but I will point them out.<br/><br/>Negatives!<br/>Honestly, 8GB of RAM is... well, it's not enough for any modern PC that you want to do more than browse the internet, but this negative hardly counts against it because once again, it is upgradeable! I added 32GB to mine and it runs like a dream now. The fact it ships with such low RAM is forgivable because that's probably why the price of entry is as low as it is.<br/>I also had a few problems with the Wi-Fi antenna at first, which I know is not unique to my laptop, but after a few online searches, troubleshooting and settings adjustments, it hasn't dropped the connection for a couple of days, so I think I'm over that hump.<br/>My last complaint and honestly maybe the only one that could be considered "major" is the screen brightness. To be clear, I'm talking about BRIGHTNESS, not QUALITY. The resolution is wonderful and the screen is a clear HD experience, but keep this thing away from the sunlight if you want to see it easily... I took it to the park one day and while I could see the screen, I felt like I was squinting, and I had to change my preferred dark mode to light mode just to see the Windows UI better. Once again, I consider this a minor gripe and won't take a star off, because if you're using this thing indoors or in appropriate shade, the screen is beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for an affordable, upgradeable, laptop suited for everyday gaming (as long as you're not trying to push max settings, 4k or raytracing), you won't be disappointed!</span>

<span>--Note, after 3 weeks of owning i decided to return this. I stand by my review, i feel the laptop is good for casual gaming, but i ended up wanting to PC game full time, and this wasn't going to cut the mustard. I ended up buying a HP Omen desktop for a just a few hundred dollars more, and the difference is night and day, i can play games at max settings and get 240 frames.<br/><br/>This is my first gaming PC, and overall its good.<br/>For the price, i think its a great snag, BUT if you plan on using this PC as your main gaming station, or plan on playing every game out there, id buy something else.<br/><br/>This PC has run every game ive thrown at it, but it runs noticeably worse when running newer games, or higher demanding games.<br/>You wont be getting 144 frames on majority of games without dropping every graphics setting to low, and even after that you most likely will not get 144 frames.<br/>Max i was able to get for Insurgency Sandstorm was 80ish, Ready or not 80ish,  Death Stranding 60, Madden 23 60, Apex Legends 120s, GTA 4 60s. I had to run these games on low settings to get these frames, and it wasn't steady. I was dropping down to the 20-30 ALOT when playing Insurgency and Ready or Not. Even GTA4 was pretty janky while driving and shooting.<br/>I got max Frames in Valorant, Counter Strike GO, and all older games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, Left4Dead 2 i was able to play on ultra graphics.<br/><br/>Graphics card is meh. I can easily notice the graphics dropoff when playing Apex and Madden on here, then hopping on Series X and playing them, its a steep drop off. The issue is you cant play a majority of games on medium or high settings, which also hurts the graphics big time.<br/><br/>The screen is excellent. Its anti glare, and very clear. I ended up buying a second monitor to game on, just because 15inches is too small after years of gaming on a 50inch TV, BUT i could have gotten away with gaming on this screen.<br/><br/>Battery is pretty bad, but i usually always have it plugged in. Just web browsing at 50% brightness youre getting 2 hours battery life.<br/><br/>I see some reviews claiming that the Wifi adapter is bad, i havent experienced this. I game upstairs on wifi, my router is downstairs, and i usually get 25 ping in online games, which is pretty great. I also got 150ish download on steam. Ive never gotten buffering when watching a video, or live stream(I watched the Bills vs Rams game last night on this without any buffering).<br/><br/>I highly recommend upgrading the ram if you do end up buying, the max this PC can use is 24 RAM, so i installed the Crucial RAM 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22, very easy install.<br/><br/>Speeds for the PC are very fast. From web browsing, to gaming, to tab switching, everything is very fast, even faster than my Macbook 2020.<br/><br/>Overall its a solid gaming laptop, just go in knowing the limitations going in. Id recommend for casual /light gamers.</span>

<span>I'm not a fan of Windows at all, however I decided to leave it as dual boot with Linux. As is usually the case with laptops, battery life is much better in Windows than it is in Linux. That is an inherent issue with Linux and not a detriment to the laptop itself.<br/><br/>Running Arch Linux, all of the hardware was found automatically. The only issue is not being able to cycle through the different modes of keyboard lighting. It's fine because I usually leave that turned off anyway. I could probably find a way to get it to work, but I don't really care to.<br/><br/>The fans are quiet, the keyboard feels positive and comfortable, the display is very good. I have no complaints.</span>

<span>I got this product on sale for $599, and it is more than worth the price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Battery life is fairly decent. The only time the battery would burn itself was when I was using additional monitors and graphic intense activities at the same time. Even when the battery may be low, the charge speed is very powerful, and you should have full charge in an hour even if your using the laptop.<br/>-Processor is a beast. i5 10300H has the firepower to run some games that normally require high specs. Dark Souls III runs very smoothly on normal settings, haven't been able to test Elden Ring yet. (This may require more ram.) I'm also able to hook up a monitor, among other peripherals, as well as have other things open, like Discord, without a problem.<br/>-Screen. With 144hz (or 144 visible frames per sec.), you don't need additional monitors to see just how good your games are running.<br/>-RGB Keyboard. Can change how the lights appears, as well as their intensity, or turn them off if you don't need them.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-RAM. With only 8gbs of RAM, you may yourself upgrading to something more using the extra empty RAM slot. Luckily, this laptop is designed to be easily upgraded with a poppable bottom. All you need are screwdrivers that fit and a RAM cartridge of your choice.<br/>-Storage. Again, with only 512gb of space, you may find yourself upgrading using the empty extra M.2 SSD spot. One thing to keep in mind is that this laptop will only support up to Gen 3, so make sure to save some money and not but a Gen 4 SSD, as you will not get the full power out of it.<br/>-Graphics Card. The GTX 1650 isn't exactly the best graphics card out there, but it gets by for meeting recommended settings on older games, while meeting minimum requirements for newer more graphic intense games.</span>

<span>My son sent me the page for this, knowing what my desired specs and budget were.  Then I read the reviews and was almost scared away.  He talked me into at least trying it and I am so so glad I did!!<br/><br/>I love everything about it.  I am not a gamer, the games I play generally do not require high specs.  However, I do photo and video editing, and a lot of multi-tasking.  This laptop works well for everything I do.<br/><br/>I have not experienced any problems with the display, you do have to make sure the cord clicks into the back, and the keyboard has a nice feel to it (I type a lot).  My only cons are the battery life (3-4 hours), and I do wish I could adjust the light on keyboard.  I don't mind the red, but do find it annoying that it doesn't light up until the first keystroke.  I often use the computer in a dim or dark room, so finding that first key is annoying,  There should be a light up key.Like hitting space to light up and it doeant make a space if used before typing anything else.  That is a minor thing tho.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I am very pleased with this laptop and hope it lasts me as many years as my previous one did.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>Keep expectations realistic do your research for what kind of games your gonna play how this hardware stacks up to running sed games and your gonna have a good time and be happy with your buy. The only ball drop by Microsoft or Acer was i had to download some additional C++ code to get some games running how they should. I play fighting games and this laptop suits my needs and runs the games without issue should also be enough to handle street fighter 6 with no issues playing more demanding games performance may decline. You also need to understand you absolutely will not be gaming without being plugged into the charger you will just gimp the component's if you don't play plugged into a outlet and have a bad time. Make sure you set up the PC to optimize performance and take full advantage of its dedicated nividia card and intel processor the ram can be upgraded but i would only put 16gigs in max the 8 gig stick is okay. The native 144hz screen is impressive for the price this laptop costs all in all if you know what your doing and know how games will run on the hardware that you want to play you will be happy with the buy. Understand this all depends on the type of games you want the hardware to play and what those games will be asking the system to preform i cant stress that fact enough please do your research before you buy that means you parents of children google and youtube are your friend when it comes to this.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I bought this Asus laptop because I bought a piece of design equipment that is run solely by software that requires Windows operating system. Since it will be dedicated to just this operation, I wanted an inexpensive but powerful laptop with a large clear screen. The 15.6" screen is sharp, clear and visible from a distance and different angles without much distortion that you often find when viewing laptop screens from an angle. This Asus running Windows 10 Home (I converted it from Windows 10 S mode) runs my design program perfectly without any lag in speed or function. It's lightweight, sleek, the keyboard is easy to type on and colors render quite nicely on the screen. While it may not be up to gaming (not a gamer here) it's a perfect laptop for a student who needs basic computing needs and like me, someone who needs to run a windows-exclusive design program.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: By submitting this I may qualify for an additional 90 day warranty. Why wouldn't I? I was about to submit my positive review anyway when I got he email offering the additional warranty. I do like this laptop very much ... and that's coming from a dedicated Macintosh user! I definitely recommend this Asus L510 laptop. You can't go wrong.</span>
