<span>This projector is easy to use, we did have to purchase a little hdmi cord to connect our cell phone. The projector has Bluetooth so allows to connect to speakers, but not our phone. We use it outdoor, either against our garage door or by using a white sheet on our deck!! Awesome system, great quality!!!</span>

<span>I really like this projector. The DVD player works great. I did hook up a set of external speakers as the sound isn't very loud if you have a large viewing area. We did it in our big backyard. The image was on a king-size sheet and took up the entire area. The image was good. You have to play around with the settings to get it the right brightness, color tint, etc. It comes with a little stand which works well. I have used it 3 times and it has been great so far. I definitely recommend this projector.</span>

<span>My wife and I spent almost an hour trying to get this machine to work, and she is very good at setting up electronic equipment.  We were trying to get it to project single photographs off an iPad.  I was using an HDMI cord.  I could not get the projector to respond, no matter how many buttons I pushed, or how many connections I tried, or how many other ideas I tried.  After plugging and unplugging it several times we finally got it to project the photographs.  What a pain!<br/><br/>One suggestion: when you think the set up is correct for the cords, follow the instructions for pushing the buttons, which is weird, and then push the button for each step, and WAIT.  Wait for a few seconds because the projector does not respond quickly or well.  Make sure you push the whatever out of the button when you push it down.  A quick or light tap will not trigger the machine to react.  Once the menu is projected and you are clicking the small arrows up down and sideways, wait until the unit responds on the screen.  Try to make sure you hit the button firmly.  Another pain is, if you wait too long to hit the buttons after the menu is on the screen the menu goes away.  It actually goes away fairly fast.  If that happens you have to start from the beginning.<br/><br/>Once your picture is on the screen, wall, or whatever, there will be a series of buttons along the bottom of the screen.  So, make sure the projector is adjusted so you can see the bottom of the projected picture with the buttons.  I found that trying to move along the bottom buttons was a chore because the machine did not respond to many of my clicks.<br/><br/>IF you are projecting from a micro SD card you will see a button along the bottom that allows you to reduce the size of the picture.  I was able to reduce the size below what I could achieve on the iPad.  You would have to transfer your photos to a micro SD card before projecting them, but that may  be a necessity if you need smaller pictures like I do.<br/><br/>The projected photo is good enough quality for my purposes.  You can see the picture without all the lights off and curtains closed.  I can see the picture in the daylight without any lights on as long as my blinds are closed.  Compared to other photo projectors I have used, which contain a huge lightbulb and a prism to throw the printed photo, this one is quite strong.<br/><br/>Getting the picture small enough to fit on an 11 x 14 area is impossible.  The smallest picture I could get was about 18 x 24.  As a result, projecting an entire photograph from an iPad, and getting as close to the wall or canvas as possible, even the smallest picture will be blown up to a large size.  It would be OK if you were trying to crop a photo or pick out a small area of a photo, but that is about it.<br/><br/>While the artograph prism projector does get a much smaller photo projection, it is also much weaker.  The artograph prism has a big bulb that gets the projector extremely hot.  You can actually burn yourself on it.  The artograph is also far larger unit, and a person must work from a printed photo because it is not digital.<br/><br/>This Bigasuo projector is small, stays cool, and the picture is bright.  A lot brighter than the artograph prism.  The sound isn't loud to me, but the projector noise was irrelevant to my use.  I have heard others that were much louder.<br/><br/>Other problems with this projector include, but are not limited to, the buttons are the same color as the projector, and the symbols telling a person what the button does are very small, mysterious, and not raised above the button much.  The small, same color as the machine, buttons make it hard to adjust the projector.  The amount of focus is slim.  If the lens was able to focus closer the user could make the picture smaller, which would be useful for people like me who want a small bright image.  The HDMI cord is a problem, plus the manufacture gave us two HDMI connections.  And they are not labeled number 1 and number 2.  Why?  Why not another USB port or a full size SD slot?  The micro SD slot is a pain.  The micro SDs are so small I cannot handle them well.  I keep dropping the things.  Why not use a full size SD slot and allow the user to put the micro SD into an adapter to use the micro SD?<br/><br/>I have not tried to use the streaming or video/movie functions.  I have not tried to use the CD functions.  I cannot say how long the projector will last.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the projector is worth the price and should work well for family use.<br/><br/>AD2</span>

<span>Update: The company reached out to me thinking it may have been defective.  I was sent another.<br/><br/>This unit did not have any focus issues and I was able to hook up my phone with this unit. But I did find using the cable worked well because I got one that charges as well as connects. This allows my phone to stay charged for long movie sessions.<br/><br/>This unit was brighter but I wish it was brighter still maybe in the next model. I still appreciate the fact the dvd is built in.<br/><br/>I would still suggest an external Bluetooth speaker if using in loud area. Fan sound did not distract me.<br/><br/>The original reasons I sent it back were above but also after I bought it one day later it went down 45 dollars in price. I will update after I attempt to run apps. I do like the fact they reached out to me to fix the issues.</span>

<span>I bought these speakers to install in my home crawlspace....yes, you read that right, but I spend a lot of time working in there and need some tunes, which can also be heard when working inside the house if I want. These Dual speakers replaced a pair of KLH speakers that went bad and although I was hesitant to buy them based on reading some reviews, I'm very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>I used the old KLH mounting brackets because they extended the speakers farther out to allow more angle adjustment which I needed to keep the speakers up close to the floor joists so I don't bump into them when crawling around in the tight space. I can't say how weather proof these things are since they're under my house but overall this was a great purchase and I'm happy to have my tunes back in the crawlspace again. I deducted one star because of the short mounting brackets.</span>

<span>I decided to move this system to my renewed bathroom and bought a desktop setup with a subwoofer. I don't see how they can say this has powerful bass when it's mostly coming from the mid-range. UPDATE I decided to keep this setup in my pc room as they do have great high end. The 2.1 subwoofer system I bought doesn't have good high end so I piped the sound from the DUAL amp strait to my subwoofer system and now have what I think is great sound. The sub system I bought was the logitech system. The main problem with that system is that it doesn't have good high end. The satellite speaks have places for a bass port at the top which I think the idiot designers would have put a tweeter but whatever.</span>

<span>If you need both the this is the way to buy 'em.... and ONLY if they are on sale,  and here's why...<br/><br/>The sound is, well,  "eh" .... not the worst but not the best either. I'm also not a snobby audiophile! At max volume things become somebody distorted at times, which can be mostly fixed with the app under the "equalizer" settings.<br/><br/>My main COMPLAINT about all 3 of these that I own, use regularly and bought at different times and different years is that they don't hear you when you speak to them BUT at other times they wake word reply when you say something other than the wake word! Flipping annoying!  My wake word is set to "Echo" instead of "Alexa" and sometime I have to say it 3 times,  almost yelling in annoyance at it the last time and then it finally answers me. This is all standing maybe 10 feet from it..... now other times I'll say "echo" at a low or normal volume voice in my bedroom and both the bed room and the kitchen echo dots will respond..... and it's quite a distance.  So my kitchen can hear me from the bedroom when I speak at bedtime voice volume but I have to nearly yell at when I'm right near the dang thing.  They are annoying in that way. However they are nice to have due to the convenience of having a voice assistant do my bidding..... so they are a necessary evil at this point.  They are good,  just have quirks that you have to deal with because AMAZON couldn't care less about making their existing equipment better because it's already bought and paid for by us and they have our cash. Bluetooth linking devices together can be tricky and can get complicated if you don't remember what you did and why and live by that standard.<br/><br/>I really wish amazon would find a way to link eventing together on one common thread so the devices are actually "made for humans" and us humans didn't have to train ourselves to the devices wants and needs.<br/><br/>In closing, if you need a plug and a dot then this is the way to go...... DURING A PROMO OR SALE! There's no way in H E Double Hockey Sticks I would ever pay full price for any of this tech. It's simply not worth it and it doesn't demand a premium price point in the marketplace. I buy mine during holidays,  events like prime day or lightning deals. They go on sale so often that you can wait. There's no one in the world that needs this type of thing immediately.... you may want it that way but you don't need it. Just wait,  save yourself some cash,  like I said,  so when the thing aggravates you..... you can shrug it off more easily knowing you didn't pay premium money for it.<br/><br/>This gen, with the fabric wrap is nice looking compared to previous models and the volume at max is more than sufficient for some light partying while pushinga swiffer and dust cloth around the house or working on a project in the garage. The best volume I've got is out of a show 8 but I don't own the "studio" or any of the insane high price Alexa tech.<br/><br/>I like these for what they are,  FOR WHAT I PAID FOR THEM, and how they make my life nicer when I'm at home. Buy them...... but buy them on sale!</span>

<span>Since I purchased my echo dot, I found it very responsive, easy to operate, and more reliable than my homepod minis. I have four hompods and four echo dots. If for some reason, my wifi glitches, my homepods reconnect to my home wifi easly. My homepods, however, is another story. They are inconsistent with reconnecting to wifi, and home kit integration needs improvement. So I use my echo dots everywhere in my house. For audiobooks, music, and even telling me the weather and time. The best part is value. I paid $99 for a homepod while the echo dots never coated over $39. Apple better figure it out or I'm ditching their expensive echo system.</span>

<span>These are great little speakers.  Unbelievably strong sound and quality.  It hits the high notes very clearly and crisply.  The low notes are good for an external speaker without a separate sub.  I have a large backyard and with volume at full on speakers and on my phone I can hear the music all the way to the end of my backyard.  Looking forward to hosting many backyard parties and just relaxing with my family with music.  Can’t comment on how weatherproof these are since I just got them and it’s only been sunny and hot.<br/><br/>I rated them 4 stars and not 5 for few reasons: 1) power cord is too short; 2) speaker wire is provided was too short as well and 3) unable to pair this set with another set.  I got around the cord issue by buying an outdoor extension cord so that added to the cost.  Also had to buy additional speaker wire to mount the speakers 20 feet apart - that added to the cost.  If I had used the speaker wire provided I’m sure there would’ve been distortion of sound…these speakers are too powerful to be placed so close.<br/><br/>In closing if you’re in the market for outdoor speakers…these are fantastic choice.</span>

<span>I may return but I will do full review if I don’t. I am replacing wireless speakers under eave on back deck (approx 10’ high and 15’ apart). The power cord and speaker wire (w RCA to two connection) are too damn short. Ridiculous miss by Pyle save a few bucks. My previous speakers had over 20’ for each and easily allowed for wires to be tucked behind siding edges, etc. More to come or a return pending.<br/><br/>UPDATE - I spent about $30 extra for wire and cords. The complaints about the Bluetooth connection prompts are real. It is screeching loud at max volume. The sound is just as loud as my previous system but much clearer and less distortion. I am pleased so far. I’d say it total spent was worth it. More to come</span>

<span>Hung these outside my garage under the eve.  They say 800 watts, I can only assume that's rms.  Even still, they don't get that loud.  Plenty for my patio, but not like I can hear it well through the yard. The only design issue I have is the power chord and switch. I planned on cutting it anyway, as I hard wired them into the garage and installed a switch to power them on and off.  That way I don't have to reach up and try to pull the back cover off every time.  The cord was quite short, maybe 6 ft.  I don't know if people are installing random receptacles in there eves in modern construction, but I forsee a lot of people having to run extention cords to power these.  I had enough to get the line into the garage, then installed a junction box in the ceiling that ran to the switch.<br/><br/>Speaking of the switch. Have you ever been watching a video on your phone late at night only to discover your phone auto connected to the bt and the audio is being blasted in the backyard...?  Maybe it's good these aren't that loud after all.  Don't need my neighbors knowing that I watch "Murder She Wrote" at 2 am. If you get these and hang them as intended, the power switch is in an inconvient place.  Wire a different switch so you don't forget to turn them off.</span>

<span>I was looking for some quality Bluetooth speakers for my new Gazebo. I found plenty of options at a lower price with smaller woofers. But their reviews were mixed. One problem I found with nearly all these BT speakers is they over state their Wattage. They play games with Peak Power not RMS which is a more realistic measure of power. So I decided to spend a little more on a well know brand that has been in business for decades, Pyle, though they also state the power as 800 Watts which should shack the house down.<br/><br/>I received them and was surprised as how big, heavy and well constructed they are. They were very easy to mount. I turned them on, paired them with my Cellphone to play music and was pleasantly surprised on how loud they can get with excellent sound quality. Very good highs and decent base even for a 6.5 inch woofer. I did get one big surprise. My phone battery was getting low so I took my phone into the house to charge. The BT remained connect from inside my house through an exterior wall that it stucco (cement) all the way to the Gazebo about 30 feet away. So if I want, I can leave my phone on its charger and broadcast music all the way to a Gazebo.<br/><br/>Only 2 issues I had was 1) The passive Speaker wire they included was too short and too small a gauge wire, so I replaced it with a better RCA connector and 16 gauge wire. 2) The Bluetooth pairing acknowledgment signal is very loud and annoying. I use my Cell phone to broadcast my music to the speakers so I have to repair them each time I go to the Gazebo. The volume control on the speaker is hard to reach once installed so I leave it at maximum and control the volume from my cellphone. So when they pair, which is automatic when they are near each other, it pairing acknowledgment signal is very loud. Neither of these issues were worth lowering my rating from 5 stars because the positives really far outweigh these two issues.<br/><br/>One side note: When mounting theses speakers in a semi-enclosed structure like a Gazebo the sound is well contained in Gazebo. So I can really turn up the volume without irritating the neighbors.</span>

<span>I purchased these to replace a small set of front speakers in a surround sound setup. I had a small 8" subwoofer that completely overwhelmed the output of the front speakers. I searched several sets of speakers before settling on the Dual units purchased. I am sure these are sold under several different names but Amazon offered the best price and fast shipping. I am not disappointed in the performance of these speakers. Their output is such that the subwoofer is as it should be, a complimentary component to the system and not the dominate speaker. The Duals are clear and handle the Emotiva power amp output without any problems. I intend to buy to more sets of these speakers for my garage and back porch.</span>

<span> The RCA - RPJ060 Portable Projector is a great Portable Projector is great for having outdoor movie nights and the picture (for a 480p projector) and sound are good for the price.<br/><br/>Picture: I should mention that NO this is NOT a 1080p projector the projector is native 480p that takes the 1080p signal from whichever device you connect to it and downscales it down to 480p the picture was good enough for me but for those who want a higher resolution for a portable projector will want to spend a bit more for a higher end projector.<br/><br/>Sound: The sound is fantastic on the RCA Projector the speaker on it is fairly large and is of good sound quality.<br/><br/>Battery: The battery life on this projector is around 2hrs so you will definitely want to keep your charger around while using it especially if you are watching multiple movies or a longer movie.<br/><br/>Would I Recommend This Projector?: Yes and no for those looking for a cheap projector to breakout every now and then and for outdoor movie nights and don't really care about picture quality then yes I would 100% recommend this projector. For those looking for better picture quality might want to look for a better alternative.</span>

<span>I've been looking for a projector that I can use to hold a neighborhood movie night, and the RCA-RPJ060 might finally be it. It packs a lot of features in for its modest price tag, and outperforms several similarly priced units in almost every way.<br/><br/>OK, that "almost" is probably gonna bug you until I explain it, so let's get that out of the way right off the bat. The biggest complaint that I have with this unit is that it's clunky and difficult to transport, with almost no concessions in design to make it convenient for you to get it and the necessary accessories to where you want them. It's boxy and bulky, although surprisingly lightweight for the size. That weight made me hope that there was some sort of internal storage for the remote and cables, but no dice. There are a couple of pockets on the side that sort of not-quite act like handles (they're not rounded to help you grip them at all). Since the cables came packaged in those, I had hoped they would conveniently store there also, but no. So you'll probably want some sort of case to keep everything together.<br/><br/>OK, that's a lot of words taken up on what is honestly my singular gripe with this projector. Literally every other aspect of it either matches or exceeds every other projector I've reviewed.<br/><br/>*Brightness: The RCA-RPJ060 isn't a projector you can use in full daylight. There, I said it. But for the price point, you're just not going to get that. What it does have is some of the best brightness I've found in an ultra-budget projector. I played it in my office at noon with the blinds open against a highly reflective white wall, and was able to see the images. That already puts it head and shoulders over most units I've tried. Once the sun had gone down a bit and I actually bothered to put my screen up, I was able to dial in the brightness even better..<br/><br/>*Image Clarity: In twilight conditions against a proper screen, the image is 1080p, which is typical for ultra-budget projectors.<br/><br/>*Adjustments: It has a keystone! Don't laugh, that's a luxury at this price point. I'd say better than 50% of the units I've reviewed don't have it. Aside from that, there's a pretty typical suite of options available to adjust brightness, color, sharpness and clarity.<br/><br/>*Inputs: It has the usual list of HDMI/VGA/Composite inputs, with the added luxury of a second HDMI input. It also has Bluetooth, but for copyright reasons it will only play music or other audio.<br/><br/>*Sound: Speaking of audio...the sound on this thing is superb (again, for the price). The 20W speaker kicks out surprisingly deep bass without neglecting the lower pitches. I played music and movies on this unit, and while it won't compete with actual separate speakers, it's definitely loud and clear enough to play a movie on outdoors for a bunch of kids.<br/><br/>That brings me to the other luxury this unit has that doesn't really fit anywhere else: The battery. Movie nights typically involve asking a neighbor if I can run an extension cord from their house to the park nearby. With the 2 1/2 hour battery life for this unit, you can skip that step unless you're planning to show the Lord of the Rings movies. That's the element that puts this over the top from a still-positive 4 stars to a full 5.<br/><br/>So in the end, while I wouldn't recommend this to be your only audio/visual device, it's definitely something worth keeping around for special occasions. You get a lot for the price, and it's (almost) all enjoyable.</span>

<span>Set-up:<br/><br/>Extremely simple. We had this projector up and running within 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Noise:<br/><br/>For a budget projector, this one is fairly quiet.<br/><br/>Picture quality:<br/><br/>Is this projector going to provide true 1080p/4k quality picture? No, absolutely not, not should it considering the price point.<br/><br/>However, we you can expect is a clear, crisp picture that projects evenly.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is very good picture quality considering this is an indoor outdoor projector.<br/><br/>Bottom line:<br/><br/>For a bare bones, budget friendly projector, this has a very nice picture!<br/><br/>5 stars</span>

<span>At first I was going to dock a star from this product until I saw how ridiculously low cost it is for the features it offers. At this price point, it is a steal, especially currently where it is half priced. There are other brands that run in their msrp price range and do not boast half of the benefits this projector does.<br/><br/>1st the most disappointing aspect is connectivity via bluetooth. You figure you may be able to play movies or stream directly from your iPhone. Not the case, I am sure it is due to streaming rights, but no Netflix, Youtube, Disney+ or Hulu would connect via youtube. The only thing that connects via bluetooth is music.<br/><br/>HDMI and USB work fine, I haven't tested the VGA port yet, although I can't imagine that older tech doesn't work well.<br/><br/>Here are the best parts, it truly is portable and has a built in rechargeable battery. The other projectors I own/owned needed an extension cable or portable power station. This rechargeable feature alone, along with the quality and features make this an excellent purchase. The sound and picture are great, remote works out of the box and it is easy to transport and set up where ever you need it.</span>

<span>I have been purchasing items from Amazon for years but never purchased a used item. The purchase price was much lower than new and listed as used-very good condition,  repackaged, that was an understatement.  The item arrived in an unmarked box, upon opening the item was sealed in the original product box seemingly never opened. The original box had minimal damage possibly from a previous shipment.  When unpacking the individual pieces each in it's own undamaged box was factory sealed and in brand new condition. Once assembled the system worked perfectly. This 8" system has great sound and is pretty loud. For my purposes (outdoor movie and get togethers) it would be perfect at half volume.  As others have stated the microphone is weak and if you are planning on routinely using it, I would suggest a amplified/powered mic. Additionally the 8" bass is adequate for the size, especially when using one of the nine preset eq setting, but if you want thundering bass you may think about one of the larger systems. Overall for my needs, I am very pleased with this system.</span>

<span>Great projector.  Stay away from the cheaper models.  I’ve tried a few and none lived up to watch the preached.  This is great we use it for outdoor movies.  Picture is clear and onboard audio is ok.  Purchasing a speaker to help boost that.  I use my iPhone which plugs in to the projector and plays what ever I want.  I haven't played around with other settings but this does not do Bluetooth or wireless streaming which I thought was ok as all the other's claimed they did but didn’t.  Would suggest for anyone looking for a side projector to do small moves gear and there.</span>

<span>Nice projector with a very clear picture.  Can be "zoomed" over a reasonable range so the image fits the screen without having to have the projector at exactly the right distance.</span>
