The ASUS Laptop L210MA is designed to help you be productive all day — even when you’re on the move. This compact and lightweight 11.6 inch laptop is powered by the latest Intel processor and provides long lasting battery life. With eMMC storage and pre-loaded Windows 10 in S mode, it offers full compatibility with a wide range of software and peripherals.

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop to use as a spare machine in my consulting practice, and also for use with my ham radio hobby. When I saw the specs on this laptop, followed by the price, I couldn't help but order one. My key requirements were size, weight, and a decent screen. This little machine fits all of those requirements in spades.<br/><br/>I have been more than impressed with the L210's performance and features. While it's definitely not a gaming machine, it's more than adequate for anyone that needs to do web browsing, office apps, and other non CPU- or memory-intensive tasks.<br/><br/>I'll start with the cons:<br/>- 4GB RAM (non-expandable/soldered in, despite Asus page stating otherwise)<br/>- 64GB SSD (easily expandable; I added a 500GB SSD for about $50)<br/>- Just adequate screen resolution (1366x768) - fine for most tasks<br/>- Non-back lit keyboard (even though the product listing says that it is backlit)<br/>- Relatively slow, but adequate Intel Celeron CPU<br/>- Limited USB-C support; cannot charge the laptop via USB-C and it will not support an external USB-C monitor adapter.<br/>- Weird 10-key pad on the touch pad. Enabled via a small button on the touch pad; it's too easy to accidentally turn it on, wreaking havoc when you use the touchpad. No way to permanently disable via BIOS.<br/>- No touch screen, but not surprising given the price point<br/><br/>All of the above were clearly spelled out in the product description, so none of them were a surprise. And several of them were definitely design decisions, in order to keep the cost down and the battery life high.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Amazing battery life. I've been seeing 8-11 hours per charge in normal use<br/>- Super lightweight and small form factor; 2.3 pounds/1.05kg and very thin<br/>- Nice port options. Built-in HDMI, USB-C plus 2 "classic" USB ports<br/>- Expandable hard drive via "M2" SSD stick. Took me about 5 minutes and $50 to expand storage by 500GB<br/>- Very nice keyboard, rivaling much more expensive laptops<br/>- Comes with Windows 10 "S mode", easily upgraded to Windows 10 Home for no charge<br/>- Really great price. I had fully expected to have to buy an unknown branded laptop at this price point. Asus is a great brand with a history of providing good support and high-quality products.<br/><br/>In summary, I'm very pleased with this purchase. It fits the bill for my needs perfectly and has fantastic battery life. It weighs less than my iPad Pro with folio keyboard and runs full Windows 10, including all of the apps that I need it to run.<br/><br/>Of the cons listed above, only the 4GB RAM limitation and the lack of a backlit keyboard are major annoyances. That said, this machine supplies all of the functionality that I need as a backup / travel / ham radio laptop. Since I have other machines for video editing / gaming / etc, I don't need this machine for those tasks.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a nice little laptop for basic office tasks, this is a great choice!<br/><br/>(I forgot to mention that Asus is giving me a 90-day warranty extension in exchange for writing this review.)</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I purchased this on PRIME day and got a really great deal. :)<br/><br/>I've only ever used Apple products.... and the last laptop I purchased in 2010 was a Macbook Air. Needlesstoday, it's now super outdated and, given that my email, photos and browsing is always on Google, it made sense to move to a Chromebook. Sorry Apple. But I'm still loyal to your iPhone.<br/><br/>WHAT I LIKE about my NEW CHROMEBOOK!<br/>&gt;&gt; I like the keyboard! Unlike a mac where I felt like I could barely feel the keys, I can 'feel 'the keys on this pc and typing seems easier.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Ease of use: Charge and GO!  Upon receipt, just charge your Chromebook right away. Then, open 'er up, put in your google credentials and you're on your way.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Screen: well lit, colors are great.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sound: EXCELLENT.  Clear, sharp, great stereo sound. (ha, stereo! I needed to call that out? I'm a 70s girl so, yeah.)<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Consider getting yourself a wireless mouse with a beanbag wrist rest, and, pick up a microSD card to give your little machine more storage. I'm not big on touch pads so, call me old school but I like using a mouse :)<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; FUN FACTOR: It's just a fun machine.  I like it! And I haven't even tried the stylus or other cool features yet!<br/><br/>WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:<br/>&gt;&gt; so far - there's nothing that I don't like about this Chromebook. Happy customer right here! And this was after (seriously people) agonizing over 3+ hours over WHICH brand to buy.  I'm glad I went with Samsung!<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Oh, there is this one thing. AMAZON: why would you package this sleek, cool Samsung Chromebook in a GIGANTIC, over-sized box that looked like it could have held about 8 Chromebooks?  The machine (which was packed in its own box) was 100% jostling around in transit. There's no doubt. There was the thought of a small, crumpled amount of brown paper packing material that was in there for... show? Because you would have needed about 25 pieces of crumpled brown packing material to have secured the Chromebook.</span>

<span>After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp &amp; vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only "complaint" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).<br/>I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.  Hands down this is the best purchase I have made this year, I only wish I found it sooner!</span>

<span>I've been in the market for a cheap laptop for work for a while.  I have a hefty gaming PC at home but I wanted something completely separate and portable for non-gaming needs like using the internet and word processing.  Additionally I've been trying to read more and sometimes this leads to me using the Kindle app on my phone.  I was drawn to the Chromebook Plus (V2) because of the attempts to make it more like a tablet and utilize Android apps.<br/><br/>Overall the product works exactly as described.  The screen is good, though the default settings make the things like the app shelf, window borders, and pointer size a little too large in comparison to the parts of the screen in use.  This is variable once you poke around the settings, though, and I have no complaints.  The keyboard is fantastic and responsive.  The touchscreen is pretty good, though it's not quite on par with the perfection that is an iPad touch screen.  Sometimes I miss when I try to click on things with my finger or perhaps it doesn't register at all.  That happens so infrequently that it's still entirely usable.  The pen is also nice, though I've only used it so far to doodle in the Google Keep notes app as it was not a main selling point for me.  The battery life is about on par with what is advertised; I used it lightly from 7:30-2:30 yesterday, for example, and it only got to about 50%.  The foldability for tent and tablet mode is a little bit awkward considering the size and the fact that the keyboard is always attached, but it works.  It just makes me prefer it as a laptop more than a tablet most of the time.<br/><br/>The performance is acceptable considering the hardware.  With my other machine having a much more powerful processor and more RAM, I actually do notice a bit of delay in navigation online and when using multiple apps.  With that said, it's not bad at all, and the comparison is actually rather unfair.<br/><br/>My main complaint is really only the quality of the touchpad for using the cursor.  It works well, but it's a little bit choppy and doesn't respond to light and subtle movements when trying to be precise.  Again, this might be unfair because the only recent laptops I've used have been MacBooks and those touchpads are incredibly smooth, but it's still worth pointing out.<br/><br/>Overall I'm highly satisfied with my purchase.  The problems I've described really aren't even problems but rather little quirks that I've already gotten used to.  It works for everything you'd want a Chromebook to work for and it does it well.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 to use as a bedside entertainment center, so I wanted something that could stream and have quality screen resolution.  I liked the idea of a device that I could position with the screen set back (open like a laptop) or set forward (flip it and go triangular, baby!); I also needed a reliable blue tooth as I wear comfy headphones that I can sleep in.  I have an extensive music collection that I keep on an external SSD and I absolutely love MediaMonkey because of it's customizable interface on it's Window's app (I assumed the ChromeOS version would be very similar - my first major stumble).<br/><br/>First, the positive:  The device itself is fantastic.  Everything about it feels sturdy, the touchscreen is responsive (though, I will say there are times when I feel I have to hit an app 2 or 3 times to activate).  The screen resolution and sound quality are lovely for a device of this size and price - don't go expecting studio quality here, but the streaming was beautiful.  The visuals are not pixelated; it's as good as watching on a television (only smaller).  Oh, and I will say I love the fact that the USB-C port is on both sides, which makes it easier to plug in on any side (it's the little things).<br/><br/>Performance is great, I get no lag and I've had no issues streaming Netflix, Hulu or Disney+.  I just realized I haven't tried watching Twitch or Youtube on this.  I'll download those apps and if I have any problems with them, I'll update this review and let you know.<br/><br/>I have one grouse, and it's kind of a biggie:  The apps are terrible.  It was so dismaying at first, I did actually contemplate sending the device back.  I slept on it and decided I was going to stick it out.  In truth, part of my disappointment is that the ChromeOS version of MediaMonkey is disappointing.  When it came down to it, I tried a whole slew of music apps and I wound up settling on the music app that annoyed me the least (VLC).  Most of the apps have ads that are intrusive, and even the ones I thought about paying for just don't seem worth the value.<br/><br/>Even simple apps like an alarm clock or a blue tooth manager:  I downloaded several different ones, and I'm continually settling on the app that annoys me the least or seems to be able to handle some of what I would like.  I even tried to find a power button app because I just wanted to turn off the computer with a single, on screen button push - despite over a dozen apps that claimed to do this, all of them performed poorly and one you had to close out an ad before it would turn off (really?!?).<br/><br/>In choosing whether or not to keep it, I had to weigh the solid build and reliable performance against an operating system that was under par for Windows or Mac.<br/><br/>That said, I'm very glad I kept this little guy.  In the end, it's a reliable little entertainment unit and it's wonderful where it counts: It's a great streamer (with a beautiful picture) and it plays music that I love and I can leave it in place and listen on my blue tooth headphones while I wander all over the house.  The apps are a shame, but honestly, given the price point here, it's a good deal and I can live with it.</span>

<span>So far I have had no complaints. It was very easy to set up. The battery life is more than adequate. The biggest thing for me was only adjusting to the operating system. Until now, I have only used windows laptops for the last twenty plus years. Before that I had an Apple. It's been easy so far, though I still have difficulties with right-clicking with the trac-pad. I have easily avoided this by using a wireless mouse.</span>

<span>I got this Chromebook to replace my last Samsung 11"  Chromebook which I had for about 3.5 years.<br/>The Acer spin 11 was pretty good and I liked it alot. The keyboard worked much better than my Samsung.<br/>That thing has a mind of it's own, I think. You type one word and the Chromebook types up something else..<br/>Expect for this one small problem and it started just after a month or so after I had purchased this.<br/>Once awhile it wouldn't turn back on after I had idling for whatever time it took to be in power saving mode but<br/>It wouldn't turn back on, everytime when this happens I have to press the side power button for about ten seconds to turn it off first then, I'd give it a minute before hitting the same power button again. I hold it just long enough to see the blue light goes on next to power button you just pressed. Oh just out of curiosity, what does the power button do located right top corner? Cause it won't shut the computer off or on. No matter how long you hold the button down. Anyway back to main issue, just awhile I left the Chromebook to visit UPS store and came back, tried to reboot my Chromebook as usual but this time it won't turn on. I tried unplug &amp; replug all the cables like power, HDMI. Man I only had this for about 4-5 months and this happens. My warranty expired as well.... I'm very disappointed.</span>

One thing you'll possibly need to look out for.  When I registered device on Lenovo site my device was listed as being out of warranty since 2020.  If it happens to you, you'll need to open a case with Lenovo support.  They were very good and reset my warranty to time of purchase. Other than that, no complaints so far.</span>

<span>This is my first time using a chromebook so I don't have anything to paste to besides windows pcs. It took a bit of getting used to not having a right click or caps lock. But I got it so I could write on it like a tablet and it does just that! Tho I can't say it runs android programs terribly reliably. It has crashed literally every game I've downloaded on it at some point and freezes on my writing apps (of which there are no chrome os variants). But then again, phones and tablets also crash too so it's not like this is a complete deal breaker. I love how light it is and how well it responds to my usi stylus. Touch screen is smooth and the touch pad is flawless. Honestly the touch pad on this chromebook is more reliable and sensitive than any windows laptop touch pad I've ever used. The whole this is light and the screen bezel is minimal. Also no island keyboard. Keys feel pretty standard but no issues or sticking or not working. Speakers are clear. Screen graphics are clear. All in all I'm happy I got the best of the mid-tier chromebooks instead of forking out 2x the price for a Samsung or 4x for an iPad. I absolutely love that I can access everything on my phone with it.</span>

<span>I really love this chromebook and am considering buying another one. I've had it almost 2 years. One of the hinges broke (on my left side when its open in front of me) months ago and that seems to be a common problem. I think this is what led to a screen crack in that corner. But I tell you what, even with that it still works phenomenally well and I am still using it daily. The picture is amazing even at low brightness, I love the backlit keyboard and it types well, the trackpad is one of the best I've used on a chromebook (I've had many) and the sound is really, really good! (speakers face up which is important) The touchscreen still works perfectly even with the hinge and screen crack. It is zippy fast, still. I use it primarily for streaming and for web browsing or schoolwork. Never, ever lags and never fails to boot on opening. The battery life is not as good as my old Asus, I probably get 8-9 hours but I just keep it plugged in. It doesn't get hot which is *really* nice. Overall it's probably the best chromebook I've ever had I just wish they could make the design better for the hinge issue. I'll either get it repaired or purchase another one. I do recommend it just be very careful with the hinges. Worth the price for sure.</span>

<span>UPDATED:<br/><br/>I wrote a long review but deleted it because, well, you guys said most of it, and said it well... No need to repeat. I'll just write an abbreviated review:<br/><br/>1. I bought the first one and I really liked it - until it bricked a few times. I was able to get it going again after doing some extensive research. That was a couple of months or so ago and I forgot exactly what the fix was (press a key and the side button or something) but I'll look for it and post here if I find it.<br/><br/>2. After it bricked a few times - I didn't want a defective item - new computers shouldn't brick - so I decided to return and exchange it. Ultimately Amazon did exchange it after they tried to tell me I'd have to wait over a month! What? There were several in stock according to the product page. I persisted, called again, insisted on speaking with a supervisor - who finally "was able to" get it to me within a week, not the two days that is guaranteed to a Prime member. It was kind of an insult that they tried to push around a Prime customer. My guess is they had several in stock, but not that many, and they wanted to keep those for new Flex buyers and it would take a month for the next shipment from wherever. Who knows.<br/><br/>3. Got this one, it works well and I like it a lot. Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>+I absolutely love the backlit keyboard - this is my first one - and don't know how I ever settled for a computer without one before! It's great for working in low light or the dark. Probably the one best feature of this Chromebook.<br/><br/>+And I like the keys and keyboard, typing is just right, Lenovo always made superior keyboards and this one delivers too.<br/><br/>+The screen is nice and clear, better than I first judged. But I'm really gentle and careful with it and refrain from folding it over tablet style because of all the hinge complaints. It sucks to have to be so proactively careful, but what can you do? I thought of spraying some appropriate lubricant into the hinges, but will have to find out what to use.<br/><br/>+But the speakers are sooo inferior, tinny, low volume with little range, etc.  As a comparison, my Samsung phone with one tiny speaker is much, much louder and clearer than this Chromebook. Makes no sense - the two speaker grills on the front could easily support larger, louder, better quality speakers. What would it cost them, a dollar? Two? Lenovo, come on now,<br/><br/>Overall I really like this Chromebook. It serves most of my needs, is quick, simple to use, light, good for scrolling the internet, good for watching movies (but as mentioned, the volume is low, so it would be a challenge to play for a group in a room), the battery is pretty good - never ran out of battery. I recommend it, particularly at the sale price.</span>
