<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I purchased this drive to use as an external storage for my Playstation 4.  I read reviews, looked at product videos etc. Because I was initially concern about comparative products that were advertised for use with the PS4, but did not work.<br/>I was pleasantly surprised with the ease with which the drive was setup and it's compatability with my PS4.<br/>I have been using the drives consistently now transferring application from my system to the external drive with relative ease.<br/>In addition the applications play from off the external drive with nk noticeable lag in performance or download of data.<br/>Thus far, this is a great purchase 👌</span>

<span>Got this for my son to use with his Xbox because anytime he'd want to play any of his favorite games it would take him forever to get started.  Found out it was because he was deleting Fortnite to play Apex, and deleting that to play Rainbow 6, and that for GTA5 to COD and back around again.  Oh hell no if he wanted to play Lego Batman (smh).  So I figured this would do the trick.  His father was skeptical because he'd had the 2GB and at least it happened before the warranty expired, but it crashed and had to be replaced which the warranty DOES NOT COVER!  It covers trying to rescue your data on the device.  Which like never happens, and why bother?  My data is all backed up in an XBox cloud somewhere.  It is secure, what is not secure is you device and sneaky way of making the consumer think you got them covered.  Sorry, "Oops your data could not be recovered)fake apology just doesn't cut it.  But there aren't a whole lot of choices and Amazon has a good deal on this 5GB so figured we could give it a try.  That was Birthday in July of 2022 and so far so good.  Writes and reads fast as hell and hopefully he won't run out of space anytime soon.  Definitely worth the money, I will update this if it changes.</span>

<span>Arrived on time. Packaged exactly how you see in the photo.  No physical damage as i could see. Interesting how simple the packaging was. I wondered if it was really "new" as it wasn't sealed or anything. But after i connected to my computer all was good. Capacity was exactly 2 TB. You don't see that anymore. Usually they dont give you the full capacity.  Its always 1.9 or 1.95 etc. Lol. Anyway,  happy with it!! Transfered all my movie files to free up my hard drive.</span>

<span>I use these external units to back-up and safeguard import work/personal documents.  I recently had a 250mb external HD fail due to a faulty connection port.  I was able to unscrew the case and remove the HD for insertion into another unit and was able to recover the stored documents.  My fear with this design is that if something other than the HD should fail, I might not be able to recover the drive's content.  Other than that, it's a great little HD.</span>

<span>This model is the latest generation of the many My Passport drives I've owned or purchased for clients. They have proven reliable and good performers. They have incrementally improved with each new generation. This model features a new case design which I feel is much better looking and is slightly smaller than the last version.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE (for the impatient):<br/>This model is a little bit faster than the last (2016) model I bought. I got the black 2TB model and this generation offers up to a 5TB model as well as the usual smaller capacities. This model is just noticeably faster than the last generation on sequential reads and writes when I tested using CrystalDiskMark.<br/><br/>This My Passport has a new design that returns to rounded corners and soft-look matte case. I like this much better than the older one with its cheap-looking (to me) styling. The drive is slightly less thick, wide and long than the 2016 model. In my laptop bag that’s welcome even if not a lot smaller.<br/><br/>I’m very pleased with this My Passport drive as with ones purchased over the last decade plus. It’s reliable, fast for a USB mechanical HD and gives a lot of space for a low price.<br/><br/>If you want more details, read on...<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/>The My Passport USB 3.0 drives are simple to use and come with reasonable software tools and backup/sync software. These are now in a single installer on the drive. I have my own backup solution and do not want encryption on this drive, so have not explored this software. If these are of interest, be sure to check for newer versions on the WD web site.<br/><br/>Pluses:<br/>+ This drive works fine with Windows, Linux or Mac out of the box. With Linux or Mac (where it is read-only with NTFS). They generally performs best when reformatted with a native file system to the respective operating system. Mine came formatted with NTFS for Windows.<br/>+ This generation has 5TB, 4TB, 2TB, and 1TB models. The 500GB models were dropped a couple of generations ago and more recently the 3TB models.<br/>+ This drive is faster than the last generation, but just a little. Up to about 3% faster in benchmarks, but barely noticeable in practical use.<br/>+ The form factor of the new drive is lighter and slightly smaller before with a much nicer case without pointy corners and scratch/fingerprint prone glossy finish.<br/>+ The warranty has been returned to 3 years from 2 years on the 2016 generation.<br/><br/>Minuses:<br/>- It comes with the same very short USB 3.0 cable as previous versions. I like a longer </span>

<span>: a very good upgrade purchase for the My Passport drives.<br/><br/>IN THE BOX:<br/>The My Passport comes in a easy to open retail package containing the drive and a annoyingly short USB 3.0 cable. There are a couple small pieces of paper for warranty and quick-start. That's it. The cable in this model is the same as previous versions.

<span> handy for longer runs to my desktop or even on top of a tall computer.<br/><br/>FORM FACTOR vs. PREVIOUS GENERATION:<br/><br/>I'll compare the new generation of My Passport with my 2016 My Passport Ultra<br/>This Model My Passport's dimensions:<br/>1TB-2TB:  0.27lb, 4.22in X 0.44in X 2.95in<br/>4TB-5TB: 0.46lb, 4.22in X 0.46in X 2.95in<br/><br/>2016 My Passport's dimensions:<br/>1TB:  0.37lb, 4.33in X 0.64in X 3.21in<br/>2TB-4TB: 0.54lb, 4.33in X 0.85in X 3.21in<br/><br/>TESTING:<br/>I tested both my older 2016 My Passport 4TB drive and my new My Passport 4TB model using CrystalDiskMark benchmark software and by copying  11GB folder of updates and files to the drive. This was to compare the benchmark with real-world copying. The 11GB folder has a broad mix of file sizes and types including files an over 2GB iso DVD image.<br/><br/>Using CrystalDiskMark I found sequential reads were about 3% faster and writes about 8% faster with the new model. Random reads were just a tiny bit slower and writes were about 8X (!!!) faster. While the benchmarks showed significant differences using them in my real-world copy test the difference was most noticeable with lots of smallish files, but not so much with large sequential reads/writes. If you need to write smallish files this drive is noticeably better than the 2016 model and about the same for large files.<br/><br/>For my testing the My Passport drive was connected to built-in USB 3.0 controller on my Dell 7710 Precision Mobile Workstation. I also tried it on a older add-in card with the Renasas USB 3.0 chip set on my Dell Precision T7500 tower. I have the latest Renasas drivers installed. Both are running build 1903 of Windows 10 Pro and both have SATA SSD boot drives. I used CrystalDiskMark V7 64bit version.<br/><br/>CRYSTALDISKMARK Results:<br/>The New Generation My Passport:<br/>Sequential Read (Q8T1): 129.18 MB/s<br/>Sequential Write (Q8T1): 119.75 MB/s<br/>Sequential Read (Q1T1): 120.37 MB/s<br/>Sequential Write (Q1T1): 118.08MB/s<br/>Random Read (Q32T16): 4KiB 0.6 MB/s<br/>Random Write (Q32T16): 4KiB 10.8 MB/s<br/>Random Read (Q1T1): 4KiB 0.49 MB/s<br/>Random Write (Q1T1): 4KiB 7.8 MB/s<br/><br/>The 2016 My Passport:<br/>The New Generation My Passport:<br/>Sequential Read (Q8T1): 125.5 MB/s<br/>Sequential Write (Q8T1): 113.7 MB/s<br/>Sequential Read (Q1T1): 119.1 MB/s<br/>Sequential Write (Q1T1): 113.7 MB/s<br/>Random Read (Q32T16): 4KiB 0.573 MB/s<br/>Random Write (Q32T16): 4KiB 1.290 MB/s<br/>Random Read (Q1T1): 4KiB 0.505 MB/s<br/>Random Write (Q1T1): 4KiB 1.305 MB/s<br/><br/>REAL WORLD COPY:<br/>In my real world copy test the new My Passport drive was just noticeably faster than the older My Passport Ultra. More on the writing than reading side and more noticeably with smaller files than larger files. It peaked out at about 70MB/s with large files. I never dropped below 35MB/s even with large amounts of small files being copied to the drive.  The 2016 My Passport Ultra peaked out at about 68MB/s and dropped several times to 30MB/s.<br/><br/>I'm thinking the newer drive may have a larger on-drive write cache or maybe it's just a bit faster drive. Maybe both. On big copies the new My Passport may save you a few seconds here or there but if copying a lot of small files to it the difference was much more noticeable.<br/><br/>CONCLUSIONS:<br/>The My Passport line of drives from Western Digital has been very good to me and to my clients. This reliable and good to excellent performing line has a long positive history with me.<br/><br/>This WD My Passport model is an evolution over the 2016 My Passport. I'm picking it for new purchases over the older model, but won't rush out to replace older drives. I like this 2019 My Passport’s rounded corner case better than the 2016 sharp edged and glossy one, but it's very minor point for me. Overall it's an excellent evolution to a 5 star predecessor and continues to be a very good external storage choice.<br/><br/>For making improvements in small file write performance and correcting the 2016 bad case design issue this new 2019 generation of My Passport drives is worth 5 stars in my opinion.<br/><br/>Hope this helps someone!</span>

<span>I've been using Western Digital portable hard drives for years and have been rather high quality and long lasting (only one stopped working after several years and I think it was due to frequent Time Machine use). This hard drive works well and as snappy as the others, though the casing seems low quality, as it broke in half after it fell a couple of feet to a tile floor in an accident, but still works perfectly fine, thank goodness. Would buy again either way.</span>

<span>What is there really to say?  These days external hard drives are more of a commodity than a specialty item.  They either work or they don't and they are either fast or slow.<br/><br/>The WD 4TB My Passport Portable External Hard Drive with backup software and password protection, Black - WDBPKJ0040BBK-WESN is a trusted brand (Western Digital) and the drive lives up to their reputation. It is small, sturdy and fast.  It holds what can only be described as an enormous amount of data for a small carry-around hard drive and it works. It just works.  Plug it in, and in a few seconds Windows ™ recognizes it, mounts it and you have another fast hard drive.<br/><br/>Perhaps because I am so old, it seems more amazing to me, but I remember my first 80Mb hard drive - I was king of the world!  Then I remember my first FAST hard drive, a 1 Gb SCSI hard drive that probably cost nearly $1 a megabyte.  It was a GIGABYTE!!!! Wow.  Now we have a 4,000 gigabyte EXTERNAL FAST hard drive that costs less than $200 - what a world...<br/><br/>And 20 years from now we will consider this to be a small, pathetic hard drive - if we don't wipe ourselves out as a species first.</span>

<span>Extremely durable hard drive. Here are some quick tips: yes, it can be reformatted into exFat so that it works with Mac or Linux, and it can be partitioned, if needed. Yes, you can rename the drive anything you want. I would not leave it plugged in continuously. Just plug it in long enough to save, store, or access what you need, and then unplug it and save it for later. If you do this, it will last for years without a problem. I keep a spreadsheet with everything I have on my hard drives and I number them, so that I don't have to keep going back and checking where I put some random file. I have stored files as large as 50 GB on Windows 10 using this drive without any issues. It should be able to handle anything you throw at it and last. Formatting and wiping has never been a problem. Definitely worth the price for this much storage. I even bought two of this model.</span>

<span>in terms of dollars per gigabyte, at the time I purchased these, the 12 TB was the best value.  Assuming that you are not substantially space constrained (shelf space).<br/><br/>With these high density drives reliability is always a primary concern too.  they really push the boundaries of what is feasible as they continue to push the capacity higher and higher.  Which is why for a long time I avoided such monsters.  But these have been around for long enough now that I feel more comfortable buying them.  I used a program called BADBLOCKS and let it run tests continuously for about 5 days (every sector read/write multiple times) before deciding to put these bad boys into use.<br/><br/>One of the big problems with these high capacity drives is the amount of time that it takes to move data in and out of them.  So I was very happy to see that they have increased the throughput to a sustained 200 Megabytes per second Read/Write.  Of course actual access times vary due to many factors but on large files USB3 that is what I was seeing.  So Really Happy About That.<br/><br/>There is an endless debate about which is better (more reliable)  Seagate or Western Digital.  I have found WD to be very reliable, I can't tell you which one is more reliable But I tend to avoid Seagate because some of their drives are/were very slow for me.<br/><br/>Only time will tell about the ultimate reliability, but these passed my tests with flying colors and I have some WD 8TB drives that are about 4 years old without any problems.  (I'm only using these drives for backups so not super stressing them).<br/><br/>Remember folks....  You need to make at least two copies of everything ( 2 drives) and if it is something that you really care about then make 3 copies and take one offsite.  I have seen far too many horror stories of people who's backups failed for various reasons.<br/><br/>These drives will get the job done.</span>

<span>I have a NAS device, it's fairly large, I like having backups regularly of the data.  One day I'll get a new one, and just use the old one as my backup, but until then.  These drives do the trick.  I rotate them fairly regularly as I'm a firm believer of more than one backup of data as I've lost data before and been saved from catastrophic loss by old backups.<br/><br/>I likely wont go larger that 16TB anytime soon as that much data on one drive is not exactly "safe".  If the drive got knocked over, or pushed off the table while  running, yeah, bye data.  However as its backup data, and I have a secondary rotated in every 3 months the risk is adequate for now.<br/><br/>This isn't my first of their devices, I have multiple 12's and have had multiple of different sizes through the years / decades.

<span>I got this T7 Samsung detachable drive to transfer images and documents from. my ancient Mac to my new Mac.  It's FAST (37,500 big, some multi-gig images transferred in less than 7 minutes), small, and I love that it came with 2 USB cables.  8,00 documents (many are more than 500 pages each) transferred almost instantly.  One cable is USBC to USBC (new to new), but the other is old USB to USBC (old to new), enabling easy transfer from my old Mac. I didn't need tech support.  It's new, so I don't know how long it will last, but it's perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>Purchased as additional storage for the PS5, can confirm it works with that system. USB-C transfer allows me to store games on the SSD and play ps4 games from there without having to reinstall them on the system. PS5 games still need to be on the system to play but can be stored on the SSD without issue when not being played. It has plenty of actual storage once formatted. I really like these SSDs. I currently have two in my desktop, one as external storage for my laptop, and one as external storage for my PS5. Have had all but the newest one for several years with no issues whatsoever.</span>

<span>I got the red 1tb model to back up my Plex server and I did it. It coped everything quite quickly over 500gb of movies and tv shows copyed in near minutes  Now I know when or if I need it. I can get my Plex server up and running again in no time. Filled it up to abot 60% of cupidity in near minutes. It was going around 600 mb/s cuz I have 3.1 gen 2 on my computer. It slowed down to around 400 mb/s after a while but I assume it’s cuz cache ran out.</span>

<span>Although it is a reputable product, my experience was not good, because this product is made to work with a manufacturer's program that must be installed on the computer, and uses a proprietary cache and not the standard in RAM, another problem is encryption. In other words, it's not a highly compatible device like most others on the market. I also had problems with the USB-C to USB-C cable but the manufacturer quickly supplied me with a replacement. I haven't gotten it to work properly with Linux on the USB-C port yet, but it already connects with the other supplied USB 3.1 cable. If you don't mind some headaches and you like good design and you value the prestige of a brand, don't hesitate to buy it.</span>
