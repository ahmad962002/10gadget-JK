<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>If you’re trying to buy this for your ps5 for more storage it is best for you to buy another game drive. Since this is a ps4 drive it doesn’t allow you to download ps5 games, but the product is perfect and simple.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>So I will say any external hard drive I use is Seagate they are wonderful streamline and easy to use. I've never had to transfer from hard drive to device to use anything I download I mostly use them for as it says my PlayStation but I have other ones for my laptop and computer. this one will be mostly an external to download your games onto not your screenshots and the like. Do not get an Amazon referbished one.... Buy these new well worth it 👌</span>

<span>I bought this drive to expand the storage on my PS5. The device works as advertised, it's small and very concealable, for those worried about aesthetics, has a ton of storage for games and works as soon as you plug it in. It could not get any more simple than it is. Then you just need to move games to it. For the money, it's a great external HD and you can always trust WD to make a dependable device, in my experience</span>

<span>I am very upset with the lack of quality in this product.<br/>Don't waste your money here.<br/>I am going to try and get my money back!<br/><br/>If I were to chose a word to summarize my experiences with this product it would be RUBBISH!<br/>Rubbish is a polite term for how bad the USB-ESATA bus cards on this system work.<br/>Don't waste your time like I did!<br/><br/>Below were my earlier experiences, when I was optimistic.<br/><br/>The first drive I bought worked okay after some effort.<br/>The second drive I bought did not work at all and I had to order a replacement.<br/>The replacement drive worked great out of the box.<br/>However, with such variable behavior between drives I am now much warier.<br/><br/>Drive 1:<br/>  I received and installed this drive today on a desktop PC newly upgraded from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro.<br/><br/>  I attached the drive to a USB 3.0 port on my desktop PC and powered it on.<br/>  The drive has an on/off switch.<br/><br/>  I think the drive is quiet but it is physically heavier than I expected.<br/><br/>  I stood the drive in its stand to help keep it cool as shown in the product image.<br/>  Personally I would prefer to keep the center of gravity lower. I have cats!<br/><br/>  The first time I connected the drive, my Windows system reported installing SATA-USB hub.<br/>  The installing window stalled at about 90% complete.<br/><br/>  From Windows Explorer I could see the preformatted 3726 GB NTFS partition.<br/>  I received errors when attempting to read the 2 files on the drive or create a new folder on the drive.<br/><br/>  After waiting a while I gave up and rebooted the system.<br/>  When the system restarted the new drive was not detected.<br/><br/>  I disconnected the drive and paused for about 30secs in hope the system would be readier to detect the drive.<br/>  When I reconnected the drive it was successfully detected but with a different drive letter.<br/>  I checked under devices and the SATA-USB drive was reported as connected using USB 3.0.<br/><br/>  I did not reformat the new drive.<br/>  I was able to transfer files to the new drive with its existing almost 4TB NTFS partition.<br/>  I transferred about 150 video files with an average size of 9GB.<br/>  The transfer rate from my system SATA drives to the new USB drive was between 145-167 MB/S.<br/>  That is very fast!<br/><br/>  I have ordered a second drive to use for redundancy in a Windows Mirror set (cheap RAID 0) or as a backup disk.<br/><br/>Drive 2:<br/>  I was so delighted with the first drive I ordered a second drive.<br/>  When I installed the second drive it was initially recognized on the target system and then became unavailable after a few minutes.<br/><br/>  I tried connecting the drive using USB 3.0, USB 2.0 and eSATA.<br/>  I tried connecting the drive to my laptop running Windows 8.1 and had similar results.<br/>  I spent several hours trying to get the drive to work without success.<br/>  I gave up and asked Amazon for a replacement which I received 4 days later.<br/>  I think that the USB-SATA bridge in the enclosure I received is bad which makes the added value for this supplier questionable.<br/><br/>Drive 3:<br/>  Worked out of the box. Three drives and three different experiences.<br/>  I have successfully copied the first drive's data (1.6TB) to this drive several times, each time in less than 4 hours.<br/>  However, I feel I need to stress test both dives before I can rely on them to hold master and backup copies of my data.</span>

<span>Got this 12TB Fantom drive Aug 26, 2018. Dell Precision 7910 Windows 7 would not recognize it through disk management, could not find the device, USB hub did not light up as being connected, still did not work on USB 3.0 in front of Dell Precision work station.<br/><br/>Device manager does not show anything connected to that USB port. Device manager and disk management both show the 3 internal drives and the other 10 external Fantom drives (3TB to 6TB). Blue drive light comes on, can hear disk boot up and run. I tried cable swap, no help.<br/><br/>Amazon offered support help, I declined since I have almost 40 years of computer experience.<br/><br/>Returned drive to Amazon, exchanged for same 12TB drive, exact same problem. No offer of support help. I contacted Amazon customer support, no response.<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/>BIG Update: Manufacturer contacted me, the next day!!!. Had me try: Turn on drive without USB connected, wait until drive boots (20 seconds ish), then connect USB. First two tries: No Joy. Third try: I waited longer, drive light went out, connected USB, Windows found drive.<br/><br/>So manufacturer google drive to update the firmware. Came with great instructions. Worked fine, although know that said 12TB Fantom needs to be the only drive connected while doing the firmware update. After update, turned on drive and all went well as normal.<br/><br/>Note: I have 10 other Fantom drives, the oldest is perhaps 8 years old. They are on for 99% of the 24/7/365. Not one has ever failed on its own. These drives have the best cooling apparatus.<br/><br/>Yeah, it is true that they should have tested better and not sold one that wouldn't work perfect, but the fix was easy and support was spectacular. My guess is all future drives will have this issue sorted out.</span>

<span>This 4 TB External hard drive is being used as my DVR expander for my DirecTV Genie. So here is a little back story:<br/><br/>I have Verizon Fios and DirecTV Genie service in my home. (Yes I have both for sports etc). I have used the Western digital 1TB expandable DVR expanders for a few years on both Directv and my Fios service. The Western Digitals work great but... 1TB is simply not enough for when I go on vacations or record a lot of shows within a week. I have been looking for a perfect solution to my storage needs. I HAVE found what I've been looking for in the Fantom 4TB drive. (Disclaimer, this drive only works with my Directv Genie, My Fios box wouldn't recognize it).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The drive really does expand my DirecTV Genie to 4TB. I have literally over 80 hours of HD content and only 4% is full so far. That's 96% free. Since I know the capacity limits of the 1TB I can say the Directv Genie uses the full 4TB of space.<br/>-Easy to install and use (Just unplug the receiver, plug in this drive then boot up receiver).<br/>-Does not slow down the receiver or your browsing of channels and shows.<br/>-If the power ever goes out, once rebooted it goes back right where it left off, recording all of my shows.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-The Blinking Blue light is very frustrating and annoying. Use some black electric tape to cover this light.<br/>-Compared to the Western Digital 1TB DVR expanders, this drive definitely makes some noise. Nothing too loud or unbearable but, you definitely hear the drive grinding. If you store it further away or under a shelf you should be fine.<br/>-Build quality of the casing isn't the best. Feels a bit cheap but looks aren't everything I guess.<br/>-Does NOT come with a eSata cable. Luckily I had an extra one from my Western Digital drive but if you don't have one, buy one.<br/>-Does NOT work with Fios, Only Directv as I have tested.<br/><br/>Overall I am very happy with my purchase of this drive. I know I can be away for weeks at a time and all of my shows will be recording without running out of space. It isn't perfect but for the price and the high capacity (4TB) it's a great deal!<br/><br/>Buy it!</span>

<span>This is the 2nd Fantom drive I have ( smaller storage ) as the first died for no apparent reason. Would not get past boot/initialize ( used 3 years ) This one started working out great and shortly after purchase ( 2 months of light backup usage ) it lost everything ( unknown reason ). Thought I would reformat one more time and give one more shot. Currently working just fine, my opinion is not determined at this time. Transfer speeds for computer Backup files or image backup are not nearly as fast as published specs using eSATA or USB 3. I realize my computer will greatly influence this result, but I have plenty of memory and other requirements on my main PC. Will not go for drive 3 if this one fails again.</span>

<span>I was a little hesitant to purchase based on some of the reviews. I'm glad I did. I looked at the hard drive and I got a Seagate Compute drive 10TB and it was new. That squashes a lot of bad reviews. I ran CrystalDisk analysis and it said I was good to go. I randomly run CrystalDisk to keep in front of any potential issues that may cause data loss.<br/><br/>This will be a media server drive and I live alone so the hours won't be clocked as much as a home with children where a NAS drive would be warranted. I will put about 8TB of media on it then buy another. I must admit that the initial copy is slow but I am moving from a 5400rpm drive so that is to be expected. To stream video to my TV via Plex Media Server doesn't take a lot of throughput so I am not concerned. I recorded my media at 720p and let my TV upscale to 4K and it looks great to me and that's what matters. If you are wirelessly streaming 4K video from this device then you may not be the happiest camper on the block.<br/><br/>The appearance of this drive on my desk just looks like it belongs. It is not an eyesore like a lot of competitive brands. Maybe I am just getting conservative in my old age. Nevertheless, I like it's visual appearance.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I intend to use due diligence to maintain the equipment to keep it in good working order and don't expect it to perform beyond the physical capacity in which it was designed to operate. I am pleased with what I have seen so far.<br/><br/>I definitely would purchase another once I reach 80% capacity on this drive.</span>

<span>After using up most of the storage I had available on my laptop it was time to look for an external drive. There are a lot of options out there with varying sizes, some with dedicated power supplies (like this one) and some without. After reading enough poor reviews on a lot of the smaller (1TB or less) drives that didn't have dedicated power supplies I decided to go for something large that would hopefully last me a long time.<br/><br/>I went with this Fantom 3TB drive and am very glad I did. Utilizing USB 3.0 I get very quick transfers when moving over new movies and music to the drive from my main library. 4-5 movies that range from 2-5GB a piece only take a couple minutes to transfer. I just start it, walk away to do something real quick and when I come back everything is done.<br/><br/>Equally impressive are the read speeds. I haven't encountered any hiccups when streaming media from the drive itself and everything plays perfectly smooth.<br/><br/>The overall size of the enclosure isn't small, but it doesn't take up an excess amount of space either. It comes with a basic stand so you can use the drive upright without it falling over which I use all the time. The supplied cable over a year later still works without issue or excessive slop. I utilize the drive a few times a week so it has seen moderate use.<br/><br/>The drive does utilize a blue LED that while fine during the day is slightly annoying when used in a dark bedroom at night. The light indicates power as well as access so if I'm streaming a movie while getting ready for bed a constant flickering light is hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Also, and this may be just my model or my ears, but whenever on and sitting within 10 feet I can hear the electronic noise of the drive. This is downright aggravating for any duration longer than 5-10 minutes. Whenever possible I try to keep the drive as far away as possible to reduce this issue. For this specifically I dropped a star.<br/><br/>Although the LED can be slightly annoying and the noise produced by the drive irritates me, I can't ignore the performance and durability of the drive. I tote this thing everywhere in a backpack and it has survived with no issues. I don't drop my bag or toss it around carelessly knowing it's in there, but it spends lots of time in my vehicle.<br/><br/>Overall, the large storage available in a reliable and functional package make this a worthwhile purchase and is one I would make again.</span>

<span>I'm a professional musician, and got this drive to hold all my software virtual instrument libraries I use in Logic with Komplete Kontrol. OK, it's admittedly not as good for this purpose as if you had a solid state drive, I'll give you that, to be fair, but don't knock it! This is perfect for the job. And, if you're not a musician, don't fret. This drive still may be just what you need. Remember, the drive isn't just for music creation. That's what I use it for, but it's a standard USB external drive. Beware, if you want something portable to throw in a laptop bag, this isn't the drive you want to get. This drive isn't bus powered. It does take an electrical power cord as well. Aside that though, it's pretty good. The only other thing I'd say as a slight downfall is, the drive due to its speed of the 7200RPM is slightly noisy. I mean ok, It doesn't sound like a military tomcat getting ready to take off, God forbid, but you definitely will hear it.</span>

<span>Well this External HDD works great and hasn't broken yet, (I had 2 Toshiba HDDs that both started failing w/in a year, &amp; 2 years respectively). But the reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because IT DOESN'T WORK WITH MY SONY BLU-RAY PLAYER! And THAT was the WHOLE REASON I bought the damn thing.I have a Sony BDP-S550 1080 that can play USB devices. I've never had a problem before now. I make movies and I like to watch them on my Blu-ray Player to go over them at night, as its in my room, and I dont have a HD-TV in my room, (so I cant just use a laptop hooked up to it with an HDMI cable). My Toshiba HDDs were very easy to use and I could just plug it into my Blu-ray Player and watch them. Super easy. I guess USB devices, (specifically HDD's over 1Tb), now can be formatted as GPT or MBR, but Blu-ray Players (evidently, which I now know) cant play GPT! And now that external HDD's are coming with more memory, 1- 2 Tb's+, its harder to get an external with only 500Gbs. And if its 1Tb or more it generally is GPT, as this one is. I reviewed and looked into this A LOT before buying it, and got as much info as possible about it, and I was under the impression that it would work on my Blu-ray Player. No where in the products description did it say that it wont work with a Blu-ray Player. If the technology is different, and no longer works in the way people are used to it working on their media devices, (as in easy plug &amp; play), then I expect them to tell you. I think it's ridiculous that they make them incompatible to Blu-ray players! What good is it to have all that memory if you cant even use it!? I've heard that you can try and reformat it into smaller partitions as MBR, and that this may be compatible with my Blu-ray player, which I guess I'll try, but its very annoying to have to do this, (especially as I already saved my stuff on it from my failing Toshiba HDD and I might not be able to access it again if I delete it &amp; reformat it, as I dont have an extra 1Tb laying around to put it on while I do so). I've heard you can use a DLNA server to connect your media devices as a way to access your HDD from your computer wirelessly that can be connected to via your Blu-ray, but I haven't been able to get it to work correctly. Its just very frustrating and I regret buying it. I almost rather just get another 500GB Toshiba as I know they work on my media devices.</span>

<span>**XBOX ONE OWNERS**<br/><br/>This is a nice, compact drive that is lightweight, and can safely be "stacked" on top of a console or PC with no threat of crushing or leaving indents after long periods of sitting. It can easily become inconspicuous, and even in view it is not much of an eye sore. As a matter of fact, it's black coloring goes just fine - sitting on top of my XBox One(top left - DO NOT PLACE THE DRIVE ON THE TOP RIGHT OF THE CONSOLE WHERE THE VENTILATION IS).<br/><br/>XBox One owners who have reached their storage limits would appreciate this. It IS practically "PLUG &amp; PLAY". Practically, because you must not plug the drive usb into the console until you have FIRST powered up your console. I plugged - then powered up the first attempt, and the XBox didn't even sense it. Power up the console(give it time to load your home screen), plug in the HD's usb(I plugged it in the "rear" of the console), go to "Settings", then "Storage". **NOTE: It slipped my memory, but either right after plug in, or immediately after choosing the WD drive for future memory(next step), it will ask if the drive's primary use is for "photos and media", whether you have current photos on the drive, and/or is it for your "game saves and downloads". Know that it is about to format the drive, so if you have photos saved prior to moving it to the XBox - keep this in mind...you could lose them.**<br/><br/>I provided pictures, but you will notice your consoles built in memory option at first, and the WD Hard Drive option should be showing to it's right. You may immediately notice something seemingly off...<br/><br/>"1.8 TB???"<br/><br/>You haven't been ripped off. Think of that unprovided(to you) ".2 TB" as the HDrive's functioning brain. The drive needs memory space of its own to be the think tank for services provided to you. A brainless drive is a dead drive.<br/><br/>Just click or choose to switch your memory(and future downloads) to the WD drive. Somewhere either right before or right after, it will ask your preferences on what kind of content you want saved. After formatting, IT'S SET. It showed "27.1%" memory used(for me), leaving that 1.8 TB. My explanation will take much longer to read than setting this up yourself. It's quite easy. I have since successfully re-downloaded games that I had to delete to make room for others, and I have also successfully downloaded new ones. We even had a recent power outage flicker - no harm to the drive. So far, so good, and at one of the most reasonable prices on Amazon in it's class.</span>

<span>This review is for the 2TB Passport drive.  I am using it with a MacBook Pro.  I have two other Passport drives, but they are the 1TB model.  With this one, I had to go through some extra steps to format it.  I want to clear up any confusion over whether this drive works on a Mac.  Out of the box, Disk Utility will not work to reformat the drive.  You can format it, but you must do it through the Terminal app on the Mac, and not with Disk Utility.<br/><br/>I found the steps on Reddit.  If you want to get them there, just Google "reddit disk utility fails to erase/format an external hdd."  The first hit in your search results will be that page.<br/><br/>These are the steps I took, per Reddit.<br/><br/>1. Open the Terminal app.  You will need to copy and paste specific commands into the app, hitting return each time in order execute your commands.<br/><br/>2.  Paste this command: diskutil list<br/><br/>3.  This will show you the disks you have connected to your Mac.  You want to get the name to the disk you're trying to format. The below commands assume this is "disk1", but replace "disk1" with the correct disk if it's something different.<br/><br/>4. Now unmount the disk, by copying and pasting this command: diskutil unmountDisk force disk1<br/><br/>5. Write zeros to the boot sector, by pasting this command: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk1 bs=1024 count=1024<br/><br/>6. Finally attempt to partition it again, by pasting this command: diskutil partitionDisk disk1 GPT JHFS+ "My External HD" 0g.<br/><br/>This will format your disk to HFS+.  If you want to reformat it to ExFat or something else, you can now do that with Disk Utility.</span>

<span>Well, I got this with the intent of expanding the capacity of my DVR but it turned out it wasn't compatible. Sorta pisses me off that my cable company's tech support guy told me I just needed an external drive with an ESATA interface and it should work. The reviews seem to indiacte that most people are using it to extend the capacity of their DVR's successfully, but it won't work with mine. Mine is an Arris DCX3615-M and it comes from my local cable company, Bend Broadband. When I called them to complain or see if they could make it work they said it had to be a drive specifically designed to be a DVR expander, which this one isn't apparently. Not a fault with the drive, I'm using it to store data from my computer and it works fine, just be advised that this drive MIGHT NOT WORK with your DVR.</span>

<span>Bought the drive and plugged it in. It recognized right away and was pre-formatted. The first thing I did was fire up CrystalDiskInfo to make sure the drive was fine, and also to see the specs of the drive in the enclosure. It was a Seagate Barracuda Green 2TB SATA [3GB/s 32MB Cache] 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive ST2000DL003 drive running @ 5900RPM. . All SMART tests were good with no bad / reallocated sectors. (I'd hope so on a brand new drive). I had to purchase a 3rd party USB 3.0 PCI-E 1x card to get the correct speeds.<br/><br/>With USB 2.0, I would get a reasonable 20-40MB/s Transfer rates. Through the USB 3.0 ports I get anywhere from 80MB/s - 120-130MB/s. (Which, using HD Tune is pretty much the maximum that this drive can do due to its lower RPM).<br/><br/>If you are having issues with speeds a little tip that may help. Go to 'Computer' and right click the Fantom External Drive. Go over to the 'Hardware' tab and select the drive in the list shown. Click on 'Properties' on the lower right. Then, in that new window, click on 'Change Settings'. Under the 'Policies' tab, make sure you have it configured for performance. You may need to restart windows for these changes to take affect. But read the warning, you must 'dismount' the drive properly if you are going to use this setting.<br/><br/>Overall, great drive. Fast and easy to set up. Wish the USB cable was a bit longer but that's no big deal. I will update my review if I have issues with the drive at a later date.</span>

<span>I was quite impressed with the metal box construction and sleek design.  I then purchased a USB 3.0 connection as well, but it worked fine on the 2.0.  I do think the 3.0 is noticeably faster.  They are quiet, having no fan, which does not seem to be an issue with heat.  Not sure how, but nicely done Fantom.  I liked the Fantom so much, a few months later I purchased a second one.  So far, no issues with either.  After several WD drives went bad on me (even one they sent as a replacement), I swore off anything by them.  The Fantoms are also priced competitively and have a 3-year warranty! (which, admittingly is of little solace if you just lost all your data and your backup also failed).  I would recommend their products.</span>

<span>My Product Review and Photo's published @ UMLan dot Com! Check it out for more Details! Enjoy!<br/><br/>Today, we have a product that we can compare ruggedness with the hummer in its unique tests. It is portable, small, and a beast to most people that are familiar with the HDD storage market. In this competitive market, the product does stand out from the rest because of its proven features. This little beast can endure water and physical abuse, where many just can't. UMLan would to thank Silicon Power for providing their all enduring show off portable hard drive which consists of a traditional 2.5" 9.5mm 1TB hard drive inside, they call this little beast the Silicon-Power Armor A80.<br/><br/>Most of us say "Eh..." Some of us say "Wow!" well let me break down some cool little features for some of you. As many and most enclosures, they are all the same, "True!" but what can't the rest do?! Most of us purchase HDD enclosures by design, features, and how cheap the enclosures are compared to in pricing. They all do the same but some may show differentials in Transfer Speeds and Design, the Armor A80 states one question and directly states it is a small battle tank, UMLan would like to Thank Silicon-Power for providing us the opportunity to test and try out the product, let's check out the details and performance tests.<br/><br/>The benching software used are ATTO, CrystalDiskMark, HD TACH, and HD Tune Pro which has been included. ATTO benched @ 2GB file size, CrystalDiskMark @ 4GB file size, HDTACH @ 1GB file size, and HDTUNE PRO @ 40GB file size. Overall benchmarks resulted in the same average score and stability for most USB 3.0 transfer speeds, the sequential read and write levels @ 116/112 MB/s, Random 512KB read and write levels @ 36/39 MB/s, Random 4KB read and write @ 0.4/0.7 MB/s, and Random 4K + Queue Dept of 32 read and write for NCQ and AHCI levels @ 0.49/0.70 MB/s.  Adding this storage device to my collection, I see that the Silicon Power Armor A80 can perform stably amongst most other portable hard drives in the market with a strong punch by adding additional rugged support for security during accidental physical and abusive damages even from liquid.<br/><br/>Currently I am working on an introduction test video to reveal the Silicon Power Armor A80 Portable Hard Drive, the video will introduce to the product in addition to multiple endurance tests, physically abused!! Stay tuned!!!<br/><br/>The Silicon Power Armor A80 1TB portable hard drive is just like all others in the market with additional rugged support regardless of being kicked around, drowned, and fully neglected. Through these overall abusive tests, the Armor A80 can certainly endure the wrath of my physical tests as you will see in the coming video. The overall performance resulted in transfer speeds relatively similiar and respected just like most others. Silicon Power uses the Asmedia AS1051 processor, which we can usually tell by now a days, those that are unfamiliar with Asmedia, they are one of the first few USB 3.0 chipset certified manufacturers in this technology. The overall design of this unit is fairly sleek, ergonomic, and holds a solid quality feel to the Armor A80. Today we thank Silicon Power again for sending over proof of what this portable hard drive can do as well as securing our data for the rest of our lives. Now, it all just depends on when the HDD will EOL, not the Armor A80's tough and rugged protective casing. UMLan would like to provide the Silicon Power Armor A80 portable hard drive a score of 9/10 for the following pro's and con's listed below.</span>

<span>If you really care about your data, DON'T TRUST THIS DRIVE!  I don't care what others say any drive will work when it hasn't been tried by fire.  They all work great setting on a desk or pillow but this drive was meant to hold up against the, God forbid, accident so you buy a drive that meets military specs hoping that when that does happen it will hold up.  THIS DRIVE DOESN'T.<br/><br/>This drive was attached to my MacBook Pro not even running when our cat ran by and hit the USB cord that connected it.  I initially didn't panic or worry for it only dropped one and half (1 1/2) feet to a carpeted floor and didn't even make a thud but did pull the USB cord from the drive and disconnect it from the computer.  When reconnected though that fearful sound of the click, click, click disk drive failing let me know this drive was not toast.<br/><br/>IF YOU CARE about your data then choose a drive that does hold up and do what it says it will and that is the Military spec Transcend drive also sold by Amazon.  If though you want to throw your money away and buy a drive that's no better insulated against accidents then this drive may last you a few months but just know you better have yet another backup for this drive is HORRIBLE and I only wish I could give it a half star or 1/10th star.  At least I'll know NEVER TO BUY ANOTHER SILICON POWER DRIVE.<br/><br/>RUGGED Armor?  more like aluminum foil rather than armor.  Again It's your choice but I hope you don't have to learn the hard way AS I DID!<br/><br/>*********************** UPDATE *************************************<br/>While the drive still seems to have some movement within the case I was able to get to show up on a Windows Computer and was able to reformat it and the Windows computer then showed it as a good drive.  Moving it to the Macintosh computer it showed up as a working drive and when tested it tested as GOOD.  It's storing files again so while I still have HIGH SKEPTICISM for this drive I will alter my review to three stars from the ONE before.  I am though leaving the previous review as I worded it but will say that the company Silicon Power, did provide great communication and was more than willing to service the drive and they remain so with the only cost being shipping on my part.  Really that's super customer service.  ONE OTHER humble admission.  As one other commentator stated I should have ordered the other Silicon Power drive that was military tested for drops rather than this one which is more for weather/water resistance. While that is part my fault the wording of their advertising and stating it as ARMOR was a little misleading to make me think that this drive was more drop resistant than other like capacity drives.<br/><br/>Still given the very short/small distance that the drive dropped and the very soft landing area that it landed there really (my opinion mind you) should not have been a 100% data loss event happen.  While the Mac Computer, using the Drive Utility that come with Mac's indicated that the the drive could be recovered and repaired the actual end result was that reformatting (loss of data) had to occur before the drive could be used again but at least it could be used again which is better than a total loss.  The product linked to, after this review, is most likely the product I should have ordered in order to get the most drop resistant drive. </span>

<span>These are good, super convenient hard drives. Mine were initially formatted to the fat32 file system, so max file size was 4GB. They need to be re-formatted to either exfat or ntfs file system to store files over 4GB.<br/><br/>I started out looking at 128 and 256GB usb thumb drives. Our family has plowed through prior 128GB thumb drives and it was time for something bigger. The price for these 1TB portable drives was very close to the prices for 256GB thumb drives and we don't need something small anyway. In fact I am still looking for my teeny, tiny, thin 64GB silver usb drive that had some important files on it. I am slowly beginning to accept that I will never find it and a gnat probably inhaled it off my coffee table or an ant carried it off to its nest to use as a table for the winter feast.<br/><br/>After realizing I could get another 700GB of storage for about the cost of a 256GB thumb drive my next dilemma was which of the 3 versions of the Silicon Power 1TB portable to get: somewhat buff &amp; water resistant, burly &amp; water proof-ish, or rugged and impervious to H20 for protracted submersion times. For the few dollars more (around $4 more for each better model at time of purchase) I thought I better get the ruggedest, water-tightest version, knowing my tendencies toward extreme clutzery. Maybe you aren't a clutz like (good for you!), but I bet you know someone who is that might touch or be in proximity to your new portable hard drive. Buy the more rugged version if only to save yourself from listening to them apologize to you for months on end.<br/><br/>So far I have used the first drive to back up many GB of Steam games that I hope to never have to waste precious bandwidth downloading for the kids again and dragged the other drive off to back up a friend's old hard drive on his server before switching out for a new hard drive. Both are working great so far and loving the flexibility, size, and convenience they offer. Transfer speeds are acceptable, but I wouldn't describe them as lightening fast by any stretch of the imagination. Still, a helluva deal.</span>
