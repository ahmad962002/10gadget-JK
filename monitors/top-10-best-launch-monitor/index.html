<span>I wanted to like it, but just could not. I bought it to gap my new wedges but it was so wildly inaccurate I could not trust it.<br/><br/>The software and presentation are great. The way it presents club specific data is awesome (let’s you cull the outlier shots too). The video playback is awesome. But where it goes wrong is it appears to look at about 10-15 yards of ball flight and then extrapolates flight path and distance.  I have a very hall ball flight and maybe that threw it off, tended to show a too short distance, and way less draw/fade. Some range sessions were just a bit off, others wildly off but setup all the same.<br/><br/>I mostly used it at the range, but my eye was way more accurate than this (flags every 50 yards). I tried it indoors on the net and the few shots it managed to pick up just couldn’t be trusted (although I gave it a mulligan here because of poor lighting).<br/><br/>After a few weeks this became an expensive tripod. Exchanged it for a $10 tripod, used the rest for lessons.</span>

<span>I am new to the sport and struggle to understand the true distance of my clubs and identify "faults" such as sliding in my backswing. This device tracks shot statistics and provides useful video real time to aid in the learning process.  I wish they had an android version but works really, really well.</span>

<span>Been looking for a launch monitor to bring to the range for a few months.  Finally decided on the Rapsodo based on the online reviews and comparisons to alternatives.  Have had it a few weeks and I absolutely love it.  Set up was incredibly easy.  Brought it to the range first day, worked flawlessly.  It will miss a shot every now and then, mainly if you hit a very low shot.  I'd say it's accurate to within 5 yards for sure based on comparing to a handheld scope GPS.  5 yards is the worst case I've found on a few shots.  Most shots are almost right on.<br/>The golf ball path on the video is great, the software for the app works really well and is intuitive.<br/>The 1 thing I was a bit confused about was lining up the direction you are hitting on the GPS, I then realized it was orienting on the front camera, which is the one you use.  Common sense I guess but was not sure how I was supposed to set that as instruction was minimal.</span>

<span>Honestly I didn't think any of these types of devices would be worth the money they cost, oh how I was wrong!!<br/><br/>I bought the Rapsodo MLM in December and have since then hit over 1200 golf balls with it.  The majority of the balls were hit into the net in my garage and a few on the range.  It's winter so fairly cold in the midwest.<br/><br/>This thing is amazing to say the least.  I can walk into my garage, turn it on, load the app and will be hitting balls within minutes.  I am lucky enough to have just over the recommended distances in my garage for the device and the net.  It seems like 95% of the time it registers the shot, there are a few here and there that it won't pick up, but usually those are super high with my lob wedge or a hosel rocket that I probably don't want it picking up anyways.<br/><br/>As for accuracy, it seems pretty good.  Having played golf for 25 years, I have a very good idea of how far my clubs go depending on the swing I make.  I do kinda wish it had spin rate, but from what I understand about the same priced launch monitors they are just trying to extrapolate the data and aren't really true spin rate anyways.  I guess I'm ok not knowing a guess at what the spin was and it could be completely wrong.<br/><br/>The Rapsodo MLM picks up the good and the bad shots, even the ones where I miss the net entirely and have to duck and cover with the ball hitting the garage door, ricocheting back at me.  They make for some quite hilarious videos to send friends and family.  Plus the ones where I absolutely blast a shot and want to brag.  The beauty of the video is I can see exactly what my swing looks like on a good or bad shot, shows me what works and doesn't, how the shot shape is based on the swing I make.  Doesn't get much better than that.  How else do you improve if you can't see the data along with the video evidence?<br/><br/>Not to say there aren't some things they can improve.  The first would be to add Android support.  I am lucky enough to have an iPhone laying around the house I can use for this, but others are not and could be a huge drawback or a reason to not buy it.  The other is spin rate like I said before, but I want true spin rate, if possible.  I guess I would probably settle for some extrapolation if I knew that it was a "good guess" so I know if a driver is flaring because of spin.<br/><br/>All in all, this thing is great and will continue to use it even when it does get warm enough for me to go to the actual range, it will just come with me.</span>

A truly portable and affordable launch monitor designed to provide golfers with complete swing and ball flight metrics found in professional launch monitors. By popular demand, we have kept all of the features from Swing Caddie SC200 and added an additional Practice Swing Mode. This new Practice Swing Mode allows golfers to get their swing speed numbers without hitting a ball. Golfers now have the ability to work on improving their clubhead speed even if they don’t have access to a driving range or hitting net. Using the latest in Doppler Radar Technology, and calibrating atmospheric pressure sensors, the SC200 Plus provides uncompromised precision. Integrating voice output of distance, the SC200 Plus provides the highest levels of user convenience

<span>I  needed something to let me know what my swing speed was as well as contact quality with the ball.  The added benefit of seeing total yards vs. carry yards is really helping my game.  I am finally able to see progress with my swing changes and correct issues.  Before I was just guessing.  I also love being able to set it up on the course and the range quickly.  It is amazing to get actual feedback during rounds.  I primarily use it on my home hitting mat/net setup which allows me to practice more without allowing bad habits to ruin my next round.  I am able to hit greens again thanks to the approach practice.  It has helped me get feel back into my wedges and know what my yardage is going to be.  I would have to play golf 4 times a week to get this kind of feedback in my practice.  I've owned this for about a month now. Even though my scores are not showing it due to poor putting, my accuracy and consistency is heading in a positive direction.  I know my yardages again.  I really wanted to get something with more bells and whistles so that I could use it as a simulator someday.  As far as I am concerned the simulator can wait.  The simplicity of this device is what I love the most.  Hardly any setup necessary unless you need to adjust the club loft angles for your clubs.  It is also nice to know your averages.  I am hitting more greens by that knowledge alone. I was constantly hitting short because I  "felt" like I could hit my irons farther.  Now I select clubs for my average distance because I know what it is. Huge game changer.</span>

Unfortunately the unit fails to register 30% of the time and I do not believe the readings on practice speeds are accurate especially on the driver.

<span>I've used the SwingCaddie SC300 for 5 or 6 practice sessions and I'm kind of on the fence about whether it was worth the purchase.  I like having the data, the monitor shows a pretty smooth distance average across my clubs.  Measurement of swing speed is probably the most consistent feature, and it definitely can tell when I've mishit the ball.  The other measurements on mishits can be a little random - it isn't going 200 yards when I shank it off the hosel.  Distances on mid irons seem to be pretty close to spot on, but I think it is overestimating distance on my 4-iron and hybrids.  The Apex Height measurement seems pretty inaccurate but I can't really say by how much without running it side by side with a higher-end monitor.<br/><br/>One thing I really don't like is the syncing.  I just lost an entire session because the app seemed to sync my data from the monitor, then asked for me to sync again, then froze.  When I got back into the app, all the data was gone.  I much prefer to sync all the data after the session - I have no need to take out my phone and look at the data as I go when the SC300 has such a nice, easy to read display.  But now I'm nervous that I could lose all my data for a session at random.<br/><br/>The best use I've found for it is that it has made me very aware of which clubs I have the most variability on in distance, giving me a good target for focus for my practice time.  It picks up most shots and works well at the range and into an outdoor net, as long as you have the monitor set on a level surface and it isn't angled incorrectly.</span>

<span>The honest truth is that when it works, it works great. The trouble is that I only get a reading half of the time. The rest of the time, it doesn't register. I've avoided posting a review until I used it for several months. Now, I feel sure that my results are true and correct. When this device was engineered, they needed to include a simple method (like a laser pointer) to indicate when the ball is in the precise spot or range. I've tried marking the spot and it just doesn't seem to help all that much. Others may have a better experience, but at this price, i'm just not very satisfied. I will probably sell it.</span>

<span>Really cool concept that just doesn't deliver enough accuracy to be useful.<br/><br/>I'm a 11 handycap and know my distance pretty well already. I have been to the range several times with the sc300 and have carefully set it up per instructions (club lofts customized and distance and height alignment exactly as directed in the manual) but never can get it to be accurate enough to make it worth it.<br/><br/>For example, I hit 20, 50 deg gap wedges and measured the shots with a laser and it was only accurate about half the time. The rest of the time, it was reporting 5 to as much as 20 yards short of actual. I normally hit that club 115 to 122 yards and it would constantly report carry yardage of 95-100 when the ball was dropping in at 115+ as measured with a laser. The final straw was when I pured a shot that flew 123 yards and I looked down and the sc300 said, 95. I understand this isn't a $2200 track man or $20k gc quad and I was willing to accept some margin of error but 27 yards off with a wedge is too much.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love it this thing, I almost kept it anyway but for $550 it just doesn't work well enough and I had to return it</span>

<span>I have had the SC300 for several weeks.  I used it outside a little but mostly have been hitting into a net in my basement.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I really like the way it announces yardage so you don't have to look at the screen.  Seems pretty accurate but more importantly, it is consistent.  You can clearly tell if you hit a good shot or a poor one.<br/><br/>If they put some effort into improving the APP, I would give it more stars.  The APP organizes data well enough  but wish there was a way to delete garbage shots or identify shots being taken by a friend.  The ability to export shot data to excel would be a big plus.</span>

The ES16 Tour does what no other launch monitor has done before: combine Doppler radar and photometric tracking technology in one. With this revolutionary design, the ES16 Tour delivers more direct measurements and provides the most precise club and ball data available. Doppler is the most accurate technology for speed measurements, while camera technology excels in spin and directional measurements. Ernest Sports has gone outside the box by developing the world’s first hybrid launch monitor utilizing both of these technologies. The ES16 Tour connects to the free Ernest Sports app to provide additional shot data. It allows the user to select their distance to the pin and see live ball flight while additional graphs show ball flight from an aerial and lateral perspective. Analyze your range session by viewing club averages, shot dispersion, shot shape and individual shot statistics. Save your range sessions by user to keep your data separate from your friends, and watch your game improve over time. In addition to the Ernest Sports app, the ES16 is compatible with full golf simulation from The Golf Club, E6 and Perfect Parallel. With 3 great simulation options and well over 100,000 courses to play (including some of the most famous in the world!) the ES16 will always provide the next challenge to keep you and your golf game improving. Increase the length of your golf season by playing an 18-hole course from the comfort of your own home any time of the year.

<span>I'll update this once I've done more testing. I hit about 80 balls at the range with it today. I was so excited to get it that I was waiting at the door for USPS to show up like a little kid. I got it, setup my lofts for my PXGs, and got in my golf cart and headed to the range. I live in a golf course community. I immediately started hitting my 7 iron. I carry my 7 iron 165-170 and that's measured with laser. The best distance I could show in carry on the SC200 was 150 and I could see my ball flying 10-15 yards over the 150. Since nobody was on the range, I took my cart out to the 150 and about 15 yards past it and hit back toward the tee box. I was landing balls on the tee box. Yes, there was no wind and I setup the monitor and it was showing in the 130s and 140s when I was landing it 165-170. I used my laser to ensure the 150 marker was 150 yards from the middle of the tee box in case you're thinking my yardage was off.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to try it some more tomorrow. I'll also go out on course, measure distance to the pins with my laser, and test it. If it's consistent at least, I can adjust for the inaccuracy. But, if it's all over the board, no way. I will update the review after more testing.<br/><br/>I'm a 5 handicap BTW.</span>

<span>Lobe it!  When it comes to my golf game . . . This is the best device I have ever owned.  The instant feedback is accurate and remarkable.

I have use the device to work on and improve my club head speed with really good results in that area of my game as well.  I have also increased my distance by about 8 to 10 yards across the board, but my best improvement has been in my driving distance.  I am 68 years old and have improved my driving distance from about 230 yards to an average 256 yard drive at present. It's like anything else in life, if you want to improve your golf game, use those tools that help you improve your game through routine use in association with your range time, and your real time golf experiences.  I will continue to use this every time I am on the range, and now that I have this portion of my game at least measurable and under close watch through the continued use of my Voice Caddie 2, I now need to focus on my short game . . . Looking forward to reducing my handicap even further . . .Thanks Voice Caddie 2 . . .</span>

<span>VoiceCaddie 200 launch monitor purchased on Amazon Dec 2018.  Have been well supported with couple of hardware issues on the VC200 by this company.  They have been responsive to my emails to support (reply within a couple days), and they were able to identify correct  replacement remote when my original one failed after 3 years (had to purchase remote for $20 as original out of warranty, but just thrilled to have my original $289 investment in the VC200 still working and providing good data).  The VC200 has provided accurate enough data and helps me practice better, play better.  I would buy VoiceCaddie again based on my experience so far.</span>

Product Description    Perfect for indoor or outdoor use The radar device captures both golf and baseball swing speeds Optimize your golf or baseball swingWhether a novice or professional, the Swing Speed Radar from Sports Sensors will help you maximize your distance and control to take your game to the next level. A valuable aid for players of all ages and skill levels, the Swing Speed Radar is a powerful tool for coaches and instructors everywhere. "It's not how hard you swing, but how well you swing.”The Swing Speed Radar is a small microwave Doppler radar velocity sensor that measures the swing speed of golfers and baseball/softball players. However, over-swinging can produce poor results. The Swing Speed Radar helps you improve both metrics by measuring your swing speed, determining the best speed for optimum performance, monitoring your swing consistency, and selecting the club or bat characteristics that best suit your swing type. Golfers can use the device to determine the optimum swing for distance, control, and accuracy, while baseball/softball players can work on honing their bat speed to create consistently solid contact. The Swing Speed Radar's real-time velocity feedback helps players and coaches measure improvements and troubleshoot swing mechanics. Instructions for Best ResultsTo measure golf swing speed, merely position the Swing Speed Radar in a forward location about 8 to 10 inches directly away from the tee. In baseball or softball applications, meanwhile, you can hang the device on a batting cage, pop-up net, or fence, or mount it on a tripod about 5 feet in front of or behind the player while he or she swings in the air or hits off a tee. By locating the Swing Speed Radar at a height that corresponds to the plane of the bat swing, the bat speed is measured "out front" of the batter in the hitting zone, which is where contact with the ball produces the best results. Put another way, the device measure the speed of the barrel of the bat, not the tip. This makes the Swing Speed Radar a great tool for helping you select the optimum bat size and weight for your swing.What’s in the Box?Your purchase includes a nylon drawstring pouch for carrying your Swing Speed Radar and two snap hooks for attaching it to your equipment bag or hanging from a net for bat speed measurements. Care of Your Swing Speed RadarThe Swing Speed Radar is a unique electronics product intended for training and practice situations. Although the rugged design will withstand the rigors of normal use, it should be protected from golf club, bat and ball impacts; should not be dropped or thrown; or exposed to precipitation, or immersed in water or other liquids. Do not use or leave outdoors during inclement weather. Store the Swing Speed Radar in typical in-house environments, avoiding excessive temperature extremes, humidity, dust and dirt. The Swing Speed Radar can be cleaned with a slightly damped, soft cloth. Do not use alcohol, solvents, or chemical cleaners which can cause permanent damage.

<span>The product worked perfect right out of the box, it was so simple to use a monkey could use it. After using it some last summer (2021), I hurt my back from playing golf too much--talk about bad timing. A year later I tried to use the unit again after my back had completely healed, and it seemed to not be working correctly for whatever reason (I admit it was likely my fault). I called the company directly and talked to Mike and within minutes he resolved the issue and sent me a brand new device. This is undoubtedly the best, most efficient customer service I've ever experienced. I personally don't believe the few reviews saying the customer service is poor, it was the exact opposite experience for me, they stand by their product. DO NOT HESITATE TO PURCHASE THIS RADAR. It works very well, and if a problem arises, Sports Sensors Inc. will take care of it. I'm still dumbfounded that they replaced the product with a brand new device months after their warranty expired--unheard of customer service in this day and age.</span>

<span>Edit: contrary to what I say below, a flashing number on display indicates a reading at same value as last swing.  E.g. two readings of 80mph in a row…<br/><br/>After two months of use, I can say that this is hands-down the best golf training aid I have ever purchased, and probably the best $110 I have spent in over four decades playing this silly game.  I have seen a dramatic increase in my swing speed for almost all my clubs, with a significant improvement in both distance and trajectory at range practice and on the course.<br/><br/>First off, this thing is incredibly easy to use.  Turn it on, verify it is in correct mode, and swing away.  If it gets enough data to process, it will instantly display your swing speed.  If not, you will see your last valid speed flashing.  The unit will automatically turn itself off after several minutes of inactivity.  I have not changed the batteries yet, so power consumption appears very good.<br/><br/>Now for the results.  When I first purchased, I spent the afternoon at my home hitting station (a home-built frame with a net and a mat) baselining all my clubs PW through driver.  My initial numbers were... less than impressive.  My PW was in the mid 60s.  My 7i was low-to-mid 70s.  Ouch.  Driver was mid 80s.  I have no idea whether these are accurate speeds, as I have not compared against a Trackman or other high-end launch monitor.  However, given a little internet research, my known distances seemed to match the numbers I was getting, e.g. 135-140 yards for 7i.  My game distances should have given me a clue, but it was still a kick in the front of my pants to see these kind of numbers.<br/><br/>So I spent the next several weeks experimenting with different aspects of my swing... relaxed grip, wide full backswing, coil against stable lower body, feeling club load at the top, improved timing of weight shift through transition, etc.  I saw incremental improvement.  My most recent numbers are vastly improved, in some cases 25% or more.  My PW is now registering an average 80mph.  My 7i average is now high 80s, and will sometimes stay in the 90+ range for extended periods when I am hitting well.  I will reiterate that these may not be absolute numbers, but I believe they are a good relative indicator of progress.  I am far from perfect, and will sometimes see my speeds regress significantly.  But never to the point that they were, and I am always able to recover to my averages by systematically working through the checklist of things I believe through trial-and-error are contributing to higher club head speed.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed: I seemed to get a dramatic increase in speed (10% or more) almost instantly at some point during my swing evolution with each of my clubs, but at different times.  My theory is that that is where I was able to improve my technique to the point where I was able to get each shaft past its working threshold, where it was finally able to really contribute to my swing speed.  Until then, I might as well have been swinging a lead pipe for all the help I got from the shaft.  Just a theory.<br/><br/>The one exception to my success story has been my driver, where I still feel I am unable to isolate key factors to help me improve.  My average has risen to 92, so still close to a 10% increase.  Just not what I believe I am really capable of, and seemingly very low relative to my iron numbers.  Oh well.  Something to continue working on.  Maybe I just haven't gotten to the point where I am working the shaft.<br/><br/>On the range and course, my distances have gone up significantly, and my trajectories are far more piercing than the symmetrical ballistic arcs I used to hit.  If anything, my accuracy has improved.  So no downside that I can see.<br/><br/>For consistency and apples-to-apples comparisons from one day to the next, be sure to set the unit up the same way every time.  I set it up at a 45 degree angle to target line, directly opposite and 10" outside of the ball.  I seem to get larger/smaller numbers if I move the unit significantly closer to or further away from the ball.<br/><br/>You will occasionally get a flashing display after a swing, which means the unit knew a swing event occurred, but did not have enough data to process into a swing speed.  This happens to me about 10-15% of the time.  More than I would like, but a small price to pay for such technology in a very affordable unit.<br/><br/>I rarely see what I consider to be rogue numbers that others have mentioned.  E.g. a 158 for a driver, or something else obviously incorrect.  Even the highest (and lowest) numbers I see are well within the realm of possibility.  Still, I typically take 12-14 swings when I am capturing averages, and throw out the highest and lowest one or two to get an even 10 swings.<br/><br/>Not sure if my results are typical.  I am in good shape and very flexible for my age, but have struggled with horrid mechanics.  So I may just be in the small population that can most benefit from the type of empirical feedback that a tool like this provides.  If you already have a fairly sound swing, you may already be tapping more of your potential, and will likely not see the same improvement.</span>
