<span>This is exactly what I needed for work. Easy to use and set up and the images are clear. I like it a lot and am thinking about getting another one when I have more space.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Excellent monitor!  Just upgraded from an LG 1080p 60hz IPS panel to this one and the difference is clear.  Images/text on screen is much sharper and I can tell movement with the mouse cursor on the desktop is much smoother.  I set the display scale to 125%, which now matches with my older 1080p monitor at 100%, otherwise text and desktop apps are just too small for my taste.  You can really get an idea of smoothness during gaming.  I play games where high FPS is preferred.  Currently playing Halo Infinite on older hardware (GTX 1660 ti) but enough that I get about 70-72fps on medium graphics settings.  Even with that, and response time set to 'fast' I can already tell the difference in smoothness of gameplay compared to my old monitor.  And I should mention the obvious jump in visual clarity is instantly noticeable!  Just be sure your graphics card AND CPU can handle 1440p and produce high framerates especially for graphically intensive games. I noticed that in-between games my web browsing has slowed substantially due to CPU bottleneck while using this monitor (again just a limitation caused by older hardware).  The joystick style menu control and layout is simple and easy to operate.  This monitor even comes with an HDMI cable AND a DisplayPort 1.4 cable! Got mine for $280 and at this price point you really can't go wrong with this monitor.</span>

<span>Disclaimer for fair context here:<br/><br/>This is my first true 144hz, 1440p, IPS panel experience. Up until now, I've only ever had descriptions and seen photos (on less than ideal monitors) of what to expect. So my review here may almost certainly be biased in terms of extremes for both pros and cons.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, let me just say.. wow, being my first experience with an IPS, I was absolutely blown away with just how much the colors explode off the screen compared to a TN panel. You get used to it very quickly but you definitely have those moments where you're just like "Damn, that looks really good."<br/><br/>The exact same can be said about the refresh rate. If you're coming from 60hz, the difference is absolutely staggering. It's noticeable the moment you slide the cursor across the screen. It'll give you goosebumps at first. And again, it's something you'll get used to very quickly but will repeatedly be reminded of how smooth any and all motion appears at the most seemingly benign places. Especially with Windows 10 and it's very quick but subtle flow to almost any menu and interaction. Simply opening up the start menu or action center will just appear to glide in as though it was never on the screen but just floating above it.<br/><br/>And finally the jump from 1080p to 1440p was much nicer than I had anticipated. My mind knew it was a half way mark between 1080 and 4K but my expectations were more inline with something more subtle. Nope. You're getting a massive upgrade in pixels here. The best thing about 1440p is that it truly is a half way sweet spot between 1080p performance and 4K sharpness when talking about gaming. The amount of extra power needed isn't insignificant, you will notice a loss in performance, however if you're rocking an RTX 2070 or equivalent GPU, it's safe to say that while you might not always get the best out of its 144hz refresh rate, you'll almost certainly exceed the 60hz you're probably accustomed to and it really does make a huge difference. 60fps just doesn't feel like a good performance anymore. It feels like what 30fps felt like on a 60hz monitor.<br/><br/>Of course it's also worth mentioning a few "buts" now.<br/><br/>The G-Sync on this thing is incredible. I can finally turn off vsync and not get those incredibly distracting screen tears which I'm unlucky enough to be very sensitive to. However it's worth noting that this is NOT a G-Sync monitor. It does not have the proper hardware to support G-Sync at its best. It's G-Sync compatible. Which is to say, it was built for FreeSync but after Nvidias driver update opened G-Sync to FreeSync monitors, this monitor was able to pass the certification process and be sold as being compatible with G-Sync with no real issues. The problem with this might seem nuance but it's worth mentioning. G-Sync will NOT work at framerates lower than 40fps. Once you drop below that, you'll start noticing screen tearing as the monitor doesn't have the hardware to stay in sync with the GPU at lower refresh rates. Not a deal breaker but just something to keep in mind. If you're still rocking older hardware, you might be lowering settings to accommodate the higher resolution at G-Sync speeds or resorting to turning vsync back on.<br/><br/>Finally there's the IPS glow. It's there. It's absolutely there. It's both not as bad and worse than I expected but it's well within tolerance as I quickly get sucked into what I'm doing and stop noticing it. Unlike backlight bleed, IPS glow shifts around the screen based on your relative position and angle. It's easy to adjust the monitor in such a way that it's a minimal issue but due to the size of the display, it's impossible to sit at any position or angle and not see some IPS glow somewhere. Usually in the top corners as tilting the monitor up seems to offer the least about of glow.<br/><br/>How much this bothers you it's going to heavily depend on what kind of content you'll be playing. Darker colors show IPS glow much more than brighter scenes. So brighter games like Spyro will hide it almost entirely, but darker games like Control can be real hit or miss and if you're not used to it yet, probably annoying. But it's a small price to pay for the kind of color you get over TN monitors.</span>

In the past couple of years I realize resolutions have gotten better than what this one has, but for the price and functionality as a work computer, I am very excited to add a second one to make a 3 monitor setup for increased productivity at work.

<span>This was bought for our son for virtual school. Its an excellent monitor in its own right, very clear, bright and detailed. It also has a wonderful stand that's easy to attach the monitor to.  No screws a simple latch mechanism secures it in place. The monitor has a very easy height adjustment too. Which is important for use with a chile. The on board camera is superb, and has a large green LED to indicate when in use. The speaker are fine, a little bit louder than the Laptop he uses, but much better sound and definition.  We use Blue YETI microphone so can't comment on the microphone.  For our application this monitors is A+. I did have some trouble with it out of the box. It would not come on, until I touched the exit button on the programming keys on the back right hand side of the monitor. This seemed like may be an error in set up from the factory as I have not seen this problem since.  I was worried that 24" would not be very large as his laptop screen is 15.6". After research I found that this is actually 50+% larger.  For my elementary school student this is large enough for him, and not too large where he loses things. The blue tint at night is a useful touch as well for his application. Overall highly recommended, very glad I purchased this Acer monitor.</span>

<span>I am confused by the pricing on this. The Samsung models are very simple, S60, S70, S80 etc.  The higher the number the better the quality.  UHD has more pixel density than WQHD, for example.  So why is this monitor, the S60 at just over 100 PPI, priced higher than the S80 with about 160 PPI. Does it make a difference?  Yes! It really does. This is a good monitor for what it is, but the price should start with a 2 and not a 3.  Go for this monitor if you are not a stickler for image quality and you need a nice budget monitor. If you need any level of image quality, skip this and go for the S80 UHD 4k. No matter which monitor you go with, Samsung monitors come very dim out of the box. To fix this, you need to adjust TWO settings in the monitor system setting menu.  Eco and Eco plus need to be turned off.  Also download a secondary app for your computer so your keyboard or screen shortcut can adjust the monitor brightness without digging into the monitors menu tree.</span>

<span>I recently got a new Macbook Pro and set it up in front of my older Samsung monitor. The difference was striking. The Macbook Pro monitor was twice as bright, the colors were much more vivid, and the resolution was much better. I thought - time to upgrade my old monitor! So I bought this.<br/><br/>First discovery - it's no brighter than my old monitor from 12 years ago. Second - via HDMI, the resolution is limited to 1080p. Which is okay, because I like that resolution - but it's blurrier at that resolution because it's made for 2540x1440. I thought the increased pixel density might cause it to be clearer. Third, when it turns on, it complains via a monitor pop-up that it should be set to 2540x1440 at 75Hz. It turns out my older mac minis (2010-2012) are limited to 60Hz, so I'd have to live with that message every time I turned it on. It appears to only accept 2540x1440 resolution on the Display Port.<br/><br/>This is probably a great monitor if you want 2540x1440 and can output at 75Hz. But it still pales in comparison (in every way) to Apple's retina displays.</span>

<span>I've used iMacs for years and this year Apple stopped making the 27-inch iMac - of course, right when I had to replace mine. I bought the Mac Studio which needs a monitor vs the all-in-one of the iMac. I couldn't afford the Apple monitor so I researched what models/brands would be a good substitute. I don't think this is quite as good as the Apple monitor but it's close enough for me (there are some Samsung monitors that supposedly are as good or better than the Apple one). I've had trouble buying monitors for Mac computers in the past - they never were as crisp and clear as the iMac. This one is VERY crisp and clear. And works flawlessly with the computer. I do wish it had built in speakers but I can live with having external ones. The USB ports on the back are also super handy since the Mac Studio seems to think you only need two. I definitely recommend this monitor!</span>

<span>The 16" , 1366 x 768 USB monitor (AOC e1659Fwu) has been great for years now. It is thin, included a neoprene sleeve cover and the stand works well. I HIGHLY recommend these monitors as when I go to site for service or travel for work, I have a second screen to allow active work on one screen, a procedure, email or remote screen on the other.... whatever. This monitor has lower resolution, so I have to shrink some things to fit or move them around. Windows allows reduction on this extended screen too. The AOC monitor displays pictures, text and movies perfectly.<br/><br/>So, I purchased the AOC I1659FWUX 15.6", 1920 x 1080 HD USB monitor to replace it (I use the original on my personal laptop now) and fit more on the screen though slightly smaller physically. My laptop is 15.6" and both fit in the laptop bag side by side. I never travel for work without the monitor with me. This model has a USB A to USB A 3.0 cable and is not as delicate as the one I described above, though I am adding my hooks to protect it anyway.  It works well with a USB A to USB C adapter. Great picture with HD resolution.<br/><br/>The negatives.<br/>* The neoprene sleeve, though soft, provides NO protection from impact to the screen in transport. Many complaints about that. I use the original cardboard sheet sized the same as the monitor from the original box over the screen in the sleeve. I am creating something a little better abrasion free.<br/>I use this in hotels and in computer rooms, so it does get moved around a lot, pulled out and put away.<br/>* The USB cable. You can use USB C or USB A (USB 3.0) for laptop/PC end. The included cable is stiff and I replaced it with more flexible and shorter (2ft) fabric sleeved cables to carry (USB A and USB C ends for laptop). Amazon has tons of options here. I posted a pic of the micro USB male charging cable used for the monitor interface on the 16" model. The 15.6" model uses a standard USB A male connecter at the back.<br/>* The connector on the monitor. Everyone's biggest complaint as there is no protection from pulling the cable out sideways and damaging the interface connector. I posted pics of a simple solution I created using small 3M Command stick-on hooks. I can weave the cable around the three hooks, then slide it into the connector. Removes ALL of the stress from side movement and saves the monitor from the recycler or trash. Easy to remove. Allows movement without worry. Anything like a velcro strap or a clip fastened to the back to prevent pulling out will work.<br/><br/>The negatives are easy and inexpensive to fix to prevent damage.<br/>Do NOT let these issues prevent considering the purchase of these monitors. The cardboard comes with the package, the 3M hooks cheap and the flexible, shorter cable, under $8 from Amazon and years of trouble-free use. An excellent option with AOC reliability.<br/><br/>I gave 4 stars instead of 5 ONLY for having to do things to prevent damage that should have been considered in the design and testing of these really great monitors.<br/><br/>11/7/22. I had to update to 5 stars as I just can't get around using either of the monitors and have been undeniably reliable despite the negatives. Take the precautions I outlined and a long useful life is expected. I have one for each personal and work use and don't go anywhere without them. Recommended to friends who have purchased too. The newest one in HD has been OUTSTANDING.</span>

<span>Sooooooo. where to start. First of it took me a good few hours of Googling to get this working. And you can get it working with a lot of research but I'm going to save you some trouble hopefully. For reference, I'm using Mac OS Mojave 10.14.6<br/><br/>Before we talk about the driver you need, despite the AOC website saying you don't need drivers if you have a Mac you will, Let's talk about the USB situation. So it comes with a split USB cord.  There's a super short USB cord and a longer one that splits off. If your Mac is fairly recent it should be able to run off of one cable. My Laptop is a mid-2015 and it's able to be powered by one USB cable. So I have the single side plugged into the monitor and the split side connected to a USB hub. I found that this USB hub works wonderfully with this monitor - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G8CMR18?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details if you're in need of more usb ports. This usb hub connects to your computer as well so you can use this monitor, a wireless mouse, even a phone(for itunes) with it. But if you connect it straight to your computer it should work fine.<br/><br/>If you have your monitor set up it looks like it's turning on you see the AOC logo or you see an icon telling you to connect to your computer here's what's going on. If you see the icon with a usb logo it means that it's getting enough power but it's not able to sense the connection to your computer. Try another port. I have one port on my laptop that does work and the other doesn't. Go figure. If the AOC logo flashes on it may need more power or you may need to install the correct drivers. Now I didn't find the correct drivers on the AOC website but down the rabbit hole I was able to find out the type of driver you need to get this to work is from DisplayLink. They regularly update their drivers so google it and bookmark it. I can't post the link here but if you google it you should be able to find it. Make sure you are installing the correct one for your OS. Also, they have an excellent walkthrough on this website as far as making sure your computer will accept an application that's not an authorized Apple vendor. It's very involved. But after playing around with it, it should work.<br/><br/>There is a problem with the monitor blacking out now and then it's happened to me. During and 8 hour day it'll flicker on and off three times throughout the day and usually the fourth time it won't come back on. I unplug and plug it back in and it's good to go. DisplayLink is aware of this and is working on a driver to fix that so keep an eye out for it if you're having this problem.<br/><br/>The quality of the monitor isn't great it's a bit pixalated. If you're using a Mac Retina display laptop you're going to notice a drastic difference. I wouldn't use this for graphic design but if you are using this for coding it's perfect. I use it vertically for coding and it's excellent. It's not too big, it doesn't take up much space and it's portable. Four stars for the difficulty of set up and the screen black out issue.</span>

<span>I think a lot of reviewers confuse "portable monitor" with "tablet".  Yes, more recent portable monitors are more damage resistant.  But a lot of the reviews are concerning a device they can throw into their car and drop a shopping bag on top of.<br/><br/>This is one of AOC's first cracks at a portable monitor.  If you keep that in mind and treat it LIKE YOUR DESKTOP monitor, you'll be fine.  Don't load it into a crammed backpack.  If you put it in your car, set it on the floor apart from other items rather than on a seat next to things that can damage it.  It does come with a soft-cover, but it doesn't have a plastic shell plate in the cover to protect from strike damage.  The monitor is larger than I expected, so it doesn't fit a laptop sleeve bag at all.  The soft-cover is a nice accessory included with the device.  It is NOT slim to today's standards, the display is the same average thickness as a Desktop Monitor.  It does come with a built-in kickstand, so no magnetic flaps to worry about holding the display up.  The kickstand has a single detente, with enough give after that to position the display from a 15 to 30 degree angle.  If you go under the detente, it collapses rather easily, so I wouldn't press it.  In fact, it's best to use this on a desk or table, as any three point stand isn't suitable for uneven surfaces.  This isn't something you're going to use on a coach flight.  Let alone a train ride.<br/><br/>I got a monitor new in box, so I didn't have to worry on getting the wrong model.  The resolution is true to size, and I was impressed how clear it is.  The Surface is a high-DPI display, so I ended turning the App/Font size down to 100% on that display to get a useable output (Surface still runs at 150-200% independent of the monitor, so there's some drag-shift when you move a window over.  That isn't a big deal, but it might turn off others expecting the same resolution on both -- it's not going to happen with an older display).  The USB port didn't come out of the factory loose.  The cable it came with is a wedge cable (1 USB-A to 2 USB-As) which I really don't like, but AOC said on the manual you don't have to use both.  The second connector on the wedge is meant to supply more power for older laptops on the early USB 3.0 Standard before Superspeed and 3.1 was released.  For my Surface Tablet, I used it with the charger on (works great) and off (drains the battery a little faster) but I'll probably use this next to a wall plug when I need it anyway.<br/><br/>But the advice from other users is accurate: Windows 10 means auto-pivot stops working (Windows has Portrait/Landscape settings on the Settings panel, this isn't really a big deal.)  DisplayLink drivers are best for a Windows 10 system, so install those first (which is a good idea for any USB Display Adapter, really), and find a DDC program to change brightness and contrast how you like it.  (There are no buttons on the monitor, not even power.  Unplug to turn off.)</span>

<span>I bought this for use as a second monitor when someone else in our household is using our docking station with a full size second monitor.  I have Windows 10 on my work laptops and Windows 11 on my home laptop and tablet.  This monitor works fine with both of them - simply plug and play.  The picture quality is decent considering the price.  I do wish it had a few buttons for adjusting video settings like color and contrast.  I'm sure there is a way to do it with the software they provide, but I haven't taken the time to figure it out.  The quality is good enough out of the box, but If I had an easy way to change it, I'd probably tweak it.  The same goes for the feature that allows you to rotate the monitor to portrait mode - you need to mess around with software for that to work, and I haven't bothered with that yet.<br/><br/>The monitor comes with a USB type A connector which is fine for many laptops and other devices that have type A connectors.  If you have a newer laptop or device that only has the newer type C USC connectors, you'll have to use a USB A to C adapter.  I use an inexpensive one I bought on Amazon and it works fine.<br/><br/>I don't travel with this monitor, so I can't speak to its durability when packed in a tight bag.  The monitor back and frame seems to be very flexible and not particularly rigid or durable like a high end laptop.  That's probably to  be expected in this price range though.  If you're planning to travel I'd recommend either not packing it in an overstuffed bag or else spend a bit extra for a higher end monitor.<br/><br/>For the price range, this is a good basic second monitor.</span>

<span>I use a pen display, which requires the HDMI port of my M1 Mac Mini. When I had an Intel Mini, I also had a 2k and an FHD monitor, giving me three monitors in total. But switching over to the M1, I lost that extra monitor and it really wasn't *that* bad, but I missed having 3 monitors so I could access files without having to do the whole hide-drag-unhide dance.<br/><br/>This monitor solves that problem by giving me what, in essence, is three monitors again. I have my main app on the lower half and my Finder windows on the upper and I can drag between them pretty easily.<br/><br/>But there are issues...<br/><br/>1) This monitor is like have two **21"** 2k monitors. My 2k before was 24", so things are kind of smaller.<br/><br/>2) Because of 1, I set the resolution to 2048x2304 instead of the full 2560x2880 just so things aren't so small. Really wish this monitor was sized as 2 24" 2k monitors.<br/><br/>3) You have one menu bar, and one Dock, which, depending on how you place them, seem so far away from one another. I know you can have two connections so that this monitor acts as two displays, but with an M1, you can't do that.<br/><br/>Love, though, that I can have my Apple TV also hooked up and change it to PBP so I can have the TV and my computer at the same time. Problem with that, though, is that the Mac changes the main display to the 16" pen display, *every time,* and if I want it working like I want, I have to fuss with the Displays preference, *every time.*<br/><br/>Also, I wish this monitor would let me default the HDMI from the Apple TV to the top instead of the bottom.<br/><br/>Still not sure how much I like this monitor, but for day-to-day, the extra space is hard to give up.<br/><br/>Side Note: I ditched their nice Ergo arm for a vertical post VESA, just so I could put the monitor as far back as possible. I like that Ergo arm - it's smooth - but it just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>As for purchasing as Amazon refurb: I got a monitor that was tagged as Amazon's lowest standard, but it is near perfect. There is a small patch of dead pixels on one edge in the shape of someone's finger, but the doesn't bother me. The cables were good, the monitor is good. Surprisingly great quality.</span>

<span>I thought it would be good for coding. To allow me to see the whole file, but not really.<br/><br/>The first days of using the monitor you would realize how much your coding workflow and tools are horizontally oriented. Your IDE will be clunky "as is" and requires a lot of adjustments. 9 times out of 10 I felt more comfortable reconnecting to the ultrawide.<br/><br/>The other problem is the height. There is no good way to position it. You are either craning your neck or sitting higher than normal to see the top of the screen.  But then the bottom of the screen is too far and you have to noticeably look down and lean into the desk to see the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/>The opposite happens if you optimize viewing for the bottom of the screen. The top of the screen becomes too far away and you need to look up, lean in, and extend your neck ever so slightly.<br/><br/>Granted we are talking about millimeters, but this is not required on curved ultrawide. I can scan on the ultrawide without any noticeable effort and my head is not moving around as much as I do when using this screen.<br/><br/>This screen seems like it was created for Windows. Where your active areas (menus and docks) are colocated.  On the mac, your menu bar is at the top. The dock is at the bottom so there is no good way to use this display with the mac. 90% of you need to optimize for top-of-screen viewing because that is where your app menu bar is.<br/><br/>Magnet (screen layout manager) helps a bit.<br/><br/>I tried the dual-up wit two outputs from the mac and enabled top and bottom of the screen layout.  This is probably how it's meant to be used when on the mac. It kinda word, but not optimal, each time I cross the horizontal, I'd trigger the (auto-hidden) dock.<br/><br/>It's been several weeks. I can say I am "used" to it, but it is not a productivity booster as I thought. I still prefer my ultrawide and am more productive on it. The dual up is not used as often as I would like.<br/><br/>As a technological marvel. it is very high quality. The monitor arm, the DPI, and the light weightiness are unbelievable. As a coder monitor, it is not optimal.</span>

<span>I got this because so many web sites these days are designed for cell phones, not computers. A widescreen laptop or desktop monitor just doesn't show enough of many web pages, which have thick borders at the top. Fine for a cell phone, terrible for a widescreen. Especially if you have older eyes and need larger text.<br/><br/>Yes, I know I could flip a standard monitor into a vertical position. But that's a pain, since I wouldn't want to use it that way all the time.<br/><br/>This monitor is just what I needed. I use it as one big screen, though you can use it as two screens. It lets me set my text large, and read web pages without scrolling every couple of lines.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind: you might want to adjust your mouse sensitivity, and/or get a bigger mousepad, since your mouse will be covering a lot of real estate on this monitor.<br/><br/>I docked one star because it has a tendency to go blank, with a "no signal" message. Unplugging it and plugging it back in again fixes it. I think it's probably a driver issue, since I don't have a problem with any of the other monitors connected to the same computer. Happens maybe once every couple of days. Annoying, but nothing I can't live with.</span>

<span>This resets the mind in how a monitor is useful!<br/><br/>I've have a 34" ultra wide for my 'wide' work, excel, etc.<br/><br/>This has became my primary monitor as most other things I'm doing is much more vertical.<br/><br/>Coding, researching, database work, etc.<br/><br/>Watching videos where I can have it above or below my work is also great.<br/><br/>As soon as I set it up, I started imagining buying a second DualUp monitor.  Ergonomically, I'm not sure how I can set ip a second DualUp to work with my first and my ultrawide, and I'm not looking to replace the ultrawide.<br/><br/>But the DualUp changes the thinking in the ergonomics of monitors and how they fit in with your work or play on your system.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!!</span>

<span>I have had this monitor for only one day, and I am not very impressed with it.  The monitor control buttons being in the back where you have to blindly feel for them and just remember which one is which is a terrible design.  All of my other monitors have the buttons under the front edge where they are so much easier to use.<br/><br/>The worst thing MAY be the speakers (but see the last paragraph about the screen flashing on and off) - they are absolute garbage in both sound quality and volume.  Turning up the system setting volume on the monitor does absolutely nothing to increase the sound at any setting above 50%.  What you can hear sounds like a 20-year old laptop sitting on the floor of a school bathroom - tiny, echo-y, and very hard to understand.  I have several other monitors with built-in speakers, and these are by far the worst I have every heard.  The other monitor sitting next to this one sounds absolutely fantastic by comparison.  I have good speakers on my desk, but I was hoping to get rid of them to save some space - no way with this monitor!<br/><br/>The picture quality seems decent - sitting side-by-side with a much older HP monitor of the same size and definition, both displays seem similar in brightness and color accuracy.  But I am quite worried about the reliability.<br/><br/>I set this up yesterday and left it on with the laptop in sleep mode all night - I didn't make any setting adjustments.  This morning the laptop woke fine and the monitor came on as expected, but as soon as I reached around the side of the monitor to find the control buttons, the monitor started flashing on and off, like a light with a loose or broken wire.  When I pulled my hand back, it was fine, but I could not touch the monitor at all without it flashing on and off.  The power light was not going on and off, so it was not that, and I tried changing the input to both HDMI ports with no difference.  Once I opened up the OSD, the flashing stopped as long as the OSD was open, but started again when I hit the Exit button.  After about 15 minutes of playing with the settings, I noticed that the monitor was no longer showing the problems when I touched it.  And it seems to still be working normally about an hour later.  But I am extremely worried about what was causing this issue, and how long it will be before it starts again.  If I wiggle the HDMI cable on the back of the monitor, it sometimes blanks out (but no where near as touchy  as it was in the beginning), so I guess the fault is there and I will have to return the unit.  What a pain.</span>

<span>My old 15 year old HP 24in screen died. This was the replacement. I use this screen to type documents &amp; program. (The other is a Wacom tablet screen for art &amp; photography and the occasional landscape document.)<br/><br/>The screen is bright and easy to use. I played around with the color settings...it's easy to adjust, but since I rarely use it for art &amp; photography, it's not urgent.<br/><br/>I'm not used to the proportions. This reminds me of legal pad size. For 8.5x11 docs, it's a little strange. But it's wonderful for the Python program I'm writing.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it! Good price, too.<br/><br/>(Note: I don't game much. The most would be MS Flight Simulator 2000. I can't tell you about how this would be for games.)</span>

<span>The picture on this monitor is great but I wish the speakers were a bit louder. It just gets on my nerves since I watch a lot of You Tube and some videos are just too low to hear clearly with this monitor. I use a browser volume amplifier and that helps but I really need to get a set of speakers.</span>

<span>Next time I would appreciate if the product was put in a box or something. I live in an apartment and it was left at my door like this all day. Not completely sure if this is a problem for the seller or the post office but someone could’ve seen this and stolen it. Regarding the actual product I’m Overall satisfied with its performance.
