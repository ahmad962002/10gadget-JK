<span>The arms are sturdy and hold on great even to my thin desktop (about 3/8"). I use it to hold a 27" (D2719HGF landscape) and a 24" (Acer, not sure portrait). The clamp mount is secure and wobbles very little. It also allows for movement with a motorized sit-stand desk with no problems. I do wish it went a little farther back though, since now my monitors are right in my face as opposed to before.</span>

<span>UPDATE: Used the chatbot to talk to support, they were very helpful and got the replacement screws and nuts within 2 business days! Very quick turnaround and much appreciated. The screws were a bit difficult to get started by hand but went in quickly after that. Sturdier than I as expecting for the price. Very happy with it so far.<br/><br/>Arrived in a fully intact box, yet is was missing the 3 screws necessary to even begin assembly the mount. Also missing the nuts to hold the screens on once mounted.</span>

<span>I purchased this dual mount about a year ago. Have a 24” monitor and a 27” monitor mounted. Dual mount is holding up well. Haven’t had any issues with monitors tilting or sagging. I move the arms to bring the monitors closer or to move out of my way pretty frequently. It is a good monitor mount and was well worth the price. I would recommend for anyone with monitors 27” or smaller. Any bigger I think it would be to heavy for the arm mounts.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This stand is quite inexpensive but does exactly what I want - get my monitors off my desk and raised up to eye level.  I stand while I work, and I found that I needed just another inch or so of height to get the monitors just perfect, so I just cut a little 1 inch block of wood and put it under the clamp, and voila, perfect height.  It is well-balanced (I was worried it would cause my desk to tip backwards!).  I also got the VESA adapter from this company, and while it looks a bit janky, it does keep my older monitor right in place with no issues.  Highly highly recommend!</span>

<span>I’ve had this screen over 3 years. At first I was skeptical about it being it wasn’t a name brand and the price but I took a gamble. I have no issues getting to the 200Hz range of course paired with a good video card I shouldn’t. I had issues in the beginning but it was my VC firmware. After the update I haven’t had any other issues. I use the DP connection. Ensure you go buy you a good DP cable because cheap ones will not work as intended. I planned on keeping it for 4 years so it is time for me to get rid of it with my new build the end of the year. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a budget screen and knows what they are doing to get the most out of it. If you don’t cheap out on your VC and cable you’ll be fine.</span>

<span>Bought this on impulse during Prime Day 2022.  It's clear, bright and beautiful.  It took me a while to get used to the extra wide, curved design but once I did, I really began to appreciate the new visual perspective with my gaming.  There are quite a few features on it, and it has a nice red backlight.  Decent cable management in the back, and comes with both a tabletop stand and wall-mount option.<br/><br/>The only reason I give it 4/5 starts is the integrated speakers - GREAT feature, but very muffled and loses a lot of dynamic leveling.  It is clear, but since this is designed as a visual appliance and not an audio one, I feel as though the audio aspect of the monitor pales in comparison to other displays that feature integrated audio.  Though, I may be biased considering the LG QLED I also purchased on Prime Day has by far some of the best audio output I've experienced without a home theater setup.<br/><br/>Great investment if you're looking for crisp, clear and relatively affordable gaming display.  Only minor drawback is the audio.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>I received this C960 webcam yesterday. I bought it because it seemed simple to use, looked like great video at 1080p hd, dual speakers, low profile, good price. Since it's a PLUG-N-PLAY, why not put these words first on the user guide so users don't have to figure out what all the documents are for, in addition to indicating on user guide a #5. eMeetLink for Windows/MacOS to learn how to adjust the camera.....ughhh, it was so disappointing to spend over an hour figuring this out only to find out, the webcam installed itself as soon as you plugged it in. One guide had me find the device manager and 'UNINSTALL' the webcam off my laptop, unplug,, then plug it up again......WHY???? On the EMEET website there are 5 downloads for the C960, with a couple of them having ZIP files that I extracted, and some having a different webcam model number on it. THERE IS NO SOFTWARE TO DOWNLOAD TO ADJUST THE WEBCAM. Adjustments, from what I can tell, are in the media app you're using the webcam with.....and that seems limited.<br/>This is my first review of this product. Tomorrow I begin the work week and will be using the webcam, which is why I bought it in the first place. I'll provide a review after using it for this first week. Hopefully I won't have to return it. YES the 90degree view is awesome and/or can be intrusive in a small place. Another issue was the "Quick Start Guide' #4. Mount to tripod......well, why not put optional here. I had to find a YouTube video to figure out how to put on my laptop's screen. This C960 webcam better be worth all the time it took me to figure this out.<br/><br/>10.7.22<br/>Adding to my original review....I used the webcam all week and I received good comments on video/picture quality and microphone. I also used it at night in low light, the image was great, no dullness, no darkness, I almost didn't need to use my video ring. The picture was clear and defined. At this point the only downside is that you can't zoom in. So although you're sitting a foot away, it appears like you're really far back from the camera. It's wide zoom, with from what I can tell, no way to center yourself in the middle of the screen. It looks a bit weird when everyone seems to be in a perfect position, centered in the middle of their screen and I'm sitting so far back....when I'm actually sitting as close as they are. Haven't decided if I'll keep it yet because of this.</span>

<span>I love this webcam. I wanted a new webcam for my PC to be able to video chat with my friends without having to turn on my laptop. I'm super happy I found this one. When reading the reviews before purchasing, people complained about how the lighting changes depending on room lighting, however, I find this to be positive. The camera lighting adjusts really well to the room lighting and you really don't need to have a light on to be able to see things in the camera during the night.<br/>I can't comment on the mic or mic quality as I have a headset and don't use the webcam microphone.<br/>The stand for this webcam was a bit confusing to use at first and I wasn't sure it would be able to stay balanced on top of my monitor but once I got the hang of it, I think it works quite well. I'm happy to say that you can adjust the angle of the camera quite easily without having to take it off your monitor or worrying about it falling. I like that the camera cover requires you to actually touch it the entire time you're opening or closing it because I know the cover won't fall down over the camera accidentally if I don't push it up the whole way. The hinge is stiff but in a positive way. Will buy a second one for my partner once he decides to upgrade his webcam!</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>I use this monitor on a daily basis as a work from home employee and find that it's the "best bang for the buck".  I had bought one over a year ago and believed it to be a good enough monitor to buy a second one to replace my other aged monitor.  The picture quality is good enough for my job functions which includes reading/observing on dark and light backgrounds.  However, at times some text on webpages look fuzzy when they are at 8 point or lower.</span>

(The other is a Wacom tablet screen for art &amp; photography and the occasional landscape document.)<br/><br/>The screen is bright and easy to use. I played around with the color settings...it's easy to adjust, but since I rarely use it for art &amp; photography, it's not urgent.<br/><br/>I'm not used to the proportions. This reminds me of legal pad size. For 8.5x11 docs, it's a little strange. But it's wonderful for the Python program I'm writing.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it! Good price, too.<br/><br/>(Note: I don't game much. The most would be MS Flight Simulator 2000. I can't tell you about how this would be for games.)</span>

<span>I use this for work to display "spreadsheets" with a lot of data - great resolution and response time.  My only  complaint, albeit minor - is that with 2 HDMI inputs, I wish I could easily switch between the active input - the monitor does not recognize the signal so I must manually select and the input buttons are in the back of the monitor - still love it - but folks ( i.e. SCEPTRE), this should be an easily solution... thanks</span>

<span>I bought one of these C24 monitors back in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic for my home office setup.  I had an old desktop with dual monitors that I was using for personal use, so I didn't want to plug up my laptop to those as I needed a different setup to achieve a mental separation from work and play.<br/><br/>The 2020 version of this monitor is a bit different than the 2022 version, now that I have them both mounted side by side.  The most noticeable difference is the bezel, which is thicker on the new screen, though better.  Reason being on the 2020, the bezel stops way short, almost a CM short, of the actual display range.  It's just black screen.  The thin bezel, which a good idea, literally did nothing for the experience due to this dead zone between the viewable display and the bezel.  I measured and the 2022's bezel covers this zone.  That gives it a bit more strength, but not as good of a feel.  It also gets around a bit of the false advertising of a edgeless display.  While the 2020 was pretty edgeless, the display just didn't get all the way to the edge of the screen.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use these for gaming.  If you're a real PC gamer, get a 1ms, 144hz display.  That's far better than these, which on their best day in ideal conditions get 4-10ms and 75hz.  They say they are great for gaming because of course they do, it's for marketing.  But just save up and buy a $300-400 display that is designed to enhance your game play.  Running Age of Empires, sure, this monitor is fine.  Running Apex, CoD, or anything like that would just have tearing and clipping.  Those types of games really need faster refresh rates.<br/><br/>Speakers are straight up garbage...I'd rather they just stop putting speakers in monitors and just give us more edgelessness or invest that in a better power supply or something.  I couldn't care less about monitor speakers when Logi sells speakers that are far better for less than $30.<br/><br/>Another major difference was the addition of a second HDMI port.  The 2020 only has 1, where the 2022 has 2.  I'm not going to be using it, but it's definitely a feature some need when using multiple devices on a single monitor (in lieu of a KVM or something).<br/><br/>The 2020 also had a solid metal stand and mount, versus the 2022 which came with a black plastic stand and mount.  I mounted both to a VESA arm mount, so it's moot for me, but there is most definitely a visual difference as the metal one was silver and stronger.  Probably a cost swap due to them adding another HDMI and making the whole deal cheaper since 2020, when I believed I paid around $125.<br/><br/>The power cable on these are not standard...which kind of makes me mad.  Most monitors have the 2 or 3 prong power cables (like on a TV), which is ideal due to the universal nature of it.  I've got those cables for days around here, and at varying lengths depending on my needs.  These come with a proprietary plug and 3ft cable.  That won't work for a lot of set ups (especially for gamers who might have multi-display setups or a standing desk with a limited plug length).  You could always find another one online somewhere that is the same port and wattage, but why not just use the standard, Sceptre?  You aren't Apple...<br/><br/>The curve of these monitors is a bit of a gimmick as well.  I've got a 34" ultrawide curved by Gigabyte and that thing is most definitely curved.  These are slightly curved, but not enough to really have the effect.<br/><br/>Regardless of any shortcomings, these are $100 monitors that work well and look good for office work.  Definitely recommend for WFH warriors or start ups, as they seem to take a bit of abuse (I've used the 2020 daily, moved it all around my office, and haven't cleaned it much).</span>

<span>Bought 2 to start building a new gaming setup. The screens came in and work really well. The only downside to my order was that one of them wasn't curved but I'm not bothered by it to much to make a huge fuss over it. In the future if I decide to expand to a 3rd monitor I can get another actually curved one and use this one for a completely different reason with no hassle.<br/><br/>Great quality, and easy to set up!</span>

<span>If I had paid 100s of dollars for this monitor then I would be very disappointed. That being said, for the price and my purposes (extra monitor for WFH), this is perfect. It's only slightly larger than my laptop screen, so I am able to use them side by side for extra screen space. I still use my laptop as my primary monitor because it has higher picture quality, but the monitor is perfect for having my calendar up while doing other things, taking notes during meetings, and generally having additional work space. I like that it comes with an HDMI cord and stand. It also came with hardware pieces to wall mount the screen, but no actual wall mount?<br/><br/>What wouldn't I use this for? Anything where you want to have high-quality picture- video games, TV (it would also be a very small TV), creative industry work, etc. I haven't tried the speakers (I just use my laptop speakers) but have seen other reviews stating that the audio quality is not good.<br/><br/>What would I use this for? My basic office job that is centered around basic programs where the visual quality does not matter. For me, this additional monitor was a total steal and I'm loving it.</span>

<span>This is my 2nd gaming PC purchase from Amazon, the first was a different company, and that PC was great too.<br/><br/>This PC has been wonderful. It is a little lacking in RAM, but unless youre running multiple games at once, or some program that really eats up memory, this PC should be substantial enough.<br/><br/>I can run Fortnite on performance mode with low settings at a solid 144 fps, I havent played a lot of other games with it. Youtube and other streaming services run lighting fast, no lags, no issues, everything connects and stays connected.<br/><br/>Ive had this PC for about a year now and have had exactly ZERO issues with it. I dont even recall crashing a single time. The GPU is a good one, not the top of the line, but very good and very reliable.<br/><br/>For the current price point on this PC, you cant beat it. I havent needed CYBERPOWERPCs customer service for anything yet, but for the quality and price of this PC, i dont suspect they would be difficult to deal with.<br/><br/>I would totally recommend this PC to a friend or family member. Youre getting a great deal here and a very fast, powerful, and reliable PC.<br/><br/>Highly reccomend. :) Could not be happier with my purchase.</span>

<span>I had to order this twice; the first one was DOA out of the box. CyberPower tech support was very quick to respond to my call for help and was able to quickly troubleshoot the problem to the motherboard or CPU.<br/>Amazon's response I found a little odd, as they wouldn't ship a replacement, only offering a full refund. Not having a choice, I accepted the refund and got the PC repacked and down to the UPS store before the last truck left for the day.<br/>I immediately ordered another of the same PC and it arrived this afternoon. At the moment, I'm still getting the system configured how I want it, but I must say I'm impressed with both the build quality and the parts used. Everything is from a brand name I recognize -- EVGA graphic card and power supply, CoolerMaster case and fans, ASRock motherboard, Western Digital M.2 NVMe SSD. The only items that weren't third party brand name are the mouse and keyboard, which are CyberPower branded. Even these are better than the normal el-cheapo pieces you find shipped with the big brand PCs.<br/>I also like the little touches, like the no-screws drive rails, the extra zip-ties for neatly routing any cables you may add to the chassis, and even two SATA cables if you decide to add a hard drive or two later.<br/>Another thing I appreciated is almost no bloatware, and what I found I think came from Microsoft and Windows 11. I will mention that the Amazon description for the rig said it came with Windows 10, which I was fine with, not being a Windows 11 fan, but I was instead greeted by the overly smug front end of Windows 11 on start-up. Oh, well.<br/>This is a really nice system, and with all of these standard components, I can do any number of upgrades in the coming years without having to worry about compatibility.<br/>The only whisper of negativity was that one of the front panel fans was making a ticking noise, but once I adjusted a few mounting screws, the sound went away.<br/>Overall, this is an excellent buy (There was a pretty good discount going on at the time of my purchase.) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good middle-of-road gaming PC. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was due to it taking two tries to get a good one.</span>

<span>Picked this gaming PC up for under $1000 (before taxes).  At that price, it's an awesome value.  The graphics card (EVGA single fan three slot), mobo (ASRock), case fans (Cooler Master), and CPU (11th gen Intel i5) together are worth it.  Based on my own experience and reviews, part quality varies.<br/><br/>In my particular rig, there was a 600W Gold Aptevia PSU.  Glad I thought ahead and got an Asus Thor 850W Platinum.  IMHO 750W is the bare minimum these days for headroom, 850W gives you much more wiggle room, 1000W futureproofs you unless you are on the insane bleeding edge of tech.<br/><br/>Stock CPU cooler/fan for me was Deep Cool block-style heatsink+fan combo.  Meh..  Replaced that with a V5 tower cooler.  500GBSSD with no additional storage??  Dropped a WD 10TB gaming HDD in on the cheap.  8GB T-Force DDR4 RAM?  Points for heat spreader and red color for visual appeal...  But 8GB is below today's standards for gaming and overall performance.<br/><br/>That stuff is all icing on the cake.  The biggest deal-breaker for me as an old fart who is used to full towers and expansion options is the absence of expansion bays and proper full height and half height drive options.  Unlike other reviewers, I was fortunate to get the rails for one full-size/mechanical HDD.  It's a snap-in pin-in style rail system from Cooler Master..  and it does the job.  But good luck with any aftermarket anti-vibration mounting kits.  It just won't work.<br/><br/>There is tons of space to work with but it is wasted as an "airflow chamber".  There are no external bays because the three front intake  fans block the way.  Say goodbye to external optical drives, hot-swap bays, digital dashboards, or anything else of the sort.<br/><br/>Another odd choice is forcing the PSU and any additional drives to a bottom compartment.  You're cutting off key components from the airflow in the main chamber.  It's just an odd choice that seems to favor anesthetics.  Due to the odd design choices, the transparent side panel right of the control panel is only a 3/4 view, which detracts from the RGB potential.<br/><br/>That said, this was still the best choice on Amazon and Newegg alike to be used as a baseline for upgrading at the $1000ish price point.  It's a shame they didn't go a few inches and push that value proposition.  We can blame the supply chain issues and semiconductor situation but I think that, at the end of the day, it's just a lazy attempt to improve profit margins.<br/><br/>Now, I haven't tested the rig fully but I am still confident it was more cost-effective than building from scratch.  The EVGA Nvidia 2060 6GB graphics card makes it a very compelling choice so I ain't mad.  Just wish CyberPower went just a little further because they have an opportunity here to take a major market share.  I mean, try getting an Alienware at similar specs for anywhere close to this price point.. it just ain't happening!<br/><br/>So far, I recommend it but be aware of what you get and may have to potentially replace.  Power, memory, and cooling are definitely worthwhile considerations depending on your needs.<br/><br/>Reinforcing the little bad there is: tiny motherboard, no real expansion options, super hot GPU, tons of wasted space...  I added two high-CFM chassis/case fans and a GPU cooler and that's still not quite enough.  I'm not a fan of liquid cooling outside of bleeding edge OC setups so your best bet may be replacing the stock fans, though I will say they are solid CoolerMaster units.<br/><br/>P.S.  My particular build came with the RTX 2060 Super which is even more of a value.  This GPU really performs.  Super pleased, especially considering many reviewers only got the base version of the graphics card.</span>

<span>I have had this camera since Feb and while I do like it, unlike my Kiyo Pro, there is NO auto focus. This amazed me as I just found this out recently. According to Elgato this is a streamer based camera so they removed unneeded functions for streamers. Removing the mic I understand, but it baffles me why they would remove auto focus. I only found this out when taking a proctored exam online and had to show my ID. The Facecam was my main camera I was using. The text was very blurry and made it challenging for them to confirm. So I later tested on my other webcam, and I could see it adjusting the focus. This, in my opinion, is a big miss from Elgato. I think I might just pick up another Razer Kiyo Pro for this reason.</span>

<span>I was hesitant to buy this after reading the reviews about issues updating firmware. I am happy to report that the firmware update process was smooth and I didn't have to contact customer support. I updated from 1.01 to 1.05 without issue. The low light support is really good - it doesn't hit 60 FPS in low light, which is to be expected due to how cameras work, but I am very satisfied with the low light results. Normal lighting is great but the picture seems lightly washed out with my non-pro lighting setup.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this webcam.</span>

<span>For a year and a half, I had used a Logitech c920. My c920 features the Carl Zeiss lens. The c920 served me well and I never had any issues with it. However, I desired a camera that had better image quality. When I noticed the Kiyo Pro on sale for $99, I decided to give it a try. I have not been disappointed. The image quality on the Kiyo Pro is markedly better.<br/><br/>I use the cam strictly with ZOOM. I use a green screen and alternate backgrounds for every meeting. I have excellent lighting and with a little effort have been able to present my image without ghosting which is common with everyone I have seen trying to use a virtual background. The Kiyo Pro makes it even easier to eliminate ghosting. With the Kiyo Pro, I do not even have to light my green screen separately as I did with the c920. I turn on the key lights and hair lamp and that is it. For someone wanting to use a virtual background and green screen, this camera will improve your image and decrease ghosting, however, you will continue to experience ghosting with a poor setup.<br/><br/>Speaking of a poor setup; if your lighting is less than ideal, you will love this camera. The low light capabilities are head and shoulders better than the c920. Very little light is needed to provide a clear image in comparison to the c920.<br/><br/>I've had the camera for a month. On first use, I was prompted to install updated firmware. The installation was completed without issue. Whatever problems others have had, seems to have been corrected, at least in my case.<br/><br/>As far as the autofocus that is the disdain of most reviewers, I believe that it is probably much improved. Although I can say that it is far from perfect. Compared to the c920, I would say neither is that good with the autofocus, although the Kiyo Pro does seem to hunt for focus a little more often. Both cameras do however focus correctly. Since I am for the most part setting still in front of the camera I could turn off autofocus and adjust manually, but it is not so bad that I have thought about doing that.<br/><br/>The Razer Synapse software used to adjust the image and field of view works well and is easy to use. I have seen a lot of reviews complaining about it for various reasons, but I have had no issues. However, once you configure your settings, you do have to make sure you check the box that allows the software to load on Windows startup. Everyone's setup will require unique settings, yet for the most part, the out of box settings in my case was excellent. I simply selected the narrow field of view and added a little warmth and it looks great. I do not use the HDR.<br/><br/>Now for the bad:<br/>On a number of occasions, the image has either frozen or presented a black screen. This has not occurred unless I have stopped my video (ZOOM controls) and then restarted. Or have switched between Synapse and ZOOM. So if I am in a ZOOM meeting, it works perfectly as long as I don't stop my video. If I do stop the video and then restart the video by clicking on the ZOOM controls, about one out of 5 times, the video does not return. In that case, I have to unplug the camera and replug. Fortunately, my USB port is on the side of my monitor and is therefore easy to do.<br/><br/>I can't comment on the microphone since I use a Tonor mic.</span>

<span>I really wanted to like the Razer Kiyo Pro Streaming Webcam, but the experience has really been made up of a few different stories.<br/><br/>I’ve bought a number of Razer keyboards and mice over the years, so I wasn’t surprised by the Kiyo Pro’s slick retail packaging.  Open the box and you’re treated to the sight of a CHUNKY webcam affixed to a folding stand, sitting in a cavity in foam.  I immediately detached the folding stand, and was left with a cylindrical camera that’s reminiscent of a DX-sized, short focal length DSLR lens.  The resemblance is probably not accidental, as you have the F-stop, focal length and knurled top outer ring plainly visible.  The stand seems fine, though I don’t know why you’d use it with a $200 webcam.  A lenscap and braided USB-A to USB-C cable round out the hardware.<br/><br/>Plug the Kiyo Pro into a Windows 10 machine, and it will be detected as a normal UVC device.  That’s to say that it will be listed in your Device Manager, and will be visible to your camera-aware programs and services.  It will also be using whatever settings are configured from the factory.  Accessing the hardware settings requires the installation of Razer’s Synapse software.  My initial excitement at seeing a 6MB download turned to resigned dread as I saw that another 345MB need to be downloaded.  This is probably fine if you can amortize this bloat over a full ecosystem of Razer peripherals, but I only have the Kiyo on this PC.  Ugh.  Once you get the software installed, it (in an nVidia-esque way) asks you to create an account.  Ugh.  Thankfully, you can skip past that, but it does ask you one more time.  Synapse is ok, but it isn’t fast, possibly owing to its “plug-in” type architecture.  Once in the Kiyo Pro widget, you can turn off AF, set a fixed focus point (assuming AF is off), set the FOV, and set a number of image adjustment parameters.  Considering the AF was hunting all over the place, I found disabling the AF and setting a fixed focus point to be the right solution for me.  It was at this point that I saw that there was a firmware update available (though no indication of what level of firmware the Kiyo Pro had loaded).  Easy, right?  Wrong...<br/><br/>Clicking on the link for the firmware download should have been a trivial exercise.  The link went to a support article directing you to contact support if you wanted the update.  Huh?  I got on live chat on the Synapse website, which required the device’s serial number (inconvenient to get to, since I already had the device mounted).  What followed was a 20 minute chat session.  I asked for the firmware 4 times.  The last time I asked, I was told that I needed to download a log generation tool.  I downloaded and ran the tool, and it created a 2.8MB ZIP file, with over 27MB (across 57 files) of data inside.  What?  I explained to the extremely patient tech that I didn’t feel comfortable sending 27MB of data about my PC to them, just to QUALIFY to get a firmware update.  She explained that the ZIP file was much smaller (not the point), and that my data would be only seen by people who needed to see the information.  Again, this is to get a firmware installer.  She eventually relented and gave my a tiny link to an all-in-one installer, which updated me from version 1.0 to 1.3.<br/><br/>Without a changelog, I wasn’t really sure what to expect from the update.  As is happens, the firmware update bricked the camera.  It was still detected by the OS, but no video was visible.  Same result on multiple PCs.  Time to go back to support.  Ugh.  What unfolded was OVER TWO WEEKS of wrestling with support.  That was chats on the portal.  Messages on the portal.  Attachments uploaded to the portal.  In the end, it was tons of wasted time.  I really only bothered with support for the purposes of this review, since I hadn’t ever dealt with Razer on a support issue.  In the end, I just returned it to Amazon for an exchange.<br/><br/>If this review were just about the camera, it would be pretty easy.  The build quality is extremely high, and the video quality is very good for a 1080p camera.  It is a LITTLE better than my Logitech C920 Pro, which is around the same price.  The video quality is a bit better than a no-name 4K unit that I’d tried using for a while.  Low light performance is pretty good, owing to its decent CCD and f2.0 lens.  Ultimately, though, it still comes down to CCD size.  You see, the CCD is TINY.  While the Kiyo Pro does extremely well for a webcam, it’s still not going to come close to what you’d get using a DSLR as your stream cam.  I would assume most people already knew that, but you never know who will get sucked into the marketing vortex.  Speaking of marketing, the materials tout the Sony STARVIS CMOS CCD.  I already have a number of IP cameras with these imagers, so I’m familiar with what they are, and how they work.  The imager is back-illuminated, stabilized, and has a bit of image processing.  While the imager itself has somewhat higher sensitivity, it’s largely the post-processing that essentially denoises a long exposure.  It’s not magic - it’s nice to have, but it really doesn’t change an awful lot when it comes to low light scenarios with the Kiyo Pro.  You will need some lighting for best results.<br/><br/>So, we’re finally down to the price.  At $200, the Kiyo Pro is somewhere in the Logitech C920/930 Pro to Brio range.  The Razer is also between those two segments of Logitech’s webcam product stack in terms of image quality, too.  Generally speaking, that would make the Kiyo Pro a reasonable value.  However, that presupposes that NOTHING goes wrong with your Razer product.  All I can say is this: if you EVER need to deal with Razer support, I hope you have a better experience than me.  While everyone I dealt with seemed nice enough, nobody was actually helpful.  Ick.  Unless you’re in love with the looks of the Kiyo Pro, and expect to deal with Amazon if you have any issues, you should get something else instead.</span>

<span>I've only had the monitor for a day but I'm happy with the purchase. I initially tried to cancel the order but the seller had already shipped. I figured I would give it a try and send it back if it wasn't up to spec. I'm coming from a 12 year old Samsung T260HD monitor that is 25.5 inches, 1920x1200 @60hz. This was top of the line at the time and paid $329 while this was one was only $109. The old monitor had screen tearing in games (no g-sync or freesync) and FPS play wasn't ideal, especially in COD Warzone. If you've never played on a higher refresh rate monitor before, it makes a difference. I tried overclocking the monitor to 85hz and then 80hz but neither took so I tried out the rated spec of 75hz with freesync and let me say.. I could notice the difference right away and even picked up my first Warzone Solo victory. Aiming was much more smooth and I could keep my reticle glued on other players. If you're using this for light gaming and you're coming from a 60hz panel, you'll be pleasantly surprised. This appears to be a TN panel because the viewing angles are poor. They're completely fine when viewed straight ahead - since this is being used as a computer monitor, it's not a problem for me but buyer beware. No dead pixels or edge bleeding to speak of. Blacks aren't super dark but decent and the factory setting was ok as far as brightness and contrast was concerned. I configured to my liking and I'm satisfied. The stand is wobbly as others have stated and I didn't even bother with speakers, nor should you. I'm not expecting this thing to last but I'm hoping to get 2-3 years out of it. I was looking to get a higher refresh rate monitor (144-165hz) but after doing research, you can't take advantage of the higher refresh rate unless your frames per second average is just as high (144+fps). With a Ryzen 5 2600 and an aging Rx 570, I'm getting an average of 75fps in COD Warzone with the settings at high. In this case, the monitor is a perfect pairing for the 75hz refresh rate.<br/><br/>In order to take advantage of the higher refresh rate you will need to open up your AMD or Nvidia software and create a profile that is set @75hz. Once this is created, go into display settings on your computer -&gt; advanced settings -&gt; monitor and then select the new 75hz profile from the drop down. Last, you will need to enable freesync from the monitor control panel (it's in the menu options) and then enable it in the AMD software (not sure about Nvidia). If you're lucky, you may be able to overclock the monitor to a higher refresh rate. Just create a profile for 80 or 85hz, select it in display settings and see if it takes. If it doesn't, the monitor will revert back to the previous refresh rate in 10 seconds. From what I've read, this doesn't harm your monitor and it depends on the manufacturer as to how far you can overclock it. Don't expect much from this panel, however. All-in-all, it's an upgrade for me in just about every way. Some people say a 27" screen at 1080p for gaming isn't ideal. I beg to differ. The pixel density isn't superb by any means but I didn't notice any difference from a slightly smaller screen (25.5 vs 27) and less pixels (old monitor was 1920x1200). If I had to choose, I'd take the extra real-estate over pixel density which I think only amounts to 6ppi. There's pixel density calculators out there if you're curious. If you can afford it and your GPU/CPU can achieve 100+fps, I would go with a higher refresh rate monitor. For lower end specs, general use or a second monitor and for the low price, I don't see why not.</span>

The base to the monitor is kind of wobbly so keep that in mind but as long as you're not slamming on your desk consistently you should be okay. Screen quality is great and I haven't seen any dead pixels so I feel it's a great starter monitor for gaming or anyone getting into the PC world</span>
