<span>I have a new M1 Max Apple 16" MacBook Pro and this screen, while really nice, is not as versatile as I would have hoped.  On the positive side, the screen has tremendous real estate (being 32" of 4K resolution) and the ability to rotate the screen between landscape and portrait is great.  The monitor does supply 90W of power via the included cable, which is great as well.  (Not quite the 140W provided by the power supply provided with the laptop, but as long as it is not under much of a load, the 90W works fine for charging the battery.)<br/><br/>Now, with that being said, there are some annoying issues that I have experienced.  When I plug the monitor into the laptop, I have to turn the monitor off and then back on, otherwise the Mac does not see the screen.  Additionally, the USB hub and the ethernet plug in the monitor do not connect to the computer.  Sometimes it seems to work (with an external drive that needed a separate USB hub to provide power), but that is only occasionally.  It is kind of frustrating, but I must use two cables where only one should be necessary (one for the video signal and power to the laptop, and another for the USB hub I had to purchase separately).<br/><br/>So...  With that all being said, I'm okay with the monitor and, for the money, really cannot complain when there really are limited options available for a Mac user at this price point.  If you have a Mac and are expecting this monitor to meet all of your connection needs, however, you will probably be disappointed.</span>

<span>The VP2768a-4K is advertised as flicker-free. I bought twin monitors in Jan 2022. It's September 2022 and ONE of them just started acting up while watching a video. First the static background in the video became animated. Then the color went all yellow. Then there was a shadow of closed windows. Rebooting the computer fixed THOSE issues, but now it is flickering horribly, even with no windows on the display, The flicker is particularly noticeable in periphery vision. Power cycling the monitor and changing the refresh rate has no effect on the flicker. It just won't stop. VERY disappointed, and now I have a headache.</span>

<span>Update 10/12/2022: after looking up the model on the manufacturer's website, i found out there was a really good manufacturers warranty on the hardware. I had to pay $30 to ship the monitor to them, but they fixed the hardware failure and sent it back and no issues since then.<br/><br/>Update: Out of the box one of the monitors would flicker and turn off very sporadically, but I thought it was a dock issue with my old laptop. Last week, I got a new laptop with a new dock. Today, my monitor that occasionally flickers and turns off went black and will not come back. Power button light turns on and cycles from blue to orange depending on if it is active, but nothing on the monitor. Not cheap monitors for only 2 years of use and now a failure. Outside of that, I generally like the monitor.</span>

<span>I saw that another purchaser had the issue with one of the screens having a yellowish tint. I have color calibrated both monitors with a Spyder 4 Pro. You cannot fix the tint issue by color profiling or adjusting settings. It has to do with the LEDs that were used. Subpar in my opinion as whiter LEDs are more expensive to manufacture.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>-They are light weight and have USB hubs built in.<br/>-Come with ample connection ports for all types of cable and cables for daisy changing. No HDMI cables though.<br/>-They are thin, clear and crisp.<br/>-Practically borderless edges giving you almost seamless side by side viewing.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>-Not uniform in color even when calibrated from the factory and a 3rd party color meter.<br/>-Menu/control buttons are hidden on the back with an onscreen display selector (horrible design). If you have to adjust a screen when mounted side by side as my image shows, it's not easy to access or toggle.<br/>-Some vignetting around the edges.<br/>-Build quality seems to be cheap with very flimsy bezels around the edges that seem to be taped on. Not very secure.<br/>-USB hubs are on bottom (my Asus ProArt 24 is on the side). Easier to access, but wouldn't work in a side by side configuration.<br/><br/>Overall I guess these aren't bad monitors for what they are and price, but the yellowish tint is pretty much a deal breaker for me. In fact I ordered another set to compare them. When I hooked them up they had brighter (whiter) LEDs but they were just as far off from each other. The spec sheets showed factors that weren't further apart. In fact one of them had a dead pixel (no good for me). Plus with the serial #'s being on the monitor and boxes, there's no way to just switch out one for the other. You have to do the set. I just decided to keep these and deal with the yellow as much as it pains me. I use the whiter one for proofing and try not to have the same color screen up, because I can definitely tell one is warmer.</span>

<span>I think there are numerous reviews bundled together here and that's an issue because some "solutions" for some complaints are not available on all screens.<br/>To say it right upfront I had 3 Dell screens that I was very happy with.  Two of them were 1080p monitors displaying the timeline and one was/is a 4K monitor displaying the full image via a Blackmagic card.<br/>Then one of the monitors failed and since they were discontinued I replaced both monitors with the newer Dell UltraSharp 24which was supposed to be the new replacement model.  The issue with the new Dells was that the black levels were very poor and there was nothing to adjust them.  Customer support was even worse.  Lots of automation and when a real person finally came on they didn't know the difference between pixel resolution and black level.  Then someone sent me an HP Z23 brand new as a gift and I compared that.  That HP was an exact match to the new Dell screens.  Crisp and pretty but poor black levels.  No problem for gaming or general computer work but unusable for color calibration of film and video footage.<br/>That's how I ended up here with the ViewSonic monitors.  To say it right upfront the black levels are fine!  They match my older 4K Dell.  The colors of one of them also matched straight out of the box.  But the other one didn't and that's one of the reasons I am removing 2 stars.  One screen had a slightly blue cast.  And yes I read the comments to other reviews that complained about the blue cast.  It is NOT an issue with the Blue Light Filter or Uniformity.  The 2 monitors coming out of the SAME box are differently calibrated.  The fix for me was to switch the monitors from "Native" to SMPTE color.  That way they match and they also match the Dell 4k monitor.  I just don't think they should come mismatched out of the same box.<br/>Secondly I agree with another reviewer that the buttons are stupidly placed.  They are on the right hand side in the back.  In a multi monitor setting it's not easy to get there and it is generally a pain to try do any adjustment.  The buttons would be much better on the bottom!  Thirdly between the Dell, the HP and the ViewSonic I must say the ViewSonic has the best black level but it also has the cheapest feel.  The entire monitor feels plasticky and cheaply built compared to the others.  The pricing of all of them is about the same, so ViewSonic should step it up a bit there.  Finally the viewing angle is worse than the competition.  The drop of in blacks is very visible on the edges.  This is particularly apparent on the startup screen.  So if it wasn't for the richer blacks this would actually be the worst monitor of the ones I have tried, but it seems it's become difficult to get a monitor with good black levels, so for now these will have to do.  I hope the next time the time comes to buy monitors OLED's will be an affordable standard.  That should take care of most issues.  Hope this helped some of you save some money (wish I had someone tell me all this before I ordered the Dell monitors).</span>

<span>This pair of VP2468 H2 monitors are exactly what we needed.  Out of the box the two are identical in color, etc. to the naked eye.  Black is very well balanced across the entire surface as well.  They came with individual color calibration sheets which were very close to each other "on paper".  We mounted them on a Vivo clamp on, two monitor stand.  We're using the Displayport MTS connections.  This does require MTS to be manually turned on.  Easy, once you find it under the main menu.  The rear mounted menu buttons are our only minor complaint, as access is limited, especially to the left monitor's buttons when it is up against the right monitor.  But really... once it's setup, how often do you need to access the buttons?  The no-foam, mostly cardboard packaging is HUGELY appreciated as we are trying to lessen our environmental impact.  The Vivo mount is similarly packaged as well.<br/>We're doing editing of worship services and special events for broadcast in Adobe Premiere with a relatively high performance Dell Optiplex.  Upgraded AMD RX550, M.2 boot drive, SSD storage, 32GB of ram, 9th gen i7, Focusrite 4i4, JBL 305P mkII and M-Audio AV-30 monitors.<br/>2x24" monitors are plenty of screen space, and the color is spot on.  Two screen setup is definitely a big boost in productivity for office style work as well.  We're just a few days in at this point.  I'll post again if there are any issues, but as of now... we couldn't be happier.  Thanks View Sonic!</span>

<span>Bought this on impulse during Prime Day 2022.  It's clear, bright and beautiful.  It took me a while to get used to the extra wide, curved design but once I did, I really began to appreciate the new visual perspective with my gaming.  There are quite a few features on it, and it has a nice red backlight.  Decent cable management in the back, and comes with both a tabletop stand and wall-mount option.<br/><br/>The only reason I give it 4/5 starts is the integrated speakers - GREAT feature, but very muffled and loses a lot of dynamic leveling.  It is clear, but since this is designed as a visual appliance and not an audio one, I feel as though the audio aspect of the monitor pales in comparison to other displays that feature integrated audio.  Though, I may be biased considering the LG QLED I also purchased on Prime Day has by far some of the best audio output I've experienced without a home theater setup.<br/><br/>Great investment if you're looking for crisp, clear and relatively affordable gaming display.  Only minor drawback is the audio.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>One drawback is when it comes to PC's and Monitors, you won't know for sure until you try it out for yourself. You can ask the seller questions, but sometimes the question you should have asked isn't obvious until the thing is sitting on your desk. It may boil down to something very specific to your application/environment/ergonomics that the seller, or even the manufacturer can't give you a definitive answer because of the subjective nature of sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time.<br/>  A big help for me in determining which to order is to download the user manual and quick set-up guides from the Manufacturer Website. By carefully reading the specs and going through the OSD Menu entries I am sure that what I'm ordering, at least on paper, has the right specs. This way, the monitors should have all the right comparable specs and you should end up with what you really want. Still, as was it was in my case you may have to try it out before you can finalize the purchase.<br/>  I need a widescreen curved monitor such as this 30" Scepter with PBP (split screen) so as to be able to work on documents from two different inputs, i.e. two PC's. So I am reviewing this from more of a business angle, not from a Gaming criteria.<br/>  Basically, it is a simple, single-purpose gaming PC Monitor. If used just for gaming on an Nvidia Graphics PC, it works as advertised. You've got to match video cards, max res, number and type of inputs, hdmi 1.4, 2.0? Is Displayport 1.2 enough?  I finally narrowed down to a 30-32 inch 21:9 ultrawide, curved, (gaming) monitor though I would only use it for business. I need a split screen with quick and easy transition from one input to another. To change inputs from one PC to another on this monitor requires 11 button pushes and the dual split-screens are squished horizontally as determined by the screen width and 2560hz horizontal resolution. Nothing really wrong with the monitor itself. My opinion is that this monitor should be best acknowledged as a single input Gaming monitor. It was not quite suitable for my application. Better would be a wider monitor with higher horizontal frequency.<br/>  The Wall Plate though not it's intended use can be  attaching it to a standard 4 hole Vesa mounting arm plate. It comes with a 75mm 4 hole Adapter, so it can be done. Two little bolts attach one side to the monitor, the other side can be fastened to a regular Monitor mounting plate (75mm hole pattern) on the extended arm of your vesa desktop stand mounted to your desk .  You will have to obtain an additional four M4 x 20mm bolts, with washers and nuts to bolt (fasten) Wall Mount to the Vesa plate of your stand. Easily accomplished except for  obtaining your own hardware. No wall plate screws are supplied as there are different types of wall mounts.<br/>  At this price point, as I've mentioned, this monitor is designed to work best with a PC having an Nvidia Video Card using GSync. They tell you up front how it's designed to work. With the right hardware you can get the 160 - 200 hz frequency for high-end gaming. With Displayport 1.2  I was able to get 120hz picture that was good enough for ordinary Windows 10 desktop, but I can't comment how it would work for gaming. Need Displayport 1.4, or Hdmi 2.0 to obtain 160-200hz. The Nvidia drivers must be up to date and can be downloaded from Nvidia Website. The driver page lists a long paragraph of Nvidia cards compatible with that driver. It may work well enough with other PC video cards as well, but I was using an old GT 620. No problem with the latest driver but not suitable for intensive gaming.<br/>  Using with a Mac, (I have a Macbook Pro) is a crapshoot. Older Macs are designed to work with older Mac compatible hardware. This monitor, as is the case with the majority of OEM generic monitors, is directed at the Windows PC Market. If it works with your Mac, well and good, but don't count on it, not for serious gaming for sure. My 2011 Macbook Pro has early thunderbolt - backwards compatible with mini-displayport. I used a mini-displayport cable with short mini-displayport to Displayport adapter. Macbook has a 2560x1440 spec video output. It connected with the monitor but full-screen picture was a little vertically flattened, (i.e.horizontall stretched); not acceptable. Mac System Preferences Display Icon showed 1080p. That is correct, but the Macbook is designed for 4:3 ratio. My Macbook was never intended to handle 21:9 aspect ratio; not the fault of the monitor. Works perfect though with my 21.5 inch Acer screen. Newer macs with thunderbolt 3, a.k.a. USB-C should be compatible with USB-C input monitors.<br/>  In order to avoid the hassle of a return, my advice is to ask the seller - better yet, download the manual, especially with third-party sellers as return shipping is pretty expensive. Be aware of the intended use and specs and consider that in order to get a monitor with better options, you might have to spend another $100.00 or more.  What I could determine is that used as intended and properly set up, it will do what is advertised at 160hz For business, with dual inputs, maybe not, but the manufacturer does not advertise it as anything but designed for gaming so I really can't complain. I had to try it to find out.<br/><br/>Walter O.</span>

<span>Color reproduction capability is definitely better than the display it replaced, although definitely more on the yellow side straight out of the box. Calibrated it several times with DisplayCAL and eventually got the whites more neutral and the contrast matching my laptop's internal display. However, the display is much dimmer than expected even at 100%. I went back and checked, and the spec was nowhere to be found on the product page, so I checked the spec list on ViewSonic's site and found it is only 250 nits (which unfortunately is only half of my internal display). I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known, but arguably shouldn't need to go check the manufacturer's spec on their site to find such a basic and important spec.</span>

<span>First, the size of the box it comes in is huge. Obviously to hold the 32-inch monitor that is inside. Everything was well packaged to prevent any damage during shipping. The monitor has its own stand mount and cannot be used with any standard monitor mounts, which is a downside if you are wanting to mount it otherwise. When setting up your cables to run, the stand has a cable channel that allows you to hide the cables and not be sore eyesight. The monitor does come with an HDMI cable which is nice but not the other type of cable to utilize the PBP feature. The other video input is DisplayPort which you cannot use an HDMI cable on, so you'd have to do your own research on finding an Active DisplayPort adapter. Once I powered on the monitor the resolution was amazing, not because of the size and in your face. I could see more detail on a larger scale, which is nice for me since I do some design work on my CNC router and laser. This was a major reason why I wanted the 32-inch Samsung monitor. You control all the settings through a simple joypad style button like most Samsung products have, which can be a pain but convenient and out of the way. Along with using it for my CNC work, I use it to play my gaming console as well as I wait on projects to finish on my laser. I can either watch both my laptop and gaming console at the same time or I can choose to switch between them utilizing the DisplayPort. It has an eye saver mode built-in if you plan on using for extended hours at a time but I have not used that feature yet. Going through and adjusting the settings, most of the images or videos that play on the monitor look lifelike! The curve on the monitor is very nice to have especially if you are sitting so close to it using your computer. It definitely gives what you are looking at a better perspective for your eyes since it is about the same distance from the center to the edge of the monitor. So if you are looking for something huge, uses little desk space, amazing picture and resolution, hides cables, lets you use 2 video inputs at the same time or switch between the two. Then this is the monitor for you to get! I would really like to get another one to go side by side! </span>

<span>Just got this yesterday. 32" from corner to corner, a little over 31" diagonally across the screen. Bottom edge of monitor while on stand is about 3.6" above desk. Everything on screen appears smooth and sharp (because 4k). I feel that monitors over 30" should be UHD if your face is between 2 and 3 feet away. With a WQHD monitor of this size, I was having a harder time seeing enemy players from long distances away while gaming, but UHD brings in that detail.<br/><br/>When I first got this, the screen was extremely bright and a little washed out. (Mine came from a company that had been testing it in another language too, apparently, so the settings had already been messed with.) I lowered the brightness to 35 and boosted the colors to more accurately match my IPS monitor. It looks great now and much better than other VA monitors.<br/><br/>For Freesync, you will need to install third-party software. I originally thought this was a Freesync monitor when I bought it, but there were no options in the on-screen display. I already had a program installed for custom resolutions, and I found that it also had options to enable Freesync. AMD's Freesync range is pretty big, but monitors have a specific range in which it actually works, so I tested between 35 and 60Hz. This one's Freesync range turned out to be 43-59 Hz. If you stray outside the range, you'll experience signal loss. Additionally, this only works with HDMI.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: if you choose to enable Freesync on a monitor, research how to do it first, and don't freak out if your monitor goes black. You should probably have another monitor handy in case you mess up. If your Freesync range is different, you'll have to test your lower and upper bounds by limiting framerate to test for signal loss. I will not share exactly how I enabled Freesync because someone capable of doing this should be able to figure it out from what I wrote, and I don't want to be blamed for someone somehow bricking their rig and setting their house on fire.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm in love with this monitor already, and if anything were to happen to it, I would be deeply upset and agitated.</span>

<span>first off, once again, 1 star removed bcz the carriers you choose to use lie about delivery, then dont deliver to my actual address forcing me to walk heavy boxes up 3 flights of stairs. the carriers have dollies and stuff for that, i do not, so ill keep removing a star until you gain control over your carriers.<br/><br/>1 star removed bcz i tried to cancel this before it shipped but received an email saying it was too late to cancel, but it didnt actually ship until 30 hours later. good job people, keep it up.<br/><br/>1 star removed because you sent a 400.00 item in a giant box with not one piece of bubble wrap. if i had the energy i would box all this up and send it back. all my packages from amazon these past 2 weeks have come with little or no bubble and im buying up parts for a VR computer, so that about 3500.00 over 3 e-tailers and 4 different carriers, all arriving in busted boxes at the wrong location with no protection. this is your job. why is it hard?<br/><br/>so you just lost 60% of your rating for avoidable things that are persistent in your supply chain. amazon has been getting worse and worse and worse ever since it started being another e-bay with shady sellers and wildly fluctuating prices and shipping. your usefulness is coming to and end when prime video is no better than free youtube, your products are price matched , and your delivery methods are corrupted.<br/><br/>now for the monitor. i should keep taking stars away, but i would be left with negatives. first the bezel"less". there is a bottom branded bezel, along with 1/8" of dead space. the other 3 sides all have 1/4" dead space. so you effectively have an internal bezel of non-usable screen real estate that still takes up the space a monitor that doesnt shave off inches does.<br/><br/>next - display port. it does have 1 display port. ive read reviews where it did not, and that was the reason for my cancel request. well, that and no vesa, really, why would you not include that? seems intentionally cheap. anyway about the DP, i dont know if samsung updated this model to include it, or previous reviewers got bait and switched with a different model (this also happens here on amazon, just look at some "renewed" item listings), or simply didnt recognize the port as it looks like hdmi in the dark, and it is dark up in the cable attachment area. in any case you get one now. just one. version 1.2<br/><br/>no vesa. you know, this is disheartening as vesa compatibility has almost become ubiquitous. so this was a choice. a choice made by someone who is completely out of touch with todays home and soho computing. its one thing to not include the vesa if you are going to give us a stand with lots of motion, and stability, and good materials. instead you get a cheap tube frame and about 5 degress of motion up and down, no side to side. the frame is so cheap , i assume, bcz they engineered the weight and design of the monitor to hold it steady. in this it is marginally successful, but only by using a lot of desk space.<br/><br/>controls - are a joke. i do enjoy the joystick type navigation on the power button, serving double duty as the way to nav the menu. however, you get contrast, brightness, volume....oh yeah, thats it. why have a menu?<br/><br/>documentation/box contents - you get a lot of useless information, like a warning not to pour water on it, but no product spec sheet, which i immediately hunted for to put the display port thing to rest. no case badge, no stickers of any kind, no cleaning cloth, no display port cord. nothing. im sorry, you do get a cheap 6' hdmi cable and a typical power cable.<br/><br/>color. when i plugged it in, i had typical hd settings on my ben-q ips. so i immediately got a pop up warning for that. once i changed it to 4k settings, it filled up my screen but was washed out, grey. even now with brightness on 100, the top amazon blue nav bar looks muted and washed out. the white area where i am typing is kinda grimy grey. there are no controls to change this on the monitor. obviously you can use windows to calibrate, which i just took a time out from this review to do. setting brightness on 50 even though it looks like typing on a gym sock, i went through the process, only to find at the end, nothing changed at all. except my brightness control was reset to zero, giving me the ability to raise total brightness past the previous max. welcome because now i can see, but still washed out colors.<br/><br/>cyber monday had some ok deals and there are screens by AOC and even LG that i should have tried. but i own lots of samsung stuff and im typically happy, so i went with this one. at 500.00 original cost i would lol in your face while i packed it up and returned it. at the 399.00 i paid i feel raw by about 150.00. this is a 250.00 monitor tops. there is way too much competition, good competition, for samsung to release this giant box of pffft.<br/><br/>im going to keep it for either my 3rd or 4th favorite computer, but thats only bcz its here in my house already, but it wont ever be connected to any machine i use every day.<br/><br/>skip this. people will say its the cheapest 4k so get it. but washed out colors, no vesa, simplistic controls and giant footprint on your desk make it a sure pass. i havent even tried to watch anything in 4k yet bcz it cant make web browsing look good and im too tired to get more irritated at this junk.<br/><br/>oh, i forgot cable management. imagine the cheapest thinnest plastic ever, then make it thinner, and this is your backplate which covers the area where the stand screws to the screen and offers a hidden channel to run your pwr, dp, and hdmi cords down to the desk level. this demands careful thought as a previous reviewer ranted about the cables falling out. well, yes, the hdmi slot is too wide and it will fall out over time, as will the power cable, however you can coil and bend the wires to a point where you can make then exert upward pressure to keep them seated. no tape or glue needed. it takes time bcz you dont have alot of room to work in and you dont have a lot of room to coil up inches of cable in there. the fisher price backplate is not strong enough to hold it if you could. this was a design flaw and an obvious one that should have been caught and rectified during product testing. recessed, side facing ports with a usb 3.0 or 2 or 3 would have been a good addition, and one which most of the competition has included so once again im left scratching my head as to why samsung decided not to include these features.<br/><br/>after i finished writing this, i have to go back and take another star off for quality of product. i hate 1 star reviews, but samsung and amazon deserve it.</span>

<span>I bought this to replace an LG ultrawide that stopped working after just a couple months. The picture is great, USB-C power delivery works reliably and the screen shakes less because the base is more substantial.<br/><br/>My only complains after a couple months are:<br/>- The base is solid but it takes up a lot of desk space.<br/>- Since big curved monitors are such an awkward shape, you'll want to keep the box but it's huuuuge because the base is a single piece. It's seriously twice the size of the box for a comparable LG, Samsung, etc.<br/>- The settings are surprisingly hard to navigate. The onscreen menu is shown on the bottom right edge of the screen and you select a menu option by pressing the corresponding button at the same location but on the back of the monitor. The monitor is thick enough that you have to duck down to the right level to make sure the button you're pressing lines up with the menu item. Oh, and the power button is right there too, so don't accidentally turn the monitor off while you're in the middle of adjusting something. Terrible design.</span>

<span>This monitor looked nice upon unpacking but then i noticed after mounting it that on the left side there is uneven separation between the display and the frame edge (see attached photos). I initiated a return right away without even finishing unpacking because for that money the frame should be flawless and who is to know what other defects are inside. I would love to get a replacement but the frame design seems too thin and it's a shame as I like this mojitos specs on paper at least. Now i'll be down another week from my workflow waiting for refund and purchase something else with a more robust frame edge.</span>

<span>Out of the box it was easy to set up and connect, everything is functional, and the ULTRA CURVED SCREEN gives an aspect Ratio 16:9 and displays images in dark blacks, vivid colors, and sharp details with a high-quality picture. Only issue was with Samsung, they did not want to gie me the 3-year warranty. I had to request the seller The Minerva Project to contact Samsung to correct and update the 9 month warranty Samsung gave me to the 3- year warranty.

<span>I use this product daily for communications and playing card games. It is a good clear picture with decent response time. I would have given it 5  stars except that the button on the back to operate the menu and turn the screen off is clumsy and difficult to use especially if you have large fingers. I installed a 10 foot HDMI cable and discovered the screen would not turn off when I turned off my computer. Little icons rolled around the screen until it was manually turned off by the button in back, clumsily. I installed my old analog cable and the problem went away. The screen now turns off with my computer (windows 11). Would prefer an HDMI connection in case it would give a better picture. Does anyone have a similar complaint or solution.</span>

<span>I use this monitor on a daily basis as a work from home employee and find that it's the "best bang for the buck".

<span>Using this monitor with my Macbook Pro. At first I tried to connect it via my own Hdmi cable and all I got was flickering, white dots and the screen going on and off sporadically. Then I connected it with the USB-C cable it came with and it worked perfectly fine. It will not work by connecting the cables to my dock station. I tried a different Hdmi cable and that also gave me the same issue. So after talking to Amazon customer service (which was no help) and then getting transferred to a LG tech rep, I played around with the resolution of the LG monitor and it seems to be working fine once changed to 2560 x 1080. When I used the Hdmi cable that it came with, it automatically set it to this resolution setting. I then switched it to what's recommended which is 3440 x 1440 and so far it seems to be working fine.<br/><br/>So, my verdict, just make sure to use the cables it comes with and don't bother plugging them into a docking station.</span>

<span>Best computer monitor I have ever own. I have haul this monitor around to many places in a travel trailer and yet it continues to function like new. The monitor sit on a hard table top in my trailer secure with a single bungee cord. I have transported it on long trap facedown in the trunk of my SUV with no padding. Yet it continues to function with no defect. The picture quality is the best. So, what do use this monitor for/with? Mostly use with my iPad 11 Pro (2020) for general computing. Since the iPad is my primary computer, I just get a big square (viewable area) in the middle of the screen with two black bars on the right and left side of the screen.  The viewable area is approximately about 23 inches diagonally. Some contents like movies and photos will fill the screen for view pleasure.  The blue color USB port in the back of the screen allows me to connect blue USB devices like flash drives and high performance cameras with no problem. Over all this was a good buy. I’m happy.</span>

<span>This monitor is absolutely fantastic.  I'm using this as an external for my new 2021 Macbook Pro M1 16", and the performance has been flawless so far!  My old Philips 4K monitor would flicker under every color profile, and I constantly had to change the color profiles to prevent this from happening on a daily basis.  But this new LG was plug-and-play, super easy assembly with no tools necessary, and it NEVER flickers, no matter what color profile I set it at.  It doesn't take an eternity to boot up like my old Philips monitor did.  And the picture is so much better.  Everything is so sharp, and the color representation is wonderful at every angle, thanks to this being an IPS monitor.  This is my first widescreen 21:9 monitor, and the real estate/multitasking is really something else.  It's very immersive, and I love the curved panel.  I write music scores for a day job, and I love that I can see huge portions of my scores in such detail, in addition to whatever other windows I need to have open simultaneously.  At first, I kind of wished that I would have gone with a 38 inch 4:3 because this one seemed to be not tall enough, but I'm quickly getting over that.  The quality is outstanding, and I hope this monitor lasts for many, many years to come.  I'm very, very happy with the purchase of this LG Ultrawide at this price point, and I highly recommend it!</span>

<span>After a lot of research, I found this great IPS monitor that has all the essentials I was looking for: ultra wide screen, IPS, curved and USB-C connectivity. It immediately worked perfectly with my M1 Mac mini as well as my laptop from work (an HP EliteBook 845 G8 which stays charged through the USB-C plug, so no power cord is needed). The picture quality is beautiful...images don't appeared warped by the curvature as I was afraid they might. I don't use it for serious gaming, so I can't comment on that. The monitors stand is wide and takes up a lot of desk space, so you might want to consider a desk mounted monitor arm (the WALI Single Monitor Gas Spring Desk Mount works well for me).</span>
