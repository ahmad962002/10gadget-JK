<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>First of all, excuse my English. Gonna be honest, the picture quality looks ugly out of the box and too bright but if you sit down and patiently adjust the colors and few other characteristics on the menu, you can get a really good image quality and you can make your games look pretty and run very well.<br/><br/>The sound is not that bad as other reviews says but I use headphones anyway so it doesn't affect me.<br/><br/>If you don't have too much money to spend and are looking for a budget gaming monitor, this one will do the job until you can get something better. It can be used as a second monitor too if you are into streaming. To see the chat, your streaming software, etc.<br/><br/>This monitor does the job. You just have to sit down and make some adjustments.<br/><br/>Oh! And Make Sure to increase it to 75hrtz!!! Is set to 60hrtz. Go to the menu and increase it. It makes a big difference!</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>Nice prompt delivery, well packaged.  Picture is good.  The tweaking selections are all on the back which makes it  hard to adjust since you can't see both sides at once, but if you get it figured out, finally, there are no complaints, but I wish it had a front bar or screen for that.  I think I could then really tweak it well.  Speakers are okay, again they face backwards instead of out the front where I am, and my computer speakers are better,  and there is no way to switch them or add stereo, which I could do if the setting was there for it.  But I could do headphones if I wanted that.  But for the money it's not a bad deal at all.  I got the 24 inch.  I desperately needed a bigger screen and this helped me out!  The color is good for my artwork.  I did have to call tech support for a question and they were very nice and helpful.  Not a super-perfect product but a really good one, and a great deal for the price.  Thanks!</span>

However there are some acer ones that are $119 so IF you can swing up to that range, then there you go.

<span>This review is for the “(Sceptre 20" 1600 x 900 75Hz LED Monitor 2X HDMI VGA Built-in Speakers, sRGB 99% Machine Black (E209W-16003RT Series) aka “20” 75Hz Wide Viewing Angle” monitor.<br/>I got 2 of these for $115/ea. It was difficult to return them and go with two Samsung 1080p IPS 22” monitors instead. For some reason, the non-IPS screens (like these) have a hard time displaying an even black/gray screen. The pictures with the grayscale test have my very high-quality laptop monitor below them as a reference in each picture for what the black/gray screen SHOULD look like. The monitor is on the top of each picture and my laptop is below it. The laptop screen is mirrored on the Spectre monitor above it. These exhibit pretty bad “ghosting.” To be fair, it is not as bad in real life as the camera makes the monitor look. But I still found it too distracting to work with. Because the screen is always darker at the top than the bottom (regardless of viewing angle), it can be difficult to see vertical scroll bars because it fades from normal at the top to washed-out at the bottom. Googling information can also be difficult because the color change of a site you have already been to on Google is more difficult to see at the bottom of the screen than at the top. It is also harder to work in Excel because the grid lines are not an even shade across the entire screen. It is not horrible like the HP V20 HD+ 19.5-inch monitor. But it is still not great. I found it too distracting to work with as a home office monitor. There should be 6 pictures showing the different shades of black/gray mirrored off my laptop onto the Spectre 20” monitor. The monitor in the picture also has a bad pixel a few inches from the top left corner that you can see in the darkest pictures as green. I personally do not take off points because my specific product/item has a flaw/defect. Even the best manufacturers have products that pass quality control. So I simply mention it and let readers decide for themselves if it is too common of a problem for them to decide not to purchase it. I only give bad reviews for “systemic problems” that affect all of a product line like this. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>On the good side it does have some really nice features for the money. I will miss the dual HDMI ports and the speakers even though they’re not very good. But this allows you to plug in a Roku stick and watch/listen to TV while working on the other monitor if you have two (see picture). I also personally liked the size better than the 22” Samsung 1080p monitors I’m keeping. Two 22” monitors are a little big for my very small desk even when VESA mounted. The Spectre monitors are also VESA mountable which was another reason I purchased them. They come with screws that create a gap of about ¾” between the monitor and a VESA mount (see picture). I’m not exactly sure why they did this, but it does make it easier to access cables in the back and it was not an inconvenience for me. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>If you don’t have much money and these are on sale for $120 or less, it might be a monitor worth considering. But the one I opened to try/test had a defective pixel so I had to return it anyways. And I never opened the 2nd one because I decided I just couldn’t work with this monitor for most likely many years. The Samsung’s look fantastic straight out of the box without having to mess with screen adjustments. And I got them on sale from Amazon for $140/ea. For my needs, as a home office monitor(s), the Samsung’s are much better and worth the extra $25/ea. But the Samsung 22" IPS monitors are normally $165+/ea. It would have been a more difficult choice if I had to pay full price for the Samsung’s.</span>

<span>This review is for the SB220Q series (1920x1080) 75Hz monitor variant.  At a $90 price point as of July 2020, all of the praise this monitor has gotten and continues to get is pretty well deserved.  Right out of the box the factory calibration is pretty awful as with most TVs and monitors (I’ll never understand why that is), but Acer’s built-in menu gives you a wide range of control to tweak the image quality to your liking.  Here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past three weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The colors can be very vibrant and the sharpness makes everything nice and crisp both up close and from a distance without going overboard.  Although the spec sheet does not specify the exact Adobe or sRGB color gamut range, it does have a stated 72% NTSC coverage (keep in mind that the NTSC color gamut has the highest level of color reproduction), which would imply that it should have close to 100% sRGB coverage.  This is pretty standard for most sub $200 monitors (note: the unit that TechSpot tested came in at around 93% of sRGB coverage mostly losing detail in the green range so your unit’s reproduction may vary).  The 6-bits + FRC (equal to 8-bits) color depth is also an industry standard for entry level monitors and is completely fine for casual use.<br/><br/>- This montior’s “100,000,000:1” Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) (non-standardized measure of contrast for videos) definitely seems to outperform my other slightly more expensive budget IPS monitors (the HP VH240a and ViewSonic VS2412-H)  that only have 20,000,000:1 and 50,000,000:1 contrast ratios respectively.  However, note that it still has an industry standard 1000:1 Static Contrast Ratio (measure for non-moving images) which isn’t great but is perfectly acceptable for casual viewing since only the highest tiered ($400+) IPS panels exceed that point with 1,500:1 being the maximum native contrast typically achievable with an IPS.<br/>~ A quick side note about that “100,000,000:1” DCR number:  there is no industry standard methodology for this particular measurement so the number itself is mostly useless marketing fluff.  But as I noted, compared to the two other monitors with the same industry standard SCR, this monitor did seem to outperform them both in that area.<br/><br/>- Its 102 PPI pixel density actually makes a subtle difference in image quality when viewing up close compared to my 24 inch 1080p monitors that have a 92 PPI.  Text seems to be a bit smoother in comparison.  This is purely an advantage of having the smaller 21.5 inch screen.<br/><br/>- The Color Adjustment Menu allows you to adjust both the RGB and CMY gains, bias, hues, and saturation levels to get a better color balance.<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu lets you adjust the screen’s brightness, contrast, gamma, and blackness (“black boost”) levels while also providing a ‘blue light’, ‘adaptive constrast’ (ACM), and a ‘Super Sharpness’ on/off switch.<br/><br/>- The Game Menu has FreeSync (for AMD GPUs) and Overdrive options<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- The bezels are a bit thicker than I woud’ve liked (they’re about 1 cm on the top, left, and right sides) making the frameless design nothing more than a gimmick.<br/><br/>- The top-down viewing angle is noticeably darker compared to looking at the screen head on.<br/><br/>- Despite having a good DCR of 100M:1, the blacks are still a bit too bright for watching anything with heavy dark scenes since the display itself does not have any HDR capabilities with high contrast control zones aka local dimming (to be fair, this is completely expected at this $90 price point and is only being mentioned as reference for those that may be thinking of using this monitor to watch TV/movies).<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu’s ‘Super Sharpness’ option is just an on/off switch; it does not give you a more granular adjustment control over the amount of sharpness to apply.<br/><br/>- Even with all of the image quality adjustment options available in the settings, the whites remain on the slightly warmer side of the color temperature chart.  It’s not that noticeable when viewing on this monitor alone, but the difference can be seen if you have another slightly cooler display adjacent to it.  This is most likely just an issue with my particular unit since other reviews have noted their unit had a more neutral or “near perfect” white temp.<br/><br/>- It only has a paltry 15° degree back tilt compared to most other budget monitors being able to tilt closer to 30° degrees (this is super nitpicky as compromises are to be expected at a sub $100 price point).<br/><br/>- The Power button is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the menu buttons (both in shape and spacing).<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a nice quality budget monitor to look at spreadsheets, word documents, and do some internet browsing or even some light casual gaming, then this is a great choice.  If you are a competitive gamer, photographer, professional editor, or a content creator then you’ll obviously need to invest in a higher spec monitor.</span>

<span>I have purchased 3 of these from Amazon in the past couple of years. When on sale the price dips below $90 which I think is a great value but I have only seen it happen twice in 2 years time. It's a good monitor with nice picture quality and good features.<br/><br/>That beings said though be careful if ordering more than one for a matching setup because as you can see from my pictures out of the 3 I have purchased one of them is smaller in size, shape, and has a slightly thinner frame around it than the other two even though I purchased all 3 from Amazon themselves and from the same listing that I have had saved in my shopping list for past couple of years.<br/><br/>The have the exact same model number except the slightly smaller one has a 1 at the end of the model number. I don't know if this is normal or a mistake but either way they all work great they just look different which is why I had to buy 3 total in order to get two that matched perfectly side by side for my dual monitor setup. I gave the 3rd odd ball one to my son because he needed an upgrade as well so it at all worked out in the end. Weirdly enough though the 3rd one I ordered matched the original one I ordered 2 years ago instead of the 2nd one that I had purchased a week ago so that means Amazon must of a mixture of both in their current inventory.</span>

<span>This is a great monitor.  It is height-adjustable so you don't have to look down like you do at most monitors!  It has great built-in speakers in the back so no additional speakers are needed to clutter your desktop (adjust the default 50% volume setting as others have noted so that you can make them louder).</span>

<span>I'm very happy with this monitor.  I was able to try it out at a former employer's office.  At home, I had a larger monitor and unfortunately, larger isn't always better.<br/><br/>I like this size of this display.  My monitor is only about 24" away from my face and I have decent vision with diminishing reading vision.  Looking at a larger monitor was more than annoying, it just wasn't good to use and it made me not want to use my home computer.<br/><br/>Using this monitor at 1920 x 1080 (recommended for this screen), and having the magnification set to 100% (Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display = "smaller") is great!<br/><br/>I don't do gaming and I haven't used the internal speakers.  Can't rate those.<br/><br/>I sometimes change the color settings to help minimize the impact on viewing screens late at night (Warm, Neutral, Cool, Low Blue Light, Night, Reading, HP Enhance +, or Custom RGB).  This is helpful.<br/><br/>I am able to tilt the screen down and up with ease.  And the rotate to portrait is great (raise display to highest settings and tilt back to clear the desk), but my old laptop can't change the settings to view in portrait.<br/><br/>I recommend this monitor.  It's great that it can also go on a stand that holds double screens.  And with the very thin left and right frame sides, it would be a great monitor to use 2 or 3 side-by-side.</span>

<span>After finally purchasing a couple MiniPC's for both business and personal use, and using an old LCD 21" Wide Screen Monitor I had, I was finding that I must be spoiled by my 4K TV because the picture on that monitor which I thought was wonderful, just seemed so dull and it did not support 4K which I have come to love to watch 4K videos etc.<br/><br/>I wasn't really sure what monitor to get, but I wanted something much larger, supported 4K, and that was at a very reasonable price. I did a lot of searching Amazon's product lists for monitors, and I came across this monitor, and I noticed that it was a curved screen. While I have never owned a curved screen anything, I had seen them at the local electronics store and was darn impressed. So I was very curious about this monitor because it had all the specs I was looking for, at least 27", Wide Screen, Support for 4K, Native Resolution of 1920 x 1080, LED, and had a curved screen. When I also noticed that it was a Samsung, I was pretty excited to learn more because I have always had very good luck with Samsung products and in fact, I have only had one Samsung product ever fail, and that was a mobile phone that should have stopped working years ago with what It went through.<br/><br/>Not knowing much about monitors these days, I started reading the reviews that were written on this monitor and I asked the community a couple questions. The answers I got back to my questions sealed the deal for me. Everyone who responded had nothing but great things to say about this monitor and provided me in info I needed. So I decided to go for it.<br/><br/>When it got here, unfortunately the first one had a broken screen. It appeared that it was packaged that way since the packaging was factory sealed but the packing was broken on the inside. Needless to say I returned it but Amazon really stepped up to the plate and sent me a replacement next day, so I was only delayed by 1 day getting to use it. Because the first monitor came with a broken screen, I am going to assume that the screen may be a bit on the frgile side as my old monitor has been dropped, and the LCD screen never had any issues, I don't know jf the screens on LED monitors are more easily broken, or If this was something that someone really dropped hard before packaging, for this reason I gave the durability 4 stars)<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze! Just had to put 1 screw to put the base stand together, and that was it. The stand is about the only thing I really don't like because the base that sits on the desk is an upside down chevron shape, which sticks out in front of the monitor a few inches. This makes putting it on a small desk where your keyboard would be in front of it a bit of a pain because the keyboard has to be pulled closer to me and just gets in the way to me. I managed to get around that by putting the monitor up on a little shelf I made out of a box and an old Laptop lap desk that I had. It perfectly raises the monitor by about 4-5 inches, and let's me push the keyboard further back to where I now have more room on my desk.  (Images added to show the base and how I worked around the chevron styled base to give me more room).<br/><br/>The monitor has one HDMI port and one Display Port. Now I am not familiar with the Display Port, but all my devices are HDMI, so plugging in a PC is simple. In fact, I have 3 MiniPC's that I need to connect to this monitor so I bought a 5 port HDMI switch. This allows me to easily switch between each MiniPC with just a click of a button.<br/><br/>The picture on this monitor is absolutely phenomenal!  Once I plugged in the HDMI plug, turned on the monitor, it automatically scanned for the signal which it found right away and WOW! What a gorgeous picture. The colors are very bright and vibrant. The dynamics between the Black and White colors are stunning and the color definition is very vivid. For never using a curved screen before on a computer monitor, I am very impressed. It almost immerses you in to the picture and almost gives it a extra dimensional view, almost 3D in nature... The thing I worried most about with a curved screen was is there going to be any distortion with a curved screen and I am happy to say. "Absolutely Not!". The images looks perfectly flat, but because of the curve, it pulls the outer edges our of your peripheral vision and closer to your focused view when looking straight forward.<br/><br/>Learning how to use the toggle button on the back for adjusting the settings van take a bit of getting used to, however, at this point, I haven't really needed to use any of the options other then Sleep and Shut Down as the defaults seem to be perfect for my setup.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this monitor does not have built in speakers however, if you have speakers connected to you computer or use a set of Bluetooth Speakers you will be just fine.<br/><br/>Overall my impression of this monitor is fantastic! The picture quality is stunning, and the size with the curves screen is awesome. I would recommend this monitor to anyone who wants an excellent monitor for home or office at a more then reasonable price. While I have not used the monitor for gaming, I have used a monitor that has the same 4ms refresh rate and that has the same native resolution  of1920 x 1080 and that monitor is over 10 years old and still holds up today, so I can only imagine that this monitor would be perfectly fine for today's games.  I am definitely glad that I went ahead and purchased this monitor, and should I need to replace the monitor that I amusing as  a secondary monitor, I will likely purchase another one of this model!  Again, Highly recommended and over all this monitor gets a full 5 Stars from me! ~</span>

<span>Out of the box it was easy to set up and connect, everything is functional, and the ULTRA CURVED SCREEN gives an aspect Ratio 16:9 and displays images in dark blacks, vivid colors, and sharp details with a high-quality picture. Only issue was with Samsung, they did not want to gie me the 3-year warranty. I had to request the seller The Minerva Project to contact Samsung to correct and update the 9 month warranty Samsung gave me to the 3- year warranty. Still waiting to see if Samsung stands behind their 3-year warranty as advertised.</span>

<span>Positive:<br/>  The monitor’s packaging has many protective features. The result was no dead, faded-colored, or dim pixels. The screen has a matte film over the screen, which significantly decreases eye strain due to prolonged uses. I have not slowly played back footage of the screen. This being said, I have not been able to observe any screen tearing. (Screen tearing is when a portion of the screen has not update in sync with the other portion. This results in the screen showing a different image for a split second.) With that being said, I believe the refresh rate is fast enough for this monitor.<br/>The 1080p resolution works well with this size monitor. (4K has much less of an effect on small screens.)<br/><br/>The sleek stand has a relatively small footprint, yet is very sturdy. The bezel around the edges is very slim. Easy access for power cord and HDMI port. The digital menu can be easily navigated. The menu is operated through a joystick which is depressible. Overall clean design, easy menu flow, and quality image.<br/><br/>Negative:<br/>  I wish there was a quicker way to turn the monitor off. One must press the joy-stick down and scroll through a menu to the toggle off.  There is not much more (for me) to comment on.<br/><br/>(Personal opinion):<br/>The silver tone bezel adds a nice touch. As a gamer this has a fast enough refresh rate, and rgb range to handle any games/interfaces I have used.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>I would highly recommend this monitor. It works great for gaming as well as an everyday computer monitor.</span>

<span>I am using a MacBook Pro 15 inch 2012 (non-retina) with this monitor and it has been great. I've been using my laptop for 8 years and decided that I need more real estate. At first I was planning to get the new MacBook Pro 16 in. 2019 and a USB-C input type of 4k monitor setup but that was about over 3k dollars. I'm not so familiar with computer hardware but wanted more real estate for coding and productivity. After extensive research, I realized that I can connect a mini-DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter to my MBP in the thunderbolt 1 port and a separate HDMI cable to this monitor. Once I have gotten this monitor, I realized that 1080p resolution is more than I need and a very cheap solution. Even if I upgrade my MBP to the 16 in. 2019, I would still continue to use this monitor. The curved screen is a bit of getting used to but I don't mind it at all. If you use spreadsheets heavily then you might consider getting a flat screen instead because the lines won't be as linear as you may like. However, watching movies is great and I'm not a gamer but I'm sure it's great for gaming too. My only regret is that I wish I bought this monitor sooner!!!</span>

<span>To begin this hp monitor is in no way meant to be classified as a gaming monitor or used for it but that’s what I used it for. It holds up great picture quality while not having any dead pixels or dim sections. Definitely a solid beginner monitor to choose!</span>

<span>I bought this monitor back in 2016. This monitor is still alive till this day, I do love the monitor a lot it was a worth while investment until i finally got a new monitor to play around with. Definitely one of my go to monitors on a budget as it is a beauty.<br/><br/>Good:<br/>I played different genre games with this, and it is keeping up with the graphically intensive game (Monster Hunter World (Average Graphics Quality). Other games included in the mix: Final Fantasy XIV, League of Legends (high average settings), and  Blazblue: Central Fiction.<br/><br/>The monitor will last you for a long time if you are taking care of it, as well by not overtaxing the usage of the settings of the monitor (Brightness to Max)<br/><br/>Buttons are great for my standards. They are easy to press and also it gives me an easy setup in the monitor brightness when the sun's glare is messing with the monitor.<br/><br/>The monitors base is a good base that you dont see in other monitors which allows you to put stuff under the monitor, like wireless charger, and glasses case to name a few.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/>For a monitor, it is no pure gaming monitor, with the 7ms Response Time. Games that requires the player to react instantly may show an upsetting result, as they input it on time as they see the move, but due to a small delay it results on a Win or Lose situation.<br/><br/>AC adapter to monitor, it is loose when you try to move the cable, but it is not to a point where it can come off with a slight pull of the wire. It is more when you are trying to move the monitor place to place that it somehow  AC adapter connected to the monitor is a comes off but not completely, still hanging from the monitor. I do manage to remind myself that it will do that, so in the end I just check if the plug is really plugged in every time I move my monitor around my desk.</span>

<span>I've had no trouble from this monitor for the last 5.5 years. I initially wanted one with a speaker, but found a tiny bluetooth substitute to quell that need going forward. It's been good for surfing and media watching.<br/><br/>I have one small complaint. Now that I'm looking for a second one to complete a dual monitor setup, I realize just how huge the border on this thing is. It will be distracting. I can overcome my annoyance, it's just that. But why even bother putting a thin bezel if they were going to put a thick border? I'm sure the technology was there to make it bezeless. I think they just wanted to make the monitor seem bigger than it actually was and save a few bucks on plastic. I'll deal with it to have a matching set. But yeah, a half inch border on a multi monitor setup is not particularly cool look when they are turned on and being used.</span>

<span>This is coming from the perspective of someone who games and occasionally does image and video editing.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>  - Standard widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio.<br/>  - Standard zoom, this was my second monitors and compared to other cheap monitors I've gotten my hands on, this one wasn't deceptive. (Some would be a similar size but be zoomed in so you wouldn't actually get as much screen real estate.)<br/>  - Great horizontal viewing angles. There's a sweet spot, but the image is generally good as far as you go.<br/>  - Good color reproduction. I don't know anything about the fine details of color accuracy in monitors, but it seems pretty accurate out of the box.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  - Awful vertical viewing angles, such a small viewing angle. At least all that happens is that the image gets a bit dark, which is better than other effects I've seen, but the angle is crazy narrow.<br/><br/>Possible compatibility issues:<br/>  - Cables go out the back instead of the bottom. This is probably more standard among thinner monitors, but take note of the extra space that your cables will take up behind the monitor.<br/>  - No VESA mounting option. You're using the included stand, period.<br/><br/>The things it gets right are all things I care about, the compatibility issues are pretty minimal for casual use, my main gripe is with the vertical viewing angle, it's bad enough to lower my rating to 4 stars, but from my (very limited) experience, I think I'm happy with what I got for what I paid.</span>

<span>I’ve had this screen over 3 years. At first I was skeptical about it being it wasn’t a name brand and the price but I took a gamble. I have no issues getting to the 200Hz range of course paired with a good video card I shouldn’t. I had issues in the beginning but it was my VC firmware. After the update I haven’t had any other issues. I use the DP connection. Ensure you go buy you a good DP cable because cheap ones will not work as intended. I planned on keeping it for 4 years so it is time for me to get rid of it with my new build the end of the year. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a budget screen and knows what they are doing to get the most out of it. If you don’t cheap out on your VC and cable you’ll be fine.</span>

<span>Was shopping online with my son for his first gaming PC (which we decided upon an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU with Nvidia RTX 2060 Super GPU model) and I quickly realized handing him down my old Samsung 27" 1080p 60hz LCD monitor as was the original plan would have been a total waste of his new computer!<br/><br/>So having saved a couple hundred bucks buying a pre-built instead of building our own with the same specs (as PC components are experiencing shortages cause of COVID-19 and have gone up drastically in price), I told my son he could pick out any monitor on Amazon he wanted on a budget of $300, and he picked out this one.<br/><br/>I could instantly see why he chose this model which at 30" was bigger than most other gaming monitors with decent specs at this price range and it was an ultrawide, which made me proud (like him being a chip off the old block) as I game on a 49" super ultrawide monitor myself. But the real "wow factor" of this model, of course, is the 200hz refresh rate which is a rarity in itself especially for ultrawides but almost unheard of at this price range.<br/><br/>The only thing I wasn't sure about was I wasn't familiar with the Sceptre brand. Generally as a rule I've stayed away from buying displays from lesser-known manufacturers as with panels you often get what you pay for and "cheap" usually turns out more "expensive" in the long run, if not just "frustrating" and "disappointing".<br/><br/>But this was my son's computer and his pick for the monitor and I was proud that he did all his own research so I wanted to support him. So Sceptre it was!<br/><br/>Well I'm glad I didn't say anything cause this monitor rocks! The colors looked great straight out of the box and I haven't felt the need to do any calibration of any sort. Contrast and blacks are above average on this display and well beyond my expectations for a sub-$300 model. Even though there's no HDR and I believe it's rated at just 250 nits, it looks much brighter than that, possibly because of its high native contrast.<br/><br/>But what both my son and I were most looking forward to see, of course, was how it performed at 200hz. So I fired up 3DMark and ran a few benchmark tests and...WOW!<br/><br/>The motion on all frame rates was buttery smooth. On some tests we were reaching fps of over 600 so we knew we hit the monitor's 200 frames per second limit and it looked incredible! No tearing or ghosting or any sign of distortion whatsoever. My own 49" super ultrawide only goes up to 144hz and I could see a discernible difference in frame rate running identical tests on our PCs both of which were pushing frames well beyond the limits of our monitors. This monitor's 200hz refresh rate is legit!<br/><br/>Another great feature of this monitor is its support of AMD Freesync. It worked flawlessly with my son's RTX 2060 Super both in fullscreen and windowed mode, even though the Nvidia Control Panel said the monitor wasn't "validated as G-SYNC Compatible". I've actually had problems in the past getting this compatibility feature to work on other Freesync monitors so was really relieved to find it working perfectly on the Sceptre.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic gaming monitor that performs well in all its highlighted and advertised features, and phenomenally when you also factor in its price. Highly recommended and most importantly for me is my son couldn't be happier!</span>
