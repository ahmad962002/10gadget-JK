<span>First time reviewer, monitor came and is very nice.  Camera is completely dead though.  Unless it is a user error,  I don't know because trying to get help is like torture.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I had high hopes for this monitor however, however it had three main issues, first, the camera was flickering and the video quality was not good at all, and second, the sound from the monitor was really bad, and I had to use the laptop's built-in sound, third, an extra cable is needed for the webcam. I returned it.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This monitor has a lot for a good price.  Only issue is that the brightness at 100% is what I like for my general viewing.  So it's OK for me, but if I wanted a brighter screen, I'd be out of luck.</span>

<span>Sigh... I purchased an HDMI cord because I read a review that one might be needed for the monitor to be compatible with a laptop. Fine. Whatever. What I needed was a monitor with an integrated web cam. When the monitor arrived no cords arrived with it. I was able to use my purchase HDMI to connect the monitor, but the USB ports and web cam don't work at all. Apparently these require a USB 3.0 cord, which was not included either.<br/><br/>So much for the integrated web cam.

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>Works great, no dead pixels.  This is a budget-priced monitor, with bright, high-contrast picture quality for everyday use.  Videos are smooth and crispy-clear.  I am not a gamer, so I can't rate super-speed performance on games.  You don't get angle or height adjustment, but you can always use a riser and still save a bundle of money over other monitors.</span>

<span>I have two very old, inexpesive 18" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.<br/>I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.</span>

<span>Nice prompt delivery, well packaged.  Picture is good.  The tweaking selections are all on the back which makes it  hard to adjust since you can't see both sides at once, but if you get it figured out, finally, there are no complaints, but I wish it had a front bar or screen for that.  I think I could then really tweak it well.  Speakers are okay, again they face backwards instead of out the front where I am, and my computer speakers are better,  and there is no way to switch them or add stereo, which I could do if the setting was there for it.  But I could do headphones if I wanted that.  But for the money it's not a bad deal at all.  I got the 24 inch.  I desperately needed a bigger screen and this helped me out!  The color is good for my artwork.  I did have to call tech support for a question and they were very nice and helpful.  Not a super-perfect product but a really good one, and a great deal for the price.  Thanks!</span>

<span>This screen's specs can't be beat, except by Samsung's 4K 240Hz Odyssey Neo G8 which really isn't worth it unless you got a PC that can drive something that ridiculous and still have $1500 to blow. What will wow most people about the G7 is the color reproduction and contrast, which due to the VA panel and Samsung's QLED tech is inherently miles ahead of common TN or IPS screens. Since Samsung gives you a pretty solid neutral config out of the box it will look great even without touching the picture settings, but if you look up some test patterns and customize it will be even better.<br/><br/>Another great part that you'll notice more with certain games is of course the fast refresh rate and response time. Use VRR/g-sync for best results and enjoy the seemingly nonexistent ghosting and input lag. This is my favorite thing about the G7 and what I think justifies the somewhat high price tag (which isn't really so bad when on sale). Usually you have to look at tradeoffs between great looking color and these high performance gaming specs, but the G7 feels like a no-compromises solution for most users who aren't doing some kind of color-sensitive professional work or playing FPS games at a pro level (in which case I would think such a big screen wouldn't be practical anyway).<br/><br/>There are a few issues with this G7 that I've run into. The most obvious is inversion artifacts in some situations, most easily triggered by test patterns and certain combinations of browser and website dark modes. It has not been a dealbreaker for me because artifacts have not appeared with "real" content aside from websites, and you can be sure I was squinting at every moving object in games for the first couple of weeks. The pattern is sensitive to the Black Equalizer setting, so it may be worth experimenting with if you're not too bothered by inversion but want to minimize it.<br/><br/>Next problem is that in the out of the box configuration, using VRR/g-sync will result in scanline-like artifacts and flickering while in-game. This is fixed by enabling "VRR Control" which is hidden at the bottom of the second page of system settings. You have to be on the latest firmware to have this so make sure to check the Samsung website and confirm you've got the latest. VRR control ought to be on by default to avoid the issue but it isn't. While you're in the menu, turn off "Dynamic Contrast", a feature that seems to just make the picture look worse.<br/><br/>PS5 support is fine, it takes 4K input and downscales it which is great news until the PS5 gets 2K support. But the monitor's HDMI port is version 2.0 so you are limited to 4K@60hz (with or without HDR) due to HDMI 2.0 bandwidth. Theoretically 2K@120Hz without HDR should be possible but I have not been able to try the PS5 beta firmware and confirm.<br/><br/>HDR: It's pretty new to me, so I don't know where to set expectations. First thing I did in HDR was Ghost of Tsushima and I found it kind of underwhelming. I think the game was made to look amazing with or without HDR, so going from a good VA panel without HDR to one with HDR didn't blow me away. The effect was more noticeable in movies. I watched "The Night House", a recent horror movie that was released in HDR, and the first four "Star Trek" films which were remastered in HDR. For "Night House", it was really nice and the contrast between bright and dark scenes made it feel more like watching in the cinema. In the "Star Trek" movies, the extra brightness in space battles was welcome. There was a scene in "The Wrath of Khan" that seemed to confuse the local dimming algorithm, resulting in noticeably brighter/darker rectangles crawling across the screen behind the Enterprise. This may be a limitation of HDR on an edge-lit screen. Overall, nice to have but not a game changer at least in this implementation.<br/><br/>Some words about the non-screen bits. I have it mounted to a monitor arm, which works great, the necessary VESA bracket is included. I am happy to report that the power LED (which you can set to be off when the screen is on) is not very bright. I'm sick of my living room glowing blue at night so I appreciate Samsung not adding to the problem here. Headphone users will appreciate the headphone jack for your HDMI and DP audio, which I use a lot because my motherboard has a noisy headphone jack. A remote for volume control would be nice, but sadly it's not available. Whether or not you get software volume control may depend on your GPU and operating system: my PC with a 3080 does have one, but my Mac does not, and I have not been able to get DisplayBuddy working. Consoles do not have software volume control on the HDMI output. The included stand has a headphone holder on the back, which seems like a weird choice for such a big monitor. Some of Samsung's earlier gaming monitors had a headphone holder that pops out of the side, which would have been better but I suppose more difficult to implement on a curved screen.<br/><br/>Something I have found surprisingly annoying is switching between inputs. My setup looks like this: DisplayPort1 is connected a gaming PC, DisplayPort2 to a Mac, and HDMI to a device for toggling between my PS5 and Nintendo Switch. The only scenario that works well is switching between one of the DP inputs and HDMI when both inputs are on. Any other scenario, changing inputs is going to take 20+ seconds for everything to settle and the monitor might become unresponsive until you unplug and reconnect the DisplayPort input you want. No other monitor I've used has been this annoying.<br/><br/>Overall: For me this looks like it will be the perfect main display for several years, or more if higher resolutions take a while to take off. Do your research and be aware of the issues before deciding to buy based on the specs alone.</span>

<span>Ive noticed that there are too many reviews with incorrect/uneducated information.  Im going to break this down simply.<br/><br/>Requirements:<br/>In order to get 240 HZ 10 Bit color you need DSC (display port compression) graphics card otherwise you are limited to 8 bit.  This also has to be set manually in the NVIDIA / AMD control panels.<br/><br/>GPU capable of even achieving 240HZ and if you plan to game with this depending on the game /settings you may need a very high end GPU to hit high enough in the fps range to utilize as much as the refresh rate advantage as possible.<br/><br/>Proper display port cables/ The ones it comes with from the OEM.<br/><br/>Issues:<br/>Flickering - Completely resolved by the latest firmware update as near as i can tell. Latest firmware update contains a VRR control that you must set in the monitor menu.<br/><br/>Backlight Bleed - its there and very apparent when the screen is completely black. Its not oled and its not FALD. It does have light zones though. This should be a non issue for the actual target reason to buy this monitor.<br/><br/>Stuck Pixels - I got one with stuck pixels. It wasnt just one it was several in different areas. Its why i bought directly from amazon. Shipped it back. Got a different one without the issues.<br/><br/>Panels Broken in shipping - Yes Samsung has an issue with this. 1000R curves will break at a high percentage during shipping. No real way around this due to the curve and carrier handling. If you can buy from a big box store that sells them regularly in store.  they usually are shipped on pallets together and arent as mishandled by carriers.<br/><br/>"My mac cannot detect this all the time Bro.. I have to unplug the cable and plug it back in" This at the current time appears to be true. though for some reason apple cannot ever seem to get this simple thing that windows has been doing since the 90s right. Its a problem for lots of monitors on their latest build of Big Sur and its a problem on their new apple silicone(m1) with their own cpu/gpu. I observed it on my own mac mini with the m1 PROC.<br/><br/>No ultimate gysnc module - Yep it doesnt have it. Look up the BOM for it on the internet. then ask yourself would you pay maybe double for this monitor to have that module? Ive noticed no gsync issues with monitor and i personally cannot tell any justifiable  difference between this and gysnc ultimate on a x27 predator i owned.<br/><br/>Samsung service is terrible - In my individual opinion they are. Every comment online i have read about interacting with them is terrible. Its why i bought from amazon and made sure all was working.<br/><br/>Slight vertical lines( non dead/ on broken pixel rows) - Yes this VA panel may have them. They show up in certain colors and brightness's in certain spots of the monitor. These are extremely subtle and i doubt most people will notice unless they really are looking or super uptight about quality.<br/><br/>Rumored issues:<br/><br/>Ghosting - Your high if you think so. Look at the Youtuve videos of the UFO test. This thing performs and has low response times. gtg 1ms<br/><br/>HDR - Its HDR 600 and no FALD. They dont advertise it as FALD. HDR is noticeable and makes a difference in some games.  Its not going to wow you and this isnt an issue with this monitor. HDR works at pretty much the level your paying for in my opinion.<br/><br/>So why the five star review?<br/><br/>1. Curve is 1000R. For me life changing eye comfort.<br/>2. 240 HZ 10 Bit color. Smoothest gameplay at 1440P i Have ever seen.  If you can run at 240 FPS the game your playing its beautifully smooth. (There isnt a huge difference between 144hz and 240 that i can see but its still awesome)<br/>3. 240 HZ productivity. window movement and any motion that can take advantage is beautifully smooth.<br/>4. RGB lighting is nice<br/>5. Color is nice<br/>6. HDR while not the FALD 1000 NIT wow factor its i think pretty good for what you pay for.<br/>7. Overall design... Very nice. stands out.<br/>8. Power cable length. I have a slightly higher desk and lots of my cables don't reach. this one did.<br/>9. Dual Display<br/>10. Settings to adjust for gaming/response/performance/etc.<br/>11. Monitor button. Very nice to switch between two computers.<br/>12 Bezel... its not thing and technically its a bezel inside of a bezel which is common to give the appearance of a smaller bezel.<br/>13. Mine included a vesa mount plate.<br/>14. Super USB charging<br/><br/>Is this monitor perfect? no its not. Is this monitor catering to something uniquely awesome 1000R 240hz 10 Bit color? Yes it is.<br/><br/>I love this monitor. you can nitpick all the imperfections and obsess over them.  When using this monitor I don't even want to ever touch another x27 predator or a asus pg27uq(regarded as the best monitor ever made by many).  Reality has become this is my go to monitor.</span>

<span>This is a really awesome monitor. 240hz is super smooth (not a super big upgrade from 144 to be honest, but I notice it). SUPER bright screen that I wasn't really expecting, and now all my older monitors look so dim :P. Colors are nice and the size is good. I think 27" is a good size to start using a curved monitor. I think some of the default settings are really kinda eh, and some of the other profiles included don't really give the correct feel for what I want. I would mess around a but with local dimming and some color adjustment.<br/><br/>As this is my first curved monitor, I was a little anxious about it. The curve just seemed so unnatural and sitting down at it after I had set it up, I thought maybe it was a bad idea. Turns out it is really nice to have!  I got used to it super fast and its kinda weird how much more immersive it is to play games with a curve.<br/><br/>I think one thing to keep in mind: since it is a curved monitor the stand is huge! I have a skinny desk and to fit my deskpad AND the monitor is a little bit of an issue. I'd probably look into a mount or larger desk if you're interested in this. All in all, best monitor I've had!</span>

I purchased in Jan 2021 and updated to the latest firmware and this monitor is perfect.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>-240hz is gorgeous and it's obviously why you are on this page looking at this monitor. There isn't a ton of competition in the 240hz 1440p market right now<br/>-VA panel is done very well by Samsung. VA panels have typically not been executed well by other manufactures, but Samsung has been doing VA panels with their TVs for a long time, so they have all the kinks worked out.<br/>-Color was great out of the box, minor tweaks made it perfect.<br/>-Curved screen helps me not "lose sight" of things in the corners and far edges of the screen. 27" is a big monitor, if you are going from a 24 or 25 to a 27, you will probably have a transition period going to 27 and the curve definitely makes a difference.<br/>-Zero issues with ghosting, the top review on Amazon says he had major issues but I have had zero on this monitor. I have had it on previous monitors, so I know what it is. He may have just gotten a bad monitor or firmware not update. Don't let that dissuade you from this monitor<br/>-Was on sale when I got this for $599 and used a ton of rewards on it as well. Good deal at the time for me.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>-Curve is jarring for some people, it looks goofy, but loved it now almost two months later. Won't know until you try it. Free returns with Amazon, so worth a shot IMO.<br/>-HDR is supposedly not bright enough for some people? I didn't have that issue but most of my games are not HDR, so this was a non-issue for me.<br/>-Firmware NEEDS to be updated before using.<br/>-Price? I don't know, that is obviously relative. Gaming and technology are my main hobbies, I will happily spend money on them.<br/>-Back panel cover is flimsy, some people broke it by not being careful. I knew that going in, so wasn't an issue.<br/>-VA isn't IPS? I had no complains with my picture quality or performance whatsoever.<br/><br/>COMPUTER USED<br/>i9-10850k @ 5.0<br/>RTX 3090 Evga XC3<br/>Corsair Hydro X cooling<br/>32gb 3600mhz<br/>All ssds are M.2 NVMe<br/><br/>GAMES PLAYED<br/>-CSGO - main game, noticeable difference between 144hz and 240hz, very very smooth.<br/>-PUBG - game is still clunky as hell, but getting ~200fps makes it feel slightly better lol.<br/>-CoD Cold War + Warzone - feels buttery smooth running at 240fps consistently at competitively high settings<br/><br/>ALTERNATIVES (prices as of 3/11/21)<br/>-Samsung G7 in 32" at $798 - it is the same monitor but just bigger, so the 1440p will be blurrier. My sweet-spot is 27" and want the same size to match my secondary monitor<br/>-Samsung G9 in 49" at $1400 - this really isn't comparable as it is twice the price and it's unbelievably ultrawide. A very niche product IMO. I have a 34" Ultrawide 1440p monitor at work and I love it, but I cannot imagine something this big.  I have a powerful computer and I don't see the point of running like a flight sim on this as my 3090 is no where close to maxing out frame rate.<br/>-Dell Alienware AW2721D at $767 - this was my only really competitor that I was considering. It basically had all the specs that I wanted, the difference being IPS vs VA and Curved vs Non-curved. The main factor was timing and the Dell was $200 more expensive than the G7 on the time of my purchase, so I went with the G7. I have been a big fan of Dell monitors for a long time (work, gaming and personal use). I was replacing a 1440p 144hz Dell TN panel monitor I got on Amazon warehouse used for a great price many years ago. It is now my secondary monitor.<br/>-HP Omen X 27" at $609 - TN panel was not in the cards, I wanted to upgrade to either VA or IPS for this price point. People also complained about the VESA mount (requirement for me) and the matte on the screen. I also HATED the look of the bottom bezel area.<br/><br/>OTHER NOTES<br/>Two months in, I love this monitor and I have no regrets whatsoever. Sorry if the review is all over the place, hopefully still helpful to some in deciding their next upgrade.<br/><br/>Turn your g-sync on, read the blurbusters article if necessary on it. If you are gonna spend the money on a nice monitor, use it to the full extent.<br/>-G-Sync On in Nvidia control panel (both full screen and window mode)<br/>-V-Sync On in Nvidia control panel<br/>-V-sync Off in game settings<br/>-Cap FPS 1-3 fps below monitor max refresh (237 in this case)</span>

<span>Really like the functionality of this monitor.  Cannot testify about gaming don't use those.  However, the power cord is got some type of flaw attachment.  When you move the monitor or touch the cord the power cuts out and you have to find just the right spot for it to come back on.  Limits the ability to turn it to different angle when in use for zoom or such type meetings.

Unfortunately while the description on Amazon says it's VESA mountable that is NOT TRUE.  Samsung does not provide any screws to mount into the full motion desk mount arm I have.

<span>It’s a solid QHD display- colors are good. But the video conferencing components are lacking.<br/><br/>The camera is acceptable but poor compared to modern video conference cameras. I do like that it can be retracted though.<br/><br/>The speaker quality is very poor. For video conferencing it gets the job done and is loud enough, but I would not recommend using them for music.<br/><br/>The microphone quality is also basic- doesn’t cancel our background noise.<br/><br/>I’m an Apple user and a couple of little things bug me- like the fact that I have to go through a clunky menu on the display itself to control volume and brightness.<br/><br/>Overall, it works as an entry level setup, but it’s not on the same level as the Apple display.

<span>This was by far one of the easiest monitors I've assembled.  Literally took me less than 5 min to attach stand.  Love the that height is adjustable and it has tilt as well.  Picture quality is great.  Some reviews stated poor picture quality or that screen was brighter on one side of that picture quality had to be fine tuned.  I had none of these issues.

<span>I'm very happy with this monitor.  I was able to try it out at a former employer's office.  At home, I had a larger monitor and unfortunately, larger isn't always better.<br/><br/>I like this size of this display.  My monitor is only about 24" away from my face and I have decent vision with diminishing reading vision.  Looking at a larger monitor was more than annoying, it just wasn't good to use and it made me not want to use my home computer.<br/><br/>Using this monitor at 1920 x 1080 (recommended for this screen), and having the magnification set to 100% (Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display = "smaller") is great!<br/><br/>I don't do gaming and I haven't used the internal speakers.  Can't rate those.<br/><br/>I sometimes change the color settings to help minimize the impact on viewing screens late at night (Warm, Neutral, Cool, Low Blue Light, Night, Reading, HP Enhance +, or Custom RGB).  This is helpful.<br/><br/>I am able to tilt the screen down and up with ease.  And the rotate to portrait is great (raise display to highest settings and tilt back to clear the desk), but my old laptop can't change the settings to view in portrait.<br/><br/>I recommend this monitor.  It's great that it can also go on a stand that holds double screens.  And with the very thin left and right frame sides, it would be a great monitor to use 2 or 3 side-by-side.</span>

<span>I bought this so I could consolidate all of the work from home peripherals that have become a tangled mess on my system.  I like the quality of the camera, the audio is pretty good for the size of the speakers and the quality of the display is very good.  That being said, I much prefer having my Dell docking station for the single USB-C connection to my laptop.  The USB-C coming from the monitor causes my Dell Precision laptop to throw warnings about not having enough power (90 watt USB-C from the monitor), so I have to use my power brick with it and have my laptop connected to the monitor.  My Blue Microphone is my preference, not the semi-cheap one built into this monitor, and plugging it into the monitors provided USB3 causes the Blue mic to have some delay issues...I will continue to futz with it to get it working well...hopefully, but my whole reason for buying it was to reduce the complexity of my setup...which isn't happening so far.</span>

<span>I was working from home, had two monitors, a laptop, a docking station and a jabra speaker phone.  Since I do a lot of video conferencing I thought this would be the perfect solution to get rid of all the extra wires and devices.<br/>THE GOOD: Monitor quality is superb.  Very bright, very crisp. Just a nice sharp picture.  The size is awesome for having multiple windows open.  The camera quality is nice and sharp, very happy with it.  The build quality of the monitor is nice and sturdy as well.<br/>THE BAD: As soon as I started using it I had people saying they had trouble hearing me, as if I was either muffled or too quiet.  I changed all sorts of microphone settings and increased the volume...nothing fixed it.  Then the speaker that is built into also is rather quiet.  If I'm on a call and the diswasher or dryer or even just a fan is going, I can start to have trouble hearing people.  Again, I went out to the website and searched and tried all sorts of fixes and yes both the volume on the monitor and the computer were turned all the way up.  Tried playing around with the noise suppression settings too.  Just not much volume out of this.<br/><br/>So overall I'm fairly happy.  As a monitor, it is really nice and the camera built in is nice.  But one of the key selling features of this monitor is the conferencing portion and I feel like where audio is concerned, they dropped the ball.  After playing around and struggling for almost a month, I hooked my Jabra Speak 510 back up and use that for all my conferencing audio.  Probably would have been better off to just get a cheaper monitor of the same size and picture quality if I had known audio would be this bad.</span>

<span>I wanted a monitor that did everything reasonably well without a lot of fuss and with easy connectivity.  If this was my only monitor it would be fine.  However, I have a second DP monitor.  Since (to my surprise) there is no DP port out on this brand new monitor (!?!) and since this monitor only gives full sound/camera/mic functionality if connected by USB-C ... there is no way to use this monitor as my hub without abandoning my DP monitor.  I had to keep my old hub and all of the extra cables connections I had hoped to eliminate in order to use my second monitor.<br/><br/>I agree with the comment on the camera... not a huge deal for me but for the price point these are two significant misses in my book.</span>

<span>Eleven days of owning and no issues, but after reading the reviews and seeing all of this crap said about DisplayPort ports dying, non-mountable, not powering on, Sceptre isn't a brand name.<br/>I'm left to ask a serious question. Are any of you taking into mind what comes with the monitor, taking advantage of it, and using the right equipment.<br/><br/>I'm gonna cover a lot of this in this review.<br/><br/>'Sceptre is not a brand name'<br/>___________________________<br/>What? Sceptre is a relatively big brand and a decent one at that. Though they've always been on the budget friendlier side of the equation, and there's tons of research you can do on it to reinforce my claims.<br/><br/>'DisplayPort dying within a month'<br/>________________________________<br/>If this ever happens, there are several things that need to be considered.<br/>1. Was this during a graphics driver update? If so, unplug the DisplayPort cable, connect an HDMI, DDU your drivers, and install again with the cable in fresh.<br/><br/>2. What kind of DisplayPort cable are you using? I don't care if the monitor came with one. I don't care if you have a DisplayPort cable laying around.<br/>Purchase a VESA Certified cable and ONLY use VESA Certified cables like this one - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CD1FB3A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1<br/>Cables can kill a DisplayPort rendering it entirely useless. Stop being cheap and making up excuses for your monitors port dying out.<br/><br/>'How do I mount the monitor?'<br/>____________________________<br/>There's a VESA Certified mounting plate that comes with this monitor. You need to already have a mount setup and ready to use, and be ready to make sure the mount supports the monitors weight.<br/>After that, attach the mounting plate to the monitor, and then screw it in with the screw provided for the stand. After that, you want to mount this to your VESA mount, yes it will flex the plate, but at least it's keeping the monitor stable. Continue to mount until tightened.<br/>All mounts should be compatible.<br/><br/>Please stop coming to Amazon ready to complain about something you may have caused on your own.<br/>Sceptre doesn't deserve to be strung out all over the place because of human error.<br/>If you encounter any sort of issue on opening, you need to be in their Amazon messages issuing a return or RMA, not writing asinine reviews and giving the company a bad rep.<br/><br/>Onto my opinions!<br/>This is a budget monitor, it has BUDGET MONITOR ISSUES.<br/>The monitor looks great, sure. Though I will say, this monitor doesn't exactly achieve the whole ultrawide appeal to the fullest extreme. Yes, it's great. Though I feel wider would've been a little more genuine to the ultrawide claim.<br/>So far, I love it. Though I have noticed, if you don't mess with the settings properly, there is ghosting, dull looking image, and so on.<br/><br/>NVIDIA users should completely avoid this monitor.<br/>There's been countless reports of this monitor flat out not achieving 144Hz+ 100FPS+ goals on this panel. A lot of it seems to lean to this monitor being tied to FreeSync and not cross compatible.<br/>I use an RX 5600 XT and have hardly any issue.<br/>All of these things need to be taken completely into account before you buy this.<br/><br/>I can recommend this monitor to responsible people who are actually going to verify issues, and obtain the proper equipment before purchasing, as you should.<br/>I like it, I will likely be upgrading though. This is likely going to be a media monitor for me in the near future, just because I think I'd like stacked ultrawide panels and a different panel.<br/><br/>Gaming works fine on here, though there's a reported issue of ghosting at 200Hz. I can't test this myself, though I'm sure it's something that can be fixed.<br/><br/>Hopefully everything I covered was at least of some use to people, thank you for reading.</span>

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

<span>I’ve had this screen over 3 years. At first I was skeptical about it being it wasn’t a name brand and the price but I took a gamble. I have no issues getting to the 200Hz range of course paired with a good video card I shouldn’t. I had issues in the beginning but it was my VC firmware. After the update I haven’t had any other issues. I use the DP connection. Ensure you go buy you a good DP cable because cheap ones will not work as intended. I planned on keeping it for 4 years so it is time for me to get rid of it with my new build the end of the year. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a budget screen and knows what they are doing to get the most out of it. If you don’t cheap out on your VC and cable you’ll be fine.</span>

<span>One drawback is when it comes to PC's and Monitors, you won't know for sure until you try it out for yourself. You can ask the seller questions, but sometimes the question you should have asked isn't obvious until the thing is sitting on your desk. It may boil down to something very specific to your application/environment/ergonomics that the seller, or even the manufacturer can't give you a definitive answer because of the subjective nature of sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time.<br/>  A big help for me in determining which to order is to download the user manual and quick set-up guides from the Manufacturer Website. By carefully reading the specs and going through the OSD Menu entries I am sure that what I'm ordering, at least on paper, has the right specs. This way, the monitors should have all the right comparable specs and you should end up with what you really want. Still, as was it was in my case you may have to try it out before you can finalize the purchase.<br/>  I need a widescreen curved monitor such as this 30" Scepter with PBP (split screen) so as to be able to work on documents from two different inputs, i.e. two PC's. So I am reviewing this from more of a business angle, not from a Gaming criteria.<br/>  Basically, it is a simple, single-purpose gaming PC Monitor. If used just for gaming on an Nvidia Graphics PC, it works as advertised. You've got to match video cards, max res, number and type of inputs, hdmi 1.4, 2.0? Is Displayport 1.2 enough?  I finally narrowed down to a 30-32 inch 21:9 ultrawide, curved, (gaming) monitor though I would only use it for business. I need a split screen with quick and easy transition from one input to another. To change inputs from one PC to another on this monitor requires 11 button pushes and the dual split-screens are squished horizontally as determined by the screen width and 2560hz horizontal resolution. Nothing really wrong with the monitor itself. My opinion is that this monitor should be best acknowledged as a single input Gaming monitor. It was not quite suitable for my application. Better would be a wider monitor with higher horizontal frequency.<br/>  The Wall Plate though not it's intended use can be  attaching it to a standard 4 hole Vesa mounting arm plate. It comes with a 75mm 4 hole Adapter, so it can be done. Two little bolts attach one side to the monitor, the other side can be fastened to a regular Monitor mounting plate (75mm hole pattern) on the extended arm of your vesa desktop stand mounted to your desk .  You will have to obtain an additional four M4 x 20mm bolts, with washers and nuts to bolt (fasten) Wall Mount to the Vesa plate of your stand. Easily accomplished except for  obtaining your own hardware. No wall plate screws are supplied as there are different types of wall mounts.<br/>  At this price point, as I've mentioned, this monitor is designed to work best with a PC having an Nvidia Video Card using GSync. They tell you up front how it's designed to work. With the right hardware you can get the 160 - 200 hz frequency for high-end gaming. With Displayport 1.2  I was able to get 120hz picture that was good enough for ordinary Windows 10 desktop, but I can't comment how it would work for gaming. Need Displayport 1.4, or Hdmi 2.0 to obtain 160-200hz. The Nvidia drivers must be up to date and can be downloaded from Nvidia Website. The driver page lists a long paragraph of Nvidia cards compatible with that driver. It may work well enough with other PC video cards as well, but I was using an old GT 620. No problem with the latest driver but not suitable for intensive gaming.<br/>  Using with a Mac, (I have a Macbook Pro) is a crapshoot. Older Macs are designed to work with older Mac compatible hardware. This monitor, as is the case with the majority of OEM generic monitors, is directed at the Windows PC Market. If it works with your Mac, well and good, but don't count on it, not for serious gaming for sure. My 2011 Macbook Pro has early thunderbolt - backwards compatible with mini-displayport. I used a mini-displayport cable with short mini-displayport to Displayport adapter. Macbook has a 2560x1440 spec video output. It connected with the monitor but full-screen picture was a little vertically flattened, (i.e.horizontall stretched); not acceptable. Mac System Preferences Display Icon showed 1080p. That is correct, but the Macbook is designed for 4:3 ratio. My Macbook was never intended to handle 21:9 aspect ratio; not the fault of the monitor. Works perfect though with my 21.5 inch Acer screen. Newer macs with thunderbolt 3, a.k.a. USB-C should be compatible with USB-C input monitors.<br/>  In order to avoid the hassle of a return, my advice is to ask the seller - better yet, download the manual, especially with third-party sellers as return shipping is pretty expensive. Be aware of the intended use and specs and consider that in order to get a monitor with better options, you might have to spend another $100.00 or more.  What I could determine is that used as intended and properly set up, it will do what is advertised at 160hz For business, with dual inputs, maybe not, but the manufacturer does not advertise it as anything but designed for gaming so I really can't complain. I had to try it to find out.<br/><br/>Walter O.</span>

<span>Bought this for WFH and casual gaming with an Xbox Series S. I was surprised to have receive the IPS version. I actually prefer IPS but some people do not so heads up. I have divided the review between WFH and casual gaming:<br/><br/>OFFICE USE<br/>Pros:<br/>- Wide viewing angles<br/>- Consistent accurate looking colors<br/>- HDMI allowing for easy connection to laptops<br/>- VESA<br/>- High resolution allows for 'more' on the screen at once<br/>- Adjustable screen with fliters etc<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- unsure what panel you may receive (&lt;- big one)<br/>- no speakers<br/>- dummy thicc bezels<br/>- non adjustable stand<br/><br/>While I consider some of these cons, I will not take stars off as I knew this prior to buying the monitor. They need to sort out what panel they are shipping. Overall for office and WFH it is a great monitor.<br/><br/>Gaming<br/>Pros<br/>- Freesync compatible (48 - 75) over hdmi<br/>- FPS counter built into monitor<br/>- low input latency<br/>- low pixel response time<br/>- 1440p<br/><br/>Con<br/>- Only 75hz<br/>- No HDR<br/><br/>Perfect fit for Xbox Series S. Was surprised to see this monitor has freesync as well as an FPS counter. Tested on Xbox One and Series S and it worked perfectly. While it does not compare to my 144Hz LG gaming monitor, this is good enough to get some wins ;) Low latency compared to some TVs and the pixel response is good enough to not completely blur the image (IPS panel). As with the WFH section, while I put items in the con section, they are to be expected so no stars off.<br/><br/>TLDR<br/>It's a good monitor for work as the resolution allows for windows/programs to be visible at one time and the IPS provides good viewing angles and colors. Good for casual PC/Xbox Series S gaming as the 1440p screen is high resolution for how far you will be sitting and the refresh rate fits these devices well (especially the Series S). Low pixel blur and low input latency as well. Overall good work/play monitor for the price.</span>

<span>Okay, so I bought this a while back as a second monitor. I do photography and videography, but only need to deliver in sRGB for the internet, so the 100% sRGB appealed to me (I managed to get to 99.8% of the sRGB gamut with DisplayCal). Surprisingly, though, I learned that I was getting nearly 89% of the AdobeRGB and 91% of the DCI-P3 gamuts when calibrated and verified. These are very good numbers, ones that even an LG 27UN850-W monitor costing almost twice as much doesn't even come close to.<br/><br/>This is a good choice as a monitor for office work, imaging and viewing films. What I most like about this monitor is the unobtrusive anti-reflective coating, the lack of blooming of white on black text and the very reliable color accuracy. I don't game with it because I'm a responsible adult with a wide range of other time-sucking hobbies, but I'm sure with the meager refresh rate, it's not going to satisfy any hardcore gamers. But what I need it for, for doing some (non-critical) color-correct viewing, it meets and surpasses my expectations. The only downside for that is some inconsistency in the brightness uniformity. But this is absolutely forgivable for my purposes and I hardly even notice it.<br/><br/>However, the brightness uniformity issue some have written about here leads to my next point about build quality. Here there are some issues. I suspect the uniformity issue is an issue of inconsistent quality control, because mine is tolerable and not as bad as some of the other examples seen here. Also, quality control was no doubt at issue when my monitor started developing vertical black lines after one year. This is caused by the adhesive degrading and the electrical inputs that connect to the display losing contact. I called AOC about it, I was asked to provide a few pictures and then I sent the monitor back. Thankfully, there's a generously long three-year warranty period on it. Because of the price I paid for it, I wasn't about to complain about losing it for three weeks, having to pay my own shipping and providing my own box, which they didn't send back to me. I was just happy to get a completely new one in an acceptable time-frame.<br/><br/>Looking at the monitor and comparing it to other displays, such as my partner's MacBook Pro with the Retina display or the aforementioned piece of junk from LG, made me realize what a great buy this is. AOC is sacrificing a bit with build quality to provide some high capabilities in terms of what you buy the monitor for anyways: viewing. And with how fast display technology is moving, who really cares if the thing fails on you after three years?<br/><br/>tl;dr buy this thing for literally anything else than gaming</span>
