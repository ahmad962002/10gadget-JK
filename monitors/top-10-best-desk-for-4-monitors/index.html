<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The top has a fake wood finish, but it's well sealed with smooth reounded edges and I like the rounded corners.  Just the right size, and plenty sturdy enough, to support my small LCD TV on top.  Note with the open sides, it can support a wide (but flat) DVR underneath, as the DVR can extend through the sides.  And all the DVR connecting cables can extend out the back.<br/><br/>Also note, the space between the risers is only 12", so anything wider than that, such as a standard-width keyboard, would need to rest one or both sides on the riiser rails when stored underneath, rather than on the desktop surface.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I loved this for the price and the aesthetic. The squared off edges were appealing. The product was super easy to assemble but the quality lacked. Came with chips and unpainted edges. You get what you pay for.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I love the stand itself, it's aesthetically pleasing and modern looking and perfect for my desk! I originally intended to use a couple of acrylic drawers underneath the stand so I ordered this because the description says it's 5.1" high which would be plenty to fit my 4.5" tall drawers. However this stand is only actually 3" high, which means I can't use the drawers I bought. Not a huge deal to me, I can just use something else. I thought I'd mention it in case anyone else is planning on doing something similar to me! Overall great product, just be aware of dimensions!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The stand is sturdy and does its job. It did come a little damaged but not enough for me to care. It was very easy to assemble so I'd buy it again.</span>

<span>This is exactly one inch too narrow across the width for the keyboard I want to stow underneath. But it was the largest / widest raiser I could locate that is metal frame, using legs, that free up the space between each pair of legs. So I have to maneuver the keyboard in, rather than simply slide it in.<br/>The product I received is different from what is currently displayed. The current display has a bolt head sticking up out of the top of the riser surface. That would be / could an inconvenience for setting things on the riser... What I received has the legs stud welded to the bottom of the riser. So, not bolt on the top that interrupts the real estate.<br/>The construction is "study enough" provided you do not agitate it. All the weight of your monitor and setup is bearing down in sheer force on sprung pins. Do not accidentally bump those sprung pins or you might pop them in and then you might have a crash. Aside from impacts from the side or front, it is vertically "sturdy". I have a 30 lb monitor resting on this and I do not detect any strain across the beam. I would not want to test the strength of the weld of the legs pins by lateral impacts.<br/>This is not a best match to what I wish for, but what I wish for was not to be found.</span>

<span>I purchased this product (riser and anti fatigue mat) to use at home because I use a similar set up at work and, post-COVID, am working in a hybrid situation. The one at work is a VariDesk Corner unit. I looked into purchasing the same for home, but the $500 price was too much when I could get a similar product for less than half the price. I've only been using the Rocelco desk riser for a couple weeks now, but so far I am happy with the product, more satisfied with the price, and do not see any significant difference between the usability of the Rocelco at home and the VariDesk at work. The Rocelco desk riser is lighter, which is also good since I have to move the riser from our kitchen table on weekends. I also purchased the fatigue mat and use it on a ceramic tile floor. It seems to be high quality and comfortable to stand upon. I stand at my desk 8 hours a day and find this mat a must. Overall, I am very happy with the Rocelco products and find them every bit as good--for far less price--than the VariDesk products.</span>

<span>I have been using this desk converter for a couple of months now and it does exactly what it should; it gets me off my butt and on my feet. I find that I'm on my feet for at least half of every day now instead of maybe 20%. The work space is just right.  Any bigger and it would tie up too much of the counter space and any smaller would make it unusable. It raises and lowers easily and smoothly with little effort. The most difficult part of the set up was adding a pole for two monitors to be mounted. But, even that wasn't a major obstacle. The desk is sturdy, doesn't shake, is a hard surface that cleans easily and, after two months of daily wipe-downs it hasn't shown any signs of fading or wear.  It is a good desktop for the price paid..</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> OPTIMISE WORK LIFE AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY: The Duronic DM554 is a die-cast aluminium desk mount for four computer monitors or four lightweight LCD/LED television screens. Our DM55 range of spring-powered arms provide ample flexibility thanks to the adjustable VESA brackets and inbuilt spring-loaded mechanisms. The arms can be manouvered higher or lower on the fly, just simply by holding the screen and directing it into the desired position.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> HEALTH BENEFITS AND INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY: Most stand-alone monitors are low-levelled and as such they can cause a problem for most people as they sit below the user’s natural line of sight. When a screen is not positioned properly it can have a negative effect on the user’s posture, wellbeing and productivity. This ergonomic Duronic desk mount allows the user to adjust the stand based on their own height and seating position, enabling them to work comfortably.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> ADJUSTABLE TO SUIT YOUR NEEDS: This model has four extended arms with three joints that swivel 180°; these joints enable the user to manuouver the screen easier and bring the screen forwards. The VESA bracket which holds the screen offers adjustability; it can swivel left/right, tilt up/down and can rotate 360° allowing you to view the monitor vertically. The spring arm allows for greater vertical adjustment of the screen.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> COMPATIBLE WITH VESA MONITORS: This DM554 monitor stand is suitable for most major brand monitors on the market (i.e. Samsung, LG, Dell, to name a few) who adhere to VESA compatibility. This mount will support 4 screens 15”-27” in size and with a maximum weight of 17lbs per screen. The VESA bracket will hold a monitor with VESA 100 or VESA 75 mounting holes; this means that the holes should be either 100mm or 75mm apart from each other when measured.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> SPECIFICATIONS: The DM554 is made from strong lightweight aluminium; this sturdy pole will stand firm on your desktop supporting your monitor precisely and with ease. It can be fixed to the desk using the wide V-shaped desk clamp included, or it can be installed using a grommet (which you can buy separately: DM-GR-02). We sell a range of accessories for this pole to allow you to customise your set-up including spare arms and VESA brackets.  </span></li>

<span>Works well.  With two monitors mounted up high, it does bounce a little if you lean on the keyboard shelf or type heavily.  I got used to that.  If it didn't bounce it would be outstanding.  Nice sleek design that I prefer over the scissor type lifts.</span>

<span>The instructions for assembly were very simple.  Although the  instructions state it will take 2 people, I did it by myself within the 40 minutes.  Follow the instructions and you should not have any problems. The monitor stand is ample space for my laptop and a 30 inch TV I am using as an additional monitor.  There On the monitor stand there is a power bank with two standard 3 prong outlets and two usb connections.  The monitor stand can be mounted so the power bank is on the left or the right side.  There is ample desk top space for all your what nots.  The desk is solid and sturdy and  looks great in my home office.  I looked at a lot of desks and am so happy I decided on this one.<br/><br/>If you are wondering about the set of drawers under the desk check out IRIS USA Craft Plastic Organizer.</span>

<span>Okay lets start off by saying I have OCD and am pretty picky when it comes to quality. That being said this thing met all my expectations. To address every comment saying this is difficult to out together, they have either never used hand tools or put anything together. Every bag and part is labeled and corresponds to instructions. Second note for people saying there holes dont lign up. They are not suppose to line up perfectly. There will be a hole or two slightly and I mean slightly off. You are suppose to stretch the pieces ever so slightly. What this does is gives it more rigidness and strength. Every time I got a piece on you could tell it was gonna be well secured. If for some reason you strip out a bolt...if you dont attach all the accessories then you will end up with extra screws. Same thread pitch as bolt, use a screw in place of the stripped bolt. It will secure it solidly. Did this to one of my bolts, my fault not theres, specifically says no power tools but I love my power tools. Carefully used drill with a phillips attachment is key to making this faster. Nobody tells you this but you need a tiny wrench at a point because some of the accessories use bolts with little nuts on the end. If you dont hold the nut down with a wrench or pliers like I did it will spin with the bolt will not actually get tight. Leg room is solid, I am 6'4" all in my legs and I fit just fine. My inital plan was to put the pc on a cart and wheel it under the desk. The surge protector rack made it not fit so I put it to the left of the desk. The surge rack is not suppose to be "tight" it hangs on the bar so that you can slide it out a ways to access it. Genius! If you dont care about your pc going on the ground it will fit under there and you will still have leg room. Last note. People saying in the top right corner there is a imperfection in the carbon wrap. Its not. Its covering a pre made hole for securing the cd/contoller rack. They covered it up with the wrap in case you dont attach that like I did. Keeps it clean looking with just a little bump where the spot is. But since you now know what it is, it should not bother you knowing its there. When it comes to opening the package. Dont tear into it like an animal, you will likely damage your table. What I did is open one end of the box. Then grab one flap and roll it backwards on itself like your rolling up a carpet tearing the top off the box. This will reveal the contents without damaging anything, then you can carefully remove styrofoam without making a mess. Overall very well made and packaged. Nothing wobbles at all, if it does then you did not tighten or attach something correctly. I leaned my leg on the edge of the table and tried to get something to move. The only thing that moved was the carpet, the table held its ground. If you shake the absolute crap out of it then the monitor moves. The monitor not the stand attached to the desk. It was solid. If you have someone in your house shaking your desk that hard, promptly tell them to exit your residence! Absolutely worth what you will pay. Hopefull this review helps answer questions I had before it arrived.</span>

<span>Mono price TV stand: Easy to assemble strong and good quality.<br/><br/>It has short studs that require a hex wrench to tighten into the aluminum pucks glued on to the glass. I did not feel like going all the way out the shop to get my allen or hex wrench set so I just grabbed the stud with pliers and tightened it that way. The studs do not need to be super tight so the pliers did not bite into the threads and mess them up.<br/><br/>I did use some lock tight threat locker on the studs where they went into the aluminum glued on pucks.<br/><br/>Next you screw on the aluminum tube feet. I added 1" felt pads on the bottom of the adjusters that contact the desk top. This should have been done by monoprice as these aluminum feet will scratch your desk top if no felt pads are added.<br/><br/>I kinda feel like whacking a star for no felt pads and no Allen or hex key these two items should have been included for the over all price. But this is a small complaint as the monoprice monitor stand is a quality unit. You should ad the felt pads if you buy one as this protects your desk from getting scratched and as a bonus it slides easy after adding the felt pads.<br/><br/>I bought this to put behind my TV so I could have an elevated stand for a large size Tripp lite UPS. See photo. Had a smaller cyber power UPS and it failed after a yr.<br/><br/>The Tripp lite UPS was much larger but would not fit behind my TV. I did not want to place it down under the TV stand.<br/><br/>Solution? This Monitor stand shelf unit. It spans over the rear TV stand extension and has plenty of room for the UPS and the digital antenna and a few other small things. Problem solved.<br/><br/>I do like the Mono price monitor stand enough I would get one for my desk/monitor if I decided to arrange my office desk in such a way I needed it. I have a Yamaha stereo head unit I use as a monitor stand so I can have stereo sound in my office. It is a bit large but works.<br/><br/>Bottom line yes I do like this monoprice monitor stand and would recommend it to a friend.<br/><br/>~</span>

The feet I got were slightly mismatched so the stability is lacking and the whole thing rocks. Even adjusting the heights of the feet it's still unstable due to not much room for adjustment.

<span>So the number one downfall of the product is that you can either sit or stand with it. That being said, the standing position is with the desk pulled all the way up. This means you aren't able to pull the desk only halfway up, a quarter of the way up, etc. Its either down or its up. Very annoying. Another thing is that when I stand with it, and im writing, apparently I put too much pressure on the top, and the desk collapses very suddenly, very fast all the way down to the sit position. Just buy something else. I will be returning.</span>

<span>I gave 4 stars because while it does feel pretty stable now, I don’t know if I’d say it feels like it’ll last long term.  Maybe I’ll come back in a year with an update... looks nice now though.  I would prefer if the bottom metal section were slimmer, it’s like 2.5 inches high and when the desk is in the lowered position it’s quite thick.  but when sitting it does have the benefit of making me sit up straighter than I used to at this desk.<br/><br/>1-year update: this desk is still going fairly strong, though it wiggles and squeaks a bit when I rest my elbows on it.  Unable to find the source of the squeaking, and I’m not sure I have the tools to tighten it up.  Overall I’m still quite pleased with my purchase and how it’s held up.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">FAQS</h2>
<h3><h3>What is the best desk for multiple monitors?</h3></h3>
    



If you're looking for the best desk for multiple monitors, you'll want to find something with a lot of surface area. You'll also want to make sure that the desk is adjustable so that you can get the perfect viewing angle for each monitor.
<h3><h3>Does 4 monitors increase productivity?</h3></h3>
    

There is no definitive answer, as it depends on individual preferences and the types of tasks being performed. Some people may find that having more than one monitor increases their productivity, while others may prefer to stick with a single screen.
<h3><h3>How do I make 4 monitors act as one?</h3></h3>
    

You can use the nvidia-settings tool to create an "output configuration" that spans across all of your monitors. This will effectively make them act as one large monitor.
<h3><h3>What size desk do I need for 3 27 monitors?</h3></h3>
    

You will need a desk at least 80" wide to accommodate 3 27" monitors.
