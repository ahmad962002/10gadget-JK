<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I replaced an Alienware 1080p monitor with this Samsung 4K and I am using it primarly for work and it has much clearer text for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  Keep in mind that you must use Windows magnification of about 200% because leaving Windows in native 4K creates microscopic text which is unreadable.  So there is some distortion of text at this level of magnification but the trade-off is worth it compared to using a 1080p monitor.  I also tried the monitor with my Xbox Series X and it works as described at 4K and 120hz.  The only monitor that would be better is an OLED panel however they are 1.5x the price of this monitor and the current one from Alienware has a fan which reviewers have stated is an annoyance.  This monitor seems like a great solution until OLED monitors become less expensive and fanless.</span>

<span>I decided to replace my monitor (super wide aspect) with this. I have to say the picture is so much nicer now. Also, with the curved display all of it is in focus without me having to move my head (glasses) around all the time. For gaming I don't know that all the fps and sync are really needed (I'm no twitch gamer) but this display was certainly worth the price. If I had one tiny complaint it would be that after you sleep your computer, if you want to turn off your monitor you have to basically turn it on and wait then select power off. I would have liked a simple click off that wouldn't have cost them much at all to include.<br/><br/>Oh and all the people saying the existing stand is bad - stands are bad in general (physics people). It is actually adjustable up/down (you just push the monitor down). It starts at the highest setting. I already had a monitor swing arm though so after testing it out I installed it on the arm and ditched the stand.<br/><br/>Edit: After using this for a few weeks now I do have one complaint. The monitor seems to take an eternity to wake up when I wake up my computer. It used to be at least twice as fast on my old monitor.</span>

<span>All the issues talked about concerning blackscreening, random shutdowns, and poor quality, are from using the DP cable provided in the box, I had all of those problems, including artifacting with random lines on the screen.<br/><br/>I had bought an HDMI 2.1 cable in preparation for the monitor, believing it would not come with a cable, however it did so I used that one first, it worked at first but was very finicky and had those problems I talked about. So I changed to the HDMI 2.1 cable and it works flawlessly with no problems whatsoever now.<br/><br/>For the actual monitor review, the colors do indeed pop, you will have to change the settings yourself however as the standard config is disgusting. Once you get it right though, and Samsung provides a vast amount of options to change your picture to do so, you will love this monitor. The HDR isn't really HDR so I didn't use it.<br/><br/> The gaming aspect is great, it is better than most budget high refresh rate monitors in terms of input lag and pixel response times. I did better at overwatch through this monitor despite getting only a resolution boost (I was on 1440p + 144hz before).<br/><br/>this is likely because of the vastly superior pixel response times and input lag compared to my cheaper gaming monitors (AOC 34 inch ultrawide), overwatch is very fast paced and fighting can sometimes look like a cartoon brawl pit where all you can see is dust, but with this monitor the pixel response times really help to reduce the amount of motion blur and smearing, meaning it is easier to make sense of what your seeing.<br/><br/>For viewing pleasure, it is great, I am coming from a Samsung 4k 32 inch display, I believe the UJ59 or something among those lines. This display is smaller but better. The old display was a VA panel, which is usually well known for their contrast and darkness. This IPS however is actually superior in contrast and dark levels in my opinion. Of course If I had an OLED right next to me I'd probably say otherwise, but compared to my AOC, the AOC looks like a cheap washed out monitor, so much so that my G70A looks OLED by comparison.<br/><br/>HDMI 2.1 also supports 4k playback on Netflix for PC, an unexpected but welcome upgrade.</span>

<span>This screen's specs can't be beat, except by Samsung's 4K 240Hz Odyssey Neo G8 which really isn't worth it unless you got a PC that can drive something that ridiculous and still have $1500 to blow. What will wow most people about the G7 is the color reproduction and contrast, which due to the VA panel and Samsung's QLED tech is inherently miles ahead of common TN or IPS screens. Since Samsung gives you a pretty solid neutral config out of the box it will look great even without touching the picture settings, but if you look up some test patterns and customize it will be even better.<br/><br/>Another great part that you'll notice more with certain games is of course the fast refresh rate and response time. Use VRR/g-sync for best results and enjoy the seemingly nonexistent ghosting and input lag. This is my favorite thing about the G7 and what I think justifies the somewhat high price tag (which isn't really so bad when on sale). Usually you have to look at tradeoffs between great looking color and these high performance gaming specs, but the G7 feels like a no-compromises solution for most users who aren't doing some kind of color-sensitive professional work or playing FPS games at a pro level (in which case I would think such a big screen wouldn't be practical anyway).<br/><br/>There are a few issues with this G7 that I've run into. The most obvious is inversion artifacts in some situations, most easily triggered by test patterns and certain combinations of browser and website dark modes. It has not been a dealbreaker for me because artifacts have not appeared with "real" content aside from websites, and you can be sure I was squinting at every moving object in games for the first couple of weeks. The pattern is sensitive to the Black Equalizer setting, so it may be worth experimenting with if you're not too bothered by inversion but want to minimize it.<br/><br/>Next problem is that in the out of the box configuration, using VRR/g-sync will result in scanline-like artifacts and flickering while in-game. This is fixed by enabling "VRR Control" which is hidden at the bottom of the second page of system settings. You have to be on the latest firmware to have this so make sure to check the Samsung website and confirm you've got the latest. VRR control ought to be on by default to avoid the issue but it isn't. While you're in the menu, turn off "Dynamic Contrast", a feature that seems to just make the picture look worse.<br/><br/>PS5 support is fine, it takes 4K input and downscales it which is great news until the PS5 gets 2K support. But the monitor's HDMI port is version 2.0 so you are limited to 4K@60hz (with or without HDR) due to HDMI 2.0 bandwidth. Theoretically 2K@120Hz without HDR should be possible but I have not been able to try the PS5 beta firmware and confirm.<br/><br/>HDR: It's pretty new to me, so I don't know where to set expectations. First thing I did in HDR was Ghost of Tsushima and I found it kind of underwhelming. I think the game was made to look amazing with or without HDR, so going from a good VA panel without HDR to one with HDR didn't blow me away. The effect was more noticeable in movies. I watched "The Night House", a recent horror movie that was released in HDR, and the first four "Star Trek" films which were remastered in HDR. For "Night House", it was really nice and the contrast between bright and dark scenes made it feel more like watching in the cinema. In the "Star Trek" movies, the extra brightness in space battles was welcome. There was a scene in "The Wrath of Khan" that seemed to confuse the local dimming algorithm, resulting in noticeably brighter/darker rectangles crawling across the screen behind the Enterprise. This may be a limitation of HDR on an edge-lit screen. Overall, nice to have but not a game changer at least in this implementation.<br/><br/>Some words about the non-screen bits. I have it mounted to a monitor arm, which works great, the necessary VESA bracket is included. I am happy to report that the power LED (which you can set to be off when the screen is on) is not very bright. I'm sick of my living room glowing blue at night so I appreciate Samsung not adding to the problem here. Headphone users will appreciate the headphone jack for your HDMI and DP audio, which I use a lot because my motherboard has a noisy headphone jack. A remote for volume control would be nice, but sadly it's not available. Whether or not you get software volume control may depend on your GPU and operating system: my PC with a 3080 does have one, but my Mac does not, and I have not been able to get DisplayBuddy working. Consoles do not have software volume control on the HDMI output. The included stand has a headphone holder on the back, which seems like a weird choice for such a big monitor. Some of Samsung's earlier gaming monitors had a headphone holder that pops out of the side, which would have been better but I suppose more difficult to implement on a curved screen.<br/><br/>Something I have found surprisingly annoying is switching between inputs. My setup looks like this: DisplayPort1 is connected a gaming PC, DisplayPort2 to a Mac, and HDMI to a device for toggling between my PS5 and Nintendo Switch. The only scenario that works well is switching between one of the DP inputs and HDMI when both inputs are on. Any other scenario, changing inputs is going to take 20+ seconds for everything to settle and the monitor might become unresponsive until you unplug and reconnect the DisplayPort input you want. No other monitor I've used has been this annoying.<br/><br/>Overall: For me this looks like it will be the perfect main display for several years, or more if higher resolutions take a while to take off. Do your research and be aware of the issues before deciding to buy based on the specs alone.</span>

<span>I have two very old, inexpesive 18" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.<br/>I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.</span>

<span>I can return this monitor until the end of next month (1/21), I suppose because I purchased it during the holiday window.  If I get no more negative surprises, I will be keeping it.  Here's my experience with it so far since late November.<br/><br/>First of all, it's IPS and 240Hz refresh, without a doubt.  Great colors, middling contrast, good gamma curve, and nice calibration out of the box.  I'm very happy with ONE of the display modes.  That introduces my first issue with it:  Only the "Gamer 1" mode allows full control of all the image and color functions in the OSDs.  All the others, including "Gamer 2", grey out most of these options.  So for example, I can't change gamma, color temperature or black level on any mode except "Gamer 1".  That includes the modes that aren't even meant for gaming.  In the "Vivid" and "HDR Effect" modes, only brightness can be adjusted!  Why?  It's a disconcerting limitation, particularly in a $400 monitor.<br/><br/>Second issue, external power brick with 3 AC prongs sticking right out of it.  I don't understand why the power supply couldn't be internal.  This is a desktop monitor, not a portable device.  But even overlooking that, they should have at least provided an AC cord that connects from the power brick to the AC outlet.  I in fact ended up buying a 3-ft heavy-gauge AC extension cord to complete their design as it should have been out of the box.  Plugging the brick directly into a power strip was impractical, both because of the short DC cord from it to the monitor, and the fact that several plugs on the strip would have been blocked by the brick.<br/><br/>Third issue, the stand.  It's this front-splaying vee shape that intrudes into what should be my desktop space.  It limits how far I can push the keyboard away from the front edge of my desk.  It also doesn't allow swivel (left/right), though it allows height adjustment and turning the screen to portait mode (90 degrees).  However, I can't push the monitor down as far toward the desk as I would like, unlike my previous ASUS monitor.<br/><br/>Fourth issue, no speakers.  Now, I know that monitor speakers are invariably lousy, but it's good to have them as an occasional fallback on monitors that process digital audio anyway.  But for whatever reason, they're not present here.  There's an audio-out jack, which I use for my decent external speakers.  It works well, and even has volume adjustment in the monitor OSD.  But those who want onboard speakers won't like this product.<br/><br/>The saving grace is the excellent pixel response without nasty overshoot, and high refresh rate with Freesync and G-Sync compatibility.  Even in Windows, moving things around or scrolling is clear and sharp.  No smearing or ghosting.  The image is very pleasing, and this is the first LCD monitor I've owned that can resolve every block in a luminance-gradient chart I've long been using for reference.  Gaming at variable frame rates over 100 fps without screen tearing or dropped frames is a joy.  This offsets my other, negative impressions.  I have learned to work with the odd limitations of the monitor, using the Nvidia Control Panel to provide additional adjustments when using display modes other than "Gamer 1."  Fortunately, the Nintendo Switch I also have connected to it looks beautiful too, even though it has no fancy display adjustments.</span>

<span>I bought two of the 27 inch screens, and they are absolutely beautiful ! - No complaints about the image.<br/><br/>However, when DisplayPort is used, the screen will power off after 2 seconds of no signal.  This means that if you have 2 of these monitors and reboot Windows 10, one monitor will power off during the reboot and mess up the desktop configuration.  Every time you reboot you need to manually power on one monitor, then fix the desktop layout in Windows.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand it anymore, so I used two DisplayPort to HDMI adapters, and added EDID Passthrough Adapters ( search for them on Amazon ).  The screens will power off during reboot, but the HDMI connections will trigger both monitors to turn themselves on, whereas DisplayPort didn't.  The EDID Passthrough Adapters will trick Windows into believing that the monitors are always present even if powered off, so no more desktop layout issues.  This setup won't work &gt; 60Hz, but I didn't care about that.<br/><br/>This is really annoying and there are numerous complaints about it online.  ASUS needs to add auto power-off timer options to the menu so that you can keep the silly things powered without a signal for more than 2 seconds.</span>

<span>I have two complaints with this monitor. The first is my fault. I didn't know curved screens are not for fps best for simulators and clearly TV or movies. The second issue I have with this monitor is it will randomly turn on at night if not placed in standby. Company was helpful over the phone but couldn't figure the issue. Otherwise it's great quality 4 stars is fair at this price point. Great for a casual gamer or a beginner set up.</span>

<span>I absolutely love how this monitor looks, all the games I play on it look crisp, the colors look great with HDR on or off, and the high refresh rate is the cherry on top. However it has one issue that I don’t see talked about, which is totally fair as it’s something that only affects a small percentage of people, which unfortunately includes me. The built in speaker for this monitor is absolutely horrendous. It’s incredibly quiet and nothing seems to sound as it should. Everything else about the monitor is perfect so I won’t judge it too harshly for this given that most people have their own sound system or use headphones. While I do have headphones that i use a majority of the time, I don’t have my own sound system so I’m stuck with the speakers on the monitor whenever I don’t want to wear headphones, which are just not up to the standards and expectations I've had with other monitors.</span>

<span>Picture is great just put trace free on 20 no more and the only thing they can do better is in a very black screen in a dark room u can see the back like bleed in the corners but for the price it's great just remember the trace free must be on no more than 40 I suggest leave it on 20 by default it's on 6o<br/> that causes artifacts so do that and you'll love it!!!! Oh and the ps5 does 1440 p now so it's great but this can do 4k at 60 herts and 1440p at 120 it's great!!</span>

<span>This monitor is awesome. I got the 1440p 27inch curved variant.<br/>Picture/screen:<br/>  Before this I had a basic 1080p 24inch Asus monitor, and let me tell you the upgrade was very much worth it. The color on this screen just pops. WAY more color coverage then my old monitor. I hadn't realized just how many colors I was missing until now. That being said I did try the HDR because it does advertise it, but I would say that its just not quite there. The screen is brighter , yes, but I would say that you lose at least 20% color coverage if not more. Frankly HDR is bland. I wouldn't recommend it at all if that's  a big sale point for you. I also have a decent amount of back light leak, so blacks aren't as dark as they could be (part of the reason HDR isn't that great on this unit). For those 2 reasons I knocked of a star.<br/>Gaming:<br/>  This is the main reason I bought the monitor. Playing on here has been a dream. I mostly play Apex and again the color coverage is out of this world. The contrast is RICH, like batman rich. It's easy to overdo to the point where you cant see people in dark areas. Although some fiddling around in the settings fixed that right up. On that point factory setting are okay but ounce you calibrate it, its twice as good. The curve and upgrade in size and resolution took me some getting used to but once I got used to it again, gaming has been nothing but spectacular. I have had no screen tearing, practically no motion blur and input lag is non existent. That being said I stay consistently around 100-110 FPS, so I haven't maxed it out.<br/>Ergonomics:<br/>  This is where I can't really say to much. I didn't even unwrap the stand, instead I immediately mounted it to my own desk top stand (VESA 100mm x 100mm). I did this because the factory stand seems to be a pretty basic one. No height or swivel adjustment, just tilt.<br/><br/>In conclusion Picture good. HDR bad, gaming fun. Stand doodoo.</span>

<span>After finally purchasing a couple MiniPC's for both business and personal use, and using an old LCD 21" Wide Screen Monitor I had, I was finding that I must be spoiled by my 4K TV because the picture on that monitor which I thought was wonderful, just seemed so dull and it did not support 4K which I have come to love to watch 4K videos etc.<br/><br/>I wasn't really sure what monitor to get, but I wanted something much larger, supported 4K, and that was at a very reasonable price. I did a lot of searching Amazon's product lists for monitors, and I came across this monitor, and I noticed that it was a curved screen. While I have never owned a curved screen anything, I had seen them at the local electronics store and was darn impressed. So I was very curious about this monitor because it had all the specs I was looking for, at least 27", Wide Screen, Support for 4K, Native Resolution of 1920 x 1080, LED, and had a curved screen. When I also noticed that it was a Samsung, I was pretty excited to learn more because I have always had very good luck with Samsung products and in fact, I have only had one Samsung product ever fail, and that was a mobile phone that should have stopped working years ago with what It went through.<br/><br/>Not knowing much about monitors these days, I started reading the reviews that were written on this monitor and I asked the community a couple questions. The answers I got back to my questions sealed the deal for me. Everyone who responded had nothing but great things to say about this monitor and provided me in info I needed. So I decided to go for it.<br/><br/>When it got here, unfortunately the first one had a broken screen. It appeared that it was packaged that way since the packaging was factory sealed but the packing was broken on the inside. Needless to say I returned it but Amazon really stepped up to the plate and sent me a replacement next day, so I was only delayed by 1 day getting to use it. Because the first monitor came with a broken screen, I am going to assume that the screen may be a bit on the frgile side as my old monitor has been dropped, and the LCD screen never had any issues, I don't know jf the screens on LED monitors are more easily broken, or If this was something that someone really dropped hard before packaging, for this reason I gave the durability 4 stars)<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze! Just had to put 1 screw to put the base stand together, and that was it. The stand is about the only thing I really don't like because the base that sits on the desk is an upside down chevron shape, which sticks out in front of the monitor a few inches. This makes putting it on a small desk where your keyboard would be in front of it a bit of a pain because the keyboard has to be pulled closer to me and just gets in the way to me. I managed to get around that by putting the monitor up on a little shelf I made out of a box and an old Laptop lap desk that I had. It perfectly raises the monitor by about 4-5 inches, and let's me push the keyboard further back to where I now have more room on my desk.  (Images added to show the base and how I worked around the chevron styled base to give me more room).<br/><br/>The monitor has one HDMI port and one Display Port. Now I am not familiar with the Display Port, but all my devices are HDMI, so plugging in a PC is simple. In fact, I have 3 MiniPC's that I need to connect to this monitor so I bought a 5 port HDMI switch. This allows me to easily switch between each MiniPC with just a click of a button.<br/><br/>The picture on this monitor is absolutely phenomenal!  Once I plugged in the HDMI plug, turned on the monitor, it automatically scanned for the signal which it found right away and WOW! What a gorgeous picture. The colors are very bright and vibrant. The dynamics between the Black and White colors are stunning and the color definition is very vivid. For never using a curved screen before on a computer monitor, I am very impressed. It almost immerses you in to the picture and almost gives it a extra dimensional view, almost 3D in nature... The thing I worried most about with a curved screen was is there going to be any distortion with a curved screen and I am happy to say. "Absolutely Not!". The images looks perfectly flat, but because of the curve, it pulls the outer edges our of your peripheral vision and closer to your focused view when looking straight forward.<br/><br/>Learning how to use the toggle button on the back for adjusting the settings van take a bit of getting used to, however, at this point, I haven't really needed to use any of the options other then Sleep and Shut Down as the defaults seem to be perfect for my setup.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this monitor does not have built in speakers however, if you have speakers connected to you computer or use a set of Bluetooth Speakers you will be just fine.<br/><br/>Overall my impression of this monitor is fantastic! The picture quality is stunning, and the size with the curves screen is awesome. I would recommend this monitor to anyone who wants an excellent monitor for home or office at a more then reasonable price. While I have not used the monitor for gaming, I have used a monitor that has the same 4ms refresh rate and that has the same native resolution  of1920 x 1080 and that monitor is over 10 years old and still holds up today, so I can only imagine that this monitor would be perfectly fine for today's games.  I am definitely glad that I went ahead and purchased this monitor, and should I need to replace the monitor that I amusing as  a secondary monitor, I will likely purchase another one of this model!  Again, Highly recommended and over all this monitor gets a full 5 Stars from me! ~</span>

Absolutely infuriating!<br/><br/>EDIT: Amazon's customer service wins the day, and has honored the refund even though it was a day after the return window.

<span>The monitor was delivered very quickly which is nice. The solid packaging prevented any damages to the screen or parts (stand/base). Alienware/Dell make quality products and I hope this AW2521HF lasts for some considerable time (might be cheap for some folk but with international shipping to beautiful Fiji, I paid a total of about FJ$1,300.00) but to complete my machine (have an R11 - was using an AOC 27" 144Hz GSync, also very crisp) price was, on balance, negligible (we live once...at least with current sci/tech). So far I am pleased to say no dead pixels or backlight bleed issues (not paranoid but I first read negative comments/reviews before buying any tech online for obvious reasons - I live in Fiji - shipping costs, even for "free returns/replacements" are not negligible). Played a bit of Deus Ex (alas not the new ones with Jensen, the old classic with JC, the revision version) and also Doom Eternal and while I honestly cannot tell the difference between 144Hz and 240Hz (doubt i'll appreciate a 360Hz) the gaming experience (maybe a placebo) seemed snappier/fresher and overall smooth. Not that I have any complaints with AOC, but Alienware is Alienware. Thank you Amazon for being a facilitator and thank you DHL for the speedy and safe delivery. Also, thank you Alienware/Dell for your quality products. Hope this lasts (we're all very climate/environment conscious now) so I'd rather use quality tech like Alienware for some time to come (until the next tech leaps).

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Overall this is a good monitor for home use.<br/><br/>There are better ones out there, but the price point makes this one worth considering.  I bought it because I wanted to display text files in larger sizes -- so far, it's doing an excellent job.  Text is crisp, and the larger size allows me to both read more easily and multitask.  Arguably a similar arrangement could be done through two smaller monitors, as is the case in my business office, but I don't like the screen being divided.<br/><br/>My old monitor was 27 inches.  It, too, worked well for many years, but as my eyes have changed, I was feeling more strain to read text.  Because I write and edit a lot, among other things, I often have more than one full-sized page open at a time.  The problem was larger monitors without higher resolution were not necessarily an improvement.  Yes, they enlarged the images, but then the text wasn't as readable.  This higher resolution, 4K monitor bridges that gap.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>1) Crisp images and text -- I can run a 4K movie in a window and still have plenty of real estate for other applications.<br/>2) A decent refresh rate -- videogamers no doubt will have quibbles, but for ordinary business use and all but the most sophisticated graphics, it's fine.<br/>3) No dead pixels or screen bleed -- I've been using the monitor a while now, but, of course, these flaws often don't show up right away.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>1) Color reproduction seems a bit off compared to my old, non-Samsung monitor.  The colors lean toward the blue portion of the spectrum.  I may play around with the settings more to see if I can warm things up.<br/>2) The display stand is not adjustable and does not swivel.  This is a bigger issue than it sounds because it's actually in an computer cabinet with fixed shelving.  Yes, I can raise the office chair, but this is the first monitor I've ever owned that can't simply be raised or lowered at the stand.<br/>3) Physical buttons are awkward.  There's a circular control in the back that's tough to reach (especially since the monitor also does not swivel).  The HDMI and power plugs are on the opposite side . . . which is awkward since the feed for cables in my display cabinet as well as the wall socket are opposite of that.  Because the power cable is short, I actually have to use an extension cord to plug it in.<br/><br/>So, if you can live with these limitations -- some of which are specific to my furniture and den set up -- this is a good value for the price.<br/><br/>Time will tell how long it lasts.  For the past 10 years or so, I've sworn by Samsung televisions, but a more recent one developed significant display problems because of a long, purple "cloud" across the top of the screen.  I'm guessing because the television is so razor thin, the screen buckled from it's own weight, warping that portion.<br/><br/>It's too early to tell if this monitor, which is similar in proportion, will do the same.  In more recent years, Samsung seems to be using cheaper parts and components, so I may need to update this review in a few months.</span>

<span>Great video.  EZ package removal.  EZ set up; aside from the whole no audio thing.<br/><br/>I'm legally blind, so use the monitor in dark mode.  The 4k, and as good a black as I've seen, combine for an image that makes work still possible.  It's awesome, and only two negatives to cite.<br/><br/>The convenience of a single joystick controller is dulled because the interface screen it drives is a little picture in picture down in the corner.  I didn't measure, but maybe 2.5" x 2.5".  Not Samsungs fault I'm legally blind, but I think this would be an annoyance for most.<br/><br/>And the lack of speakers.  Just why?  Again, easy to overcome, but this is for home office use.  I don't need an external speaker cluttering my desk, but I do use monitor speakers for Teams / Video Call interface.  I'll be honest, I didn't check if it had speakers, or even review their quality.  Some things you just expect, so a let down, and the reason it's a 4 star monitor.</span>

<span>I use this mainly for work through a KVM and on a Mac.  Works great on Mac, but when I switch to Linux the dark colors get green noise in them.  For the amount I spent and the primary use case, this monitor is a good value.  I don't think this is a gaming monitor, haven't tried but the refresh rate is low.  For doing programming work it's great.</span>

<span>One drawback is when it comes to PC's and Monitors, you won't know for sure until you try it out for yourself. You can ask the seller questions, but sometimes the question you should have asked isn't obvious until the thing is sitting on your desk. It may boil down to something very specific to your application/environment/ergonomics that the seller, or even the manufacturer can't give you a definitive answer because of the subjective nature of sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time.<br/>  A big help for me in determining which to order is to download the user manual and quick set-up guides from the Manufacturer Website. By carefully reading the specs and going through the OSD Menu entries I am sure that what I'm ordering, at least on paper, has the right specs. This way, the monitors should have all the right comparable specs and you should end up with what you really want. Still, as was it was in my case you may have to try it out before you can finalize the purchase.<br/>  I need a widescreen curved monitor such as this 30" Scepter with PBP (split screen) so as to be able to work on documents from two different inputs, i.e. two PC's. So I am reviewing this from more of a business angle, not from a Gaming criteria.<br/>  Basically, it is a simple, single-purpose gaming PC Monitor. If used just for gaming on an Nvidia Graphics PC, it works as advertised. You've got to match video cards, max res, number and type of inputs, hdmi 1.4, 2.0? Is Displayport 1.2 enough?  I finally narrowed down to a 30-32 inch 21:9 ultrawide, curved, (gaming) monitor though I would only use it for business. I need a split screen with quick and easy transition from one input to another. To change inputs from one PC to another on this monitor requires 11 button pushes and the dual split-screens are squished horizontally as determined by the screen width and 2560hz horizontal resolution. Nothing really wrong with the monitor itself. My opinion is that this monitor should be best acknowledged as a single input Gaming monitor. It was not quite suitable for my application. Better would be a wider monitor with higher horizontal frequency.<br/>  The Wall Plate though not it's intended use can be  attaching it to a standard 4 hole Vesa mounting arm plate. It comes with a 75mm 4 hole Adapter, so it can be done. Two little bolts attach one side to the monitor, the other side can be fastened to a regular Monitor mounting plate (75mm hole pattern) on the extended arm of your vesa desktop stand mounted to your desk .  You will have to obtain an additional four M4 x 20mm bolts, with washers and nuts to bolt (fasten) Wall Mount to the Vesa plate of your stand. Easily accomplished except for  obtaining your own hardware. No wall plate screws are supplied as there are different types of wall mounts.<br/>  At this price point, as I've mentioned, this monitor is designed to work best with a PC having an Nvidia Video Card using GSync. They tell you up front how it's designed to work. With the right hardware you can get the 160 - 200 hz frequency for high-end gaming. With Displayport 1.2  I was able to get 120hz picture that was good enough for ordinary Windows 10 desktop, but I can't comment how it would work for gaming. Need Displayport 1.4, or Hdmi 2.0 to obtain 160-200hz. The Nvidia drivers must be up to date and can be downloaded from Nvidia Website. The driver page lists a long paragraph of Nvidia cards compatible with that driver. It may work well enough with other PC video cards as well, but I was using an old GT 620. No problem with the latest driver but not suitable for intensive gaming.<br/>  Using with a Mac, (I have a Macbook Pro) is a crapshoot. Older Macs are designed to work with older Mac compatible hardware. This monitor, as is the case with the majority of OEM generic monitors, is directed at the Windows PC Market. If it works with your Mac, well and good, but don't count on it, not for serious gaming for sure. My 2011 Macbook Pro has early thunderbolt - backwards compatible with mini-displayport. I used a mini-displayport cable with short mini-displayport to Displayport adapter. Macbook has a 2560x1440 spec video output. It connected with the monitor but full-screen picture was a little vertically flattened, (i.e.horizontall stretched); not acceptable. Mac System Preferences Display Icon showed 1080p. That is correct, but the Macbook is designed for 4:3 ratio. My Macbook was never intended to handle 21:9 aspect ratio; not the fault of the monitor. Works perfect though with my 21.5 inch Acer screen. Newer macs with thunderbolt 3, a.k.a. USB-C should be compatible with USB-C input monitors.<br/>  In order to avoid the hassle of a return, my advice is to ask the seller - better yet, download the manual, especially with third-party sellers as return shipping is pretty expensive. Be aware of the intended use and specs and consider that in order to get a monitor with better options, you might have to spend another $100.00 or more.  What I could determine is that used as intended and properly set up, it will do what is advertised at 160hz For business, with dual inputs, maybe not, but the manufacturer does not advertise it as anything but designed for gaming so I really can't complain. I had to try it to find out.<br/><br/>Walter O.</span>

<span>I got this monitor because my desk space wouldn't properly fit two 1080p 24" monitors, and it's easier to stay focused when everything is all on one screen. I was surprised and skeptical when I found this monitor because it's a 30" ultrawide with good reviews, but a lesser known brand. I had a Sceptre monitor back in the CRT display era, so I decided to give it a shot, since the monitor I had back then worked perfectly fine throughout its use.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Surprisingly bright, I had to turn it down to 50% for white background windows/browser pages.<br/>- Very clear for colors and detail, it seems noticeably better than the monitors I had previously. I can't speak to professional color schemes, since I primarily use it for programming work and gaming.<br/>- Buttery smooth. I didn't think I would notice much difference between 144hz and 200hz, but it does seem even smoother. Competitive games like CS:GO will definitely show a difference.<br/>- PIP and PBP capability, which is fantastic for when I actually need two monitors. I can use the same source (main PC HDMI and DP) for both monitors also.<br/>- 4 ports allows me to have two setups with dual monitors, one for work laptop and one for main PC.<br/>- Supports standard 1920x1080p resolution, although the desktop will stretch and games/applications might have the "black bar" effect, which doesn't really bother me much.<br/>- 1 DP and 3 HDMI (the DP can support up to 200hz, HDMI 1 can support up to 165hz, and HDMI 2 and HDMI 3 can support up to 85hz)<br/>- OSD is extremely intuitive, and the buttons at the bottom make sense. I didn't even need the manual.<br/>- Costs the same as two budget 24" 1080p monitors.<br/>- I appreciate the blue light reduction settings, makes it easy on the eyes.<br/>- Has speakers and doesn't require headphones to use them. They have pretty decent quality for a monitor.<br/>- The screen is about as tall as a standard 1080p 24" monitor (which is what I'm used to), the screen size itself is 27.8"W x 16.1"H (30" diagonally)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- PBP for dual monitors stretches the displays to fit, making both look compressed, kind of annoying but not much can be done without changing both desktop resolutions. PIP mode can work well for fixing this too if you don't mind sacrificing part of your main screen.<br/>- "Black bar" effect on applications that don't support 2560x1080p, expected with an ultrawide monitor though.<br/>- The stand that comes with it is kind of short, raising the screen maybe 6" above the desk. Tilt works to fix this a bit.<br/>- Backlight is dim and only glows red, but it can be turned off.<br/>- FreeSync works, but I've had some trouble getting it to work properly (never had much luck with FreeSync anything though).<br/><br/>I will update if I encounter any problems, but I'm very impressed so far.<br/><br/>Updates after a few days of use:<br/>- The monitor is VESA mountable with an included bracket (75x75 pattern) designed to go on the back of the monitor (in place of the stand). The monitor is about 12.15lbs, fairly light for a monitor of this size, so it should fit most VESA mounts. If you have a VESA mount larger than 100x100, you might want to consider using longer screws and standoffs, since there is a small overhang on the back of the monitor that might block larger VESA mounts from laying flush when screwing into the included bracket.<br/>- Some of my previous monitors had about 1ms response time, and this monitor has 5ms response time. I don't think it is hugely noticeable, but in fast paced competitive games, you might see mild ghosting if you're used to faster response times. Like most curved monitors, it's a VA panel, so the slower response times are somewhat expected.</span>

<span>I like this monitor. I love the height adjustment! It will be so much nicer than bending my neck to look down at my all-in-one. Hard to find a height adjustable monitor at this price.<br/>I did have a bit of trouble getting the operating manual. Spent way too much time looking for a manual for this model on the HP website. FINALLY noticed Get Product Support on the order details page. I soon talked with a very nice human being who sent me a cut and paste address for the manual.<br/>Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to use it much, other than to check screen quality. I ordered an HP desktop from another vendor at the same time. In my quest to get some questions answered about the computer, I found that HP had no record of the computer's serial number. After some googling, I found that is a thing with HP. They don't have a very reliable system for keeping track of their serial numbers. AND, if you have no serial number, there is no way to communicate with HP. Plus, you have no warrantee. Many people find out they have no valid serial number too late. Even the tech guy at the store where I bought the computer had had the same problem. He spent months (in vain) trying to get satisfaction from HP. I am still looking for a NON HP desktop.</span>
