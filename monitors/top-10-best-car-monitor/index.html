<span>Received very fast, tested before installing, powered right up but shut down within 10 seconds.  Called customer service after trying several fixes, item was returned for exchange. Received second unit same problem.</span>

<span>It worked well and picture, but beware it will melted in the sun.  It has been very hot in southern CA.  The outside shelll holder melted and disformed.  The funny is that it still works with good picture too.  I just pull it be hand to open when before it used to spring up.  I'm not going to complain because it was my fault.  I should not of left in the sun.</span>

<span>I use this monitor in conjunction with a backup camera I recently installed on an older vehicle.  The "flip down folding" feature is great for my application.  My only complaint is that the plastic latching feature on the case never latched consistently and then failed after about a week.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>For the money you can’t beat these cameras.. Would have the night picture comes in decent. Has great lighting but the picture is a little grainy.. But again for the price you can’t beat it!<br/><br/>Came with all the proper hardware and wiring! Besides the adapter and power cord which i sourced through Amazon for cheap.<br/><br/>All and all would recommend or buy again!</span>

<span>This was a great add on to my wife's 2019 town and country the dome light only comes on or off when you touch the button on the unit so I see a dead battery in the future. Mounting screws are no where near long enough so buy yourself some 1 1/2 in m4 screws before you attempt install. Also some self tapping sheet metal screws really help to hold the mounting plate in place above the head liner. I think you may say some new curse words you didn't enen know that you knew. But by the 50th time you say the F word you will finally be done! Not to mention how pissed your wife will be about the mess you made in her car. And last but not least she will decide she doesnt like the color of it and then will make you change it. Oh yeah and the leadliner is made of fiberglass so there's also that to look forward to when your done and you have little fibers in your face and arms from cutting holes in the headliner. HAPPY INSTALL!!!!</span>

<span>So I cannot yet comment on this thing's features but installation was incredibly frustrating. I generally consider myself pretty handy and know my way around a shop and cars.  It's not that the concept of how everything goes together but some additional instructions would be helpful. I. At first thought they had forgotten to send instructions but I finally found them half way through the users manual. You would think they would put it at the beginning or at least label it in the table if contents as installation instructions or something to that effect. However after finding them I found them sorely lacking. They weren't even written in good English.<br/>Let me quote here:<br/> "3. To install the unit to the metal support bracket, connecting with the unit and the wires passing through the space remained. (Take care to tidy up the wires<br/> to avoid pressing Multimedia chipset. And install special screws to avoid loose.)"<br/>Of course they have not bothered to explain what the multimedia chip set is so I can make sure I don't press it.<br/>As I said the general idea was pretty simple but there were just done confusion about some of the wires and what to do with the ones I didn't need. I actually had to open up the unit to disconnect the extra AV cables from the board because we will not be using those and they would otherwise be dangling down from the unit forever.<br/>The really challenging part of the installation was trying to get the screws that hold the unit into the installation bracket in without dropping the thing. It is virtually impossible for one person to do alone. They desperately need better guides on the installation bracket to help line it up easier. Overall I was just sorely disappointed. I felt like compared to the other units like this one I was getting one that was medium high on the price scale or at least there were a lot that were a lot cheaper, so I expected way better quality.</span>

<span>We bout this to keep our kids entertained for a trip we took in April. Upon first install and instillation, we discovered the player would not read any of the DVD’s. Every time. We called and were sent a new one almost immediately, within a week of sending it out. This time we tested to make sure a DVD would play, success! All was well again. Except for a hinge broke less than two months later. So for for a few weeks we were riding with the screen taped to the mount. And then the second hinge broke, so not there were two pieces being held together by just the cable.<br/>The screen size and picture as well as the sound were nothing to complain about. The instillation instructions were not very detailed. Sometimes the player wouldn’t even play new DVD’s with the smallest smudge, like a fingerprint. It’s just cheaply made and not durable</span>

<span>Works great BUT I did have to have this professionally installed which costed me $350! You have to pull the whole headliner out and it’s a WHOLE JOB! I didn’t want to risk messing up my new car wires so it was my choice to pay sometime fo do it BUT don’t think this is going to be a simple job, it’s not.<br/><br/>On the bright side.. I’m happy with my purchase because my kids love it! The picture quality is good and the volume is also good. Easy to use and automatically turns off when the cars cuts off so you don’t have to manually do it each time you stop which is nice! HUGE screen so even in a third row vehicle the people in the back can see and hear just fine!</span>

<span>OK; this is a great backup camera &amp; monitor system for just about any vehicle.  And yes, as others have stated the wiring diagrams/instructions are useless, hence the 4 star review.  I did the installation myself in a 2008 Ford Fusion for my son - it took us about 3.5 hours.<br/><br/>Here are some very helpful hints if you plan to do this yourself:<br/>1.  The actual backup camera must be installed right-side up.  Which way is that you ask?  The adjustment screws for the camera must be facing downwards.<br/>2.  The video cable (yellow RCA plugs on either end) also has a red wire that runs alongside (not pictured in the product photos!).  Do not ignore as others have done, as this is used to automatically power on the monitor when reverse is engaged.<br/>3.  The camera has two leads off of it; one is yellow, and this is the video feed that will connect to the long video cable to the monitor.  The other is red - this will be your power source to the camera.  It has a corresponding plug that ends with a black &amp; red wire.  Take the red wire and splice into the power lead to your reverse light, and connect the black wire to a ground source (tap a screw on your vehicle's frame).<br/>4.  Remember the red wire that runs along the video cable?  One end of this should ALSO tap into the powered line of the reverse light - WITH the red wire from the camera power feed (as noted above).  Note that you will almost certainly require extra wiring in order to accomplish this, so have it on hand before the install.  It simply isn't long enough and ends too close to the video RCA plug.  The other end will be spliced to the green wire from the monitor (this wiring bundle is also not shown in any of the product pictures here).<br/>5.  Before ordering this system, look over the interior of your vehicle and try to determine where you will run the video cable.  You could opt to run it beneath the carpet floor on up to the front of the car - or look for a cable channel found in a lot of cars - this can usually be found in the bottom of the car's door frame sills.  If you do run the cable underneath carpet - make sure you have a wire fisher; this will help considerably.  You can also remove carpeting, but I don't recommend this...<br/>6.  Both the mounts for the monitor are a little flimsy (there is a square nut in both mounts along with a tightening wheel - DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN or you will crack the back casing of the monitor).<br/>7.  The easiest way to power the front monitor is by using the cigarette lighter socket and a plug is provided; just splice the corresponding wires together.  Otherwise, you will either need to find a 12volt power lead inside the car (fusebox or even tap the cigarette lighter from behind).<br/>8.  You may need to be prepared to drill a hole somewhere near the rear license plate in order to run the camera's cables into the interior of your vehicle; this may be vehicle dependent but again, be prepared.  Look at your license plate beforehand and imagine running the camera's two cables (power and video) to the inside for a better idea.<br/>10. Be prepared to remove interior panels (most likely in the trunk) in order to route wiring.  Usually it's just plastic plugs that pop out (gently use a flat-bladed screw driver) and will pop back in.<br/>11.  My last tip (and this helped me quite a bit): before your installation, place the camera on a table or floor.  Start hooking up all the wires and lay it out like it will be in your car.  Look to see how it all connects together BEFORE you are halfway through your install :-)  As others have mentioned, go to the PyleAudio website and navigate to the product page; there you will find only a slightly helpful wiring schematic but it is marginally better than what comes in the box.<br/><br/>If you wire/hook up as I have above, then when you engage reverse the monitor will automatically turn on and you will have an instant backup view.  As soon as you disengage from reverse the monitor will turn off.  Done!</span>

<span>First let me start off by echoing every other review on the non-existent wiring instructions. There's a wiring diagram included that provides zero details.  Worst instructions I have ever seen.  I installed this system on my Dodge Ram 2014 2500 4wd and was wanting it to activate when I placed the transmission in reverse. No big deal because that's what the camera system is intended for.  I connected the camera power wires (red and black) to the reverse light wires according to instructions, connected the monitor power wires to the provided cigarette plug. Fired up the truck, and placed it in reverse.  This is when all the fun started. The monitor picture was completely distorted, no picture at all. So, I went back and took the camera power ground wire and ran it to a frame ground. Same problem, complete interference, no picture.  I tried every possible combination with the wires to get the picture to show. Green wire, orange wires in the wiring harness may serve a purpose in particular installations, we may never know because the crappy instructions are well crap.  I boxed everything up and contacted amazon for a refund because the monitor would not work.  Then later that night my smart and lovely wife suggested I lay the system out in the living room floor and use an extra lawn mower battery I had to see if I could get it to work.  Like a good husband I listened and obeyed. Except this time I ignored the extra orange and green wires and just hooked it up straight. Black is ground, red is positive,  It worked perfectly.  I had to admit to her that she was right again.<br/><br/>The next morning I installed it on my truck just like I did in the living room the night before. I had to provide an additional power wire long enough for the camera to reach the cab but yes, it worked great. My advice on the install.  Forget about the reverse lights if installing on a Dodge Ram 2014.  Way too much electrical interference from some where.  Older vehicles may be fine, but not the newer ones. Forget about the extra orange and green wires, tape then back or cut them off.  I used zip ties to keep the AV cable and power wires nice and tidy under the truck, use shrink wrap on your connections, this is insurance for the future.  I'm going to keep the system since it's working now.  I'll have to plug the cigarette plug in when I need it, but that's no big deal to me.  The good thing about wiring it up straight, instead of using the reverse lights is I can use it anytime I want to.  The truck does not have to be in reverse to activate.  Now I can see whos tail gating me I guess. If you have trouble on the install, just ask your wife.</span>

<span>Tested on a lab power supply, looked GREAT so I installed it on the truck.<br/>It only works if the battery voltage is over about 12.5, can only be used it when the engine is running.  Checked that battery voltage was getting to the camera and video display.  With engine running there is interference on the screen but I suspect it is related to the power supply problem.<br/>Control buttons no longer work or actually some do, some don't and the others have switched functions.<br/>Minor item, there is no "Invert Screen" if you have to mount the camera upside down ( or at least I couldn't find it with the corrupted controls).<br/>Minor item.  The cable exit from the camera frame only exits one way (up) so if you have to mount at the bottom of the  license plate (because top is obstructed by the license plate light) you have to loop the wire over the camera.  An Invert Screen feature would have solved this!<br/>Minor item.  The bright blue illuminated buttons make viewing the picture difficult in the dark - no way to dim them or turn them off.<br/><br/>I've ordered a replacement, I'll update here if it works correctly.<br/><br/>UPDATE New one is working fine BUT AN INSTALLATION WARNING<br/><br/>The cable between the monitor and the camera includes an extra wire for running +12 volts.<br/>Since it was easy to access the backup light power near the camera at the rear and since it was nearly impossible to locate the backup circuit in the cab and since I didn't want an ugly cable going to the cigarette outlet, I opted to use this extra wire to feed 12 volts from the backup light to the monitor - MUCH NEATER.<br/>BUT DON'T DO IT.<br/>The extra red cable (that runs along with the video cable) is totally inadequate for carrying the current to the monitor and aggravates the low voltage sensitivity.<br/>Since there are virtually no installation instructions you have to discover this the hard way and create a warranty return.</span>

<span>I ordered this for my '07 Ford Sport Trac. I was tired of jumping out of my vehicle every 2" in order to tell if my boat trailer was over my hitch or not, also to help aide backing up into parking spaces at work without going to far backwards and hitting the wall behind me with the hitch-no harm to the vehicle but everyone looks when they hear it hit.<br/><br/>After reading the reviews I did look at the "manual" just to get a good laugh in, and threw them away right after. I work on vehicles on a daily basis so wiring was no problem and it took me about an hour to have this thing installed start to finish. The wiring went from above my license plate, down the frame rail with the vehicles wiring harness, up and into the engine compartment and then back under the dash, up the console where the radio is and to the windshield where I mounted the screen using the suction mount (which has stayed on no problem since). I still had a few feet of wire left.<br/><br/>I can say that the lines on the monitor do not, at all, line up with any kind of lines on the ground at least with my vehicle but this doesn't really matter to me since I don't have any issues parking straight, just how far back I go or how far away the boat trailer is. Also some screen shots of this product show green/yellow/red lines, mine are all yellow and has the word STOP at the bottom of the screen, in case that matters to anyone. The video isn't bad, it's not HD but for $60 what do you expect. I'm sure there are other more expensive, clearer image cameras and devices you can purchase but this one is good enough for my needs.</span>

This kit includes a nightvision-capable rear view camera and clip-on rear view mirror for your vehicle. The camera installs easily above your license plate and outputs crystal clear video over an RCA jack. The monitor clips to your rear view mirror. The monitor detects when you back up and shows the camera on screen. When you put your car back in drive, the image disappears – and your mirror becomes a mirror again. Perfect for backing into tight spots or moving in reverse when visibility is limited – it’s like having an extra eye. And this model comes with nightvision LEDs, which illuminate the area behind you at night. This small and durable unit will keep you safe and secure because you’ll always know what’s going on around you. The mirror also has multiple video inputs so you can hook up a portable DVD player or iPod. There is a seam that runs around the body of the camera itself. That seam is marine coated, however in environments that vary in temperature greatly, the plastic can contract and let in water. We suggest using clear silicone to go around that seam approximately 0.25" in width. This covers the expansion and contraction of the plastic body.FeaturesBackup Camera & Monitor System Visual Parking Assist for Safer Driving Includes All Necessary Cables & Wiring Camera:Exterior License Plate Mount CamDistance Scale Line Display Marine Grade Waterproof Construction, IP68 Resolution: 380 TV Lines (x 60) Night Vision Performance Low Lux Light Illumination Extra Wide Viewing Angle Slim Style Compact Camera Swivel Angle Adjustable Cam Monitor:Built-into Rearview Mirror Assembly Universal Size Clips onto Existing Mirrors 7'' TFT / LCD Mirror Monitor Screen Display16:9 Wide ScreenResolution: 800 x 480 Pixels (RGB) Contrast Ratio: 400 CD/M2 Anti Glare Coating Dual Video Inputs Ability to Connect Additional Video Source Power Consumption: 6W Auto Switch PAL/NTSC Dimensions / Size:Screen (W x H): 5.9'' x 3.25''Mirror Assembly (L x W x H): 10.0'' x 1.5'' x 4.25''Camera Dimensions (L x W x H): 8.46'' W x 1.29''H x 1.37''D Sold as: Unit Weight: 2.17 lbs.

<span>I like the system.  It is really cool backing up looking into the rear-view mirror and seeing everything behind the car.  I feel like I can drive in reverse anywhere.  I think it will really help when I am backing up my trailor.  With that said, the instructions are worthless.  Since they are, I will describe my installation here on a Honda Ody 2005:<br/>1.  Find a 12V power adapter (kind you plug into cigarette lighter, they come with lots of electronics so you probably have one somewhere.  If not it can be purchased at RShack)/<br/>2.  Cut off the plug end that goes into the electronic item (not the end that goes into the cig lighter).<br/>3.  Splice the cut wires into the Pyle Monitor's wires (the red is power and the black is ground).  On my 12V adapter, the black wire was ground and the black-with-white-stripe wire was hot.<br/>4.  I did not use the green wire and will explain later.<br/>5.  The only other wire is the yellow video connector which we will use later.<br/>For the camera:<br/>6.  Remove all the plastic backing on the trunk hatch.<br/>7.  Remove the license plate.<br/>8.  There is a hole midway betw the lic plate mounting holes.  Drill that out wider so the camera power and video cables can snake through.<br/>9.  I had to mount the camera on the bottom of lic plate (interfered with trunk latch).  Snake the cables through the drilled hole and tighten everything up.<br/>10.  On the inside of trunk hatch, find the wire that feeds one of the rear back up lights.  On the Ody it is green.  Cut a green and ground (black) and connect to the red (hot) and black (ground) wires that connect to the camera.  NOTE, these wires plug into the red coax cable coming from the camera.<br/>11.  All that's left is to connect the video from the camera to the montior and replace all the plastic you took off.<br/>It worked like a charm (took me all day to figure this out though).  I did not connect the green wire from the monitor b/c it was hard to find a backup power wire, cut it, and connect it to the green wire - I did not want to cut wires in the dash area b/c it  was crowded and hard to get to.  But I don't miss it.  I just hit the power button on the unit when I want to back up and turn it off when I am not in reverse.  No big deal.  Hope that makes sense.<br/>I hope these instructions help.<br/><br/>11/2011 update<br/>The mirror only lasted less than a year.  It stopped giving an image.  It was not wiring but the device itself.  Piece of S%&amp;%.  I will never buy any of this company's products again.</span>

<span>Just got this system in the last week. So far I have had no problems. I ordered the product on Friday and received it on Sunday (thanks to Prime shipping.) I want to start out by saying that installation of this device is more than basic. If you have no experience with wiring/ripping your car apart, please seek professional or experienced help.<br/><br/>I installed this into my 2006 Scion Tc.<br/><br/>Delivery:<br/>Like I said it was perfect. It came quickly and was nicely packaged.<br/><br/>Hardware Quality:<br/>Everything seems pretty high quality. It came with most of what I needed. The screen fits nicely on my mirror and has adjustable clips if needed. The weight of the screen causes the my mirror to sag down a little. I don't blame the system, but the mirror. Looking to fix this.<br/><br/>Installation:<br/>Not for a novice is wiring. I am no expert in wiring, but I have done a bit with stereos and such. You will definitely want some electrical wire, cuttings, strippers, soldering iron/butts, ground tips, add a circuit heat shrink/electrical tape, and wire taps. I'll break down my process.<br/><br/>1. My Scion Tc is a hatchback. The license plate lifts with the hatch. I first installed the camera onto the license plate.<br/>2. I removed the paneling from my hatch interior. This allowed me to feed the camera wire into the interior.<br/>3. I soldered better wire to the end of the hot end and the ground end of the Camera. I used a large amount of extra wire on the hot wire. I will explain why.<br/>4. I installed a ground tip to the ground wire and found a pre-installed ground post on the hatch.<br/>5. I used a wire tap and ran the hot wire into my reverse light hot wire.<br/>6. I plugged the yellow video cable into the camera.<br/>7. I fed the video cable and the extra slack of the hot wire into the ceiling. This was pretty easy in my Tc, since most of it is a sun roof. I ran it just above the driver.<br/>8. I installed the screen onto my mirror.<br/>9. I removed my driver side visor. This allowed me to access the roofing above me. \<br/>10. I fed the video cable of the camera and the monitor towards each other until I was able to connect them.<br/>11. I fed the hot wire (blue) of the screen towards the back until I reached the extra slack of the camera hot wire. I used a wire tap to connect them. This allowed me to create a hot wire connection on both ends without having to find two access points.<br/>12. I installed the screen ground wire into the visor screw.<br/>13. I used an add a circuit kit to install the screen power cable.I used the accessory panel fuse port. You can use just about any port as long as it turns on with the key and doesn't have a switch (like the defrost.)<br/>14. I tested. It worked!<br/>15.I cleaned up all my wiring and made sure none were exposed.<br/>16. I sealed up all my paneling.<br/><br/>Camera Quality:<br/>I have no issue with the quality. I installed the camera because my windows were very tinted when I purchased my car. Backing up at night is a struggle. The camera helps a lot. The quality is helpful at night and extremely helpful during the day. I live in Washington state so I am a little worried about it being water proof or not. We will see. I need to find a solution to the mirror sagging down with the weight of the screen, but that my only problem. I will update in a few months or so.</span>

<span>I'll just mention things that are not already mentioned many times over.<br/><br/>* Electrical connection: I can't pin down why the electrical connection is such a mystery, but it is confusing. I think it's that the instruction sheet only shows one power connection; there should be two - one for the camera, one for the monitor. Once you "get" this, things make sense if you've got basic electric-circuit smarts.<br/><br/>* Camera placement: I tried the camera inside on the rear shelf, and the high-mount stop light, but the trunk lid blocks the view.<br/><br/>* Camera wiring placement: On my 2005 SAAB 9-3, the main problem was running the cables from the license plate to the inside of the car without cutting metal. I found parts diagrams on the 'Net that I used with the user's manual, to remove the trunk lining and then remove the license-plate lighting assembly. The hole that's could be a direct connection is too small for the cable's plugs, so found an alternate hole and padded the edges of the assembly, and the cable where it passes under the edge, with closed-cell insulation foam. When tightened, the assembly won't leak. I didn't want to cut metal, so the car would remain "mint."<br/><br/>* Running the wires: I studied online parts diagrams and talked with the dealer's body shop mechanic. His best tip was that the headliner and side trims are all removable with care, and where to find the removable caps that expose nuts. This let me find places to run the wires.<br/><br/>* Electrical power connections: I didn't want to splice into existing wires, so as others have suggested, I used a cigarette-lighter socket adapter connected to both the camera and monitor.<br/><br/>* Monitor placement: This is the most frustrating part, for me. There's almost no place other than the rear-view mirror to mount the monitor. Although it works, I didn't like it because the monitor as well as the factory mirror give a narrow view. The thick safety pillars, high back-window shelf, and bulky headrests all contribute blind spots. I've used a wide convex rear-view mirror for years, and, after trying the monitor as mirror, I reverted to the old mirror. The monitor works well-enough down near the shifter console, but it blocks the CD player slot, plus it would need a way to fasten it. The preservative treatments on the plastic surfaces make it impossible to attach sticky-back Velcro. Hanging it over the air vents blocks the vents and the entertainment controls. I decided on wedging it between the left corner of the dashboard and the windshield, where it doesn't block forward vision. For safety, I'll lock it in soon. The only negative is that it's exposed when parked, and is tempting to thieves. I left slack in the cable so I can easily stash it in the door pocket, or disconnect the cable and put it in the trunk. After using it a while, it occurred to me that a great place for the monitor might be on the rear window shelf, so I could see it in the front rear-view mirror. A passenger in the middle of the back seat would block it, though.<br/><br/>* Parking: I still have to look out the windows to judge parallel parking, because of the camera's somewhat narrow angle of view. Also, it takes a lot of getting-used-to to understand how close things are.<br/><br/>* Picture quality: OK enough, but as another reviewer mentioned, bright lights, especially headlights at night, mess up the image. I plan to fit a gray filter over the lens that darkens the top half of the image, like those popular with cameras. My first try was rough, but proved the concept.<br/><br/>* Disappointments: It's not the fault of the product, but the camera doesn't show side blind spots. For me, the wide convex rear-view mirror helps.<br/><br/>* Second thought: If I had known that mounting the monitor on the rear-view mirror wasn't my best solution, I might have bought the smaller monitor model, hoping it would be easier to place.</span>

<span>The product works quite well but I had a hard time connecting this.  Given that I used many of the reviews as a replacement for the instructions, I thought that I should add my two cents worth.  After trying to get everything working using a fuse jack, etc. I spoke with someone who connected this on his car.  His advice was very good and made everything much easier.  I went to the hardware store and bought red wire and black wire (stranded).  I connected spliced the red wire on the mirror to the long red wire I purchased from the hardware store . . . I did the same with the black wire then ran the red and black wires to the back my full sized van. I splice the red wire to the red wire on the camera and the black wire to the blak wire on the camera.  Once I had a good connection, I used some a "quick snap wire splice" to splice the red wire to the backup light and the black wire to the negative or return wire.  The quick snap allowed me to connect these to the existing wires without disconnecting the wires.  See your car manual to identify which wires are for backup light, return, etc.  In my case, I had a wiring bundle for a trailer that I used but you should be able to connect it to your backup lights, reverse sensors, etc. (same concept).  Oh . . . as far as the green wire on the mirror . . . I did not need it so I cut it off but that is up to you.  Also . . . it may be better to ground the black wire but I was not getting joy with that so I connected it to the negative.  Anyway, I am a complete novice with cars and car electronics which I am sure is obvious if you know what you are doing.  I hope that my frustrations and subsequent success will help others.</span>

<span>We bought two of these for our kids to use on a long road trip between Texas and Florida.  We did not connect them together because our kids wanted to watch different movies.  We only used them to play DVDs.  First, these barely fit the headrests of my Buick Enclave.  I had to raise the headrest all the way up and use a lot of force to make these fit.  The headrest was in an uncomfortable position for me and my husband for our long trip.  But the main problem was trying to operate these units during the trip - incredibly frustrating!  I was constantly unbuckling my seat belt and leaning back to try to help my screaming kids who were always having some kind of problem with these units.  The unit itself does not have a main menu button, a pause or a play button.  You have to use the remote for these.  The problem is that the remote will control BOTH units at the same time, even if you only want to control one unit.  This meant that I had to unplug one unit to fix the settings on the other unit.  I had to do this a lot because each time the power to the units was off (when we stopped for gas, etc.), the settings would change randomly (i.e., change from DVD input to HDMI input or something else).  Changing the input without the remote (using the unit's buttons) was nearly impossible without messing up something else.  So I had to unplug one unit to fix the input on the other using the remote.  Also frustrating was that many movies would start in the middle and I couldn't get them to go back to the beginning, even with the remote (I pressed all of the different "menu" buttons and the unit just showed an "X").  Some movies would not play at all.  By the end of the trip, the power input jack on one unit became very loose such that a very slight jostle would cause the power to turn off (and the settings to randomly change).  My 3 year old screamed each time it turned off, and I had to unbuckle, lean back and attempt to set it up again.  I would not recommend these players to anyone!</span>

<span>Loving the Pyle DVD thus far. We just got it in the mail yesterday and it didn't take long to set up in the car. Not many directions were needed but what was instructed didn't actually say how the DVD gets power. The directions only told you how to plug in a Dual DVD player into the other. It was easy as pie once I figured the 12V plug cord just needed to be plug into the car and imported into the DVD. This could be a common sense action to take but I thought there were other options like a way to charge it in a  wall outlet and the car adapter was a second option! We hope this DVD works great for our daughter in the long run! Thus far I would recommend this product!</span>

<span>There are no IR wireless headphones included despite it saying there are in the “what’s in the box” section of the description.

Amazon, however was extremely helpful and made the situation right.<br/><br/>The player seems fine otherwise. It mounted easily and the picture quality seems adequate.

ON/OFF works, but not with the door signal.  The third negative is the IR signal.  Terrible signal.  Static if not sitting directly in front of the tv.  Sitting driver or passenger side of the same seat, static.  I am now using a Bluetooth transmitter to headphones and that works much better.<br/><br/>I never tried the FM output so I don't know how strong that is.  Overall I am satisfied for the price, just wish all of the features worked well out of the box.</span>

<span>I like how big it is for our Suburban so the kids in the 3rd row can see it.  Picture quality is also good.  Installation was a bit of a challenge (just time consuming) for my husband, who is a mechanic.  We also had to buy a lot of extra cords and wires to connect it to the car and to our tablets can, and the instructions for connection were really poor.  Even after all that, my biggest issue is that, after using it for 2 weeks, the speakers busted.  My kids were watching a Disney movie on a road trip and suddenly, everything is super staticky.  I’m so bummed because my kids were so excited about this.  Now, it’s pretty much useless.<br/><br/>Edit:  After turning off the car and turning it back on, the speakers’ sound clarified.  It still sporadically gets staticky, but it did get better.</span>

<span>I came into this with low expectations. I was a car stereo enthusiasts many years ago and have experience with installation as well as being familiar with this brand for being very entry level. I needed something to keep our 1 and 3 year old busy while running all the other kids to thei activities with long waits. As long as it played videos, we are good. Installation was really simple for me, installed into a 2009 Ford E-350 passenger van. All rca and power wires are tied into one cord making running of the cord nice and easy. We have a rear power point (cigarette lighter type) outlet for constant power so I just tapped into that.  Only problem for anyone with out any experience... NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION. I had to search online to figure out what the second set of wits were for, they are for the dome light feature. I wasn’t worried about using that, so I just left them tucked under the unit.<br/><br/>We bought a 128gb usb drive to store movies and nursery rhymes on so no need to hook into anything external. The FM transmitter works decently, internal speakers are ok, but will likely be too loud for us in the front and not loud enough for those in the back.  With 6 kids, headphones are out of the question, so I did not test the IR functionality.<br/><br/>Overall I’m very pleased and it’s met or exceeded my expectations.</span>

<span>I've had a V3 for about 6 months and liked it so much I just got two more, and the hardwire kits. So now we have one in all three of our cars permanently mounted. I love that they turn on when you start the car and turn off on their own. Having the parking protection enabled is also great so that we can see who hits our car in a parking lot.. which happens too often.<br/><br/>The video quality is great, and the night sight is also quite amazing. I love that the videos do forwards and backwards! All for a great price (less than $200). Most of the other cameras with similar features were $400+.</span>

<span>I won't be buying BOSS anymore. I've had this head unit for a year now. When I first installed it I was ready to send it back because the volume knob was malfunctioning. Randomly when adjusting the volume it would continue in whatever direction I had changed the volume. Meaning if I tried increasing the volume one digit it would continue rising until it was at maximum. When I turned it down it would continue down until it was on zero. I couldn't change screens or shut it off because the volume knob was continually sending a signal, which prevented any other actions. The only remedy was to turn the car off and then it would go back to normal. This happened once or twice a week. I got fed up enough that I contacted the seller and asked for a refund. But since I hadn't installed it right away, I was just barely passed the 30 day mark and he refused a refund and offered to help me start a warranty claim with the manufacturer. I didn't want another crappy unit, though, I wanted a refund. I did open a help ticket with the manufacturer, but they never responded. I dealt with the problem the rest of last summer. This spring I pulled the head unit out and found a black wire that wasn't being used, but the end was exposed (the insulation was off). I taped this up and I taped the ends of all the other unused wires even though the insulation was still on them. The volume problem only happened once since then. Maybe that was it, or maybe it's just randomly behaving itself for now.<br/><br/>Now for the minor problems:<br/><br/>1. My biggest issue with this radio itself is the fact that there is no seek function. Finding new radio stations requires you to push the tiny left arrow button countless times and search through every single static station in order to find radio stations near you. I travel a lot and can't always listen to presets. Or they get reset when the battery is disconnected and I have to spend the trip home reprogramming them. I don't know how many times I've been trying to find a new station by hitting that arrow button over and over when an errant finger slips and I hit another icon on the screen. It's really irritating. I sprung for a unit so my steering wheel buttons would work with this radio and even the seek buttons on there don't do anything.<br/><br/>2. Switching between modes (from radio to CD or bluetooth, etc) takes much longer than it should. Another irritating event whenever I'm trying to change the station with the little arrow and my finger accidentally presses the CD icon.<br/><br/>3. As others have noticed, volume doesn't increase or decrease consistently. For mine, the volume increases in very minute increments from 1-6 and then between 6 and 7 the volume jumps up much louder. Then the small increments start again. A minor inconvenience that shows the quality of BOSS.<br/><br/>4. I can't for sure blame this on the head unit or something else during install, but I can't rule out the head unit either. After installation, the gauge lights on the dash on my car no longer work. I've checked every. single. fuse. both visually and with a tester and they're all good. I also replaced the most obvious fuses just in case. All other lights work, including other dash lights. Only the gauge lights went out. Something happened when this head unit was installed and I can't figure out what caused the problem.<br/><br/>This head unit is in need of refinement. Since the initial problem with the volume seems to have gone away, I can live with the other little annoyances. If it wasn't for the lack of a seek function I would give a 4-star rating. Every stock or aftermarket radio I've had in every car I've ever owned all the way back to the 1985 Chevy Cavalier I had in high school had seek buttons. It's a pretty basic feature and not having it bothers me more often than having to turn on my dome light to see how fast I'm going when driving at night. It's for that reason and the lack of support from BOSS that I don't recommend this product.</span>

<span>Put this in my 2002 Chevy truck. I think it is really a good upgrade from the factory radio, for a non audio enthusiasts.  Has some room to add features I may use in the future. I only use the streaming and radio at the moment. Phone call audio is lower than expected, but still an upgrade from where I was, and I don't generally use the phone call feature long.</span>

<span> I wanted to wait until I had some time to use and learn this unit before I posted my review. Since the reviews here are all over the place I thought I would try to give the best opinion I can. I'll cover installation, usage and features that I have opted to use so that hopefully it will be useful.<br/>INSTALLATION: This is not the 1st radio I have installed but it is the first double DIN I have done. As far as installing it was no different that what I have experienced with other after market radios. The wiring instructions are printed very small in the supplied book, but it was not at all difficult to figure out. I used a harness to match the factory harness in my car. I soldered all the wire connections and the wires held solder very well. For reference I installed this in a 2009 Toyota Camry SE. In order for me to utilize the steering wheel control I need another accessory. I did try hooking directly to the harness with the wires from the unit to the three corresponding wires on my vehicle but it didn't work. Your vehicle may be different than mine.<br/>USAGE/FEATURES: the touchscreen is very responsive and feels comfortable to use. However, I will prefer to use my steering wheel controls while driving since it is a little distracting finding the source and songs/station while driving. This is just my preference and shouldn't be used as a negative towards the unit itself. Navigating the features and what not are easy to learn and not very cumbersome to learn. I have used the Bluetooth feature to stream Pandora, music and even YouTube audio through the head unit and it worked as expected. The hands free calling works well and the phone conversation is clear and audible. As a note: If you enter the car on the phone and turn the radio on, it will switch to hands free once it pairs with the phone, which is cool, but be aware that if you were listing to the radio at high volume, the call will be very loud! This did happen to me and provided a nice laughter session during the conversation! USB/SD both work very well. I have opted to just use the SD card feature mostly and occasionally use the USB for variation of music. The AM/FM tuner works well and since I only listen to FM for morning talk shows I really can't go into reception quality or usage. But from what little time I played around with it, it is easy to use and sound quality is what I expect from terrestrial broadcast. DVD works well. It doesn't playback DTS at all, and only stereo from Dolby Digital. Not a deal breaker for me, I w really don't plan on using this as my primary movie source. DVD Audio does work but with stereo only, but I am OK with that as well. REAR-VIEW capability is something I am interested in but have not hooked up yet. I have to still find a camera and plan on how I will run the wires form the tag area on my car. Once I have done that and used it a day or two I will update the results here.<br/><br/>Overall I am pleased with the unit. The volume the built in amp is capable of playback at higher volumes than I actually use and is distortion free. I am not running the speakers through any external amplifiers. I have 4 6X9 speakers hooked up to the unit. I do have a powered sub-woofer running off the Pre-Output (RCA). At first I used the sub-woofer pre-out and it was not loud enough for me to hear the bass punch I desire. I then used the front pre-outs for the sub-woofer and that made a difference. For the money I paid for this unit I am very pleased, I know if I spent a little more I could get some additional features but I had a small budget the improve the speakers/radio and add a sub-woofer.<br/><br/>Four of Five stars review for the features and design. Less one star for lack of EQ and ability to change wallpapers from factory settings. There are 4 such wallpapers to select from however. Please note: If you are looking for top line features this is not the unit for you. If you want Iphone inter-connectivity and control, this is not the unit for you. If you want a decent touchscreen with several modern features at a good price, this might be an item for you. I hope this was useful and if I have any issues I will update my review, otherwise, so far so good!<br/><br/>Update #1: I installed the Metra Axxess ASWC-1 and I can confirm that it does work with this radio. I would recommend to also get the proper harness for your vehicle as well. I was able to find the one for mine and it made the install a breeze. You do have to map the commands to the radio and the GUI interface is a little confusing, but not impossible to figure out!<br/><br/>Update #2 (12/26/2014): The screen doesn't like cold weather! On very cold mornings the screen looks a little alien and/or doesn't come on at all. It is a little annoying, but once the unit warms and and power cycle the unit it works properly. I am not sure if this is a common problem with all LCD based units or not (I would imagine it is) but I figured it was worth an update. (02/28/2015) I wanted to clarify that this is not a common problem. It only has happened a few times and the temps were under 20 degrees. Thankfully, where I live that is vary rare!<br/><br/>Update #3 (12/26/2014): On both the SD Card and USB connection, if you quickly skip songs the unit will reboot. I have experimented to see if it is the .mp3 or the card and have isolated that it is the radio itself. What I have done to reduce the rebooting during song selection playback is let the song play a few seconds than skip to the next one. Also it is much worse if you use random play. (02/28/2015) I have since updated my music on both USB and SD cards, and the problem has gone away. I do not believe that the problem was the radio, rather the files on my drives. I noticed that I had some .ogg music on the disks and those were the songs that were making the radio reboot.<br/><br/>Update #4(02/28/2015) Added a back up camera and it works as expected. No complaints or problems with the use or install of the device. I would recommend having a professional install it for you if you are nervous or inexperienced at making modifications to sheet metal on your car! I had to drill a 10mm hole on an interior panel of my trunk for the wires to run through. Also as part of the update I have taken some pictures of the radio in action and made a short video.<br/><br/>Overall impressions of the radio are fairly positive. It is a good radio on a budget that has several features that make it flexible for several types of users. In all honesty I may replace the unit with a different brand, not because I have anything negative about this brand or radio, but I would like additional features that this unit doesn't have.</span>

<span>Well it plays music and even made the 16 year old factory speakers sound good, HOWEVER I would not recommend this to anyone! Where do I start??? The USB Plug is mini! They do give you the adapter but now you have a thumb drive sticking 3 or 4 inches out of your stereo! Now, try plugging your iPhone into it and wait and see what happens! Ready??? NOTHING! No sync, no nothing! Like it isn't even there! It doesn't even charge it!<br/><br/>So not that you can't plug your favorite MP3 Player into the unit but you have to use the 1/8 mini plug (which is included) Woo Hoo! a 2.00 value, but you have to control the songs using your MP3 player not the units fairly useless touch screen! I say fairly useless because when you want to go to the next song... You HAVE TO USE THE REMOTE!!! There is no skip forward or back button on the screen! You can view maybe 8 songs on the screen to choose from which would in fact let you touch the screen and go back and fourth but you can't touch the screen to scroll through the list! Maybe not a big deal if you put 8 songs on the SD card but when you have a few hundred songs this sucks!<br/><br/>On to other things! When the screen is down, the controls on the detachable front are USELESS!!! they have one for AM/FM and one or two other useless features! You will be hard pressed to find anything good on the front panel except for the "open" button so you can use the useless screen... I forgot to mention the part about the screen that I hate the most! When you are looking at the 8 or so songs, you can only see abbreviated song title on the right side of the screen! The left side just says "SD Card" In case you didnt know what source you chose!<br/><br/>Now if you are still trying to decide on buying this...<br/>The rear view camera... USELESS! I hooked it up and... Nothing!!!<br/>Tested camera, and it works! No place to select camera on the menu though so it isn't like i need to select it to use it so what gives? I tried to hook it up like the directions on both the radio and the camera said (which were the same) and nothing? What gives? I gave up!<br/><br/>I decided to try and email legacy customer support! HaHaHa! Just like the stereo, they are lacking also! 2 weeks and no reply! Try through the website and... Nothing! Now several emails to every email address I could find and over a month of trying I give up!!! My mission here today is to save YOU from wasting your time and hard earned money buying this junk! I could have tried to return it but after cutting and soldering all the wires and spending the time to install it, the money is lost! LEARN from my mistakes! I will just leave the face on it and hope that someone steals it so I don't have to waste my time removing it!<br/><br/>Oh and I almost forgot the DVD player! I did ground it out so it would play videos while driving, because that is a great idea and it is one place where the unit shines... the touch screen works well here and the picture is decent but hard to enjoy on the small screen and impossible for your child to see from the backseat!<br/><br/>I was originally going to give this 3 stars because it sounded good but...<br/>Anything sounds better than the stock cassette player that is older than most people reading this, so after reading over everything I wrote, it brought back painful memories about how excited I was while I waited for it to arrive and waited to get a few hours to install it only to find out how crappy it actually is! So I am dropping it down to a 2 stars! I highly recomend spending a few dollars more and getting something with a functional USB port and maybe Bluetooth? Most importantly... controls on the detachable face, just in case the touch screen on the unit is as bad as this ones!</span>

<span>I bought this for my grandson for his 1991 Chevy Cheyenne.  He installed it himself and said it was very easy to install.  He loves it.  I bought a back up camera to help when he has large loads.  It accepted the back up camera just perfectly.</span>

<span>I installed it in my 2005 Dodge pickup. The radio worked well for 9 months the AM bands had lots of static and the volume would change by itself. The back up camera failed after six months. I used an amp meter to check circuit power and power came to the radio but no camera screen.<br/>I do not recommend this radio unit due to the issues. I will replace it with a more dependable radio</span>
