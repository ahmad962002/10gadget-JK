                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This launch monitor works great. It was easy to set up, pretty accurate and it’s easy to align. So far I love it. I returned the garmin approach R10 because it was a pain to align and wouldn’t register a lot of swings. With the Rapsodo I’ve probably hit around 100 swings and it’s only missed 2-3 probably because I hit them low. Overall I’m super impressed. Definitely recommending this product</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This monitor is very easy to set up and easy to use. Just what I was looking for! I love the video playback of every shot.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>One of the keys to lowering your score is consistency in distance (as well as direction).  The MLM provides the feedback needed to improve that consistency by providing accurate feedback on swing speed, carry distance, launch angle and more.<br/><br/>It's pretty easy to set up and then provides very clear feedback on your swing and results.  I've dropped a few strokes in my handicap is the past few months of using the MLM by dialing in my carry distances with my irons and thus improving my GIR percentage.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The product is compact and very easy to set up.  It comes in a protective case for ease of transport.  I found that using the iPad while on the range was better simply from a visual ease perspective.  I use club sensors to track distances during round play and this monitor seemed to align exactly with what my round data indicates from a distance standpoint.  The shot tracer and video components are a huge plus!</span>

<span>You have to like the price of this device and it is good Garmin is finally getting them back in stock.<br/>Now that I have used the product outdoors at the range I am updating my review and have added another star.  The R10 works very well as long as you take the time to set it up properly which is true of all launch monitors.  I did not have any other monitors to check the results but had a friend use a range finder to check distances and they were very close.  I did not pay for the subscription yet but I believe it could be used to simulate play at a course in Home Tee Hero with good results.<br/><br/>I also want COMMEND the product support team they have worked with to attempt to resolve the issues I have had using the monitor indoors.  Using the Garmin Approach R10 indoors returns data well under what I should be seeing, by at least 20%.  I am an older golfer and the one time I had access to a TrackMan it clocked my swing speed between 65 &amp; 70mph so maybe the algorithms used in R10  penalize slower swings compared to others.  If so, I can hope a firmware or app update fixes addresses this.  Another shortcoming I have found is how many missed shots there are when the clubs speeds drop below 30mph.  I think that it tries to allow for a pre-swing waggle and as a result ignores short, slow chip like swings.  Even below 40mph some the data that is calculated can be missing but it usually captures most shots above 30mph.  This could really impact the ability to use this device in an indoor simulation as chipping would be much more difficult.  The R10 has no way to capture putting so in the simulation it assigns a number of putting strokes based on distance from the pin, I knew this ahead of my purchase and have no issue with it. (I forgot to check this on the range so not sure if it is an indoor only thing or something I am doing wrong, the YouTubers don't seem to have this issue)  If I get that fixed it will be 5 stars for sure.<br/><br/>On the plus side other than distance and carry being short, the data the R10 spits out is consistent and appears to be correct based on what I am seeing while using it.  Shots that go to the right of my target are reported as that direction, same for pulled shots that go to the left.  On the driving range app it is a little difficult to tell if there is a draw or a slice, just that it was offline and by how much.  Since it is radar-based lighting has no effect, so using it in a dimly lit garage should not be a problem or affect the data since technically you should be able to use it in the dark.<br/><br/>In the end I am glad that I bought it and will continue to use it during practice.  At this price point I doubt there is a better product for the mid to high handicapper looking for feedback on how they struck the ball.  If you buy one make sure you update the firmware as that can make a huge difference depending on when the device was built.<br/><br/>And once again product support has been excellent and continues to be quite responsive.</span>

<span>If you want a Golf simulator, this is the best on a budget! I love all of the different simulator apps that you are able to use with this device. Garman is constantly doing new updates to better the device as well. However, if you do, want to get a dedicated launch monitor with no simulator, I would suggest the Rep Soto MLM.  Make sure you take the time to set the Garmin up properly and calibrated and follow tips from groups on Facebook to get super accurate numbers.</span>

<span>First thing first, so simple to set up and use. I already had the Garmin Golf app because I use the Garmin watch when playing golf to get yardages but that is all you need to do is get the app, turn on the device and add the device to your app. I was literally out hitting shots into the net in less than 5 minutes. All of my shots registered first time and I have to say they seem very accurate based on my knowledge of my time spent on the course and at the range using top tracer. There is a wealth of information with every shot. You can see the ball flight if you want on a virtual driving range or you can have it display various stats on your phone as you swing. You can also turn on audio cues and decide which stat is audible after each swing. I think one of the coolest features is being able to look at all your shots after your practice session and you can add notes for each shot if you want.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend to anyone that wants to up their game. A friend of mine bought a $1500 tracker (used) and I don't see anything this R10 cannot tell me that his very expensive device displays. Can't wait to get out and practice now.</span>

Swing Caddie SC300i is the latest addition to our family of portable launch monitors. The SC300i is truly portable and provides golfers with complete swing and ball flight metrics found in professional launch monitors, including launch angle, apex, and spin (spin numbers displayed in the Swing Caddie App). Using the latest in Doppler radar technology, and calibrating atmospheric pressure sensors, the SC300i provides uncompromised precision. SC300i connects directly to a personal phone or tablet via Bluetooth allowing golfers to track their real-time, integrated data, video swing recording capabilities, and draw swing plane lines. Voice output of distance and a remote control provides the highest levels of user convenience.

<span>I bought the SC 300i after trying my friends a few times. For the most part I get fairly consistent results (didn’t say hugely accurate), but I noticed it read just a little bit less on my numbers then a much more expensive Trackman. Let me elaborate. I went to a club fitting last month on a Trackman and was getting numbers at about 104-106 mph for my driver club head speed. I had set up my SC300i at the same time and was consistently getting about 98-99 mph on the same strikes so I guess it was reading my swing slower by about 6-7 mph. For my seven iron fitting., Trackman had me btwn 86-88 mph and SC300i was about 84-85 so I think it was a little more accurate for the shorter club. Accordingly for distance, it was also reading a little bit shorter for both clubs. Interestingly the smash factor for both devices was actually fairly close. So either trackman was reading me high or the SC300i was reading me lower.  But of course I’m assuming the trackman is the more accurate being much more expensive and sophisticated device. But as I moved between different brands and shafts,  I did note that the relative differences between the Trackman and the SC300i stayed pretty consistent. In other words, if I was getting better #s with a Titlelist versus a Callaway, both devices had the same relative differences.<br/><br/>But I am just an older former college baseball player now turned weekend golfer playing 40 or so  rounds a year.  So I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on a device but I’m serious enough that I’d like to get a little better. I think for my testing purposes during my not frequent enough range sessions, the swing caddie gives me good enough comparative numbers. i.e. if I’m tweaking driver settings or comparing my driver with another buddies, I think it would give me those relative numbers fairly well. As far as dialing in yardage numbers, I think it does better still at the shorter target clubs like wedges up to the seven iron but maybe a little less so for long irons, hybrids and woods. But I’m not in the market to spend the $20K+ for a Trackman so the swing caddy does the job good enough for me!</span>

<span>The unit came and I made sure it was charged.  I was able to use it with my net indoors without issues and logged 25+ hours on the first charge.  I only hit my irons and utility woods indoors and everything seemed to work correctly.  I was happy with the unit.  I was able to recharge the battery over a 5 hour period and continued to use the voice caddie.  I started to take some swings indoors with my driver and it failed to pick up about 25% of the shots.  I assumed it was because I was topping the ball and the caddie could not see the ball but then there were balls that hit higher into the net than the missed balls and they were not detected.  Today I went to hit some balls into my net I turned the unit on and there was nothing.  I know the battery level was low the last time I used it and planned to re-charge soon but I know it still had some power left in the battery when I shut it off.  I plugged in the USB cable to recharge and there is no indication that the unit is recharging.  I sent an email to voice caddie support and am hoping to get it repaired or replaced but I am worried that there warranty information states that the "battery and other components are not covered by the warranty".  Seems to me to be a weak warranty?  You mean if I send it in and they determine that it was built correctly but component "A" failed and that is not covered by the warranty that they will not fix or replace?  That is strange.  Anyway I will wait to see what kind of response I get from my email.<br/><br/>I contacted voice caddie support and they provided a solution to force start the voice caddie which worked as suspected.  I am back up and running.</span>

<span>This is for the the SC300i.<br/>Distances are not accurate 50% of the time for well hit shots. I dont expect any accuracy for poorly struck shots so ignoring those. I use it at the range the most which has distance signs so you can see where your ball landed. Sometime it shows the distance I wish it would go and others it comes up short and more.than the margin of error I. The spec sheet. The longer the club, the more inaccurate.  Turning rollout on for total distance is even less accurate.  On the course then, i'll hit a driver and my son will hit a 5 wood and it will show the 5 wood went further than my drive and my drive went less than the 5 wood.  Walk up to the balls in the fairway and I'll be 20 yards further than the 5 wood.  Wedges up to a 9 iron seem to be very accurate.  Even the 8 iron has accuracy problems.<br/>I can't judge the rest of the metrics as I have no point of comparison.  The swing speed shows that my son hits 15 to 20 mph faster than me and his distances then are dramatically further than mine, but again, just inaccurate.  I really like this thing but can't justify keeping it with its main feature being so problematic.  It becomes just a novelty.</span>

<span>It is pretty easy to use! Out of 10 shots, it misses about 2. If it doesn’t pick up the shot, I just try to back it further away from me. The unit needs to be on the same level as the surface you are hitting off of. For example, you’ll hit off an AstroTurf patch at most driving ranges which is 1-2 inches off the ground. I’ll place the unit at least 6 feet back from me but have it raised on the rectangle box it comes with. I’ve found this to be the perfect height.<br/><br/>Even if there is somebody hitting next to you, it’ll still pick up your shot.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- you can log in each of your clubs with lofts (it even has most clubs already built in, eg I play with Titleist AP1 irons and the unit already had those in the firmware with lofts)<br/>- good reliability (catches 8/10 shots)<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- expensive<br/><br/>Overall, it does a good job and compared to the pro units costing thousand an of dollars, I’m happy with how it performs. It has changed to way I practice at driving ranges. I can now gap my own clubs to a certain extent and work on my distances.<br/><br/>The one downside is it still is expensive, but most golf equipment is, hence the 4/5 stars.</span>

Product Description   Sports Sensors Swing Speed Radar with Tempo Timer   Amazon.com   The Sports Sensors Swing Speed Radar with Tempo Timer lets you measure both your clubhead speed and swing tempo, from takeaway to ball impact. A small microwave Doppler radar velocity sensor, it can be used by golfers of all ages and skill levels to optimize swing mechanics and rhythm for achieving maximum distance and maintaining control, consistency and accuracy.  Clubhead speed and tempo are two significant characteristics of a golfer's swing that must be optimized and controlled if the golfer is to consistently achieve his/her best ball-striking results. Expensive launch monitors costing thousands of dollars, primarily used by well-funded clubmakers, instructors, or pro golfers, generally include these two vital parameters in their measurement systems. However, less expensive devices for use by most instructors, clubmakers, and by the golfing public are limited in utility. Conventional swing speed meters can be inconsistent, unreliable, and complicated to use. Some even require attachments to the club that can change the club swing dynamics. Metronome-type devices can provide tempo time models for the golfer to try to emulate, but the resulting tempo time can only be estimated by comparisons with the model.  The Swing Speed Radar with Tempo Timer can be set to measure and display clubhead swing speed alone (SS Mode); tempo time, from club takeaway to ball impact, alone (TT Mode); or both swing speed and tempo time in the Dual Mode, in which the display toggles (alternates) between swing speed and tempo time.  The Swing Speed Radar with Tempo Timer is the practical choice of clubmakers and instructors who want the flexibility and convenience of use in the field as well as at their home-based hitting stations. It can be used by golfers of all ages and skill levels, at home or at practice facilities. Tip: When practicing at home, in the backyard, or in areas where actual balls cannot be hit, it is best to use a practice ball "target" to obtain swing speeds that correspond directly to those of hitting an actual golf ball. The practice target provides a point to focus the release of the clubhead. Many golfers experience a slower swing speed without a practice target on which to precisely focus.

<span>Since I started playing golf, I've been wanting to know my golf swing speed. Taking lessons I was taught to make good contact and everything else except how to generate club speed.<br/>Today I found out what my swing speed is thanks to this little gadget. One thing I'm learning is that the swing speed is very inconsistent and it is hard to maintain the same speed all the time, trying to do that can lead to injuries.<br/>Anyway I'm very happy with this product.<br/>btw.. In case you were🤔 wondering my swing speed is 89 to 100 MPH. 😜<br/>Thank you for reading..</span>

<span>I purchased the swing speed with tempo timer. The item does what it says and it is really easy to use. Put the batteries in and push one button a couple of times and you are ready to go. The readings are accurate, as they match my swing speed in the golf shops. It also matches the swing speed as measured at a top 25 golf school. This is much more accurate than the swing speed gadget from Medicus that you clip on your club. With the Med. device set up as suggested, it reads 10-15 MPH faster than swing speed radar with tempo timer. We had to lower the club length with the Medicus device to 38 (from 45) inches to get it to read closely with SSRTT device. Be aware, Tech support has limited hours of operation, so if you work during the day, you may find it hard to get in touch with them should you need to.<br/><br/>The only two things I would point out that you should be aware of are: (1) if  you have a quick wide(1-2 foot) waggle, you will set it off and will not get an accuarate reading, (you can use a small slow waggle); and (2) I have had several very high readings 148-160 at times. There is no literature to tell you why this occurs. My swing speed generally will vary from 103-112 MPH with the driver. The high readings appear to be the ball speed. I surmised this based upon a 1.40-1.50 smash factor. I have generally noticed that everytime I get these readings, I hit it off the heel and pull the ball. Why this causes the radar to pick up the ball speed I do not know. But, it is the unusual reading so it is no big issue. If you hit it anywhere close to the sweet spot, you will get an accurate reading. I have yet to try it with measuring ball speed. My understanding is that if your launch angle is greater than 12 degrees, it will not give you an accurate ball speed reading. But, the Co. makes no promise that it will with launch angles higher than 12 degrees.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it is very useful to determine if changes you make to your golf swing are helping or hurting your game. I would highly recommend it! I never go to the driving range now without it! Kaos</span>

<span>Second to my Cimmaron 10x10x10 backyard net as the best golf purchase I have ever made. I have used this twice at the range and three times in my backyard and have increased my swing speed by about 5 mph per club. The feedback is fantastic.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>I think the biggest thing I learned with the radar was that trying to kill the ball is actually a total waste of time. It actually tightens you up and lowers your swing speed! Mentally you feel like you are swinging harder but in reality you are swinging slower.<br/><br/>In taking this to the range I can gauge based on the distance and height where I am hitting the ball on the face. For example I have two identical swing speeds with my 8 iron but on one of them the ball flight is about 15 yards farther (my typical 8 iron distance). Tells me I am hitting the shorter shot more up on the clubface more towards the toe of the club. Confirmed this with impact labels on the club.<br/><br/>Other things I learned thus far with this device:<br/>- That there is not much difference between what feels like an easy swing and one where I am trying the swing harder.<br/>- That the lower body hip movement easily 10% mph to the swing and even more when I fire the lower body in the optimal sequence (which I have not figured out to consistently yet)<br/>- Loosening the grip and relaxing the upper body adds to swing speed<br/>- Choking down on the club reduces swing speed with the same swing<br/>- The release/lag (unhinging of the wrists on the downswing) at the right time has a great impact on increasing swing speed.<br/><br/>There is a golf pro named Paul Wilson that has youtube videos that use this device and cover what I have just talked about.<br/><br/>CON<br/>Every now and then it will register a swing speed that is bogus. One time I took 4 swings with my driver and it registered 130-135mph. Ha, in my dreams. My driver swing speed falls within 90-95 mph.<br/><br/>I have not really used the tempo feature much other than to verify that my swing tempo is pretty consistent. Swing tempo is a very important and overlooked part of the swing, and given the price differential between this model and the speed only model is worth getting.<br/><br/>An excellent purchase.</span>

<span>This was my third attempt to find an accurate value swing monitor  I returned 2 others because of accuracy problems . One was a $500+ model .<br/><br/> I bought  this unit  for checking carry distance , smash factor and for future speed training and it excells in all these areas . The  audible calls help me maintain focus on my practice . I hope they add to these audibles in future models, especially smash factor.<br/><br/> Outdoors  the remote must be 6 inches to work and indoors about 12 inches ?  I believe it should work to at least 4 foot . Nothing "remote" about the remote .  It only serves as a switch base for additional functions . I changed the battery but it didn't help the problem . This problem is only a deal breaker if you intend to change clubs often . I usually hit 20 to 30 balls before I change clubs and that mitigates the problem .<br/><br/>  I used this monitor outdoors after a rain storm with premium balls and checked distances with a laser .  All balls were no more than 1 yard from pitch mark .</span>

<span>Knowing the swing speed, ball speed, smashing factor and distance, etc are highly essential parameters in golf swing and those values are reasonably sensitively shown with my swing.<br/>Carry and total distances for long clubs (woods) show some discrepancies (10-20% shorter than actual values).  However, since those parameters are all related each other, they are still useful in improving or correcting your swing pattern.</span>

<span>I was impressed during the practice sessions I used this product. It was easy to set up and was consistent in terms of distance/speed. It was fast and the display was easily readable. The remote worked perfectly and it supported the loft options on most of  my clubs (newer irons are much stronger and there may be a set that doesn't exactly map to your clubs). I really liked the feature that allows you to try and match the distances for the clubs<br/><br/>However, for me, unless I made an additional investment in rechargeable batteries (8 total) it would be limiting to use.  Maybe there was something wrong with my unit but I was only able to get throughabout 2.5 buckets of large range balls. I am normally at the range daily if I can make it and certainly at least 4 or 5 times a week as a minimum. I am not a big fan of alkaline batteries from an environmental perspective so not using rechargeables is not an option. It was also clear that you would need a case to store the unit and keep the extra set of batteries.<br/><br/>I am writing this to recommend this to anyone that may hit fewer  buckets a week and is looking for the most critical info on your swing. The price point and accuracy are really good for the features of this product and I recommend it. You can spend a lot more and not sure you would get better value for the extra features.</span>

<span>The sad reality of my swing. This is somewhat depressing as I imagined my swing to be faster. Looking at film, I seem faster, but electronic devices either work or don't. I do not think the readings are wrong. However, as a total beginner, I really had no clue and now I at least have a basis from which to work.<br/><br/>I have been playing around with different swings, now on my 203rd one (I have the ability to copy swings), and by tweaking things I actually have picked up a good 5 mph and that is good. The ball snaps into the net at a decent velocity and I do it with a bit more ease, although not at the point where people describe where they just let their arms swing free and all that. I use my arms fully. I think in actuality they just use more of their body, and do so more in synch.<br/><br/>I expect as I loosen up, become more confident in hitting the ball, work on my not yet flowing follow-through that maybe there is another 5 mph in me. That would be acceptable and something that would preserve some accuracy as it is not the wild swing I reserve for when Titanaboa comes out of the swamp.<br/><br/>So, after a few days I have a realistic idea of my swing speed, have gained a good 5 mph and have some hope for more. Clearly this was an essential tool for me to learn golf since I have not taken lessons.<br/><br/>I think it is money well-spent, but I had to take off a star because the button seems semi-stuck and jammed in. It works, but I have to press pretty hard. I won't send it back because it actually works, or that explains my swing speed readouts...<br/><br/>Made in the USA, although the button installing person should be beaten.</span>

<span>Pretty ready to put on cluhs.  I gain a great deal of insight to my putting and swing tempo as well as the orientation of the putter and Clubface.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this exclusively for putting. It always works and I get instant feedback. It has about 10 factors to measure on your stroke so if you want feedback this is the item to buy. I have used it for over a year and have "perfected" my tempo. Other parts are definitely harder to improve. I do wonder how accurate it can be with things such as putter face angle when each time you put it on your club you cannot reindex to the prior orientation but even so on a relative basis each session it is the same position so it will measure your strokes for that session or while it isn't taken off. Finally there are times I hit the ball and data says bad stroke but I hole a putt. In the end I have determined your eye/mind compensates often for your imperfect stroke. Bottom line there is lots of data and it definitely gives you lots to work on. Much better than standing on a putting green for hours just putting and trying to hole a shot with no plan and limited feedback.</span>

<span>fast and easy to use. Not sure about the accuracy in club speed. Different with my two radar monitor. but only few percent. Can easily live with this difference. GREAT for putting metrics the only one that really works.</span>

<span>Monitored driver swing speed on a radar based launch monitor and compared to Blast sensor readings.  Way off and erratic for blast monitor.  If I had a swing speed of 110 MPH I'd be hitting it a-lot longer than 230 yards. Launch monitor is very consistent at 92MPH and matches actual range performance.  Love the tempo AOA and other features.  Layout is great.  Unfortunately very suspicious about its accuracy on other measurements given the swing speed was so far off.</span>
