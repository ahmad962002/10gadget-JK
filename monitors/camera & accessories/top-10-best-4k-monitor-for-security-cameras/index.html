<span>This is a 20 inch screen with hdmi (and other) input. Just a nice little monitor I use to play my switch at my dorm. It has a headphone jack too which is really nice. Almost nothing bad to say about it. It does its job well. Only thing I can think of is hooks to hang cords and the picture not being locked in but instead automatically switched from the preset to custom when you try to change it.</span>

<span>I ordered this new monitor for my laptop since the old monitor wouldn't attached to my laptop. I love it! I ordered it and received it the same day which was great! The only1 thing that made me mad is the next day it was 21% off but I needed it, so it is what it is. The size it true and the colors are great! It only took about 5 minutes to put it together. I will and already have referred people to order this monitor. Matter of fact, I use it for work, and I had to share my information on the computer, and they made a comment about how it is big and how it looks. I love it!</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>Nice prompt delivery, well packaged.  Picture is good.  The tweaking selections are all on the back which makes it  hard to adjust since you can't see both sides at once, but if you get it figured out, finally, there are no complaints, but I wish it had a front bar or screen for that.  I think I could then really tweak it well.  Speakers are okay, again they face backwards instead of out the front where I am, and my computer speakers are better,  and there is no way to switch them or add stereo, which I could do if the setting was there for it.  But I could do headphones if I wanted that.  But for the money it's not a bad deal at all.  I got the 24 inch.  I desperately needed a bigger screen and this helped me out!  The color is good for my artwork.  I did have to call tech support for a question and they were very nice and helpful.  Not a super-perfect product but a really good one, and a great deal for the price.  Thanks!</span>

<span>I have purchased 3 of these from Amazon in the past couple of years. When on sale the price dips below $90 which I think is a great value but I have only seen it happen twice in 2 years time. It's a good monitor with nice picture quality and good features.<br/><br/>That beings said though be careful if ordering more than one for a matching setup because as you can see from my pictures out of the 3 I have purchased one of them is smaller in size, shape, and has a slightly thinner frame around it than the other two even though I purchased all 3 from Amazon themselves and from the same listing that I have had saved in my shopping list for past couple of years.<br/><br/>The have the exact same model number except the slightly smaller one has a 1 at the end of the model number. I don't know if this is normal or a mistake but either way they all work great they just look different which is why I had to buy 3 total in order to get two that matched perfectly side by side for my dual monitor setup. I gave the 3rd odd ball one to my son because he needed an upgrade as well so it at all worked out in the end. Weirdly enough though the 3rd one I ordered matched the original one I ordered 2 years ago instead of the 2nd one that I had purchased a week ago so that means Amazon must of a mixture of both in their current inventory.</span>

<span>I have external monitors at home and work so I can just plug in my M1 Macbook Air and have plenty of screen real estate.<br/><br/>I bought this monitor 6 weeks ago to replace an aging 24" Dell monitor that had served me very well.  But 4K monitors have been getting better and coming down in price, so it was time to upgrade.<br/><br/>Last fall, I bought the more expensive Dell U2720QM monitor for my office at work.  That one cost about $550 (and often cannot be found for less than $650).  This one, the Dell S2722QC, costs about $380.  I will be comparing them in this review, and - spoiler alert - this monitor, the QC, is pretty much just as good as the more expensive QM.<br/><br/>Both the QC and QM models are 27", 4K, have nice bright screens, and accurate vivid colors right out of the box.<br/><br/>Both have wonderfully adjustable stands:  there's the usual tilt &amp; swivel, and you can slide the screen up to a higher position (useful if the screen is plugged into a laptop and the laptop is directly in front of the screen on your desk) or to a very low position where the bottom of the monitor is an inch from the surface of your desk.  But the really cool thing is that stand (for BOTH monitors) allows you to rotate the screen 90 degrees so it's in portrait mode.  That's really helpful for some of my use-cases.  It's also useful to help you see the ports on the bottom edge of the display, when you're plugging in cables - otherwise they're hard to see when you're trying to plug something in.<br/><br/>Both of these monitors can replace a USB-C hub.  Meaning, you can plug in several peripherals into the monitor and connect the monitor to your computer using just a single USB-C cable.  Your computer will get power from the monitor over the same USB-C cable that your computer uses to transmit data to the monitor.  And your computer will see all the peripherals that are connected to the monitor as if they were connected directly to your computer.<br/><br/>These USB-C hubs are godsends for people with laptops that only have 1 or 2 or 3 USB-C ports.  For this reason, I have used USB-C hubs for my offices at home and work; they're not cheap, but they're worth it for me.<br/><br/>But the USB-C hubs take up desk space and have some cord clutter.  With the Dell monitors, I don't need the USB-C hubs any more.  I donated one to my college and the other to a local church.  Both Dell monitors have enough ports for me to plug in my printer, my external hi-fi speakers, my external web-cam for Zoom &amp; FaceTime calls, and an external SSD hard drive.<br/><br/>So why does the Dell U2720QM cost so much more than this Dell S2722QC?  Well, the QM has one or two more ports (for the USB-C hub functionality) than this QC model.  And, on paper, the QM seems to have a slightly better display, according to specs.  But I have both, and I can't tell a difference in video quality.  Probably people who do a ton of photo and video editing could, but I have good eyes and I can't tell the difference, and I don't think most people will see enough of a difference to justify spending $200 more for the QM model.<br/><br/>Oh, here's one more difference:  the cheaper QC model has built-in speakers, the more expensive QM model does not.  I have to say, I really dislike the sound that comes from the speakers in the QC monitor; it is very very thin and tinny sounding, almost to the point of being shrill and annoying.  My laptop speakers (which are not great) sound way better.<br/><br/>And that's a shame, because if you're feeding video into the QC monitor from HDMI (for example if you plug a blu-ray player into the HDMI port), the audio goes in over the same cable, so the monitor really needs to have its own speakers otherwise it's difficult to find a way to hear the sound.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  for most people, this $380 QC model is every bit as good as the QM model that costs $550 or $650 or more, even though both have a gorgeous 27" 4K display and both have very useful USB-C hub functionality.  And the stand's flexibility is really useful.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!</span>

<span>I bought this for programming and editing along with its 1080p little brother. The 4k is my main monitor for viewing and it does everything perfectly! The "Comfort view" definitely helps my eye strain and helpes take the blue and flicker out of the equation. I only wish the Dell 1080p I bought along with this one had the "Comfort view". It makes all the difference!!!! The USB type C charges everything very quickly, just be careful the 65watts doesn't damage your cell phone or electronic that you attach to it.</span>

I just plug in my MacBook (or XPS 13, depending on what I'm working on) and I get 4k60 graphics, keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals, and power to charge the laptop.<br/><br/>With the quality, features, and price, I'd definitely buy this display again!<br/><br/>(yes, I'll admit the MacBook still has it beat for pixel density, brightness, and contrast, but unlike many other monitors, this Dell still looks solid even in a side-by-side comparison.)</span>

<span>I'm using this curved 4K monitor with my Mac Mini and I love it. In order to get 60Hz at 4K with a Mac Mini you will need to get the right cable. I'm using a $15 Thunderbolt/USB-C to DisplayPort cable and it works great. With HDMI you will only get 30Hz at 4K, I believe.<br/><br/>The other thing that took me days to figure out is that some apps/games will cause the screen to flicker really badly. Don't panic! You just have to change the color profile. Go to the "Displays" settings, and select sRGB, or P3, or Adobe RGB, or some other profile and you WILL find a profile that doesn't flicker. I use the same profile 99% of the time, and then I change it for the one or two odd apps that cause the problem. I really don't think this is a monitor issue. I think it's a graphics driver issue with the Mini. In any case, the fix only takes 10 seconds and it always works.<br/><br/>By the way, the text will be tiny by default. If I set the resolution to "scaled" and then select the 3008x1692 option, the text and UI elements will be scaled to be readable, but the rest of the screen will still be 4K. I didn't believe it at first, but it's true. I didn't want to scale anything because I thought it would work like Windows where it scales the entire screen and you lose clarity. With Mac OS the scaling appears to only affect the UI. The app window content is all still 4K.<br/><br/>I've been using this monitor for about 4 months now and after doing all the above, it has functioned perfectly. The curved thing does take a while to get used to though. I actually like it now.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Overall this is a good monitor for home use.<br/><br/>There are better ones out there, but the price point makes this one worth considering.  I bought it because I wanted to display text files in larger sizes -- so far, it's doing an excellent job.  Text is crisp, and the larger size allows me to both read more easily and multitask.  Arguably a similar arrangement could be done through two smaller monitors, as is the case in my business office, but I don't like the screen being divided.<br/><br/>My old monitor was 27 inches.  It, too, worked well for many years, but as my eyes have changed, I was feeling more strain to read text.  Because I write and edit a lot, among other things, I often have more than one full-sized page open at a time.  The problem was larger monitors without higher resolution were not necessarily an improvement.  Yes, they enlarged the images, but then the text wasn't as readable.  This higher resolution, 4K monitor bridges that gap.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>1) Crisp images and text -- I can run a 4K movie in a window and still have plenty of real estate for other applications.<br/>2) A decent refresh rate -- videogamers no doubt will have quibbles, but for ordinary business use and all but the most sophisticated graphics, it's fine.<br/>3) No dead pixels or screen bleed -- I've been using the monitor a while now, but, of course, these flaws often don't show up right away.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>1) Color reproduction seems a bit off compared to my old, non-Samsung monitor.  The colors lean toward the blue portion of the spectrum.  I may play around with the settings more to see if I can warm things up.<br/>2) The display stand is not adjustable and does not swivel.  This is a bigger issue than it sounds because it's actually in an computer cabinet with fixed shelving.  Yes, I can raise the office chair, but this is the first monitor I've ever owned that can't simply be raised or lowered at the stand.<br/>3) Physical buttons are awkward.  There's a circular control in the back that's tough to reach (especially since the monitor also does not swivel).  The HDMI and power plugs are on the opposite side . . . which is awkward since the feed for cables in my display cabinet as well as the wall socket are opposite of that.  Because the power cable is short, I actually have to use an extension cord to plug it in.<br/><br/>So, if you can live with these limitations -- some of which are specific to my furniture and den set up -- this is a good value for the price.<br/><br/>Time will tell how long it lasts.  For the past 10 years or so, I've sworn by Samsung televisions, but a more recent one developed significant display problems because of a long, purple "cloud" across the top of the screen.  I'm guessing because the television is so razor thin, the screen buckled from it's own weight, warping that portion.<br/><br/>It's too early to tell if this monitor, which is similar in proportion, will do the same.  In more recent years, Samsung seems to be using cheaper parts and components, so I may need to update this review in a few months.</span>

<span>I use this mainly for work through a KVM and on a Mac.  Works great on Mac, but when I switch to Linux the dark colors get green noise in them.  For the amount I spent and the primary use case, this monitor is a good value.  I don't think this is a gaming monitor, haven't tried but the refresh rate is low.

<span>The display is pretty clear! I am unwilling to get back to my small monitor after I got used to the monitor. One flaw is that the refreshing rate is a little bit low.  One can easily sense the drag when moving the pointer in such a big screen. And may not be good for gaming though!</span>

<span>This review is for the SB220Q series (1920x1080) 75Hz monitor variant.  At a $90 price point as of July 2020, all of the praise this monitor has gotten and continues to get is pretty well deserved.  Right out of the box the factory calibration is pretty awful as with most TVs and monitors (I’ll never understand why that is), but Acer’s built-in menu gives you a wide range of control to tweak the image quality to your liking.  Here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past three weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The colors can be very vibrant and the sharpness makes everything nice and crisp both up close and from a distance without going overboard.  Although the spec sheet does not specify the exact Adobe or sRGB color gamut range, it does have a stated 72% NTSC coverage (keep in mind that the NTSC color gamut has the highest level of color reproduction), which would imply that it should have close to 100% sRGB coverage.  This is pretty standard for most sub $200 monitors (note: the unit that TechSpot tested came in at around 93% of sRGB coverage mostly losing detail in the green range so your unit’s reproduction may vary).  The 6-bits + FRC (equal to 8-bits) color depth is also an industry standard for entry level monitors and is completely fine for casual use.<br/><br/>- This montior’s “100,000,000:1” Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) (non-standardized measure of contrast for videos) definitely seems to outperform my other slightly more expensive budget IPS monitors (the HP VH240a and ViewSonic VS2412-H)  that only have 20,000,000:1 and 50,000,000:1 contrast ratios respectively.  However, note that it still has an industry standard 1000:1 Static Contrast Ratio (measure for non-moving images) which isn’t great but is perfectly acceptable for casual viewing since only the highest tiered ($400+) IPS panels exceed that point with 1,500:1 being the maximum native contrast typically achievable with an IPS.<br/>~ A quick side note about that “100,000,000:1” DCR number:  there is no industry standard methodology for this particular measurement so the number itself is mostly useless marketing fluff.  But as I noted, compared to the two other monitors with the same industry standard SCR, this monitor did seem to outperform them both in that area.<br/><br/>- Its 102 PPI pixel density actually makes a subtle difference in image quality when viewing up close compared to my 24 inch 1080p monitors that have a 92 PPI.  Text seems to be a bit smoother in comparison.  This is purely an advantage of having the smaller 21.5 inch screen.<br/><br/>- The Color Adjustment Menu allows you to adjust both the RGB and CMY gains, bias, hues, and saturation levels to get a better color balance.<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu lets you adjust the screen’s brightness, contrast, gamma, and blackness (“black boost”) levels while also providing a ‘blue light’, ‘adaptive constrast’ (ACM), and a ‘Super Sharpness’ on/off switch.<br/><br/>- The Game Menu has FreeSync (for AMD GPUs) and Overdrive options<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- The bezels are a bit thicker than I woud’ve liked (they’re about 1 cm on the top, left, and right sides) making the frameless design nothing more than a gimmick.<br/><br/>- The top-down viewing angle is noticeably darker compared to looking at the screen head on.<br/><br/>- Despite having a good DCR of 100M:1, the blacks are still a bit too bright for watching anything with heavy dark scenes since the display itself does not have any HDR capabilities with high contrast control zones aka local dimming (to be fair, this is completely expected at this $90 price point and is only being mentioned as reference for those that may be thinking of using this monitor to watch TV/movies).<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu’s ‘Super Sharpness’ option is just an on/off switch; it does not give you a more granular adjustment control over the amount of sharpness to apply.<br/><br/>- Even with all of the image quality adjustment options available in the settings, the whites remain on the slightly warmer side of the color temperature chart.  It’s not that noticeable when viewing on this monitor alone, but the difference can be seen if you have another slightly cooler display adjacent to it.  This is most likely just an issue with my particular unit since other reviews have noted their unit had a more neutral or “near perfect” white temp.<br/><br/>- It only has a paltry 15° degree back tilt compared to most other budget monitors being able to tilt closer to 30° degrees (this is super nitpicky as compromises are to be expected at a sub $100 price point).<br/><br/>- The Power button is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the menu buttons (both in shape and spacing).<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a nice quality budget monitor to look at spreadsheets, word documents, and do some internet browsing or even some light casual gaming, then this is a great choice.  If you are a competitive gamer, photographer, professional editor, or a content creator then you’ll obviously need to invest in a higher spec monitor.</span>

<span>Most reviewers below said they can't get 4k resolution.  The main issue is your PC/Mac can handle 4k resolution and the adapter/HDMI cable is 4k capable.<br/><br/>I had the issue with the HDMI adapter and I wasn't getting 4k resolution.  Once I switched to a different one, I got a fantastic 4k resolution.</span>

<span>This has been a great monitor connected to my 2015 Macbook Pro (not sure what another reviewer was talking about, this works fine with my Macbook). I also used this for an Xbox One, the 4k picture was excellent, the only downside was that the monitor has no speakers so you either have to use a headset connected to your controller or digital to analog audio converter that you can plug headphones into. At the current price this is a great value (40% off of what I paid in 2020), 28" is nice too for a little more screen real estate than the standard 27" screens.</span>

<span>As many other reviewers have rightly mentioned, this display is shipped in a way where it appears EXTREMELY dim (my second monitor at 50% was brighter than the Samsung S80A monitor). There is a setting causing this. To adjust this setting, press the middle button on the bottom to bring up the grid of icons. Press up once and press the center button again to go into the display settings. Scroll down to "system" and once again click the middle button. Scroll all the way to the bottom and disable "Eco Sensor Mode". I imagine for most people this will fix the issue. Brightness can also be adjusted in "Menu" under "Picture Settings".<br/><br/>Display is otherwise great. Clarity is good, although the coloring is clearly extremely over-saturated (I'd say likely not a good photo/video color correction monitor).</span>

<span>I have an old iMac (2012) and a new Macbook Air.  When I use this with the iMac, the resolution maxes at 1080p, which means every app is HUGE on the big screen. With the Air, I can raise the resolution and it's fine.<br/><br/>Also, I saw a review that said it's not bright enough and doesn't look as good as an Apple screen.  If you play around with the color profiles in your display settings to match that used by your machine, that shouldn't be a problem. It doesn't default to that, so you have to set it up manually. But after that, it's perfectly fine. And it costs about 1/10th what the new Apple display does.  I'm sure the Apple display is nicer, but someone else will have to enjoy spending over three grand for that.</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these at $299 each on prime day.  As I don't play games on PC, these 2 are just for my office use.  They serve that purpose good enough.  An entry level 4k@60hz, nothing else fancy.  Just be careful about a few things: 1) This monitor has the following input: 1 USB type C,1 DP, 1 HDMI, and 3 USB type A as output.  So type C is the only data input.  You cannot use a type A to type B cable for this as there's no port for type B. 2) One of the monitors is making high-pitching noise when connected via usb type C or DP.  What's more weird is this only happens when I connect my laptop to both monitors.  If I only connect type C or DP on one monitor no noise at all.  I have 2 different types of docks, 2 laptops, all kinds of DP and mini DP to DP cables, so after trying 2 dozens of the laptop-cable-dock combinations, I am sure the monitor is the cause of the noise issue.  As you may never experience this, this is just FYI.</span>

<span>This is a great monitor for the price. The ability to have TV quality sound, content, remote, etc. is really nice! And the built-in office 365 is convenient as well.<br/><br/>I LOVE the ability to stream 4k content directly from the monitor and not use a computer resources.<br/><br/>From reviews, I was nervous about the brightness. I love a bright screen as much as the next person, but at the same time I don’t want to blast my retinas at close range over an 8 hour work day or multi-hour gaming session.  Now that I’ve had two monitors for a month, I don’t think the brightness ‘issue’ is a huge deal. Perhaps if you were in a very sunny room. Could it be brighter, yes, but for the most part everyone should be happy with it.</span>

I ordered it because I had a tiny laptop and needed dual monitors and the docking station had a connection for a 4K monitor.  It can be used as a TV missed that too.  I feel really good about the purchase because I definitely got more than I expected.  Can also use Office 365 without a computer.  Who knew.</span>
