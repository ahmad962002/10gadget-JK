<span>Im defiantly a function over form type guy but this is one of the most elegant looking accessories on my desk. Just from holding the pieces in my hand everything feels really well built and out of high quality material at that. I planned on opting for one of the lower cost knock off brands but I'm really glad I didn't. This product is well worth the money I spent and will be buying another in the future.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Pros:<br/>+ Light was easy to setup and place on top of monitor<br/>+ Color temp control (daylight to warm white)<br/>+ Brightness control<br/>+ Does good job aiming light away from monitor and not causing glare<br/>+ Saves desk real estate that would be used by a lamp<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Price is a bit high for an LED strip in a tube (should be more like $50 IMO)<br/>- I wish it could get slightly brighter; good at what it does, but you can't use a task light for your desk if needed<br/>- USB C (device side) to USB A (power side) and NO AC adaptor so you need a free USB for power; includes cable<br/><br/>I would use this for when you want some soft lighting and working on PC at night.  I  do not regret buying.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Not cheap I suppose, but very high value. I was on the fence about whether to buy the one with or without the control pad. I paid the extra dollars for with. Glad I did. While it is true that it is probably not difficult to reach up and control the ScreenBar with buttons on top, the fact that the ScreenBar is not actually attached to the monitor makes me feel more comfortable controlling it without having to guess and fumble and possibly knock it off [maybe not likely but possible]. The small controller is easy to relocate out of the way and access when needed. The ability to control brightness [or use auto] and temperature is excellent. My workspace is now much better and more evenly illuminated than it was by an overhead spot. Further, screen rendering seems much easier on my eyes and with less glare. Should have bought one long ago. Highly recommended. [Amazon, next time you send me a returned product, at least make sure someone re-packages it competently.</span>

<span>I am impressed by the build of the lamp, and the high quality of the lighting.  I am using the lamp at my desk in front of a couple of monitors on stands.  The lamp is very heavy and sturdy, and easily holds the position you set it up in.  It is extremely adjustable and has great pivot points on the arms as well as a ball adjustment on the light head itself.  The LEDs are very high quality and it easily illuminates my entire desk with high quality light that reveals details that I had not seen with my old light-including a lot of dust!  The lighting itself is quite adjustable,  Not only can the amount of light be dimmed but the color temperature can be adjusted between cool and warm tones.  The reason it is called an e-reading lamp is it has automated modes that adjust lamp automatically for an optimal amount of lighting for your room for either reading or computer screen reading.  These function very well. The look of the lamp is very cool and modern, with the swooping angle of the light head and the dramatic length of the arms.  My only criticism is the dimming feature.  It doesn't dim as low as I would have liked.  I enjoy fairly dim light most of the time and even at its lowest setting the light was very bright.  This is more of a personal preference and of course people are buying this light for work or reading but I would have liked to be able to dim it all the way to zero, like how most dimmers work.  Aside from this complaint, I think it is a great lamp and a real upgrade to my work area.  I think, from an eye-health perspective, having high quality lighting like this will spare my eyes from strain, which is a huge plus.  I recommend this lamp if you can afford its high price.  For the money, you get amazing build quality and incredible technology,</span>

<span>I was recently looking to replace a lamp that broke on me. I remember that a lot of people in software engineering own this lamp. When I first saw the price tag I was like “how can a lamp possibly be worth 200+ dollars?”. After doing some more research in the area I still wasn’t fully convinced. No amount of YouTube reviews or Amazon comments was going to get me to spend 200 on a lamp. However, I remembered the story of the Pixar lamp in the opening of every Disney movie and how it’s based off an actual lamp in real life. Turns out that lamp costs 150 dollars (and it runs on a regular bulb). So something must be making these lamps worth the money, if every Pixar animator in that era swears by it. I took the leap of faith and purchased the BenQ lamp. On the first day, I knew I made the right decision. Pulling the product out of the box (the packaging alone was an experience) I could feel the build quality of all the parts. During assembly I knew the engineer put some thought into this product. Possibly the simplest setup process designed for people who don’t have time to waste on reading an IKEA like manual. And finally the light produced. The lamp puts off a very nice light that doesn’t hurt your eyes when under it for a long period of time. In fact I leave it on all day in my office and I don’t even notice it is there (I only notice when it’s not there). I think the best part was I found out that there is a floor lamp version of this light, which i immediately bought for my bedroom as a reading light that I dual purpose as an alarm clock with a smart plug and Alexa.<br/><br/>I think If you are still on the fence due to the price, then go to a local lamps plus store and check out a wider spectrum of lamps. You will see what quality you get for each price point among other lamps. Now if the quality difference of a 50 dollar lamp is negligible to a 300 dollar lamp, then you will know that this product is not for you and that’s perfectly okay. Spend your money on other things that will provide you more value.</span>

<span>This is a great accessory for your desk hands down! It works perfectly for my setup!<br/><br/>The light is bright and dimmable so you can find the right brightness level for you. It casts the light perfectly on to your work area without shining in your eyes or washing out your monitors image.<br/><br/>The versatility is great as well you can change the color temp between varying warm and cool white. You can also change the lights angle to adjust it to your setup.<br/><br/>The only feature I don't completely like is the auto-dimming. It tends to just always be a bit too bright for me, but that's ok with me. I just use the manual dimming to get my perfect lighting.<br/><br/>To conclude my ramblings it is a great product at a great value for your money. Similar products with the same features sell for typically $30 or more than this one. Definitely give this one a shot before you decide to spend more on other brands with the same features.<br/><br/>I give it a five star recommendation!</span>

<span>I've been looking at the "name brand" screenbar for quite some time, but just couldn't justify the price. This light seems almost identical so I finally purchased one for my home office. I am very satisfied with the quality. The advertised CRI light quality seems valid. The mount seems even better than the brand name version as it has a spring clamp that can expand for thicker monitors, and a small piece is included to provide a tight fit for thinner monitor frames. I ordered a second one for the kids desktop computer to give them better light when working on assignments in front of the computer.<br/><br/>Update: I'm adding two pictures of the light shining on the wall to compare the light shaping vs the screenbar from another brand. You can see that with this light the majority of the brightness is only on one side (in front of the monitor) which is what you want. In contrast, cheaper screenbar lights that don't tune the light path shine back on the monitor itself, causing unwanted reflections and glare and defeating the purpose of these lights.</span>

<span>I tried the BenQ monitor light for $99 and it was such a great monitor lamp. But it never sat good with me to pay so much for a light. So I searched around and found this TorchStar lamp at half the price.<br/>It is pretty much the same lamp, AT HALF THE PRICE! Some will mention the build quality and led brightness as being superior on the more expensive lamp. As far as build quality, they are almost identical. Same size, material, feel, buttons, etc... The brightness might be slightly brighter on the BenQ but for me that wasn't an advantage really. I don't need a lamp that close to me being that bright. I keep the lamp on the warm setting and let the auto dimmer adjust it. Works perfect.<br/>Included image of the TorchStar sitting above my Acer 27inch monitor and it is the perfect size for that size monitor.</span>

<span>If you need a light to brighten your desktop area and also reduce glare from the screen, this is a great product. The light rests well atop my 27" Apple monitor. I do have to shift it to the side rather than keep it centered in order to use the monitor's camera for conference calls. The three lighting options (white, warm, mix) are helpful as during the day the brightness in my office varies. I like that you can also adjust the brightness. Love that it plugs into the USB port on my monitor so there isn't need for an additional outlet.</span>

<span>I was trying to find a lamp for my desk and came across this product.<br/>It's the same product from Baesus and the light works great. I was not interested in the other lights due to the edgy look on the triangular designs, and this one's cylindrical design is much more sleek and clean.<br/>The brightness level can be adjusted using the knob on the light, and there are four different light temperatures.<br/><br/>I don't do too much book reading these days but this light is bright enough for anything you want to do on your desk.<br/><br/>It looks and fits great on my 27 inch dell S2716DG, but could not fit on my alienware AW3418DW due to the really thick top portion of monitor. Both of these monitors have USB ports so the light could be powered directly from the monitor.<br/><br/>Pros: MUCH cheaper than alternative product with same design<br/>Great lighting and brightness adjustments<br/>Easily adjustable angle, you can always avoid light reflection on screen and direct to your eyes.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Doesn't fit thick monitors like my alienware<br/>The brightness adjustment knob is kind of loose and feels cheap, maybe just my unit?<br/><br/>All in all a great product for the price!</span>

<span>Like many people, I found myself actually considering the ridiculously priced BenQ ScreenBar ($130 last I checked), but only because all the alternatives looked like cheap trash. Glad I kept searching and found this. Very impressed so far.<br/><br/>Build quality is very nice. It's all metal and feels hefty enough to take on the zombie apocalypse, but don't worry it's not as heavy as it feels. Most of the weight is in the base that sits behind the monitor and keeps this thing anchored. Controls are intuitive. You get 3 light temperatures: incandescent, fluorescent, and a neutral white in between, akin to the midday sun. I prefer the neutral color but they are all pleasant.<br/><br/>Note: It will remember your settings when you turn it off and on, but it resets if you cut off its power source, so I'd recommend connecting this to a dedicated charger rather than your monitor or computer ports.<br/><br/>IMO, SIKAI may be a new brand but they've definitely got a winner on their hands with this light.. They did a really great job with designing it and using quality materials, and all for pretty much the same price as the plastic versions the other Chinese competitors are producing.</span>

<span>I can't believe how awesome this light is. I can't believe this LED light is so warm and not cold at all. Yes, mine is set a little more to the red side, and the adjustment is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's purpose built for playing the piano, so the light is broad enough to cover many pages of sheet music on the stand.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I use the light sensor setting that senses movement to turn on, and sometimes, when playing very slow pieces without much movement it will shut off, so I have to lean forward into the light sensor to make it come back on.<br/><br/>Yes, I'd definitely buy this again.</span>

<span>This piano light works great with my upright piano. It puts the light right where I need it. There is also a sensor so it shuts off when you walk away and comes back on when you return that works great. I also really like the design of the bottom of the light. The piano lid hinge fits right in the light’s groove so it doesn’t slide around. It is worth every penny.</span>

<span>I like all of its features, basically I can utilize all the features provided.  Sometimes if a product provide way more features than you really need, then it's "useless".<br/>I like the flexible "gooseneck" that you can adjust whereever area you would like to lit up, unlike some others that it's rigid or with limited tilting or turning.<br/>The wireless is definitely almost everyone can utilize since wireless charging smartphone is just so popular.<br/>I utilize the extra USB port to charge my sport-health watch.<br/>I like they provide a power adapter that don't rely on your own power source.<br/>It's quite portable, thanks to the flexible gooseneck that you can wrap it and go.<br/>I like the light color temperature can be adjusted to fit different usage or brightness requirements.<br/>Some I don't like or need improvement is that,<br/>I hope there is 1~2 extra buttons.  since currently there is only 1 button to control everything including the color temperature and/or the brightness, it's simple, but every time you also need to cycle through all the color temperature to turn it on/off.  The brightness adjustment is workable but not very convenience.  So, hope there is extra 1~2 extra buttons for operation.<br/>The gooseneck personally I feel is slight short, it will be "great" if it can be couple inches longer.<br/>Overall, this portable desk light is portable, excellent for small table and need to move around frequently, features offered are useful!</span>
