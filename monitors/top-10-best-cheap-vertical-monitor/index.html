<span>Everything is great runs looks and feels amazing to the eye but on mine it came with a dead pixel in the middle of the screen I see it from time to time but I think that is just mine I didn’t bother to return it cause it would take to long but everything else is perfect</span>

<span>Setup was easy, Picture quality is good. My only compaint is the stand by light on the bottom of monitor blinks and is extremely bright even with a sticker over it I can still see it at night blinking.</span>

<span>Was using a top of the line Alienware IPS ultrawide.  Was too hard on the eyes.<br/><br/>Obviously this is a step down from a $1k monitor but honestly its not too far behind in picture and it's much easier on the eyes.<br/><br/>Just about everything I need in a monitor - high refresh, good quality, easy on eyes.  It's 1080p and I'm ok with that.  Even with an rtx 3070 1440p struggled on some games/settings. Everything runs like butter at 1080p</span>

<span>Desided to down size from a 43 inch 4k 60 hz tv which looks and runs amazing. But i wanted so ething with high refreshrate and still looks good. First time with anything over 60hz and personally its amazing. The colors are great. Still wish monitors would have a remote to them but, the blue light on the monitor which is set to standby by default but i have mine always on is the button that controlles it all and its super simple and convinient. Crystal clear smooth and very easing. Only downside is there is not any hdr. But two diaplay ports and a hdmi port plus auxillary cord jack is nice.</span>

<span>I have owned the monitor for a few weeks now, and it has performed flawlessly.  I use it as my computer monitor. I do not watch movies on it, and I have not used the built-in speakers.  My monitor came with no dead or stuck pixels.<br/><br/>Amazon shipped the monitor in its original box from Asus.  It was left on my doorstep by the delivery person.  I am glad no one saw it there and ran off with it.<br/><br/>Attaching the base to the monitor is very easy and requires no tools.  The base attaches securely, and is fairly stable.  The monitor's screen has a matte finish, but the bezel around the outside of the monitor is glossy.  Fortunately, the bezel is thin and unobtrusive.  A single (thankfully dim) LED indicates the status of the monitor.<br/><br/>Overall, I like the plain, unobtrusive styling of the monitor.  I looked at monitors from a number of manufacturers, before choosing this monitor, and many have unnecessary cheap-looking details.  E.g., a silver stripe along the bottom edge of a Dell monitor and a bright LED and lots of clear plastic around the edges of a Samsung monitor.<br/><br/>This monitor has various display modes.  Color balance and contrast are very different with each mode.  sRGB and Standard modes work best for normal desktop use.  I originally used sRGB mode, but the monitor was too bright in my relatively dimly lit room.  There does not seem to be a way to adjust things like brightness and contrast, except in Standard mode (but I could be missing something).  No matter, Standard mode offers a wide range of adjustments, and I was quickly able to adjust the display to my liking.  The control buttons along the bottom edge of the monitor are no more or less intuitive that those of other monitors I have used in the past.  The viewing angle is as good as other monitors I've looked at in this price range.<br/><br/>I have owned and used a number of LCD monitors over the years, and I do not think that this monitor displays any more ghosting than these others.  Perhaps there are higher-priced monitors that do not suffer from any ghosting-like artifacts, but I suspect that this monitor is just as good as others in its price range.  This is a good monitor.<br/><br/>Regarding ghosting, I watched a number of YouTube videos that show the "ghosting problem" with this monitor.  The ghosting was actually more pronounced when I watched these videos on my old HP LCD monitor than when I watched them on my new Asus monitor.  I suppose this means that my old monitor (which was very expensive when I bought it) had more of a ghosting problem than this monitor.  It does not pay to obsess over these things.<br/><br/>For the price, this looks to be a very good monitor, and I have no reservations recommending it to others.</span>

<span>UPDATE  3/26/13:<br/><br/>I played: Crysis 3, Dead Space 3, Skyrim, Doom 3: BFG Edition, Far Cry 3, GOW: Ascension, Mass Effect 3, and they all looked great on this monitor. I love this monitor and I definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>*So far I have tested 6 PS3 games with this monitor. (Note: the PS3 and Xbox 360 have graphics less good than high-end gaming PCs).<br/><br/>*I received my monitor two days ahead of schedule (was shipped by Amazon).<br/>*This monitor is HUGE! and lightweight.<br/>*The quality of this monitor for the price is impossible to beat. What a deal!<br/>*I experienced no GHOSTING.<br/>*I'm using a HDMI cable I got from amazong for like a $1 and I compared the cable with the monster HDMI cable that came with my 60'' hdtv and I saw no difference in graphics (you may check out my review on that cable).<br/>*Some of the PS3 games I played looked outstanding while others did not but this is due to the games themselves and not the monitor.<br/>*If you own a gaming PC you'll enjoy higher graphics than us PS3/XBOX 360 owners.<br/>*My desktop screen looks true 1080p HD on this monitor; 1080p HD videos look great too.<br/>*The STAND that came with it is excellent; it allows to adjust the angle all the way down facing the floor or facing very up. Also, I put the monitor on my bed and I can freely move on my bed and this stand is so good the monitor barely even moves. Now I can play while on my bed and don't have to be careful at all about moving around! Love the stand!<br/>*This product was packed excellently; very secure and professional. I received a brand new product.<br/><br/>*The default display settings were horrible but after messing with it for a couple minutes I got a great display. The preset display called "scenary" was the only and best looking one (the others looked terrible). I did try the settings offered by the top reviewer here but his settings were almost exactly as the preset "scenary."<br/>*The very first time I turned on the monitor, it was set to only work with VGA so I was forced to connect it to a laptop with VGA before I could actually access the monitor's menu and change to HDMI and edit all the other settings.<br/>*The speakers are terrible but this was expected; very low maximum volume too (as expected).<br/><br/>:::GAMES TESTED/PLAYED:::<br/>*Uncharted 1 &amp; 2: this game is extremely famous for its outstanding graphics. I finished the entire game on this monitor. The game looked absolutely outstanding from start to finish! Incredible/perfect graphics. I am now playing Uncharted 2 and the graphics are outstanding.<br/><br/>*Infamous 1: excellent graphics; both cutscenes and gameplay looked true HD. Uncharted takes first place hands down but Infamous is right there with beautiful excellent graphics.<br/><br/>*Sniper Ghost Warrior: this game is known for its no-good graphics. This game did not look good but we know it is the game and not the monitor!<br/><br/>*GTA IV: shockingly this game looked terrible on this monitor. The cutscenes looked outstanding in true HD but strangely while driving vehicles the graphics looked atrocious. I was not happy at all. I don't know what is wrong.<br/><br/>*Crysis 2: this game is very well known for its high-end graphics. The game looked excellent but not as outstanding as Uncharted. But let's not forget that I played the PS3 version - the PS3 console's graphics are limited and are not as high as high-end gaming PCs. Again, Uncharted wins first place hands down but Crysis 2 is right there at the top too.<br/><br/>*Prototype 2: this game was criticized for its not-so-good graphics (e.g. IGN review) and it's true. I played this game on this monitor and although the cutscenes looked true HD the gameplay looked sort-of HD. Again, this is the game's fault and the PS3 console's fault and NOT the monitor's fault. Still I enjoyed and loved the game and it still looked great.<br/><br/>*Modern Warfare 3: I only played a couple minutes of the game on the monitor but the game did not look as Uncharted and Crysis 2 and Infamous. This is probably because I am comparing in my mind every single game with Uncharted. I mean, Uncharted was absolutely incredible, and MW3's graphics could not compare. But I only played a few minutes of MW3 on this monitor so perhaps it is too soon to give a final verdict.<br/><br/>-I need to try Skyrim, Bioshock, God of War III, Dead Space 2, AC: Revelations, and Batman Arkham City, and I'll report how the games look on this monitor, with the PS3 console.<br/><br/>VERDICT: +5 stars. Love this monitor. I highly recommend it. The price + quality combination is unbeatable!<br/><br/>UPDATE 9/17/12<br/><br/>School started for me here in NYC (college senior) and I have NOT been able to play at all! I know I need to test especially Skyrim and Bioshock but I'm busy with school, schoolwork, and the gym (lifting weights 5 days a week). But when I can I'll test the games!<br/><br/>UPDATE 11/3/13:<br/><br/>I have been busy and had not much time to play. I do have all the "top/best" games with me though, but I just have to find the time to play my PS3 games...<br/><br/>I'm still happy with the monitor though. I was able to connect my iPad 4th Generation to this monitor with a cable (blacks ops zombies) and the game looked great. So I am still happy about this.</span>

<span>I got this in early February 2013.<br/><br/>The built in speakers are useless.  In order to hear them in an average room with negligible background noise you need to stand up and put your head over the monitor.  NOT a very practical way to use the monitor.<br/><br/>Please understand I have worked in electronics for over 30 years.  I know audio and I know PC's.  For 10 years I owned a service shop that serviced all kinds of audio equipment from clock radios to high end audio equipment and I worked on my share of them as well.  For the last 20 years I have been building, rebuilding and supporting PC's.<br/><br/>I put it on a brand new Win 7 PC I was setting up.  I was new to the PC, monitor and the OS so originally I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought it must be a setting I had not found.  I thought Asus was a great company and made great products.  I have used their mother boards often and they are always rock solid and highly respected by others as well.  I was too busy to figure out the problem right away and connected some old speakers until I had time.  Of course when I finally decided it was the monitor it was one day past the return window on Amazon.<br/><br/>I contacted tech support through customer service and they were very nice, but in the end insisted it was normal saying it only has 1 Watt of audio for two speakers.  I responded that most cheap clock radios have 1/2 to 1 Watt of audio and one speaker and they produce way more sound.  They added these speakers were not intended for normal use.  That must be about the dumbest comment I have ever heard from any tech support and I see nothing in their specs or ad saying don't expect to actually use the speakers.  I finally gave up for the time being and let them go.<br/><br/>Then I examined why this was happening if it is normal since 1 watt should produce adequate sound levels.  My conclusion was POOR DESIGN.  The speakers are buried in the top of the case with only very small narrow slits for the sound to get out through and they are pointed straight up.  Thus if you position your head directly above the monitor the sound is usable although not loud even at full volume.  Armed with that understanding I figured they had to know this was an issue, because every unit is bad so I called customer service again.<br/><br/>After much discussion with customer service and pointing out my background and what my analysis of the problem revealed they offered to send a replacement.  Given what I had found it seemed useless, but I figured at least it would show I tried and I could confirm it was the design and maybe that would earn me something.  Again very nice and put it through a program where I would return the one I had after receiving the new one.  The new one was indeed exactly the same as the old one, so I just returned it.<br/><br/>I called customer service and told them I wanted an exchange with a different model that actually worked and offered to pay any difference in price.  Again they provided nice but useless help. They directed me where to put in my request via their web site.  Apparently it was the electronic equivalent of the trash can.  I got an acknowledgement they received the request and never heard from them again even though I inquired two or three times over the next three months.<br/><br/>The audio is not the only poor design on this product.  The controls including the on/off button are all on the bottom.  This makes even the lighted on/off button difficult to find.  The other controls are VERY frustrating to use.  They are totally hidden in any half way normal viewing position and you are supposed to know which control is for what by the markings on the front surface.  Unfortunately the labels show up much better in the picture on Amazon than they do on the real product.  If you look closely at that picture you will understand how that is the case.  The controls on the bottom are visible and that is only possible from a point directly in front of and below the level of those control labels.  From that angle they show up better and with bright lighting to take a good picture they hide the issue.  The labels are a light washed out silver against the black background and seem to be getting lighter as the months go by.  Unless I shine a fairly bright light directly on the face of the monitor they are unreadable.  So unless you plan to use it in a brightly lit lab or picture taking environment be prepared to have a flashlight in one hand while you make adjustments with the other hand.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about this monitor is the display works fine.  They seem to have gotten that right and I gave it 3 stars because of that.<br/><br/>I will NEVER buy another Asus monitor.</span>

<span>I am not a gamer, nor do I do any serious video work, so I am not in a position to review this in terms of what many may find most important. Indeed, my vision is far from perfect and I suffer a form of color blindness. So if you want a review of the finer visual qualities look elsewhere. All I can usefully say about its visual quality is that it works great for my needs, with clear, sharp, bright display. So I will instead talk about features that matter to me.<br/><br/>A great stand with easy setup<br/><br/>Typically, when I get a new monitor, I have to fiddle with assembling the stand and attaching the monitor to it. An unpleasant chore that delays me actually getting to use the thing. And after working with the typical stand for a few days, I find myself ordering a separate monitor desk mount (which in turn needs to be assembled.)<br/><br/>But the ASUS VA24DQSB stand was the easiest out of the box setup cabling that I have ever had. By far. Furthermore, the stand actually has the tilt and rotation flexibility and solidity that I need. This saves me having to get a separate monitor mount, and I really had this thing usable within a couple of minutes of opening the box.<br/><br/>The cable management guides on the stand are also correctly less ambitious than others I've seen. Instead of attempting to completely conceal cables at the expensive of complicated setup and difficulty in changing things around, it takes a very simple and straight forward approach.<br/><br/>The only downside I can foresee of having this stand is that heavier than what is typical. That might be an issue for shipping or moving it about, but if so that would be a minor one. It is only an issue if you plan to mount the monitor and so the benefits of the stand would be wasted on you.<br/><br/>Connectivity saves on cables and adapters<br/><br/>DisplayPort, HDMI (and VGA) mean that I unless I were in a DVI world, I don't have to worry about adapters, making cabling easier and means that I can use it easily on a broad range of devices now and in the future. I happen to be using it via HDMI from a Mac mini, but it is not wedded to that host.<br/><br/>The USB hub give me 2 USB 3 type A ports in a convenient location. Again, making cabling easier.<br/><br/>I realize that the features which most immediately appeal to me after having this for less than a week may not be what matter to others, but I do hope that this is useful for some.</span>

<span>This is a great monitor to have while traveling.

<span>I purchased this to replace an MBAC16 USB screen that did not work with my Raspberry Pi 4.  This AOC 16T2, using the power adapter and the micro-HDMI output, works well with my Raspberry Pi 4 (without touch capability).  I also tried the AOC 16T2  with an Acer windows laptop that had a USB C output: screen and touch input worked with Windows 10.  The cover doubles as a stand and works well for both purposes.<br/><br/>The controls and connections could be better:<br/>-There are 2 USB Cs on the T2.  The one on the left is to charge or power the T2.  The one on the right is for connecting to a device as a second display.<br/>-The control buttons on the left of the screen are 'single tap'.  I do not see an 'up/down' option for the menus or choices like on other screens.  Rather there is a single button that brings up the menu, and then, you press the same button until you are on an item to change like contrast, wait a few moments for it to be selected, and then press again to increase the selection until it starts over at 0 or reaches the level you want.<br/><br/>Having said that, this has the features I wanted at a reasonable price (*I bought it used via Amazon).</span>

<span>Owned a 24 inch ViewSonic monitor for 10 years with never a problem.  I picked this up on cyber Monday just for the larger screen and felt bad sending my 24 inch to storage because there's nothing wrong with it to this day.  Never heard of ViewSonic in 2011 when I bought that 24 inch which was for my only computer build and held through my next 2 pc's.  I'd never buy another brand based on the success I've had with this brand.  This monitor is larger and I'm just as happy so far as my first ViewSonic monitor.  I can't speak to audio quality, I use separate speakers.  I'm not a details expert so the settings out of the box work for me.  I can say with 2 ViewSonics from 2011 to present day I've never had dead pixels.  Picture is sharp and perfect for the gaming and browsing I do.  I feel for those that have had negative issues but I can only fully recommend this monitor based on my 12 years of ViewSonic ownership.</span>

<span>The 4K quality is fantastic, and a huge step up from 1080p. The built in speakers are adequate, though I’m sure it’s no surprise that they’re bad in comparison to dedicated ones. The 90W usb c connection is the best part of this by far. One cable to power your device and transmit video is incredibly convenient, though not functional for gaming (obviously).</span>

<span>As many other reviewers have rightly mentioned, this display is shipped in a way where it appears EXTREMELY dim (my second monitor at 50% was brighter than the Samsung S80A monitor). There is a setting causing this. To adjust this setting, press the middle button on the bottom to bring up the grid of icons. Press up once and press the center button again to go into the display settings. Scroll down to "system" and once again click the middle button. Scroll all the way to the bottom and disable "Eco Sensor Mode". I imagine for most people this will fix the issue. Brightness can also be adjusted in "Menu" under "Picture Settings".<br/><br/>Display is otherwise great. Clarity is good, although the coloring is clearly extremely over-saturated (I'd say likely not a good photo/video color correction monitor).</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these at $299 each on prime day.  As I don't play games on PC, these 2 are just for my office use.  They serve that purpose good enough.  An entry level 4k@60hz, nothing else fancy.  Just be careful about a few things: 1) This monitor has the following input: 1 USB type C,1 DP, 1 HDMI, and 3 USB type A as output.  So type C is the only data input.  You cannot use a type A to type B cable for this as there's no port for type B. 2) One of the monitors is making high-pitching noise when connected via usb type C or DP.  What's more weird is this only happens when I connect my laptop to both monitors.  If I only connect type C or DP on one monitor no noise at all.  I have 2 different types of docks, 2 laptops, all kinds of DP and mini DP to DP cables, so after trying 2 dozens of the laptop-cable-dock combinations, I am sure the monitor is the cause of the noise issue.  As you may never experience this, this is just FYI.</span>

<span>I have an old iMac (2012) and a new Macbook Air.  When I use this with the iMac, the resolution maxes at 1080p, which means every app is HUGE on the big screen. With the Air, I can raise the resolution and it's fine.<br/><br/>Also, I saw a review that said it's not bright enough and doesn't look as good as an Apple screen.  If you play around with the color profiles in your display settings to match that used by your machine, that shouldn't be a problem. It doesn't default to that, so you have to set it up manually. But after that, it's perfectly fine. And it costs about 1/10th what the new Apple display does.  I'm sure the Apple display is nicer, but someone else will have to enjoy spending over three grand for that.</span>

<span>This is another solid budget monitor that’s OK for everyday use when doing nothing more than looking at spreadsheets, word documents, and browsing the internet.  One caveat I would like to point out upfront is:  although the spec sheet claims that this monitor only has a 72% sRGB coverage (keep in mind that the sRGB color gamut is the absolute minimum color reproduction standard with Adobe RGB being the second best and NTSC being the highest), I do believe that this is an egregious typo due to the fact that the LG LM238WF2-SSA1 display panel in this monitor actually has a stated 72% NTSC coverage according to the manufacturer’s spec sheet.  Furthermore, if you look at other monitors that are also sporting this exact same panel (such as the BenQ GW2480, LG 22MK430H, and Acer HA220Q) you’ll find that they all have the color gamut listed at 72% NTSC.  A 72% NTSC is an industry standard for entry level monitors so that would imply that the HP VH240a should actually have closer to 100% sRGB coverage.  And lastly, a 72% sRGB would mean that all of the colors would appear to be very washed out, but that is not the case with this monitor since vibrancy appears to be fairly normal in my unit (albeit not spectacular).<br/><br/>With that caveat out of the way, here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past two weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The ‘Sharpness’ Image Control setting offers 7 preset adjustments available so you can tweak the clarity to your liking.<br/><br/>- The overall white color temperature can be adjusted to be cooler or warmer when tweaking the color settings.<br/><br/>- The bezels are really thin (about 5 mm) which does its frameless design justice!<br/><br/>- The adjustable ergonomic stand allows you to pivot the screen 90° (to the right) so you can use the screen vertically in portrait mode.  This was the #1 reason I decided to buy this monitor.<br/><br/>- The power button is completely distinguishable from the rest of the menu control buttons (it has a different shape and is spaced further apart from the other buttons).<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- the colors are OK in my particular unit but they don’t pop nearly as much as similarly priced monitors (the cheaper Acer SB220Q bi outperforms it in this regard).  The red tones seem to have a slightly higher bias over the rest of the color range making them appear a little more vibrant while the other colors are more neutral.<br/><br/>- Although you can tweak the RGB color balance, this monitor’s built-in settings do not let you make further adjustments to things like saturation, hue, bias, blacks, gamma, or even YMC balance levels.<br/><br/>The black levels are nothing to write home about.  Although my unit didn't have much light bleeding, it still struggled to keep blacks dark when anything slightly brighter was on the screen despite adjustments.<br/><br/>- Although its spec sheet claims to have a 250 nits max brightness, the one I got seems to be noticeably darker than my other 250 nit monitors at 100% even with the contrast level also being maxed out at 100%.<br/><br/>- Noticeable ghosting (motion blur) when scrolling through webpages<br/><br/>- Overall image quality is subpar compared similarly priced and some cheaper monitors (I would highly recommend the ViewSonic VS2412-H as a much better alternative in this regard if you really need a stand that pivots)<br/><br/>- The 90° pivot can only be turned to the right side, putting the bottom bezel of the monitor between your main display when this monitor is on the right side of it.<br/><br/>- You can adjust the monitor up and down, tilt it back by 30°, and pivot it by 90° (to the right), but you can’t swivel it left or right without turning the entire base of the stand.<br/><br/>- Does not have any FreeSync (AMD) or G-Sync (Nvidia) support.  This causes lower resolution graphics and images to have noticeable jagged sharpening and screen tearing effects.<br/><br/>The HP VH240a is ok for daily use if you just need something cheap to do some web browsing, view word documents, and other non-graphics intensive tasks on.  For my particular uses, since I only bought this monitor to use vertically to view documents and social media pages and do some light coding on, it is good enough to get the job done in that regard.  I would not recommend this monitor for casual gaming, watching movies, or doing any kind of image editing since the experience would be subpar and the color reproduction would be inadequate for any professional use.  The main advantage of buying this monitor over comparably priced monitors is for the adjustable stand (although the ViewSonic VS2412-H is a much better direct alternative, in my opinion).  If you don’t need the vertical pivot then there are better monitors in this price range that deliver a more impressive image quality (another recommendation would be the Philips 246E9QDSB  which delivers a far superior image and color reproduction).</span>

<span>This laptop sits at just over 4 stars while some of the other similarly priced and comparable monitors from Spectre, Lenovo, and other brands hover around 4.5 stars. This gave me pause, but after looking through many of the 1-3 star reviews it was clear that the majority had harshly penalized the monitor due to its reportedly lackluster audio performance. My laptop has surprisingly decent sound so I could essentially care less about the monitor's speakers. Now if my laptop didn't sound good then I would have simply connected my laptop to my Bluetooth speaker, my old PC speakers, my blue tooth headphones, or hell even my surround sound if I felt so inclined. Those reviews are overly demanding imo.<br/><br/>First Impression: Time spent from opening the box to having the monitor up and running was under 5 minutes. Well designed packaging and easy to put together - no screwdriver required. Came with both a HDMI and an Aux cord... ok cool I appreciate that but whatever. First glance of the monitor on my 38" x 24" desk and I'm satisfied with its footprint. The screen bezels are tiny which looks good and helps manage size. Another plus is how the base extends behind the screen as opposed to extruding in front which would take up valuable real estate in front of the monitor. The monitor and my laptop share the desk very well, and there is even generous room for an open notebook directly in front of the monitor. I'm glad that I went with a 23.8" monitor over something like a 20-22" as that last 1-3 inches makes a noticeable difference in screen size. The design and style of the product is very sleek and it looks great on my desk. It definitely doesn't advertise its modest price tag with its expensive and luxury appearance.<br/><br/>Early performance: When I connected my laptop (a lightly upgraded Lenovo T440P Thinkpad, maybe a $400 laptop) via HDMI to the monitor I was  met with a large snowy-owl staring at me (one of the photos that Windows cycles through before/during log-in). The picture was bright, edges were sharp, and the snow-white feathers of the owl looked like a true pure white. The contrast between the white of the owl, its dark eyes and the brown of the tree was great and everything looked realistic and accurate. After logging in I went into the Windows display settings and made a few simple adjustments on how I wanted the laptop to display to the monitor, it was very easy and intuitive to do.<br/><br/>First thing I did was browse some HD Youtube videos (a Lord of the Rings fight scene, and Planet Earth) and I was immediately impressed. The screen kept up with the intense action/pace of the LotR fight without any lagging frames or stuttering. Planet Earth's tropical videos looked bright and accurately colorful while the following cave video was properly dark and intense with moments of brightness. Here the speed of some of the small critters gave the monitor a little bit of blurring, especially when the color of the animal was similar to the color of the background. I then switched over to Netflix, browsed a bit, and decided on Planet Earth again since the show has so many amazing spectacles to view. Everything looked just as great and in some cases even a little bit better. The speed of the animals didn't seem to blur as with youtube (note: I didn't watch the exact same video so this is highly anecdotal.) When it came to reading text and more general browsing of the web I was pleased. Letters had sharp corners, and the additional amount of text that fits on the screen vs my 14" laptop made for less scrolling.<br/><br/>Happy with the video playback I rotated the monitor (set monitor to top height, grasp edges of screen, and twist it to the right) to portrait. The rotation felt smooth and solid. Boy does it make for a long screen, but I'm confident I will use it when working with long lists of data, programming, using Excel, etc. I am glad I will have the option.<br/><br/>Weaknesses: As mentioned before the sound is definitely weak. The volume is low, audio sounds pretty "shallow", and there just isn't much to report there. In my mostly quiet apartment I could hear and understand the audio from the monitor, but it admittedly wasn't long before I reverted back to my laptop sound. Nonetheless having an at least usable audio option as a back-up is better than nothing. I will generally award more points to any item that exceeds the expectations of its main function than I will penalize a product for including an average to below-average "extra" that is not vital to performance. If my computer chair gave me a back massage I would be very pleasantly surprised, but if it had a lumpy seat, didn't spin smoothly, and was stuck at a certain height I wouldn't be so pleased. I'll choose the chair that I can be comfortable in for hours, spins effortlessly and noiselessly, and adjusts height easily.<br/><br/>I can't speak to using the monitor for gaming and whether it can handle that demand as I don't have the gaming tech knowledge, the gaming experience, or even a game to test it with.<br/><br/>Final Pros: Sleek aesthetic/design, stand rotates landscape-to-portrait, tiny bezels, good brightness, dark blacks, efficient footprint, simple and<br/>  smooth tilt/height adjustments<br/><br/>Final Cons: Weak speakers, minor blurring at times of very fast moving video.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it!</span>

<span>Overall, this is a great monitor for picture clarity and color.  Specifically, this is a great monitor to use with a Mac Mini Intel that is having issues with the HDMI connection. The problem with the Mini coming out of sleep mode and then displaying a screen with snow while using the HDMI port is fixed with this monitor using the USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 connection.  Just be sure the USB-C cable you use supports video - the Cable Matters USB-C to USB-C cable (from Amazon) I chose works fine.<br/>The only misleading thing I found in the listing is the monitor does not have internal speakers - it has a mini phone jack where you can plug in headphones but no actual speakers.</span>

<span>As a software engineer with a personal and work computer, this monitor is a programmer's dream. I now have the flexibility to easily switch between inputs and PBP configurations (half of my display for personal and the other half for work).<br/><br/>In Visual Studio Enterprise and Code, I can see more code than I have ever been able to before with a single monitor.<br/><br/>If you like social media, it's also great to see a long feed without having to endlessly scroll.<br/><br/>This monitor is fantastic for personal and remote work.<br/><br/>I highly encourage anyone in IT to invest in this monitor. Based on my research, there are not many other options currently available that come close in comparison.</span>

<span>This resets the mind in how a monitor is useful!<br/><br/>I've have a 34" ultra wide for my 'wide' work, excel, etc.<br/><br/>This has became my primary monitor as most other things I'm doing is much more vertical.<br/><br/>Coding, researching, database work, etc.<br/><br/>Watching videos where I can have it above or below my work is also great.<br/><br/>As soon as I set it up, I started imagining buying a second DualUp monitor.  Ergonomically, I'm not sure how I can set ip a second DualUp to work with my first and my ultrawide, and I'm not looking to replace the ultrawide.<br/><br/>But the DualUp changes the thinking in the ergonomics of monitors and how they fit in with your work or play on your system.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!!</span>
