                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I like the smaller size of the Charge, which is why I chose it over the versa or sense. I like the app and the versatility of the watch. Things I don't like are the accuracy of the steps. If I'm carrying something (which is most of the time as a farm wife, stay at home, and work at home mom) it doesn't count my steps. The sleep tracking isn't accurate as it says I'm sleeping when I'm reading or watching TV. And the black band is definitely cheap looking. Wish I would've gotten white, but I hesitated because I wasn't sure if it would stay clean. If I had to purchase again, I would've gone with the versa, as my sister doesn't have the same complaints as me. Overall, it does the job--making myself accountable for activity. But I wish it had more accuracy for my day to day.</span>

<span>I will update my review as I've had more time to use it, but here are my initial thoughts after about one week of use. And please keep in mind that I'm finally upgrading from my 1st Gen FitBit Surge, and the primary purpose for me having an exercise tracker is for running.<br/><br/>Aesthetic: 5/5<br/>It has a nice low-profile design. I got the off-white gray-ish color because it's a little more feminine looking in my opinion.<br/><br/>Weight/Size: 5/5<br/>Very lightweight. Of course the slim profile makes it fairly easy to wear long sleeves or a coat. I don't need a huge screen, so this model works well for me size-wise.<br/><br/>Battery Life: 5/5<br/>I read where another user vouched for the week-long battery life, and while I haven't really put that to the test yet, I found that after three days of not being on the charging device, it was still going strong.<br/><br/>Watchband: 5/5<br/>I like that they include both the small and large watchbands in the box. That's one less accessory you'd have to purchase separate. If you're used to wearing an Apple Watch or something with a silicone band, then you'll be fine with this one. I can't stand having ANYTHING on my wrists, even nice jewelry, so it's definitely not something I wear unless I'm using the device for a specific purpose.<br/><br/>Display: 5/5<br/>Nice display. Not much else to say about that.<br/><br/>Functionality: Hard to say at this point how I would rate the overall functionality since many of the features are completely extraneous to me. I'm a runner, so I really just bought this for tracking my distance and occasionally checking in to see what kind of times I'm running. Here is my breakdown on functionality:<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Touch Screen: 3/5<br/>Not impressed with the touch screen. It's very finicky for me, and I thought that would improve when I took the screen cover off (BTW the screen cover was an item I purchased separately), but that has not really been the case. This is especially irritating when I'm running and need to be able to easily start and stop the clock.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;GPS: I have noticed that my FitBit Surge was telling me that the loop that I run around my neighborhood is right at 2 miles. However, the Charge 5 is telling me that my loop is actually closer to 2.25 miles. I'm inclined to believe the results of the more recent model since the technology has had like eight years to advance between the two devices. I did notice that it had trouble connecting to GPS one day, but it was also overcast. Would that have affected the connection?<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Run Feature: I like that it doesn't take long to sync up to satellites. My only real issue so far with this device's run feature is that the touch screen is difficult to use sometimes, especially when running. Let's be honest, when I'm done with my run, I want to just be able to hit Stop and see my stats. Instead, I have to tap the screen and swish and swipe a few times until I get a screen with a Pause button. I really do miss having the external buttons for Start/Stop/Pause/Finish. That was a nice feature to have because I could get more accurate stats with zero frustration.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Heart Tracker: I have yet to find a fitness tracker that can actually detect my subhuman heartbeat. It's like I put the device on, even if I have it on tight, and it thinks I'm dead. Granted, my resting heart rate is in the 30s, so when it gets UP to 40, it alerts me that my heart rate is too low. I don't necessarily fault the device for that though. I think maybe the technology just isn't quite there yet for heart rates below 40 or 50.  But I will say that it does show me my average heart rate when I finish a run.<br/><br/>I will update my review as I've had more time to use this device. Giving it some more time before I decide to scrap it and upgrade.  I'd love it if someone could tell me how to actually Stop the clock at the end of a run.</span>

<span>My first FitBit lasted for about 14 months.  The display quit working but the watch was working because I could see it on my dashboard.  I finally went ahead and ordered a FitBit 5.  I worked very well for about 10 1/2 months and then it just quit working.  I tried all the recommended solutions but nothing worked.  I finally contacted customer service on line.  They were extremely helpful.  I told them the date that I had purchased my FitBit through Amazon.  They were able to confirm that and gave me the choice of my FitBit 5 being replaced or 50% off on a new one.  I chose the replacement and about a week and a half later I received the replacement.  So many people conplained about customer service that I thought I should let people know about my experience with them.  I must say that I was dissapointed that the original watch didn't last longer.  For the price it should work for longer then 10 1/2 months.</span>

<span>The band easily holds power for 5 days on a full charge. And it has a lot of features (probably more than necessary for the average user, IMHO).<br/><br/>My biggest complaint however, is that the FitBit App information on my Android Galaxy S10 screen runs off "the page", and resizing the font app to a smaller view simultaneously affects the font size of all other apps like Messages and E-Mails. Not sure if there is a workaround, but doubtful that Fitbit can make their app function independently from the Android phone settings.<br/><br/>Also and it may just be user error, but I've trained every day (5) this week, yet the app only tracked 3 days.<br/><br/>Additionally (and this is probably true of most fitness trackers) is that for the fitness/calorie tracking, I'm not really sure just how accurate it is. Seems to be somewhat random. Most days before my feet even hit the floor, the app shows me having walked over 200 steps.<br/><br/>I guess I must be walking in my sleep;-)<br/><br/>The calorie tracker is really good, though I'm not sure how many people continue using it once the chore/novelty of the feature wears off. You have to be very disciplined. Since I don't consume a lot of daily calories in general, I now only use it to track  my water intake.<br/><br/>I'll update my review once I've used the band for a few weeks and have had a chance to work out the kinks...</span>

<span>****UPDATED REVIEW****<br/><br/>So I am about a week or so from the last review.<br/><br/>ONE cool thing I will note is that (at least on iPhone) there are widgets you can place on your phone screentop.<br/><br/>I left off the last review on 1/27 with 57% battery, recently charge on 1/25.<br/>Battery died on 1/29, I charged it on 1/30. Wore my iWatch on 1/30 and 1/31.<br/>Put the Amazefit Band on 2/1.  It's 2/3 (8am) I am at 51%.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned previously aside from the original charge, I've had to sync up with the app every time for all the feature to work/work properly.  This is highly annoying.<br/><br/>The last 2 charging times, the band is not syncing or remaining synced.<br/>For example it's telling me it's 60/64 degree's and sunny, sorry its 43 degree's (65/40) and raining.<br/>Or it's told me I haven't walked at all - literally 0 (ZERO) steps today - I've been up wrangling kids for the bus since 5am.  Three hours I haven't taken a single step?  When did I learn to fly?  My iPhone pedometer which hasn't even been on my person the whole time, has registered 218 steps.<br/><br/>I have to open the app and swipe the sync for it to sync, it doesn't automatically do it.<br/><br/>It's literally just NOT functioning in the basic capacity.<br/><br/>And I'm about 3 days out of the return window.....of course.<br/><br/>Guess my kids just got a new toy.<br/><br/>Back to the have to charge every night iWatch.  At least I can answer calls on it, and it has a calculator and memo recorder.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Has everything you want, maybe more so.  Lacks accuracy.<br/><br/>(Review is in compared to an iWatch.)<br/><br/>The main reason I wanted a watch/band is: a watch, a pedometer, a rudimentary fitness tracker (including walking, treadmill, cardio and swimming), a sleep tracker (including duration, REM, # of times awaken during the night, and quality) &amp; continuous heart rate monitor.  The stress monitor would be a plus, but only useful if the information is recorded.  And of course - and LONG battery life.<br/><br/>Compared to the iWatch/iPhone technology, the AmazeFit Band 5 is<br/><br/>Watch - Hello it's a watch - they both probably pull time from the NIST.<br/><br/>Pedometer - Well not only did I measure the iWatch, the AmazeFit Band 5, the Xaomi Mi Band 6, the Garmin VivoActive 4S, and my Treadmill (ReeBok GT40x).  I reviewed both steps and mileage.  They were all wildly different.  I ultimately chose the AmazeFit because it was the closest to meeting the treadmills numbers.<br/>However, after about 4 weeks, this band has become quite different than the treadmill.  Almost 1/2mile to 3/4mile off from the treadmill.  After each workout the band does let me calibrate the workout, and some times I can "match" it up to the mileage I did on the treadmill - but oftentimes I cannot match the total workout, which for me is very annoying.  I didn't do all of that for nothing.<br/>* I am unaware of whether that only affects my "workout" mileage, or if it affects my daily step total also.  I have not been able to see a correlation to daily steps - since that continues on through the day after my workout.  (And the treadmill doesn't tell me steps, of course)<br/>** One other thing to note about the pedometer while in "workout" mode that really bothers me is that, if I am not CONTINUOUSLY swinging my arm it will go in to "PAUSE" mode and stop registering my movement.  And I DO MEAN CONTINUOUSLY.  Like if I literally just not swing my arm or if I take a sip of water or brush my hair out of my face I have use the hand that doesn't have the band or it will "PAUSE".  That is very annoying.<br/>*** I have not had a chance to use it in the pool yet, so I cannot attest to its stroke counting or water durability.<br/><br/>Rudimentary Fitness Tracker - I personally do not enjoy the presentation of the information in the APP.<br/>(I do not particularly enjoy it in iHealth either)<br/><br/>Sleep Tracker - Again, the presentation in the APP is not ideal.  I understand there are a lot of tid-bits presented.  However, if you don't look at it each day, you are unable to view some pieces of information, such as REM, Times awake, Amount of Deep Sleep or Light Sleep.  You can see they are there - just not the individual data.  Which makes it redundant.  When you select the date it only tells you the total amount of sleep for that day.<br/><br/>Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring - As similar with other reports - if you don't check it that day and get whatever information you need, you wont be able to access.  For today only, you can see what time your heart rate was at "xyz," - but yesterday or any day prior you will only see the lowest and highest readings, with no timestamps.  There are no alerts for spikes or dips either.<br/><br/>Stress Monitor - I can manually run it on my band, but the APP doesn't recognize it.  The last registered reading was 1/1/22.<br/><br/>Battery Life - Finally the MAIN Reason I chose this, and did not continue on with my old iWatch.  In late December it had a 15 day battery life.<br/>* You have to reconnect with the APP after each charge or some functions will not work, or sync back to the APP.<br/>My iWatch had buckled down to about 18hours of battery charge, which was useless to me and with it's pedometer seemingly unfixable with every re-calibration trick tried, I was ready to move on.  This was approximately $40, it had a "15day" battery life, it was the closest pedometer accuracy I could find and the app wasn't terrible.  As of late January, 4 weeks later - I have had to charge this band 3 times.<br/>Charged when received 12/28<br/>wore AmazeFit Band 12/29 - 1/13, (14 days)<br/>charged 1/14, wore the iWatch.<br/>wore AmazeFit Band 1/15-1/24,  (10 days)<br/>charged 1/25, wore the iWatch.<br/>1/26-  (2 days and at 57% currently).<br/>* It does NOT take all day to charge, I just did not want to interrupt my step count once the day started by change watches midday.<br/>** I do not know, nor assume that it is a trend, that the battery life will continue to drop.  It's only been 2 charges post full usage, so a lot of factors go in to that.  I let the battery drain completely down, because I understand that it the best way to preserve the battery.  If this is a significant trend I will update.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>As most people say - it's a good watch for $40.  Don't expect an iWatch or a Garmin.  Don't ever expect to compare a $40 item to a $300 item.  That said if you're frustrated with the APP or interfaces of iPhone or Garmin or Samsung and want something more straight forward this could work.  Or if your resigned to not be fully on board with anything/everything, then you'll be happier to pay less at less for a fully functional (in the overall sense) product such as this than paying gobbloads for Apple, Garmin, Samsung, etc.  I will say this - I do like the construction of this product.  I don't feel like I need to buy a protective layer for it or worry about my clumsiness.  It's hearty and fits well on my wrist without being too bulky.</span>

<span>It tells time. It reminds me to take my meds every four hours. The battery recharge time is very good, 5-7 days, and I’ve had it for a year now.  It is inexpensive and just as good as my old Fitbit costing 5 times more.  I’m not particularly fond of watches that don’t allow battery replacement.  As a throw away, this works. What I don’t like:  it falls off randomly as I do yard work. Got a band with a clasp, $6, fixed.  The clock face changes randomly too.  I’m visually impaired and need a big face with high contrast, not really offered, but some are good enough.  I “lock” the watch but the face still goes off track about once a month. Back to the app to reload one I can see.  App is a bit quirky and just won’t connect sometimes.  Cant see it in bright sun but had the same problem with the Fitbit.  All in all, I’d buy it again. Good enough and very competitive pricing.</span>

<span>1: First impression: Hard to open. The packaging did not indicate how you’re meant to actually open it. There’s a little grey tab (unmarked) on the side of the box you’re meant to pull so that it tears the box open for you. Took me way too long to figure it out.<br/>2: The instruction booklet is practically useless. I read it but it didn’t really help me learn to use the watch.<br/>3: The watch itself is not accessible for people with bad vision, lacking fine motor skills, or who are technologically inept (like me). Overall, I would not recommend this product for the elderly. The screen is very small. It is a touchscreen face but  again very small with means any and all text on it will also be very small. To turn it on there is a small grey oval on one end of the watch face. That’s the ‘Home’ button and it turns the watch on and returns the user to the main screen. You can swipe up or down to view the other features and you can tap to go further in depth with each feature.<br/>4: The strap is hard to put on snugly. I primarily use this to measure my heart rate so for me purposes I need it to lay flat against my wrist which I can do because my hands are affected by anything like arthritis or shaking.<br/>5: Accuracy wise I can only speak for the heart rate measurement feature (again as that the main reason I’m using it) and when comparing it to a metronome at the same bpm it reads at, it matches. I am confident in its accuracy. However, having said that, it is NOT a constant monitor. In the app settings you can adjust how frequently the watch measures your heart rate and the most frequent setting is every minute. Next intervals are every five minutes and every ten minutes.<br/>6: the app is very customizable but can be confusing because there are so many options but I like that it allows the user to hide features they won’t use so there’s less clutter.<br/>7: the battery lasts for a while and after a full day I’ve seen it drain about 10% ish so I’d assume it’s meant to last a week before needing a recharge.<br/><br/>I’m satisfied with it as a whole and it works for me and my purposes but I don’t think this is the best fit for everyone. It’s quality for the price and I’m happy with it.</span>

<span>I read about how people are stealing and selling your personal health information now and using it to track you and I have been hacked too many times to count so I am very much against anything that tracks me. But I read that there was a private act that worked with this watch called gadget bridge. So I quickly bought it. I am very unhappy. Gadget bridge is only made for people who have degrees in coding apparently. All I needed to set up the final pairing was some sort of authentication code. Trying to find out how to get this or how to get to work was next to impossible I tried numerous times. I read informational articles on it. I asked the community forum, no answer. No customer service from gadget bridge. The watch only tells you to use their app which is not private at all. I would like a watch that was rechargeable slim and showed me the time when I wanted to sneak a peek. No you cannot sneak a peek with this watch. It is hard to get the face to come up. It will however if you sit for a while measure your heart beat when you ask it to and remind you if you've been sitting for an hour which is somewhat healthy. It gives a random idea of the steps and activity you have had during the day although it is not exact. I really just wanted a rechargeable sturdy watch that didn't look too bad on my wrist. If only I could see the time when I wanted to!</span>

<span>I was seeking a smart watch with no home assistant for my Android phone. Problem was many were pretty expensive. After searching and searching, found this one. I've been using it daily for three months and it's been a worthy purchase.<br/>It usually lasts about five days on one charge, has many watch face options to show you whatever information you want to see at a glance and helps me with work where I need to receive updates constantly through my phone. It does have some faults. Sometimes your messages won't clear no matter what you try, even if you cleared it on your phone. Caller ID doesn't work and always says "Unknown" when I receive calls. The weather app doesn't always work, which is personally frustrating since I primarily work outside. Lastly, the music control app needs some work. I have mine connected to my Spotify and use Bluetooth earbuds. The problem is you have to connect your Bluetooth headphones to the watch to use the music controls. The watch can't find my earbuds, so it's unfortunately useless to me.<br/>Overall, it's a great watch! I absolutely love it, I wear it all the time to the point of it affecting my tanline, it's comfortable enough to sleep with on and have no regrets purchasing it. Highly recommend!</span>

<span>The watch itself feels solid and isn't too bulky. It's about the size of what I expect from typical men's watches and isn't heavy on the wrist. The AMOLED display is amply bright enough in outside conditions. I have no trouble reading it and the colors are vivid. I can appreciate the watch band it came with. It has a lot of slots and would fit a wide range of wrist sizes.  Being able to switch the band out with any other 20mm quick release band is a plus as well.<br/><br/>The software story is mostly good. I have not used the Connect IQ app (the 'app store' for the watch) enough to speak to the quality of the apps on there, but the Garmin-authored and included widgets have been working as expected. It is a bit of a hassle to have to swipe through each widget to get to the desired one, though (you have to swipe up or down through the different widgets to navigate). Some widgets (and watch faces) have some consistent lag (maybe ~.5 second) before they actually render, which can be mildly annoying. I've only had this rendering lag issue with the hydration tracking widget and a watch face I downloaded from the Connect IQ store. I don't have this issue with other included widgets.<br/><br/>Notifications with my Android phone work well. It is possible to choose which apps send notifications to the watch. You can quick-respond to text messages and calls. My 2FA app also works with it; I can approve or deny from the watch without touching my phone. The vibration from the watch is configurable, but works well enough for me on the lightest setting and I don't have any trouble with missing notifications.<br/><br/>The basic sensors get things right (heart rate, steps, GPS, etc.), but the more derivative stats (like sleep, stress, 'body battery') look to be hit or miss (seems to be a miss for me). Heart rate and steps closely match what my FitBit gives me and the Venu seems to more reliably keep my heart rate stat available during exercise than my FitBit, which I usually have to adjust. GPS picks up quickly; usually in 15 seconds or less. I think the longest it has taken was about 30 seconds before it was ready. The maps I get after my runs are spot-on.<br/><br/>The companion app seems to be quite the Swiss army knife. It does a lot and can show a lot of information and can take some getting used to (I'm coming from the FitBit app's simpler user experience); it took me a few days to remember where all the settings and features were. While it's not frustrating to use, it could use some UX polish.<br/><br/>The original asking price was $400 at the time of my purchase, which was a bit steep, as others have stated. At lower prices, it's more worth it.<br/><br/>My issues with the watch are mostly based in software, and, as such, could probably be fixed in future updates. I won't hold my breath for it, though. Despite the cons I covered, I'm happy with it; it's easier to recall frustrations than to praise the things that have been done right because they just work and I forget to call them out.<br/><br/>Oh. I can also confirm that it tells time (clock, stopwatch, timer, alarm) to a decent degree of accuracy.<br/><br/>Update: I have since returned the watch for a single big reason. I rely on Android's Do Not Disturb mode frequently (it's my must-have feature these days). While the watch does have a DND mode, it works separately from the one present on my phone. If I turn on DND on my phone, it did not turn it on for the watch. I would still get notifications through on my watch, which is a huge let-down. Having to toggle DND on and off in two places is a no-go, especially when my phone has a convenient flip-to-shhh feature and my FitBit supports this perfectly. I would have otherwise been happy with this device that I now feel is more of a premium fitness tracker with some smart features added.</span>

<span>UPDATED REVIEW (after 1 month of use):<br/><br/>I received the watch on 12/16/19.  As of today, 2/5/20, I still love this watch.  It's exactly what I was hoping for; no disappointment or regrets.<br/><br/>Great Battery Life:<br/>--- Depending on how you use the watch, you can get a week's worth of use out of it before charging.<br/>--- I used to wear the watch every night to capture sleep data, but I have a pretty consistent pattern of sleep.  So after a couple weeks, I actually started turning the watch off at night while I'm sleeping to conserve battery life.<br/>--- I only use the heart rate monitor right before, during, and right after workouts.  Otherwise, I keep it off.<br/>--- If you play music straight from your watch, it drains the battery fairly quickly.  As an example, during a 45 min run outside, I had GPS on, heart rate on, and I was playing music straight from the watch.  Within that 45 min span, my battery dropped by 12%.  If I just use GPS and heart rate, the battery might only drop by about 3% during that same 45 min span.  So, if I run inside on a treadmill, I'll just play music from my phone via bluetooth.  If I run outside, I'll leave my phone at home and will use the music I downloaded to the watch.<br/>--- You can decide which notifications you want to appear.  I only turned on the notifications that I deem important (i.e. Text Messages, phone calls) and kept the rest turned off.  I'm using this watch to track my fitness, not to keep updated about Facebook or anything of that nature.<br/>--- Keep in mind that everyone's experience will be different.  I can regulary get 5 - 7 days of battery life, but someone else may only get 1 or 2 days.  It's all about how you use the watch.<br/><br/>Fitness Tracking/Virtual Coach/Garmin Dashboard:<br/>--- The Garmin Dashboard (app) is pretty sleek and it's easy to see your workout data and steps.<br/>--- I don't know any other Garmin users, but the Garmin Dashboard has a weekly step challenge that puts you in a group with other Garmin users based on your level of activity.  I started at the 30k steps per week challenge group and am now in the 70k steps per week challenge group.  It's nice having a little friendly competition with people I don't know.<br/>--- I just got started back into running again.  I'm using the virtual coach to get myself ready for a 5k in March.  Out of all the other virtual coaches I've tried to use, this has been the best experience.  After I entered some personal data, I got to pick between 3 different coaches.  Each coach had a bio and explained their approach to the training plan.  The coach I selected has me running 3 days per week.  Each workout is different.  I've done Run/Walk, Speed Repeats, Hill Repeats, the Magic Mile, Drill Workouts, etc.  After 7 weeks of a 13 week training plan, my average pace has dropped dramatically and I am on pace to reach my goal of running a 5k in 28 mins or less.  It's been so easy to follow and instructions are provided for each type of workout (job aids and/or videos).<br/>--- I like that you can only start and stop your activity by pushing the buttons on the side of the watch even though it has a touchscreen.  This just means that if I accidentally bump the watch face while running, it won't stop my run.  A previous watch I owned from a different company would only allow you to start/stop activities from the watch face.  It was a horrible experience.  I'm glad Garmin did not adopt that approach.<br/>--- The GPS is accurate from what I've seen.<br/>--- I'm sure the step count isn't perfect, but it gives you a good idea of how active you were for the day.<br/>--- You can sync your activity with Strava and Nike Plus.  After my run is over, as long as I'm near my phone, the activity will sync automatically.<br/><br/>Notifications:<br/>--- The notifications appear immediately as expected and they are easy to dismiss or remove.<br/>--- If I have my bluetooth turned on, I can answer the phone from my watch.<br/><br/>Music:<br/>--- I have an Amazon Music account, and Amazon syncs up with the Gamin Venue.  Any song that I download to my playlist on Amazon will sync over to the watch.  It's a seamless process.<br/>--- You cannot stream music from apps like Pandora.  But, if you have mp3 files of your music, you can download those to your watch.  I have an iTunes account.  I pulled the mp3 files from some of the songs I purchased and downloaded them to my watch.  Easy process.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>--- The one piece of negative feedback that I have is that you CANNOT manually pause your workout.  There is an AutoPause feature, but it doesn't work that great.  I would rather be able to pause on my own, but there's no option for it.  The top right button on the watch starts and stops your activity.  The bottom right button is your Lap button.  I'm hoping Garmin does a firmware update in the future that enables manual pausing during activities.<br/>--- This used to be a con, but was fixed by Garmin in January 2020.  There was an issue with the heart rate monitor.  If you turned it off, it wouldn't actually go off.  It kept running.  Instead, you had to restart the watch every time you wanted to turn off the heart rate monitor.  But, as mentioned before, Garmin fixed this in January 2020.  I can now turn off the heart rate monitor without restarting the watch.<br/><br/>I am glad I decided to purchase the Garmin Venue.  It looks good on my wrist, it has solid performance, and it doesn't lag like other watches I've seen.  I'm very happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>INITIAL REVIEW:<br/><br/>There's a lot to like about the Garmin Venue.  I received the watch on a Monday.  It had roughly 65% battery on it out of the box.  I didn't have to charge it until that Friday.  And it still had 20% battery when I decided to charge it.  I ran 2 days on the treadmill (40 mins on each run) using the run tracker.  I used the HR monitor every night while sleeping and sporadically during the day.  Yet, the battery didn't lose much power.  The only thing I found that really drains the battery is playing music from the watch.  I'm really loving the battery life!<br/><br/>The Venue resembles a normal watch for the most part.  This is something I was looking for in a smartwatch.  I didn't want something "boxy".  It's lightweight and looks normal on my wrist.  It's not bulky, nor is it tiny.<br/><br/>The tracking info seems to work as intended.  I don't need it to be exact; it just needs to give me a rough idea of how I'm doing each day.  Plus, it syncs easily with Strava and/or Nike Plus.<br/><br/>Bluetooth is easy to connect.  Notifications from my phone pop up immediately.  I have no complaints at all about this smartwatch.<br/><br/>If I remember, I'll stop back after a month or two of use to give an updated review.</span>

<span>I'll come right out the gate and say that if you are looking for an excellent fitness tracker and will motivate you to actually exercise this is the ticket.<br/><br/>I've owned products from Fitbit and an Apple Watch, but the Venu has by far been my favorite. Apple Watch certainly had the best smart features, but to be honest after having the thing for 3 years I didn't bother with like 95% of them. Only think I care about is notifications, and the Garmin does just fine with that. What I really cared about was the fitness tracking, and Garmin is on a whole different level. Sure Fitbit is probably more "consumer" friendly and Apple allows for everything to be in one ecosystem, but if you are more into seeing metric like sweat loss, bar charts that can track your heart rate for the entire exercise, and GPS built right into the watch you have to go with the Garmin. The ability to have workouts built in outside of just stuff like walking, running, biking, the basics really, is top notch. Will I ever use ones like the paddle boarding and the cross country skiing? Probably not, but it's there for people who will. The app is also really great, and motivating. Both my parents also use Garmin products, so it's really fun to compete with them on who can be the best. Being able to connect with social media and compete with all my friends is also really fun as well. The app is, for the most part, well laid out. Might take some time to find were some stuff is, but the internet is your best friend and Garmin's website has lots of info on it to answer your questions. Another plus is the battery life. My Fitbit products were decent with maybe 2-4 days depending on what I did. Apple Watch was terrible, usually a day at most and towards the end of its life I sometimes had to charge it twice in a day. The Venu? Well when Garmin says 5-7 days they mean it. That's dependent out course. Workouts that use GPS take more power, and using the built in music paying doubles that. Still I'd say I use it at an average level, and before the first charge I got 5 days, and probably could've got 6. That 's impressive on a device that has an AMOLED screen, and a very good one at that.<br/><br/>Cons? Well the 3rd party watch face support is pretty abysmal. Most of them require a 3rd party payment outside of the app, which is a no-no in my book. I found that most of the free ones I downloaded, which nice, drained the battery a lot faster and some of them actually messed the with raise to wake feature. I'd recommend just making one using your own photos or use the stock ones from Garmin. The app store is also a completely separate app, also a bummer, and quite frankly I don't see myself ever adding any apps outside of Spotify anyway. I hope maybe Garmin eventually just adds into into the primary ConnectApp.<br/><br/>Really, though, I think there are very few negatives about the device, actually most are just Garmin's software. The device itself is very good, worth the money, and I would recommend to anyone who wants a good competitive product to what Apple and Fitbit offer that wants superior fitness tracking abilities.</span>

<span>At this point, I have had the Sense 2 for 2 days and I know at least some of my issues will likely be fixed with later software updates.  First, the good.  I like the form factor.  The case is thin and the watch, even with the supplied band, is comfortable.  Speaking of the band, as a big guy, I was overjoyed to see the inclusion of a second band that actually fit.  Also, changing bands is a snap.<br/><br/>Overall, it seems to be relatively high quality.  The battery life, so far at least has been fantastic.  I am on hour 42 of wearing it after a 99% charge and it is down to 70% battery left.  The screen is fairly bright and crisp.  An understated advantage of the Sense 2 (and one of the reasons I switched) is that is OS and phone brand agnostic.  You can use it with Apple or Android and, unlike the Galaxy Watch, there are no features locked away if you are not using the correct brand of phone.<br/><br/>If you are coming from a Galaxy Watch where you could customize the watch face and all sorts of other things and that is important to you, then move along.  This watch will not be for you.  For now, at least, there is not really much substantive you can do to individualize your user experience.  That's not so great.<br/><br/>Also not so great is the things that are missing.  There is no Google Maps at launch.  Also, despite being a Google company, no support for the Google Assistant (Alexa only sadly).  There is also no interface to control music on your phone if that is important to you.  I found it mildly annoying, but not a deal breaker.  In addition, some people will be turned off by the fact that there are features that require a Fitbit paid subscription to get, even though you get six months for free.<br/><br/>The real reason I bought this watch was the ECG function.  I have had A Fib for a couple of years and used to use (and still do) a Kardia XL to check my rhythm.  The Galaxy Watch 4 was nice because it did a reasonable single lead reading and it meant not having to carry another gizmo with me.  You simply held still and put a finger on each of the side buttons.  Unfortunately, when I switched from a Galaxy phone to a Pixel, I lost the ability to do an ECG.<br/><br/>On the Sense 2, the ECG has not been impressive.  First, I have big hands and contorting my right one to get my thumb and forefinger on the corner of the glass has been a challenge at time.  It often takes several tries to get it right.  Second, despite confirming on both my Kardia and my Galaxy Watch, the Sense 2 will never indicate that I am in A Fib.  Apparently, if your pulse goes above 120 (which mine frequently does while in A Fib) then the Sense 2 just gives up and won't really check.  Even in instances where it was below 120, the Sense will not confirm.  I guess we get to settle for inconclusive results instead.  Given this feature was the main reason I bought the watch, it may be a deal breaker for me and I may return it for that reason.  If this feature is not that important to you, then it may still be a good option.<br/><br/>Overall though, it may be a good option for the right person.  If you care primarily about health and fitness tracking and want a good battery life, then this is a good option.  At the current $300 price point, I still feel like Fitbit may be asking a little too much given the features of the other higher end options on the market.</span>

<span>This is my 8th Fitbit and I almost switched to an Apple Watch instead but decided to stay with Fitbit for the challenges which I find motivating. I saw other reviews about the smartwatch capability downgrade in this version but went ahead and bought it as I usually use my phone instead of the Fitbit for most of the missing apps. Sadly, it is not accurately tracking my steps. I just raked leaves for almost 4 hours and have over 200 active minutes yet my step count was only about 4000 steps.  Every other Fitbit has consistently tracked raking leaves at 5000 to 7000 steps per hour. After raking I started counting my steps manually and comparing the number to the device and it is counting about half my steps with just regular walking. I did weight lifting circuit at the gym yesterday where you step up and down on a step for 60 seconds between lifting and at the end of 30 minutes of doing the step activity between weights (about 900 stair steps) the device said I had completed 2 flights of stairs. So I stayed with Fitbit for challenges- but the sense 2 isn’t giving me credit for my activity so The challenges are pointless. I had the versa 3 before this which I liked - may be a better bet.<br/>Update: I started using the large band and keeping the band loose and further up my arm- like 1.5 inches above my wrist bone- per suggestion of a guy at the gym who had the same problem with the sense 2 not capturing steps and it is definitely working better. I have not needed to position previous Fitbit devices this way for accuracy so hadn’t thought to do that. I would move my 2 star to a 4 star based on this improved accuracy however I bought this tracker recently when it was sold at a very low price. At $199 it would remain a 3 star at best.</span>

I cannot see close up and the tiny icons are not large enough to see without a struggle and I dont wear my glasses to work out . My Ionic was perfect for my vision . I did send it back.

<span>This tracker has a nice slim fit. It comes with two silicon wrist bands one for larger wrists and one for smaller. I don't use it for sleep tracking so can't rate that. It links to the Fitbit app on my phone easily and the Fitbit dashboard app on the computer shows step performance for past days. I do much walking on a treadmill and found that if you hold the treadmill hand rest with the hand that you have the fitbit on, it does not track the steps (the hand is not moving). You can buy a pants hook (replaces watch band) as a solution (or if you just don't like wearing something on your wrist). This gives up tracking heart rate and a few other things. I have not tried this yet, but I might. The display is clear and easy to use. However, to activate it you squeeze the sides of the fitbit which works fine but the included instructions did not mention this - I finally figured it out.</span>

<span>For a cool 70 bucks, you too can have inaccurate step counts, uncomfortable fit, issues with the watch thinking you're underwater, and finicky touch controls!!!<br/><br/>The Inspire 2 is essentially the entry-level fitness watch that promises a set of features that do the bare minimum, which is what you should reasonably expect. And while the product is only running 69.99, that's still more than enough to expect it to do those simple features well enough, especially coming from the industry leader, Fitbit. Unfortunately, that's not the case.<br/><br/>First issue: It's uncomfortable. The rubber band seems like it's going to be nice to wear at first, and it even comes with a spare out of the box. It's a nice matted finished band that feels soft to the touch. Unfortunately it's rubberized nature means it sticks to your skin and constantly tugs on your supple flesh, especially if you wear the band as tightly as Fitbit seems to want you to.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the second issue: Fit. If you have a problem with the Inspire 2, Fitbit's default customer service recommendations typically include: Wear it lower or higher on your wrist, and tighten it more. Let me just say that the only reason I can think of that they would want me to wear this damn thing any tighter is that they are anti-hands and are operating some in some sort of dark underbelly who wants all humans to lose their hands. But, unfortunately, that seems to be the solution to a lot of very typical problems that this unit seems to have.<br/><br/>And one of those issues is the Water Lock feature. A quick google search will show you a bunch of customers running into this problem and no real solutions offered from Fitbit CS. A simple ability to deactivate this feature would fix this, but as far as I can tell it has remained a consistent sticking point for a while now and without help from a firmware update I don't know if it's going to be fixed.  Essentially, if the watch isn't worn perfectly, for some reason it defaults to thinking you are in or around water, getting wet and moist.  Then it turns on a locking mechanism that requires you handle it's finicking touch screen to get out of the lock.<br/><br/>Speaking of its touch screen and its user experience in general, it is subpar, but feasible. If the Inspire 2 didn't have all of these other problems, a slightly worse-than-average touch experience probably wouldn't be too big of a deal, but it kind of just stacks on top of the other issues. Sometimes it works perfectly, as intended. Then other times, it takes a lot of handling just to get the screen to recognize that you want it to turn on. Sometimes the tilt function that is supposed to quickly turn on and let you see the time and water stat you have actively selected (heartbeat, steps, etc) works perfectly and other times you might as well be a corpse because I'm pretty sure the Inspire 2 thinks you are deceased and has gone into retirement.  Then the touch screen itself often works fine, just as often refuses to swipe through it's various readouts.  It is probably the best part of the product, which says a lot about everything else, and for 70 it's probably what you should expect from a touch screen.<br/><br/>Step count... While I appreciate the watch telling me that I've walked 3,000 steps today, I have been sitting at my desk for 12 straight hours straight. My legs are numb, my ass is decimated and my arteries are clogged with gelatinous blood. But seriously, when you are actually walking it does a fine job counting your steps. But it will periodically add phantom steps. I was on a road trip, driving 7 hours one way, then the other on the return, I only walked when we stopped to stretch our legs. I took no more than a few hundred steps in that time, but by the end of it, the Inspire 2 insisted I had walked well two thousand...  This and the sleep tracking (which we will get to next) were the main reasons I wanted a fitness watch to begin with. If these counts were accurate I might ignore the litany of other annoyances on offer, but it's clear that I'm not going to be getting accurate counts of calories burned, steps taken, and that calls into question things like the sleep tracking as well.<br/><br/>This brings us to said sleep tracking. It seems okay? But what do I know, I'm asleep... Actually, even that is a lie. Each of the nights I've sacrificed comfort to wear this wrist-demon to sleep, I've woken up to it telling me that it couldn't get a very accurate read, that I should tighten the band some more... my brother in christ, I can not tighten this threat any more than it already is. It does give you a decent readout of your sleep situation regardless of this message, but you do have to sleep for 14 days for the app to give you meaningful information about it. Unfortunately, again, the 14 days have to start at the first of the month. So if you are relying on paid monthly Fitbit access to get the most out of your watch, and it just so happens to fall on the latter half of a month, you may end up having to pay for an additional month just to get the information you want.<br/><br/>I hope this unnecessarily in-depth review has helped.  Pay extra, get a better watch, and maybe just get a Garmin or something.  I'm not so sure about Fitbit as a brand anymore. If you do end up getting the Inspire 2 despite yourself, only wear it during exercise. Everyday driver, this one is not.</span>

<span>I was prepared to love this Fitbit.<br/><br/>I purchased one years ago and gave up on it because it logged my driving miles as walking miles and I could never remember to initiate the steps recommended in the 'workaround' solution.<br/><br/>I heard that issue had been resolved (mostly) so I was excited to give it a try. I was also super excited to try the sleep tracking function as I suffer from mild sleep apnea.<br/><br/>The first few days were pretty good - but now - I rarely bother to strap it on. Here's why:<br/><br/>1) when I'm walking - I typically swing my arms like most humans (remember that Rachel Welch Seinfeld episode) ... but when I'm on the treadmill - I either hold on to the rails - or I'm holding dumbbells. I also have a small dog with a recent ACL injury - so I carry him a lot (for now). And don't get me started on the dozens of times I walk around the house carrying stuff (ie laundry, laptop, phone, etc). Please know that if you are not actively swinging your arms while walking - none of this gets logged as walking. It took me a couple of days to figure this out. Not to be deterred - I bought an ankle strap.<br/><br/>The ankle strap was going to solve another issue for me: I'm a stomach sleeper. And I sleep with my arms folded and tucked under my pillow. I know it's the worst way to sleep (bad for back, breasts and gut health) - but I've not been able to break the habit (even tried those special pajamas but I'd just take them off in my sleep). Like most people - I do a moderate amount of shifting or turning my head in my sleep. The longer I wore my watch, I experienced several instances where the drag from the watch band against the sheets would wake me up. I know it seems weird - but basically - envision your wrist sandwiched between the cotton flat sheet and the cotton pillow case. Every time I shifted my arm out from under the pillow case to raise up and reposition myself - the band tried to grip the sheet - the resistance provides the mild sensation of being restrained and sometimes it would startle me awake.<br/>So as you can imagine -<br/><br/>2) I was excited to receive my third party Fitbit ankle strap. For 4 weeks - I was in heaven as it logged every step and all my sleep. At week 5 - it stopped logging my sleep. It logged my heart rate, steps, etc - just not sleep.<br/><br/>After troubleshooting on my own - I finally called support. I explained the issue. The representative said the Fitbit is only designed to be worn on your wrists - not ankles or forearms. She explained that this was wasn't tracking my sleep.<br/>But here's the thing - it tracked my sleep for a little over 4 weeks while wearing it on my ankle. Representative could offer no explanation for that. Twenty four hours after rebooting it and putting it on my wrist - the sleep tracking started again.<br/><br/>So I wound up back where I started - if wearing it on my wrist - not fully logging my steps due to the insane amount of steps I take without swinging my arms. Taking it off before I go to sleep - and most days forgetting to even put it on when I wake up. I typically use the ankle strap to get accurate steps but I miss the sleep tracking.<br/><br/>I'm super disappointed but look forward to the day a better option becomes available.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/><br/>1) long battery life and<br/>2) sleep tracking component is pretty phenomenal - gives more detail than my sleep apnea app<br/><br/>Cons -<br/>1) I didn't mention this earlier - but the screen is super unresponsive. I exchanged it for a new one because it was so difficult to tap the screen awake (while other random times simply raising my arm would activate the display). I didn't bother to exchange it again because I fear this is just a glitch with this item<br/>2) wearing it while sleeping can be a challenge for stomach sleepers<br/>3) does not log steps if you are walking while carrying dumbbells or other items - you must swing your arms for it to accurate count steps.</span>

<span>I bought this because it is smaller than many other activity bands and less obtrusive on my wrist.  There really isn't much to choose from these days. It seems to work ok- it is counting steps and some exercise. I am finding the calorie/activity part of the app helpful. I'm not using it for sleep tracking at this time. People reviewing this have said that they are annoyed by the vibrations when they move their wrist. I have not had that problem- but I disabled some of the notifications so maybe that helps. The battery lasts at least a week for me. The tracker works okay, but there are some negatives.<br/>The original band that comes with the activity tracker is made of some odd material- it collects dust, and even hair sticks to it! When I took it off after  a few days there was dust collecting under the band- I've never seen anything like that with other bands. The band is also oddly positioned and doesn't lay flat on the wrist- very similar to the Charge 4 band. The buckle is made of plastic.  I then ordered a leather band also from Fitbit (thankfully it was on sale) and it is much better. It is thinner and lays flatter, and it's much better looking. It also doesn't attract dust and hair! My question to manufacturers is: why don't you give customers the choice of a band when they first buy the activity devices. Everyone knows that Fitbits sadly don't last much longer than a year, so it is a big waste of money and resources for customers to buy extra bands that will eventually end up in a landfill- especially when the trackers and the band connectors are  redesigned every couple of years .<br/>When I choose weight lifting on the tracker, it will register that I am exercising, but if I don't choose weight lifting, it might not register that I am exercising. I was also surprised by the limited exercise choices on the tracker. Maybe I've been spoiled by more expensive trackers that I have had, but then again the Inspire 2 is not that inexpensive.<br/>Sometimes I get active zone minutes and sometimes I don't. The other night I was making dinner and all of a sudden the active zone minutes came on. I wonder how accurate it is so I don't even look at it anymore.<br/>The past couple of days the hourly steps reminder has not been going on even though I have it set to remind me. I will try to shut down the tracker to see if that will fix it.<br/>I had the app on my phone, but it ran down the battery. There are ways to try and fix that on the Fitbit site, it is a known problem, but instead of trying to fix it I deleted the app and put it on my laptop. I'm home a lot more during this pandemic so it really is just as good to use the laptop for me. Just a note on apps- some really love the Fitbit app, but I've used the Apple and Garmin apps, too, and they all have their good points. I don't see anything that special about the Fitbit app, and actually, it is kind of confusing sometimes. I don't think it is always user-friendly. The calorie intake and outtake is very handy, though.<br/>I haven't been using this Fitbit for it's full potential, but it seems to work pretty well- not perfect. In my opinion, it is overpriced so try to get it on sale. It is okay, nothing special, but when there are few activity trackers to choose from, we have to take what we can get. If it lasts for a couple of years I'll be happy!  (haha) If it breaks I'll update this review.<br/>EDITED to add: I did reboot the device (squeeze sides to see clock face, then scroll up to settings, tap on settings, then scroll down to reboot- tap to reboot) and the vibrations for hourly steps came back.<br/><br/>EDIT 11/28/21: My Inspire 2 is still working as of this date. The battery life is still excellent.  Every day, though, the device goes into sleep mode without any intervention from me.  The clock is hard to see (especially outside) and I am getting very annoyed with that with my older eyes.  It doesn't help me that the face is small.  I think with the lower price it is at now, the band is more worth it than when it first came out with a higher price. It is pretty scuffed up, but that is to be expected probably. I haven't had it quite a year, and from my experience, Fitbits tend to die after a year, but maybe this one won't. I am tempted to buy a device that looks more like a watch and can be easily seen inside and outside, which is my biggest complaint about the Inspire 2. One more thing- I did not get the full one year subscription of  Fitbit Premium. I got some months (6?) and then it ended. I do not know why.</span>

<span>This is my first smart watch and I researched these products thoroughly. I chose this Garmin watch as it had all the features I was looking to monitor and I have not been disappointed. I am an avid lifelong walker and it’s wonderful to see the progress I’ve made since I purchased this watch. The price was markedly lower than other brands, the design is lovely, and it is a stunning piece. The watch is sturdy and very comfortable as I have tiny wrists and it is a perfect fit with the adjustable band. I highly recommend Garmin products which I have found to be of excellent quality and value.</span>

<span>I've tried several smartwatches and finally found the one for me with the Vivoactive 4!<br/><br/>I started with Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 - terribly short battery life and very slow charging. Tried Amazfit GTR 2 - nice but couldn't get past being tethered to China, and poor app. Fossil Hybrid HR - beautiful to look at, buggy and inaccurate. With Garmin I tried the Venu 2: beautiful screen and great features, but annoyingly buggy, and with erratic battery life. Vivomove Style - worked fine but small and just not enough good features.<br/><br/>This is the one. Sometimes I'll compare/contrast Vivoactive 4 (VA4) with Venu 2 (V2).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Just about the right shape and size and weight for me. Looks nice; I originally wanted the black but the shadow gray/silver bezel was $50 cheaper. I like the silver bezel, looks classy, and I'm happy with it.<br/>-Interface smooth and easy to use. Different from the Android-like style of Samsung or Amazfit but easy enough in its own way. No lags. Decently customizable. Decent app selection in the store.<br/>-Touchscreen works really well; responsive when I actually want to use it, but rarely picks up accidental touches, or wiping it with my sleeve. (V2 was terrible for accidental touches and always activated when trying to wipe it off.)<br/>-Great fitness features for general casual fitness (probably not for pro athletes). Good GPS for hiking (under the Walking activity). Lots of good motivators to be active, and tons of metrics even just for normal daily use.<br/>-Excellent battery life, good for a week without GPS activities. GPS uses ~10% per hour, still good. Charges in a little over an hour. (V2 charged even more quickly, but battery life was erratic, and far shorter with always-on display.)<br/>-Good selection of watchfaces, stock and third-party.<br/>-Transreflective display - I wasn't sure about this, but I've come to really like it! It's certainly not as "pretty" as AMOLED like on a Samsung or the V2, but much more practical, and far better battery life. AOD 24/7 for a week straight, backlight only needed in the dark, very clear and easy to read in sunlight - a much better choice for a fitness-focused watch in my opinion. Very happy with it! (The AMOLED AOD on the V2 was my main problem with it, other than general bugginess. It sapped the battery like crazy. It also couldn't be turned off quickly on the fly, like for a movie or a nap. Not a problem on the VA4!)<br/>-I like Garmin Connect. Pretty easy to use and lots of info.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Transreflective display - I like it, as noted above, but it takes some getting used to at first after AMOLED, and will never be as "pretty" except in bright sunlight which is where it really shines (literally).<br/>-Slightly thicker than I might prefer.<br/>-Plastic build, other than bezel. I don't mind and it's sturdy and light, but it doesn't say "premium."<br/>-Occasional problems getting a GPS lock after traveling to a new location. It helps to sync and then restart the watch.<br/>-Connect IQ, the app store, is poorly organized and has a lot of junk in with some gems. Looks like the Android Market 10 years ago.<br/>-Sleep tracking. For me this is the major con, especially compared to the V2. Accuracy is only okay, sleep and wake times decent, but sometimes missed when I'm in bed awake, or even got up to go to the bathroom. No sleep score and no insights, and can't view sleep on the watch. Sleep tracking is where the V2 really excels by comparison - impressively accurate, and very helpful sleep score and insights, onboard calculation and widget... the V2 outstrips the VA4 by miles here. I really, really wish Garmin would bring the updated sleep tracking to the VA4 as a firmware update. Or a VA5. I'd buy it!<br/><br/>Aside from the lackluster sleep tracking, I'm extremely happy with the Garmin Vivoactive 4. It's (almost) everything I want from a fitness/smartwatch. If Garmin brought the better sleep tracking to it, I'd say 5 stars, solid. As it is, call it a strong 4.5, and the best available for my needs.</span>

<span>I have had this for a few weeks now after switching from a fitbit and I really like it. I have not had any issues at all with the GPS tracking and I really like all the statists I get after a run/walk. It's also great to be able to calibrate when doing workouts on a bike or treadmill.

A chic bracelet design, on-wrist tracking and a month Fitbit Premium trial for new and returning premium users make Luxe the must-have wardrobe essential. From tracking sleep and activity to giving your mind A much-needed moment of calm, Luxe shines A light on your beauty, outside and in.   Care Instructions: (1) Give Your Wrist a Rest: If you experience any discomfort or irritation, loosen the band, and if it persists give your wrist a break by taking your device off. In general, it is always important to give your wrist a rest on a regular basis by removing the device for an hour or so after extended wear. (2) Don't Wear It Too Tight: Make sure your band isn’t too tight. Wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist. (3) Keep It Clean and Dry: Regularly clean your band and wrist—especially after working out, sweating or washing your hands. Do not use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers, cleaning wipes, household cleaners or other similar cleaning products to clean the band or device, as those are difficult to remove and could get trapped beneath the band and irritate your skin. Instead, only use fresh water and a soap-free cleanser (like Cetaphil) to clean the band.

<span>I have had a fitbit of some kind for years.  I really only want it for walking and telling time.  The other stuff is usually not used.  I have had a struggle getting it set up just like I want.  If I hit it just right it takes me into this neverland of the unknown and I struggle to get it set up again.  It has a pretty good battery.  I always seem to go to the last minute before charging again--usually once a week--however remember I don't use all the fancy stuff.  I tried several other models before purchasing the Luxe.  I'm keeping it.</span>

<span>So far, I am mostly happy with my purchase. I think it looks great and the tracking seems to be doing well for my sleep and steps. I feel like it is overestimating my calories burned even more than the last fitbit I had, which was the Charge 4. The screen is beautiful and charging is average for a fitbit. The charge will last about a week or slightly less. The one thing I do find very annoying is that I will accidentally start tracking a workout sometimes and I will look down hours later to see that it's currently on the workout screen. I then have to cancel it and go into the app to delete the workout. I never had that problem with the charge 4 so it must be due to the sensitivity of this screen and the way the watch format is set up. Overall, I think it's great but I just wish there was a way to prevent the accidental workout tracking.</span>

<span>I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this Fitbit.  Some said the watch didn’t work while others raved about it.  My honest opinion is this:<br/><br/>I don’t notice that I’m wearing it.  It’s very light weight and doesn’t fit too tight to my arm.  I’ve had no issues with it wearing it in water or while I sweat when I workout.<br/><br/>I don’t think this watch is entirely accurate for two reasons.  I woke up one morning around 4am and laid in the bed reading a book trying to fall back asleep.  Around 6am, I went to check my sleep pattern for the night… the app said I just woke up the same minute I grabbed the phone.  I had been awake for almost two hours already ready.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think the step counter is not accurate either.  This is less of a big deal to me because I bought this solely for sleep tracking.<br/><br/>The heart monitor seems very accurate.</span>

<span>This was purchased as a gift for someone who's not really tech savvy. I have been a loyal Fitbit user for the past 7 years and currently own the Fitbit Sense which is the current top of the line Fitbit (I previously owned the Fitbit Versa). This Amazfit Bip U Pro surpringly has a lot of the same features as my Fitbit but at a fraction of the cost. I stay with Fitbit because most of my friends &amp; coworkers use it so we can challenge each other and it's just easier to purchase accessories. Now back to the Amazfit... I like that you can take an SpO2 measurement anytime, unlike my Fitbit which only measures SpO2 at night when I'm sleeping and then it shows a reading. The Amazfit has other features that the Fitbit doesn't have such as a compass, way more activity tracking, it can control music from your phone and also act as a camera shutter for your phone. I like that you can create custom vibration patterns for your alerts (like for calls, texts, app notifications). The battery life is longer but that all depends on how your watch set up (screen time out length, vibration length, how often your heart rate is checked, etc). The one drawback for me with the Amazfit is that you cannot reply back to a text message or social media messages (not even with preset messages). You can reply with a preset message only when you get a phone call (you cannot answer a call from the watch or answer it until you get to your phone. It only gives you the option to silence, hang up or reply with text option). My Fitbit can reply to texts with preset messages or I can talk to text and reply that way which is wonderful. I can also answer my calls and talk through the Fitbit as long as my phone is within distance. If the Amazfit incorporated those features in the future, I may actually switch to Amazfit. I did see a more expensive version of the Amazfit at my local big box store so maybe in the future it will be more popular. I have heard good things about the Amazfit years ago but wasn't too keen on ordering something online without physically seeing or touching it in person. So when I saw a similar version at the store, I figured I'd give it a try and purchase it as a gift. The recipient loves the watch, it was purchased as a replacement smart watch so this one definitely has way more features (recipient previously used the iTouch Air SE and the screen became unresponsive to touch and the heart rate tracker stopped working). The Zepp app for the Amazfit isn't really too intuitive as many reviewers have mentioned but if you play around with it it's not too bad. I still prefer the Fitbit app better but if you've never had a smart watch before, you may not even notice a difference. I like that the Amazfit uses a standard watch band size so you don't necessarily have to order a replacement band marketed for the Amazfit. You just need to purchase the correct sized watch band. The Amazfit charges magnetically and you'll appreciate that the charging cord is fairly long especially compared to my Fitbit. The magnet only connects in one direction so there's no guessing if it attached correctly so you don't end up with an uncharged watch accidentally. The Amazfit is light and does feel cheaper than my Fitbit but maybe the more expensive Amazfit version is made with better materials (like not as much plastic). I do like the button on the Amazfit, it's much easier to press than the hepatic button on my Fitbit. As I mentioned before, I think the Amazfit is a good contender in the smart watch world. There are many models to compare depending on what features are more important to you. I would probably continue purchasing the Amazfit as gifts since it's much more affordable for all the features it comes with.</span>

<span>I love this little affordable workout watch. I've received so many compliments on it and I love telling people "thanks its from amazon" and they are shocked because they thought it was an apple watch! I use the alarm to wake me up in the mornings, it gently buzzes my wrist its perfect. I love how it tracks and maps my runs. Also battery life is RIDICULOUSLY good. I went on a 4 day trip and didn't bring my watch charger. I ended up returning from my trip with 60% battery STILL left.</span>

<span>I bought this sort of on a whim. I needed a smart watch and unfortunately the Garmin one that I'd gotten in December for Christmas just stopped working one day over the summer. Which was very weird and disappointing. I wasn't interested in spending a ton of money on a smartwatch after the experience with my last two honestly. Before the Garmin I had a fossil. The Garmin was great in terms of battery life and not being glitchy. The fossil was pretty but it was glitchy and the battery was garbage, and it had a pin that was jammed on the strap so I could never change the strap out. Never bothered to even buy new ones because I could NEVER get it to budge.<br/><br/>I'd considered buying something more pricey but honestly didn't want to seeing as how the other two I'd had were at anywhere between $100-$300 and didn't last at all or were difficult to even use daily because of poor battery life and software or just up and dying with zero explanation.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this watch. It was around $50 I believe. I was a bit skeptical but so far it's been great. The software runs well and it holds a charge well. I have to charge it maybe once a week or every other week. Really all I wanted was something to track my steps and walks and to be able to check notifications from my phone at work without pulling my phone out. It works very well for those needs. If you like fancy features or need more extensive workout tracking or GPS and whatnot this may not be the watch for you but if you don't want to spend a ton of money on a smartwatch and need it only for a few key features it's perfect.<br/><br/>I will say, it doesn't feel expensive. It is very lightweight and I'm sure some would call it cheap feeling. Doesn't bother me, it's light and easy to wear. The color is unique too which I enjoy. I feel like if it broke tomorrow I will have gotten money's worth and I'd probably immediately buy another one without hesitation.</span>

<span>I bought this watch on a whim, during the black friday sale. I'm a bit of a computer and android geek, and the WearOS watches have always intrigued me, but I never felt like I really needed one. My #1 issue with the watch (and this is mainly WearOS) is that it still seems slightly under-baked. I know WearOS 3 is coming and all that, but WearOS 2 is quite good overall, and yet it reminds me of the earlier android days. So close, but not quite there yet.<br/><br/>Setup was fast and easy, but the occasional annoying glitch (e.g. it disconnects from my phone almost every time I take the watch off when my phone is charging) keeps me from 100% enthusiastically recommending it to non-tech friendly friends/family.<br/><br/>Stuff I love: workout tracking. This is probably the number 1 reason I bought the watch. I work out daily, and I love the tracking features of the watch. Blood oxygen is a nice added bonus to go with the workout tracking. Notifications &amp; the ability to respond to messages from my watch--this is so nice when I'm out, and my phone is in my purse or pocket. Being able to ring my phone when I leave it somewhere in the house, and don't remember where.<br/><br/>Did I mention that the watch itself is really nice looking?? I love that the Fossil looks like an actual watch and not some crappy plastic smartwatch. I have two bands for it -- the silicone one it came with, and I picked up the metal mesh band from Fossil, as well. Despite the Galaxy Watch 4's superior features (and WearOS 3), I never even considered it -- it looks too much like a smartwatch. I'm a Samsung phone owner, too.<br/><br/>Stuff I don't love: the slightly buggy quirks. Sometimes the watch just refuses to connect to my phone. I can toggle the connection over and over in the WearOS app on my phone, and it still won't connect. Only rebooting the watch at that point will solve the problem. If you never take the watch off, you may never see this, but since I don't use sleep tracking (it creeps me out), I take it off at night and leave the watch to charge in a separate room from where I'm sleeping.<br/><br/>Overall, this watch is a solid buy. I'm using it with a Samsung Z Flip 3 phone. 99% of the time, it functions flawlessly -- if they could iron out that 1% of quirks, I'd be recommending it to anyone and everyone.</span>

<span>I have a small wrist so the face is a little bit too large but other than that very comfortable feel. Love to sleep function feature and the fact that it will track my steps and do other things as well, not a fan of the fact that it does not sync with apple health like I would want it to. Had to install where OS and Google Fit so not necessarily a fan of that. Had some issues with setup, had to reset the device and start over but once I did that everything was fine.</span>
