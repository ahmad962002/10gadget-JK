This MST hub lets you connect three HDMI monitors to your DisplayPort (DP) 1.2 equipped Windows laptop or desktop.Increase productivity with multiple screensThe newest generations of computers are more portable than ever, which often means that you’re left with fewer video outputs and smaller integrated screens. This MST hub solves both of these problems by letting you connect three additional displays to your computer, which makes multitasking much easier. Configure your displays for any environmentUsing the MST hub, you can extend your desktop onto additional monitors and stream independent content to each display. You can also mirror the same image onto multiple HDMI televisions or projectors, for remote viewing applications such as digital signage.Enjoy amazing video quality without draining system resourcesMST technology uses your existing video card to minimize the use of system resources while delivering Ultra HD 4K resolutions. This unprecedented performance makes MST perfect for high-resolution applications such as graphic design, gaming and medical imaging.Note: When using a DisplayPort 1.1 video card the MSTDP123HD acts as a splitter, automatically mirroring your video source across all displays. Resolution limitations apply.The MSTDP123HD supports plug-and-play installation for a hassle-free setup, and is backed by a StarTech.

<span>This replace that much more expensive Matrox triple head display.  It works set up as a little bit strange but after some manipulation it’s working fine… Decent value for the money at half the price of the matrox Which just stopped working after a few years<br/> so I can’t complain<br/><br/>In addition to my review I noticed that this unit occasionally loses its mind especially if you have your system set up to shut off the monitors after a certain period of time… I don’t gets confused and usually requires a complete restart to bring the screens back up properly other than that it works pretty well… I just shut off power saving and screenshot down and manually turn the screens off And that seems to work<br/><br/>Not working properly After a couple weeks with this device I found out that it tends to screw up the screens and lose track of what is displayed where it also takes a long time to start up and if I don’t leave power to the monitors instead of using auto shut off it often requires a complete restart of the system the Matrox never did this so I’ll be returning it and looking for another solution</span>

<span>I was skeptical that this would work, but it was exactly what I needed, so I gave it a try.  I crashed my system the first time I plugged it in, but after that it did allow me to connect 3 separate HD TVs to my desktop Pascal GPU's Displayport.  I couldn't get the same support from my laptop, but that may have been related to the fact that Intel and NVidia share the DisplayPort via Optimus.  But the device can work with the right components to connect to it.</span>

<span>I purchased this for a job that would be transmitting media to 8 different monitors.  Ultimately it is performing (2 more monitors to go)  But it was not with making a lot of adjustments to the EDID and EQ switches. But something that you won't know until you but then research is the maximum distance you can have between your transmitter and receivers is 164 feet.  Anything over that you will either get media dropping in and out or nothing at all.  Another thing we may have discovered is that it happiest with 1080p than with 4k.  It does quote the output at 1080p which is good, but today you almost expect 4k is standard.</span>

Ob ich einen DVD-Player oder einen Rechner an den Eingang anschließe, ist egal. Die Geräte am Ausgang sollten aber HDCP verstehen. Was es bei diesem Splitter aber zu bemängeln gibt, ist das viel zu kurze Kabel zum Netzteil. Wie soll ich das Gerät auf dem Schreibtisch mit einer Steckdose hinter dem Tisch verbinden, wenn das Kabel nur knapp einen Meter lang ist. Kabel von Steckernetzteilen sollten mindestens eine Länge von 1,5 bis 1,8 m haben. Dafür dann einen Punkt abzug.

<span>Purchased this to split/extend over existing Cat5e cables to show the Camera System NVR HDMI monitor output to other 4K TV's.  This also had a local Loop out for a TV to be right by the NVR without the need for another splitter and only 1 power pack needed.  With the power pack connected at the Transmitter, the receivers did not need a separate power adapter.  The unit has multiple settings via the EID switches but the default "PC Control" setting worked right out of the box.  The longest run showed as 97' with my cable tester, the others were 65' and 55'.  All 4 are working great.  The video output from the NVR is not high-end 4K so you may need newer Cat6 or 7 for longer and higher level 4K video projects, but wanted to leave a review that the buildings existing Cat5e cables punched down in a patch panel worked with the NVR.  I did read 1 review that said theirs worked for Cat5e from NVR so I want to second that to help others trying to find an option to try over existing cables.</span>

<span>Plug and play, gotta love technology. The only thing I will say is I have cat5e cable and 1080 signals come thru fine, when switched to 4k input, I get white blocks all over the screen. And sometimes I do get white dots flickering on the screen even in 1080p but only on my newer Sony 75” tv for some reason, it’s only noticeable in dark images, and I attribute that to the wiring not being cat6 or higher, I plan to change the wall outlets the receiver is plugged into, as sometimes I replug the cords into the outlet and the dots go away, but again only my<br/>75”, other TVs 55 and below no issue at all. IR sensor placement is crucial, inches make a difference. Am able to feed Comcast box and security nvr to all my TVs now. Programmed all remotes of different inputs devices into logitech hub based remotes at each receiver station with the Matrix transmitter ir taped to the ir repeater of the logitech Harmony remote. Works perfectly.</span>

<span>We replaced our long composite video runs with this product and I was literally blown away by the ease of installation and the upgraded video quality!  It was more difficult to run the Cat 6 cables than it was to setup and configure the HDMI extender.  This was truly a plug and play experience:<br/><br/>The extender receives power from the included power brick. Plug in the network cable going to each tv/projector.  Plug a network cable into each decoder near each tv/projector. No power is required.  Then simply plug an HDMI cable from the decoder to the tv/projector.  We also have a screen connected to the video loop out so we can monotor the program from the control booth.<br/><br/>Lastly, audio can also be carried over the HDMI signal.  We essentially have one wire going to each television/projector.<br/><br/>The cost of this solution was very reasonable considering we can now use up to 8 devices with a high quality stable video signal at a great distance.  Our longest run is about 110 ft away from the source.<br/><br/>I could not be happier...</span>

<span>Purchased for a sort of media cabinet i'm building that has two Raspberry Pi 4's, a mini Windows 11 computer, and an extra input/output for a 3rd Raspberry Pi 4 to plug in as a test.  I'm also using the Orei HDA-912 audio extractor (two of them), plugged into the loop out hdmi on two of the outputs.  I need the same content extracted from a playback but at different volumes, so using two of those audio extractors make that possible.  No interruptions on an output if I select another output to that same source.<br/><br/>I did have to perform a factory reset...I couldn't log into the web interface, but was able to get to the login screen.  Only way to reset it to default is via an RS232 command, which it came with the cable to connect to the rear of the unit and has a 9 pin female plug that will plug into a computer serial port, but I had no working computer that possessed such port, so had to acquire a USB to serial cable at a local retail store.<br/><br/>I ended up adding that RS232 to USB cable to my installation, as I found a way to remotely control it (and thus automate it as well) by having the mini Windows 11 PC send commands to the Matrix using a simple batch file (power on/off, select inputs/outputs, or recall a preset).<br/><br/>Only power supply needed is the one that connects to the Matrix, it is able to power up to 4 receivers via the CAT cable.</span>

<span>This HDMI switch is good to have for a device that only has one port. For me, that device is the protector I have in my room as it only has one HDMI port. The first thing I will note about this adapter is that it requires a manual change for the channel. It does not default to whatever device may be on which is a bit of a downer. I have to manually press the switch to the correct channel every time. That being said, you would also need to manually walk up to the device to change it every time. It will always be on HDMI channel one. I tried turning on a HDMI two device while the other devices were off and it still defaulted to the HDMI one channel. For that reason, I use this more so for my project that only has one HDMI port. It does not require any additional power and has a pretty decent cable length to hide the adapter if needed. It can work with most HDMI televisions whether they be older or 4k TV. It does max out at 60 Hz from what I can tell so you cannot get the higher quality if you wanted. It also supports 3d capability from what I can tell. I tried it with my 3d television and it works just fine. The device itself is a little heavy so make sure you are able to put support under it or it may bend the HDMI head overtime. It is not too heavy that it cannot be held by some table. I actually just used some double sided tape to hold it on the bottom part of the my stand. There is a small but flimsy button you can press to change channel. It is only one directional so you cannot go from 2 to 1 channel you have to just cycle through the channels. It is not too big of a deal but wish there was a better way to select the channels. It does not require external power to work nor does the lack of external power effect the video or sound quality. The material is a bit rough. I am afraid it will get super rough from dust and such from long time use. I am scared it will either get a ton dust and debris stuck to it and it will be hard to get out.  Overall this is a good way to turn your one HDMI port into three additional ports without the need for external power. Also make sure if you are going to have this hanging to have it attach to something to hold the weight to avoid damage to the HDMI. Overall this is a pretty decent HDMI switch. It is extremely basic and I wish it had a bit more remote functionality or at least smart capability where it is can detect which device is actually on so you do not have to walk up to the device to change it each time. It is a plug and play so you do not have to worry about the device needing anything extra to make it work.</span>

The Orei UHDS-104 is a reliable distribution amplifier powered HDMI splitter that will take HDMI (1.3, 1.4, 2.0) signal up to 4K@60Hz and duplicate the signal to up to 4 HDMI displays simultaneously, creating an impressive lossless image or audio transmission via HDMI cable. Compact, durable and easy to set up and operate. Ideal for trade show, conference room, lecture halls, bed room, living room, kitchen room and backyard. Please note that this hdmi splitter 4k will duplicate the source to the four output displays. It can’t be used to extend a desktop for PC or a laptop. If the connected displays do not support the same resolution then the splitter will lower the output resolution to the next best resolution supported by both displays and same goes with the audio signal. We recommend using this HDMI splitter with high quality HDMI cables 30 feet or less. The package includes Orei UHDS-104 HDMI splitter 4K, 5V AC Adapter & user manual.

<span>Works great in splitting 1080p at 30 fps. I suggest using OBS Software to capture.  For less than $20 USD it is great.  I do notice dropped frames at 60 fps, although that may be my computer(i5 8th Gen 1080 Graphic card). After the heavy compression for YouTube the missing frames at 60 fps are intolerable.<br/>The software offered by download from REI is simple to use how ever that is the only PRO, the Latency is nearly 2 seconds and is heavy on CPU. Going back to OBS I saw barely half a second latency in capture and stream. That is the difference between the Playing monitor and recording monitor. The monitor that I play on has so little (if any) latency I can  not tell any lag from button press to action on screen.<br/>I have only been using this a couple of weeks so how long it will last is unknown.<br/>The only wish (that some may see as a CON) is that the unit has NO off switch. so you need to un plug to turn off.<br/>Over all for 1080p @30 fps this great for under $20 usd.</span>

I've never used a splitter before and honestly didn't expect it to work, due to the complexities around the handshakes etc.  But this one works perfect.<br/><br/>I am feeding one HDMI 4K output into this splitter, and then having it feed that same image to 4 different 4K TV's.
