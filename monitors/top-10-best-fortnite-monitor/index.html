<span>This is without a doubt it is my favorite tv that I have ever purchased.  It has such a variety and has the roku function which really adds to this tv and it is all in the one tv. Yopu don't have to buy a seperate ROKU attachment.  I hope this tv lasts for a long time.</span>

<span>I bought 3 of these for my at home job as my old set up was giving me a headahce (different screens mix matched, different resolutions, sizes, etc). set the blue light filter on these and set the brightness and its comfortable to work at my desk all day now (as far as monitors go)</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>As the review headline says, "excellent deal."  A steal at $150 for a 27" monitor with a decent screen suitable for office work and gaming.  The extra size allows me more multitasking capability, which I need for work.  And it's always good to game on a bigger screen.  A good buy.  Recommended.  (Plus, the 2 HDMI ports are a bonus, since many monitors come with only one.)</span>

<span>Does everything it claims to do. I use it as a secondary vertical monitor to my main 35 Secptre  curved UW. I haven't tired to tax it to test its vid quality or refresh rate but I'm also not using it for anything the would require it to do that. It runs a live wallpaper when not in use and a single web browser, PDF, or txt document when in use.</span>

<span>First of all, excuse my English. Gonna be honest, the picture quality looks ugly out of the box and too bright but if you sit down and patiently adjust the colors and few other characteristics on the menu, you can get a really good image quality and you can make your games look pretty and run very well.<br/><br/>The sound is not that bad as other reviews says but I use headphones anyway so it doesn't affect me.<br/><br/>If you don't have too much money to spend and are looking for a budget gaming monitor, this one will do the job until you can get something better. It can be used as a second monitor too if you are into streaming. To see the chat, your streaming software, etc.<br/><br/>This monitor does the job. You just have to sit down and make some adjustments.<br/><br/>Oh! And Make Sure to increase it to 75hrtz!!! Is set to 60hrtz. Go to the menu and increase it. It makes a big difference!</span>

<span>I just wanted a second, larger monitor to use with my laptop. Strictly for everyday desktop stuff, not a gamer. This does a great job; good picture, ok but not rock solid construction, easy setup. Biggest flaw is the speakers, really awful compared to my laptop speakers. But I just use the laptop speakers instead, so it's mostly a non-issue for me. For a $99 dollar 24 inch monitor, it's way better than I expected.</span>

<span>I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.<br/><br/>I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.<br/><br/>Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.<br/><br/>I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.<br/><br/>Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.</span>

<span>This review is for the SB220Q series (1920x1080) 75Hz monitor variant.  At a $90 price point as of July 2020, all of the praise this monitor has gotten and continues to get is pretty well deserved.  Right out of the box the factory calibration is pretty awful as with most TVs and monitors (I’ll never understand why that is), but Acer’s built-in menu gives you a wide range of control to tweak the image quality to your liking.  Here are some of the most noticeable Pros &amp; Cons after using this monitor daily for the past three weeks:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- The colors can be very vibrant and the sharpness makes everything nice and crisp both up close and from a distance without going overboard.  Although the spec sheet does not specify the exact Adobe or sRGB color gamut range, it does have a stated 72% NTSC coverage (keep in mind that the NTSC color gamut has the highest level of color reproduction), which would imply that it should have close to 100% sRGB coverage.  This is pretty standard for most sub $200 monitors (note: the unit that TechSpot tested came in at around 93% of sRGB coverage mostly losing detail in the green range so your unit’s reproduction may vary).  The 6-bits + FRC (equal to 8-bits) color depth is also an industry standard for entry level monitors and is completely fine for casual use.<br/><br/>- This montior’s “100,000,000:1” Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) (non-standardized measure of contrast for videos) definitely seems to outperform my other slightly more expensive budget IPS monitors (the HP VH240a and ViewSonic VS2412-H)  that only have 20,000,000:1 and 50,000,000:1 contrast ratios respectively.  However, note that it still has an industry standard 1000:1 Static Contrast Ratio (measure for non-moving images) which isn’t great but is perfectly acceptable for casual viewing since only the highest tiered ($400+) IPS panels exceed that point with 1,500:1 being the maximum native contrast typically achievable with an IPS.<br/>~ A quick side note about that “100,000,000:1” DCR number:  there is no industry standard methodology for this particular measurement so the number itself is mostly useless marketing fluff.  But as I noted, compared to the two other monitors with the same industry standard SCR, this monitor did seem to outperform them both in that area.<br/><br/>- Its 102 PPI pixel density actually makes a subtle difference in image quality when viewing up close compared to my 24 inch 1080p monitors that have a 92 PPI.  Text seems to be a bit smoother in comparison.  This is purely an advantage of having the smaller 21.5 inch screen.<br/><br/>- The Color Adjustment Menu allows you to adjust both the RGB and CMY gains, bias, hues, and saturation levels to get a better color balance.<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu lets you adjust the screen’s brightness, contrast, gamma, and blackness (“black boost”) levels while also providing a ‘blue light’, ‘adaptive constrast’ (ACM), and a ‘Super Sharpness’ on/off switch.<br/><br/>- The Game Menu has FreeSync (for AMD GPUs) and Overdrive options<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- The bezels are a bit thicker than I woud’ve liked (they’re about 1 cm on the top, left, and right sides) making the frameless design nothing more than a gimmick.<br/><br/>- The top-down viewing angle is noticeably darker compared to looking at the screen head on.<br/><br/>- Despite having a good DCR of 100M:1, the blacks are still a bit too bright for watching anything with heavy dark scenes since the display itself does not have any HDR capabilities with high contrast control zones aka local dimming (to be fair, this is completely expected at this $90 price point and is only being mentioned as reference for those that may be thinking of using this monitor to watch TV/movies).<br/><br/>- The Picture Menu’s ‘Super Sharpness’ option is just an on/off switch; it does not give you a more granular adjustment control over the amount of sharpness to apply.<br/><br/>- Even with all of the image quality adjustment options available in the settings, the whites remain on the slightly warmer side of the color temperature chart.  It’s not that noticeable when viewing on this monitor alone, but the difference can be seen if you have another slightly cooler display adjacent to it.  This is most likely just an issue with my particular unit since other reviews have noted their unit had a more neutral or “near perfect” white temp.<br/><br/>- It only has a paltry 15° degree back tilt compared to most other budget monitors being able to tilt closer to 30° degrees (this is super nitpicky as compromises are to be expected at a sub $100 price point).<br/><br/>- The Power button is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the menu buttons (both in shape and spacing).<br/><br/>Overall, if you’re looking for a nice quality budget monitor to look at spreadsheets, word documents, and do some internet browsing or even some light casual gaming, then this is a great choice.  If you are a competitive gamer, photographer, professional editor, or a content creator then you’ll obviously need to invest in a higher spec monitor.</span>

<span>Compared to my laptop, the image is greener. My laptop is also an Acer. It is really bad side by side displaying the same image via an HDMI supplied by my laptop.<br/><br/>The controls are tiny buttons under the screen. It really needs a remote.

<span>I bought this monitor for work 2 months ago as I became tired of looking at my small laptop screen. The size of this is perfect for having two programs up at the side by side without having an extra monitor. I am not gaming on this monitor, so I have yet to test the gaming experience. The colors however are a little bit off and you definitely see some ghosting effects when moving your mouse or dragging programs around. With the stand that comes with it, you cannot adjust the height of the monitor, just the tilt. I paired it with a mounting arm to help with that. For work, I have no major complaints as it serves its purpose.</span>

I have no issues getting to the 200Hz range of course paired with a good video card I shouldn’t. I had issues in the beginning but it was my VC firmware. After the update I haven’t had any other issues. I use the DP connection. Ensure you go buy you a good DP cable because cheap ones will not work as intended. I planned on keeping it for 4 years so it is time for me to get rid of it with my new build the end of the year. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a budget screen and knows what they are doing to get the most out of it. If you don’t cheap out on your VC and cable you’ll be fine.</span>

<span>This laptop sits at just over 4 stars while some of the other similarly priced and comparable monitors from Spectre, Lenovo, and other brands hover around 4.5 stars. This gave me pause, but after looking through many of the 1-3 star reviews it was clear that the majority had harshly penalized the monitor due to its reportedly lackluster audio performance. My laptop has surprisingly decent sound so I could essentially care less about the monitor's speakers. Now if my laptop didn't sound good then I would have simply connected my laptop to my Bluetooth speaker, my old PC speakers, my blue tooth headphones, or hell even my surround sound if I felt so inclined. Those reviews are overly demanding imo.<br/><br/>First Impression: Time spent from opening the box to having the monitor up and running was under 5 minutes. Well designed packaging and easy to put together - no screwdriver required. Came with both a HDMI and an Aux cord... ok cool I appreciate that but whatever. First glance of the monitor on my 38" x 24" desk and I'm satisfied with its footprint. The screen bezels are tiny which looks good and helps manage size. Another plus is how the base extends behind the screen as opposed to extruding in front which would take up valuable real estate in front of the monitor. The monitor and my laptop share the desk very well, and there is even generous room for an open notebook directly in front of the monitor. I'm glad that I went with a 23.8" monitor over something like a 20-22" as that last 1-3 inches makes a noticeable difference in screen size. The design and style of the product is very sleek and it looks great on my desk. It definitely doesn't advertise its modest price tag with its expensive and luxury appearance.<br/><br/>Early performance: When I connected my laptop (a lightly upgraded Lenovo T440P Thinkpad, maybe a $400 laptop) via HDMI to the monitor I was  met with a large snowy-owl staring at me (one of the photos that Windows cycles through before/during log-in). The picture was bright, edges were sharp, and the snow-white feathers of the owl looked like a true pure white. The contrast between the white of the owl, its dark eyes and the brown of the tree was great and everything looked realistic and accurate. After logging in I went into the Windows display settings and made a few simple adjustments on how I wanted the laptop to display to the monitor, it was very easy and intuitive to do.<br/><br/>First thing I did was browse some HD Youtube videos (a Lord of the Rings fight scene, and Planet Earth) and I was immediately impressed. The screen kept up with the intense action/pace of the LotR fight without any lagging frames or stuttering. Planet Earth's tropical videos looked bright and accurately colorful while the following cave video was properly dark and intense with moments of brightness. Here the speed of some of the small critters gave the monitor a little bit of blurring, especially when the color of the animal was similar to the color of the background. I then switched over to Netflix, browsed a bit, and decided on Planet Earth again since the show has so many amazing spectacles to view. Everything looked just as great and in some cases even a little bit better. The speed of the animals didn't seem to blur as with youtube (note: I didn't watch the exact same video so this is highly anecdotal.) When it came to reading text and more general browsing of the web I was pleased. Letters had sharp corners, and the additional amount of text that fits on the screen vs my 14" laptop made for less scrolling.<br/><br/>Happy with the video playback I rotated the monitor (set monitor to top height, grasp edges of screen, and twist it to the right) to portrait. The rotation felt smooth and solid. Boy does it make for a long screen, but I'm confident I will use it when working with long lists of data, programming, using Excel, etc. I am glad I will have the option.<br/><br/>Weaknesses: As mentioned before the sound is definitely weak. The volume is low, audio sounds pretty "shallow", and there just isn't much to report there. In my mostly quiet apartment I could hear and understand the audio from the monitor, but it admittedly wasn't long before I reverted back to my laptop sound. Nonetheless having an at least usable audio option as a back-up is better than nothing. I will generally award more points to any item that exceeds the expectations of its main function than I will penalize a product for including an average to below-average "extra" that is not vital to performance. If my computer chair gave me a back massage I would be very pleasantly surprised, but if it had a lumpy seat, didn't spin smoothly, and was stuck at a certain height I wouldn't be so pleased. I'll choose the chair that I can be comfortable in for hours, spins effortlessly and noiselessly, and adjusts height easily.<br/><br/>I can't speak to using the monitor for gaming and whether it can handle that demand as I don't have the gaming tech knowledge, the gaming experience, or even a game to test it with.<br/><br/>Final Pros: Sleek aesthetic/design, stand rotates landscape-to-portrait, tiny bezels, good brightness, dark blacks, efficient footprint, simple and<br/>  smooth tilt/height adjustments<br/><br/>Final Cons: Weak speakers, minor blurring at times of very fast moving video.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it!</span>

<span>Monitor performance once I got to work is fine.  Not a superb monitor from a quality perspective, but I think it offers a great value for the price you pay.  I am not a gamer or a programmer, but I do stare at the monitor 10-11 hours a day for my job, so having a large screen helps.  Having a slight curves monitor also adds a nice aesthetic to the office.  The picture quality and the crispness of the fonts are fine for office work, and I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Right out of the box, the monitor failed to work properly.  As soon as I booted up my work laptop and logged in to the network, a screeching sound (like a high pitch squealing noise at different tones) and a random popping noise came through the monitor speaker as the screen went blank.  The on/off buttons in the back failed to respond, and I ended up unplugging the monitor from the power and disconnected the HDMI cable.  I plugged back in the cable after a few minutes and tried again, and this time instead of the screeching sound and the popping noise, the monitor started switching color swatches - red to green to blue to white to black and repeat.  Once again, none of the buttons worked, so I had to unplug the power and the HDMI.  I tested the HDMI cable, and it works fine.  I tried again, and this time, it worked.  I was able to set up the monitor as desired, and I had no issues.  I am not sure what happened at the start, but the monitor is now functioning as expected.</span>

<span>Nice quality, great resolution and color scale, blue light is adjustable as is the backlight which is a plus. The curvature was a bit less than expected but may be due to 27 inch size( my previous LG was 32 and seems to have a greater curve.

<span>This review is for the “(Sceptre 20" 1600 x 900 75Hz LED Monitor 2X HDMI VGA Built-in Speakers, sRGB 99% Machine Black (E209W-16003RT Series) aka “20” 75Hz Wide Viewing Angle” monitor.<br/>I got 2 of these for $115/ea. It was difficult to return them and go with two Samsung 1080p IPS 22” monitors instead. For some reason, the non-IPS screens (like these) have a hard time displaying an even black/gray screen. The pictures with the grayscale test have my very high-quality laptop monitor below them as a reference in each picture for what the black/gray screen SHOULD look like. The monitor is on the top of each picture and my laptop is below it. The laptop screen is mirrored on the Spectre monitor above it. These exhibit pretty bad “ghosting.” To be fair, it is not as bad in real life as the camera makes the monitor look. But I still found it too distracting to work with. Because the screen is always darker at the top than the bottom (regardless of viewing angle), it can be difficult to see vertical scroll bars because it fades from normal at the top to washed-out at the bottom. Googling information can also be difficult because the color change of a site you have already been to on Google is more difficult to see at the bottom of the screen than at the top. It is also harder to work in Excel because the grid lines are not an even shade across the entire screen. It is not horrible like the HP V20 HD+ 19.5-inch monitor. But it is still not great. I found it too distracting to work with as a home office monitor. There should be 6 pictures showing the different shades of black/gray mirrored off my laptop onto the Spectre 20” monitor. The monitor in the picture also has a bad pixel a few inches from the top left corner that you can see in the darkest pictures as green. I personally do not take off points because my specific product/item has a flaw/defect. Even the best manufacturers have products that pass quality control. So I simply mention it and let readers decide for themselves if it is too common of a problem for them to decide not to purchase it. I only give bad reviews for “systemic problems” that affect all of a product line like this. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>On the good side it does have some really nice features for the money. I will miss the dual HDMI ports and the speakers even though they’re not very good. But this allows you to plug in a Roku stick and watch/listen to TV while working on the other monitor if you have two (see picture). I also personally liked the size better than the 22” Samsung 1080p monitors I’m keeping. Two 22” monitors are a little big for my very small desk even when VESA mounted. The Spectre monitors are also VESA mountable which was another reason I purchased them. They come with screws that create a gap of about ¾” between the monitor and a VESA mount (see picture). I’m not exactly sure why they did this, but it does make it easier to access cables in the back and it was not an inconvenience for me. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>If you don’t have much money and these are on sale for $120 or less, it might be a monitor worth considering. But the one I opened to try/test had a defective pixel so I had to return it anyways. And I never opened the 2nd one because I decided I just couldn’t work with this monitor for most likely many years. The Samsung’s look fantastic straight out of the box without having to mess with screen adjustments. And I got them on sale from Amazon for $140/ea. For my needs, as a home office monitor(s), the Samsung’s are much better and worth the extra $25/ea. But the Samsung 22" IPS monitors are normally $165+/ea. It would have been a more difficult choice if I had to pay full price for the Samsung’s.</span>

<span>Remarkable picture quality, probably due to its refresh rate.<br/>The stand would be better if it was 3-5 in. taller.<br/>I had some difficulty screwing on the VGA cable. Poor alignment perhaps.<br/><br/>Excellent product anyway. And featherweight...</span>

<span>I picked this monitor up during Prime Day sale. Like others have mentioned, the built in speakers are hot garbage. I actually prefer to just route my sound through my laptop for the time being. With that being said though, with the money you'd save with this, you could easily pick up a pair of external speakers. I wouldn't say that the speakers are a deal breaker because of this. I can't speak on the gaming aspect of the monitor because I haven't used it for that purpose, but I would imagine it has an average performance for the price point. Keep in mind that you will have to use a DP cable to get the maximum specs listed in the details.</span>

<span>I purchased these monitors on prime day and took a chance on them so granted I kinda knew what I was getting myself into. Prior to purchasing these I had two flat screen 20" Acer monitors that I had been using for my home office setup, they still work great but it was time for an upgrade.<br/><br/>Overall the monitors are quite nice and they already fit my vesa mounts perfectly without any issue, so set up was very easy but then I noticed...the power bricks were differently sized...I checked the monitors themselves and they are indeed the same model and came in the same packaging BUT WHY ARE THE POWER BRICKS DIFFERENT!? Not only that but the length of the cables are different as well...the right Larger brick being longer (but feeling very cheaply made) and the left being short but seemingly good quality. Can I get the same sized brick thoooo?<br/><br/>The power bricks aside...gaming quality, picture quality, and screen quality are all satisfactory for my needs and doesn't break the bank. Again setup was easy ( I already had the Vesa mounts and arms, these do not come with them just in case you were wondering) and I'm happy with my new monitors.<br/><br/>One last thing and I'm not sure who this goes to. I did make sure to snap and picture and video just in case the monitors were busted during transport. The box in the picture shows that the monitors were basically put in a larger box but no additional padding was included. When I got the box...the monitors were just shuffling around in there and I did not see any labels saying that these could be fragile.</span>

<span>I'm very happy with this monitor.  I was able to try it out at a former employer's office.  At home, I had a larger monitor and unfortunately, larger isn't always better.<br/><br/>I like this size of this display.  My monitor is only about 24" away from my face and I have decent vision with diminishing reading vision.  Looking at a larger monitor was more than annoying, it just wasn't good to use and it made me not want to use my home computer.<br/><br/>Using this monitor at 1920 x 1080 (recommended for this screen), and having the magnification set to 100% (Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display = "smaller") is great!<br/><br/>I don't do gaming and I haven't used the internal speakers.  Can't rate those.<br/><br/>I sometimes change the color settings to help minimize the impact on viewing screens late at night (Warm, Neutral, Cool, Low Blue Light, Night, Reading, HP Enhance +, or Custom RGB).  This is helpful.<br/><br/>I am able to tilt the screen down and up with ease.  And the rotate to portrait is great (raise display to highest settings and tilt back to clear the desk), but my old laptop can't change the settings to view in portrait.<br/><br/>I recommend this monitor.  It's great that it can also go on a stand that holds double screens.  And with the very thin left and right frame sides, it would be a great monitor to use 2 or 3 side-by-side.</span>

<span>I bought 2 of these for my wife's work station at home.  The monitors are easy to put together and set up.  The cable connections allow for VGA, HDMI, or Displayport.  The monitors have speakers and sound better than the laptop speakers.  They have a connection for the speakers but with the HDMI cable the sound uses just that connection.<br/><br/>Over all the monitors are reasonably priced, can be installed in 10 mins and look great for work.  The back is also set up for a plate to be used on arm mounts for a desk or wall.  I would buy these again.</span>

<span>I have no issues with this monitor. I have purchased two. I work from home and they Do very well. I have mounted them and used them with the stand and they are great. I even put them in a tote and took it on the plane with me when traveling and they help up just fine!</span>
