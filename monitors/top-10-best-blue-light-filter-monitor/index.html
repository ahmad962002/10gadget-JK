<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This product works as described. Hardest part was finding out which 3M product fit my Samsung S27D360H monitor. 3M website wasn't helpful. Called the 1-800 product support line, once able to actually reach a representative instead of hold music (15 minutes!) they were able to tell me the correct product to purchase. Biggest downside is the extra expensive of being a name brand.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This privacy filter is great for a peeping eye in the office, or when people hang around your desk and you're still trying to get work done. I bought it due to a coworker having a great experience with it. It does successfully block eyesight from each side, so someone would actually have to try to look and see what you're doing. I have to add though, I don't love it because I have a curved monitor, and the filter does not fully stick on my monitor. It pops up sometimes, which creates a double-vision effect that can really bug out my eyes. It's annoying that I have to keep pushing it back, but that doesn't even really do anything. For almost $200, I would expect it to fit better on my monitor. It does absolutely get the job done, and I'm sure if you don't have a curved monitor it would work great for you.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Does the job of a privacy screen on my 27 inch monitor. Only blocks viewing from the sides at around 45 degrees. It darkens the screen quite a bit. I needed to turn my brightness up. I like the glossy side on my matte screen, it makes the colors look better, similar to glass screens. It is expensive for a piece of plastic, unfortunately there is no other competition like it. I didn't have a option.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I think 3M makes the best of these but they are very pricey.  Would recommend if money is not an issue for you.  The level of privacy at angle is unmatched especially when using the glossy side.</span>

3M Privacy Filters keep confidential information private. Only persons directly in front of the monitor can see the image on screen; others on either side of them see a darkened screen.

<span>++Will mention 5 star privacy screening quality first, the flaw second.++<br/>Due to an office move, a number of us had lost our longtime offices and I quickly decided that spending $80 to cut out nosy passers-by would be like that old MasterCard commercial said: PRICELESS.  I decided - after doing extensive research - that this was the best privacy screen on the market.  Since getting my screen, everyone on the floor has asked me about it since it is truly remarkable.  I've angled my computer in such a way so that you can't see a thing unless you have entered my cube and are standing directly behind me.  Make sure to measure your screen carefully, not the frame, just the screen - I've got a 22 inch (hence the bigger price tag).  But if you haven't, the product arrives in a box with a ruler on both sides that basically tells you - don't open this box until you've measured your computer because after that, good luck returning it.  Which brings me to my one complaint.  Within a week of owning this screen, it dropped off my screen, onto my keyboard - not a big jump, something that an $80 product should be able to handle - and it scratched.  It does affect viewing certain parts of the screen and so I've had to flip it inside out to try to shift the scratch location for better viewing - so I have the shiny side facing out, giving me more glare than before the screen.  But given 3M's "once you open it, that's it" message, I'm stuck with the lifelong scratch.  Just hope I don't get more of them.</span>

<span>I am not sure why there are many one star reviews about this privacy filter. For me, it seems to work pretty much as advertised, as far as effectively blocking out the view from the sides. Naturally, the filter won’t provide much privacy if someone is staring at the screen directly behind the user. However, if the filter was this effective as to block out the snooping eyes directly from behind, then the user would also be prevented from seeing the screen. The installation process is very straightforward and requires putting on a couple of sticky pieces of plastic on your monitor and sliding the filter through<br/><br/>Couple of issues to consider:<br/><br/>-In general, the filter naturally does make the screen darker to the user, however I found that turning up the brightness mostly helps solve this. For those that like their screen extremely bright and already have the brightness all the way up, there may be some initial adjustment.<br/><br/>-The filter is mildly reflective, so if there is a light source close to the monitor there is potential for glare. This can be fixed by reversing the filter from the glossy side to the matted one.<br/><br/>-My biggest issue with this filter is the price. $85 for a 22” seems rather outrageous. Although to be fair, competitor products are only a little bit less expensive. Granted, I don’t know the cost of materials and manufacturing involved in making this item, but the price still seems much higher than common sense would dictate, so I suspect there is some “profit maximization” going on as a result of patents.<br/><br/>All in all, it’s a good product that works as described, however due to high price I simply can’t give it five stars.</span>

<span>Product works.  I've also did order another privacy filter from ProTechBiz, which unfortunately did not work at all, even in the slightest bit.  Luckily, Amazon's return policy and system is awesome to use, and the return is painless (so far).<br/><br/>The important to allow this to work properly is the contrast and brightness setting of the monitor.  If you set everything to 100, no privacy filter in the world is going to work perfectly.  With this filter, at 100 setting for both brightness and contrast, you can kind of tell what is on the screen.  For example, you can tell the person is surfing web.  However, it's dark enough that you won't be able to see exactly what is on the browser.<br/><br/>By reducing the brightness and contrast level to approximately 80 and 60 respectively, this privacy works perfectly.<br/><br/>For those who still insists only using settings at 100, it is as I have mentioned above.  People can see what you are doing, but can't really figure out the details.  So, it's practically safe to work on confidential information and the person next to you can't see the details.  However, you are probably playing games or surfing web where you want to make sure your boss can't see what you are doing, you will want to consider other options.</span>

<span>Update: Had this for about a week now and I love it.  It seems to have a tinted window effect that lowers the brightness of the screen and has reduced eye fatigue a lot.  Must be a combination of anti-glare (using the matte side) and the darker tint since reducing the brightness/contrast of the monitor did not help.<br/><br/>I bought this filter for its glare reducing properties.  It has two sides: gloss or matte.  The gloss side looks like a mirror and reflects all light.  The matte is better defeating glare, but still reflects some light.  Actually the LCD monitor I have is better are defeating glare, but not enough.  After putting the filter on it has like a car tint effect that reduces a lot of the glare.  The dimensions are perfect.  Make sure you measure as perfect as possible, and before opening the package use the provided rulers printed on the package to verify your size.  The installation is simple with the provided clear adhesive strips.  The strips can barely be seen when installed.<br/><br/>TIPS:<br/>1) The closer you are to the monitor the more you will start seeing the privacy filter properties at the edges of the screen.  I have a 22" wide screen and at 25" away I can start to see darkening of the edges of the screen.<br/>2) Shake lint off the included cloth before use.<br/>3) For glare, make sure you choose the matte finish out.</span>

<span>This does reduce glare, although it also reduces picture clarity. If the screen isn’t the exact size of the protector, it is very difficult to install.  It was larger than my screen and attached to the frame it sat above the screen and really reduced quality.  Cutting to fit and adjusting the adhesive was very difficult.  Also, because the screen was rolled, there are faint lines that are visible when the scene is dark.  A static cling adhesion would be better, but would still require cutting to size.  Overall, it works as stated, just be aware you may have to fuss with it.</span>

<span>Like the title says, these are a great replacement for the dying adhesive strips on my 3M Macbook Pro privacy filter.  i'd installed/removed it so many times that the original adhesive just gave up.  clean the privacy filter and the laptop screen very well, and then carefully peel off the blue adhesive backing from the clear backing.  where I messed up was pulling the blue backing away from the larger clear strip, and it would leave the actual adhesive strip on the original backing, not on the blue backing that is intended for the installation.  should be easy to prevent if you just pay attention to it.  So far these new strips are holding up well.</span>

<span>I used this filter on a 24" Dell monitor with a very slim bezel that is in the same plane as the screen surface.  The included mounting strips are a perfect way to mount the filter when following the very helpful directions which showed exactly where to place the mounting strips.  The mounting strips are gummy, so the filter can be removed and re-attached.<br/><br/>The filter prevents viewing the screen from more than approx. 45 degrees off center.  It also greatly reduces reflections on the screen.<br/><br/>I can't understand why people are saying that they can't see parts of their screen without moving side to side in their chair.  This only happens when I put my face closer than approx. 18 inches from the screen.  I wouldn't want to sit that close anyway. I normally sit with my face about 24 inches from my screen.</span>

<span>Fits the screen very well no gap around the edges, the screen protector and tabs are easy to install. I have been using the 19" version of these for 3 years and it has been great.<br/><br/>One this is a few of the tabs have lost some of the sticky backing, but after 3 years on a curved monitor face. This is not an issue really went on 3M's site and was able to order new tabs for FREE.</span>
