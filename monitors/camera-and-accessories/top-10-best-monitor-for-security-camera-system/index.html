<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is a really great camera! I use this for security for my apartment when I am away. It needs a wifi connection. I would highly recommend getting the 2k version. It is better resolution, and can hold 128gb SD cards, as compared with the 1080p/64gb SD cards version. I really wished they had a 4k version.<br/><br/>The night vision is fantastic. The ability to pan the camera around and 24/7 recording to the SD card (WITHOUT A SUBSCRIPTION) is fantastic. Other cameras need a subscription. For this, you can save like 2 months footage to the SD card. It's cool to look back at myself in the past! They do have a subscription, I beleive its 30/year. That's just to save it to the cloud.</span>

<span>I really want to give this camera 5 stars.  For the price, I probably should.  However one of the features I would like to use is currently broken, and the manufacturer seems to be aware of it, but isn't fixing it.  The feature in question allows you to tell the camera to "ignore" motion outside of a set area, so you don't get alerts for things you don't care about.  I really really wish they would fix this, as it would cut down on the number of motion alerts, and make sifting through footage much easier in the event that I need to.<br/><br/>That said, let's move on to the good!  First, this camera is extremely simple to set up.  You can program it to patrol between up to four different points, and set how long it remains at each one.  It also rotates almost 360 degrees, so you can get a LOT of coverage from one unit.<br/><br/>Another feature I like is motion tracking.  If it detects motion, it can follow that motion.  This is useful for me as I have it under an awning (I know, it's not an outdoor camera, but for the price I'll take the chance), and it covers my entire front yard and about a third of my back yard.  If someone enters, it will follow them as long as they remain, which gives me a much better chance of identifying them!<br/><br/>Also, the way it follows motion is kind of nice.  It doesn't center it in frame constantly, but in short little motions.  From the outside, it looks a bit clumsy, which I think is a good thing.  It doesn't look like some robot is following you, but some human crudely working the controls.  It definitely gives the impression of being watched, and so I left the status lights on, as I'd prefer to deter any vandals instead of hoping I get a good shot of them after they spray their paint.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, you can slap an SD card in, and have 24/7 recording.  There is NO subscription required for this feature, which is awesome.  It highlights with green on the timeline anywhere it sees motion, and purple anytime it sees what it thinks is a person.  This is where I really wish the activity zone features worked, as it picks up cars driving by all the time.  It also identifies them as people sometimes, but oh well.  I'd prefer to only log activity in my yard, and if they ever fix that broken feature I'll edit this review with 5 stars.<br/><br/>Video quality is as advertised, and the pan and tilt is smooth enough that you don't get a bunch of blur when it follows people.  The sound quality is mediocre, but that may be because I have it mounted so high up.  Really if they ever fix the activity zones I'll probably buy another, however the one I have covers everything I need to, so I'll stay with one for now.</span>

<span>I didn't want to break the bank by buying Ring or Chime indoor cameras, so I opted for this one instead. I'm glad I did, since it still has all their features but at a fraction of the price. Being able to control it from anywhere is very nice and gives you peace of mind. The only problem is that since the memory chip is inside the camera, if a burglar saw the camera and just stole it, you wouldn't have any evidence to present to the police. Kasa would use that as an opportunity to sell you on their cloud service but honestly I don't think that's worth the money. However, if you want to use this for piece of mind (and are willing to gamble that the burglar won't notice or mess with it), it's a solid choice.</span>

<span>I'd made an earlier review, expressing frustration over the inability to get our two new cameras to connect to our in-house network. I'm now happy to share that TP-Link Support came through for us! It took several days of perseverance before I was able to connect with an agent. They were thorough though, and called repeatedly as well as sending follow up emails asking whether we still needed customer support for our issue. I finally got wise and identified their caller ID to "TP-Link" (rather than a random 800 number) so I knew to pick up the call instead of letting it go to voicemail. I also replied to their emails and asked them to call during a specific window when I was likely to be at home (knowing I'd need to be able to access the camera when speaking to the tech support). They complied and today, a very knowledgeable and helpful tech support agent, Sarah Enojas, walked me through all the steps and we were able to get BOTH of my cameras CONNECTED and FUNCTIONING! I'm very pleased and satisfied with this tech agents capability and the company's tenacity in following through on providing me with tech support. Our particular problem had nothing to do with the cameras and everything to do with two different wifi networks in our home and the necessary passwords. I appreciate TP-Link following through on remedying my problem.</span>

<span>There is a 3$ a month membership fee but the first month is free. I bought it to capture moments during a sleep apnea spell.

<span>I bought this camera for a specific project:  My other devices include a Fitbit Versa 2 with which I monitor my sleep.  Fitbit provides a graph showing different sleep states.  I wanted to record videos to compare with the Fitbit graphs.  For example, I wondered, was I really awake during the night when Fitbit reported that was the case.  And did I look different in REM sleep than in deep sleep.<br/><br/>I set the Kasa camera on a night stand, and I chose the option to record 24/7 after inserting a mini SD card, which the camera automatically formatted.  I wouldn't say the menu is highly intuitive, but after about 15 minutes I developed some facility in figuring out how storage and retrieval were configured.  I had an easy time attaching the camera to my network.  The resolution is excellent even in a dark room.  The stability of the camera on my night stand is excellent, and that is also true when the camera is tilted on its base.  I haven't needed to permanently attach the camera with the screws and bracket provided.  Because the video clips are labeled by time, I can easily correlate them with the Fitbit sleep graph.  For me, this little camera is worth the price and deserves a 5 star rating.  I'm pleased I was able to integrate recordings with my Fitbit sleep monitoring app as I've described and hope to find other apps where video supplementation will be useful.  I have not found it necessary to use the cloud recording option and like the privacy of recording only to an SD drive.</span>

However, we were able to catch the criminal..<br/>Somebody was pooping on the sofa.<br/>We have a Chihuahua, a very small Doccia, whose legs are only 3 inches long, a three legged cat, and a little kitten.<br/>By the way, we bought tarps from Amazon. They work great because that’s what we started protecting our self with until the vet recommended get a camera.<br/>To our surprise, our three legged cat, Lego was hauling his butt up there and leaving us a turd every day.<br/>Well, he denied it. The camera was proof enough.<br/>The camera is very small and undetectable so if you were looking to use this camera for something other than a pet, you could literally hide it just about anywhere.<br/>FYI, we did not get rid of Lego the cat. We simply lock him up at night, but the camera works great when we leave our son home alone for a little while.</span>

<span>Update: Can't recommend at all.<br/><br/>The picture quality has gotten worse over time. Getting static and lines and bars moving across the video, live feed or recordings. Looks like something I'd see on a tube TV in the 90s on a channel that barely came through. Certainly not 4k or even 1080p any more.<br/><br/>Original: Highly disappointed with this but it will do. The overall quality of the product is great, picture is great, pretty easy to set up but the motion detection is horrendous. I have it set to detect humans and cars and I'll get notifications of bushes blowing in the wind, shadows from the clouds or trees, even leaves going by set it off. I've lowered the sensitivity so much that it was a hit or miss notifying me of things being dropped at my front door.<br/><br/>I ended up just turning the notifications off all together which is a shame because that was a main point in purchasing this system. I couldn't recommend this based off that but it's a decent system if you want high quality picture, no subscription, and easy set up.</span>

<span>First the good.  The camera has a good image quality for the cost, there is a lot of compression though.  I haven't checked the SD card manually to find out if it's storing the images in this highly compressed way or not.  The pan and tilt is very functional and also extremely quiet, I was worried it would have an audible sound to it but it does not.  It's smooth and very functional.  I also like that it has an ethernet port, I hard-lined the connection and disabled the WiFi via the app, this makes things much more secure IMO.  The night vision capabilities are a lot better than I anticipated they would be and it switches very quickly, though there is an audible click when it switches to the IR night vision and back again.  It's also got a nice field of view, pretty much can see about a 85-90 degree arc, though the edges are distorted with a "fish-eye" effect, which is to be expected.<br/><br/>App issues / storage issues.  The app is absolutely horrible, it is poorly done.  I don't know about the Android app as I have an iPhone so the Android app could be amazing.  The iPhone app just lacks polish, it's functional but not intuitive nor does it look nice.  Text often overlaps itself, it uses a strange custom font which is probably why the text doesn't scale right.  There's a lot of things in the app that you have to go find yourself and explore, this is not for someone who wants it to "just work" after they install it.  You've got to put the time into exploring the app.<br/><br/>I hate the fact that the app advertises the cloud storage and you can't opt out of that it is omnipresent.  The cloud storage is also explained very poorly.  The app is made by a Chinese company, which doesn't set entirely well with the lack of information about the cloud storage.  There's no real notes on who is providing it and what security and safeguards are in place for it.  It is bound to your account (or so it says) and it gives the impression that it's somehow encrypted but there is no information on this of any substance.  It simply says "financial grade", which could really mean anything.  I personally take it to mean that accessing the cloud storage takes username/password information and sends it over an HTTPS connection to their servers.  I assume also that it means transactions done with their servers and the camera itself are SSL encrypted, that is pretty standard among banks and the like.<br/><br/>There's so many things that just aren't said, what kind of SSL is used, is the data on the server encrypted or is it just encrypted in transit?  Can the provider go in and read the data (images and video) stored there?  The camera is pretty inexpensive and the cloud storage isn't that expensive either ($6.99 for a 30 day cycle -- which is also very poorly explained).  I wish I knew how the cloud storage worked, I have short videos of motion detected that get uploaded but it says unlimited space with a 30-day cycle for that price.  I assume it means I get billed every 30 days and that it deletes videos after 30 days unless they are saved.  I really just don't know.<br/><br/>Given the unknowns for the app and cloud storage I was surprised to learn that there is no interface in the app or via Alexa to turn the camera off.  In fact, the Alexa integration it pitiful at best, I don't know if this is Amazon's fault for not being able to use the API's or MIPC's fault for not making use of them.  All the Alexa integration does is you can view the camera on your FireTV.  You can't pan/tilt form the remote (you should be able to IMO) nor is there a facility to take stills or videos from the TV interface.  I was really, really disappointed in the Alexa integration.<br/><br/>I highly recommend buying an Alexa compatible smart plug, I cannot stress enough.  I gave my plug for the camera a bizarre and long name making it difficult to say or even remember.  I can still operate it from the Alexa app, I can use it in routines, and it gives me control over if the camera is recording or not.  Tying this into "away" or "home" mode on the Echo is really handy to do.  The camera takes about 90 seconds to really start and be ready to view, though I really wish it had a 5 GHz capability on WiFi, I get very poor performance over 2.4 GHz WiFi because my apartment complex is just flooded with WiFi on that band.<br/><br/>If you want something that you don't have to pay attention to, don't buy this.  Save up or whatever and spring for a more expensive model, look at the app ratings in the app stores and see who makes the app and what they say about how your information is secured.  If this isn't for a critical thing or your use case means you don't overly care how secure the data is, cloud storage will probably work for you.  If not, get an SD Card, but be aware you're still using it online and so there's not a lot of information on whose running it or what their safeguards are.  Just be wary, and get the smart plug so you can limit exposure if needed.</span>

<span>I'm just going to preface this quickly by saying I'm by no means an expert on security cameras, and this is the first one I've bought.  A main feature of this camera is its alleged Wi-Fi capability, and it supposedly only works on 2.4GHz, but it never worked for me even though my router is 2.4GHz capable.  For that alone, I had to take off a star, but fortunately I could use an ethernet cable because my router is close by.  Although I bought this for a very specific purpose, it's almost over-qualified for my needs feature-wise, and all of that let to why I gave it 4 stars out of 5.  See below for a more detailed breakdown...<br/><br/>PICTURE QUALITY:<br/><br/>The resolution is crystal clear 1080p, and it has an option for "day" that will record in color if there's enough light, and "night" that will essentially be black and white but can record clear in pitch black darkness.  More importantly the "Auto" mode will switch between the 2 as the light conditions change so you don't have to.  Works beautifully for me.  On top of that you can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your liking.<br/><br/>MOTION CAPTURE:<br/><br/>Lots of features and flexibility.  App allows you to turn alarm sounds on (if you want to scare them away) and off, set the sensitivity of the detection for both day and night, and enable or disable notifications on your phone.  You can also set it up to automatically record and upload video triggered by movement that the camera detects.  The only thing I can think of that they didn't have is the ability to specify actual blocks of time to have the camera have certain settings.  As in, instead of just day and night, be able to say 8 AM - 3PM, 3PM - 8 PM, 8PM - Midnight, the Midnight - 8AM, for example.  Other than that does everything I need it to do on that front and works well.<br/><br/>STORAGE OPTIONS:<br/><br/>I haven't had a need for any of the 3 for my needs but they allow use with an SD Card, a Recording Box, and cloud storage.  Only their cloud storage is an option, I'm not sure if that's standard or not, but for what it's worth it seems inexpensive.  Monthly it's $2.99 for 7 day loop recording or $6.99 for 30 day loop recording.  If you go with the annual pay options it's $29.99 and $69.99 respectively.  If I needed this feature I wouldn't mind paying this.<br/><br/>CLOSING:<br/><br/>Outside of the issues I had with wifi, and an inability to turn off the indicator light on the front, despite an option in the app to do so, this is a very capable camera, especially at this price point.  I'm pleased with this purchase.</span>

<span>I had a similar pan/tilt camera from several years ago, but I wanted to upgrade because it used a weird app and wasn't compatible with other apps.<br/><br/>This camera has been great. The picture quality is great, the fisheye very useful (although I couldn't find a way to turn it off) and the camera pans and tracks very quietly.<br/><br/>I love that both my cameras can now be used with the same app. I also really like that the setup was pretty straightforward and fast.<br/><br/>It would have been nice to have USB-C on the device, but at least it came with a cable and power brick.<br/><br/>I also really appreciate that the transition from day to night vision is more high quality on these cameras and the "click" when transitioning is not too loud and doesn't switch back and forth more than necessary.<br/><br/>I'm very pleased with these cameras and might even add a 3rd at some point.</span>

<span>I just got the camera but must say I am immediately pleased with my purchase - and purchased another! Here is my perspective.<br/><br/>I was in need of a replacement for First Alert cameras that I paid over $100 for a few years ago. Good hardware and still working on LAN but the software, which was less than impressive at purchase, quit working on WAN and I could no longer access the cameras remotely. I cant afford that price for replacements and have been hunting for cameras in the $25 price range for my budget.<br/><br/>I had resigned that at this price range I would not have some of the features I had with the old cameras, but still wanted something around the house when I was away as I dont trust my neighborhood. At a great discount I purchased some 'indoor' cameras from BBuy made by te*d. Not sure if I can call them out directly but you get the idea. They have been returned.<br/><br/>I decided to try this camera and compared to the big box purchase I would say a night and day difference in quality! So here finally is a brief list of 'better than others' satisfaction.<br/><br/>1. Setup. The setup was easy and the provided directions were clear, informative and straight forward. The competitors directions were lacking and I was able to complete setup simply because of my experience and intuition, this regarding steps I felt were important that were not documented. The Tethys Smart Cam documentation is great and I dont think I could offer an improvement. I will say that it will help to have a QR code scanner on your phone but is not necessary.<br/><br/>2. App Software. Wow, I really wanted to point out that I have tried other cameras simply because the Android app is INCREDIBLE compared to the big box store purchase! As I mentioned before I just got the camera but I have to say the options, interface, stability is a completely different class of product compared to the competition.<br/><br/>3. Hardware. I am so pleased that for the same amount of money I was able to get a camera that has the ability to pan, tilt, has an Ethernet connection and a slot for a micro SD memory card. The competitor product had none of those options - which I accepted I would not get at this price range. Plus the 1080 picture quality is great as well as the night vision - considering its a camera an all...... Motion detection has not been tested, but I can say the software options are so much more feature rich than the competition and I am looking forward to exploring rather than accepting an inferior product due to price.<br/><br/>Finally, while this might not matter to most, I still like to be able to get behind my computer and access information about my product. The competition was all and only phone. I cant even use the internet to cancel my account.  Much to my surprise after registration I was sent a HTTPS link to access my account and not only that, there was my camera! Incredible compared to the competition. I will admit my browser was not supported but I was provided a link to download PC app/software but have not tried it yet. As with the rest of the product I expect to be pleased.<br/><br/>So in summary I can say if you are looking for a good quality camera with a clean and fun user interface you will not go wrong trying this product. Did I mention I got another? Happy shopping and hope this review helps others decide with some confidence.</span>
