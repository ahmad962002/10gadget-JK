<span>I bought 2 of these for my wife's work station at home.  The monitors are easy to put together and set up.  The cable connections allow for VGA, HDMI, or Displayport.  The monitors have speakers and sound better than the laptop speakers.  They have a connection for the speakers but with the HDMI cable the sound uses just that connection.<br/><br/>Over all the monitors are reasonably priced, can be installed in 10 mins and look great for work.  The back is also set up for a plate to be used on arm mounts for a desk or wall.  I would buy these again.</span>

<span>As far as a good budget monitor goes - this is it. Quality is very good considering the price of the monitor. Size is also ideal for either single or double monitor setup (its not huge or overly wide). The sound quality of the built-in speakers is not very good - fine for everyday use or a video call but playing music or anything loud is very distorted or fuzzy. Use other speakers/headphones and you're golden though. Would still recommend!</span>

<span>I gave this three stars because I think it's probably a decent monitor, especially for the money, but I haven't used them, and was tempted to give one star due to my issues.  I ordered two of these on a Prime Early Access Deal for just under eighty dollars each. I ordered two because I have a motley collection of mismatched monitors and I wanted two that match for my setup.  However, I should have paid attention to the review by Matthew M., because the monitors I received have the SAME model number, but they are DIFFERENT. One says "extra thin bezel" and has a diagonal viewable area of 21.5 inches, and the other says nothing about the bezel, has a quite noticeably thicker bezel, and has a diagonal viewable area of 21.45 inches.  They are SIMILAR but placed next to each other would look significantly DIFFERENT, which totally defeats the purpose I had in mind when ordering two "identical" monitors of the same model.  Amazon says they have had other customer complaints about this, but Sceptre does not distinguish between the monitors and gives them the same model number.  They (Amazon) recommended I order a third monitor, and if it matches one of the others, then I can send back the odd one.  So, if you want two of these monitors, and you want them to match, then to be safe, you need to order three.  Unless Sceptre decides to put out a third style with the same model number, in which case you might have to order four...<br/><br/>Update: I gave up and sent these back, it was too frustrating to try to get two that were the same.</span>

<span>I have two very old, inexpesive 18" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.<br/>I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.</span>

<span>Overall, this camera would be better suited to monitor a room, not as a WebCam.<br/><br/>I spend most of my days in teleconferences. When speaking with people. I wanted a camera I can put on the tripod and place it in FRONT of the screen so they feel I am speaking to them, not looking in a strange direction.<br/><br/>I have tried a few cameras, including that built into my Mac, but I always got a bad view angle.<br/><br/>This camera allows me to place it on a small tripod and in front of the screen so I look at the people I am speaking to and straight into the camera lens.<br/>However, the camera, being 1.5 feet in front of my face, shows the whole room which for working from home makes little sense.<br/><br/>In addition, the camera, compared to others, shows the skin tones which less than flattering.</span>

<span>OK - you should know this before you buy it. This is a VERY WIDE-ANGLE LENS. Meaning - if you want your head to be proportionally located in the center of the screen, the camera will need to be mounted within a foot of your face. This is a problem for me since I have no such mount and mine is currently mounted to my large ASUS screen. So, basically, if you're using this for Zoom - you'll look like this picture. I'm sitting comfortably where I would normally sit - any closer and my eyes would hurt. This camera puts me wayyy back and I'm used to having my face be more squarely in the frame.<br/><br/>SO - if you like this wide-angle lens, this webcam is for you. If you enjoy your ENTIRE room behind you in the frame, this is for you. If you like fisheye lenses, this is it.<br/><br/>The lens quality is decent.. but you need proper lighting IN FRONT of you in order to get the best picture. Don't put light behind you - you will always appear too dark.<br/><br/>I'm still debating on this webcam.. I might get used to it.. I'm not sure. :)</span>

<span>I love this webcam. I wanted a new webcam for my PC to be able to video chat with my friends without having to turn on my laptop. I'm super happy I found this one. When reading the reviews before purchasing, people complained about how the lighting changes depending on room lighting, however, I find this to be positive. The camera lighting adjusts really well to the room lighting and you really don't need to have a light on to be able to see things in the camera during the night.<br/>I can't comment on the mic or mic quality as I have a headset and don't use the webcam microphone.<br/>The stand for this webcam was a bit confusing to use at first and I wasn't sure it would be able to stay balanced on top of my monitor but once I got the hang of it, I think it works quite well. I'm happy to say that you can adjust the angle of the camera quite easily without having to take it off your monitor or worrying about it falling. I like that the camera cover requires you to actually touch it the entire time you're opening or closing it because I know the cover won't fall down over the camera accidentally if I don't push it up the whole way. The hinge is stiff but in a positive way. Will buy a second one for my partner once he decides to upgrade his webcam!</span>

NO tethering to laptop...especially when in the field. Worth its weight in gold!!<br/>Lastly, issue IS battery consumption-HATE IT!!!! I placed a FULLY charged battery and even bought a genuine Canon battery, fully charged, to see if it was just the battery that was faulty, placed into the monitor, verified it was OFF. Turn it on few hours later when needed-completely dead!!!! What??? Frustrating!! Tested 3 more times, different batteries. ..same result.  Past my return date for an exchange by 3 days, so...guess I'm stuck with it. Love the unit...just wanted an exchange to see if it was just a "lemon" unit. Now I have to carry batteries seperate if I want assurance. With that said, cannot qualify how good battery functioning life is. Oh well!</span>

With that leap of faith, I just hoped it would work well with the Glide Gear TMP-100 I bought simultaneously.<br/><br/>While waiting two extra days for the teleprompter to arrive I played with the monitor and my screaming streaming Legion Laptop.<br/><br/>Finding a USB port strong enough to handle the 4K capabilities of the monitor, I hooked it up and Voila, easy peasy there was my image. Although I could dink with settings galore as if I was a professional videographer who knows what he's doing, I kept all the defaults since I fear fixing something that isn't broken.<br/><br/>Whew! No Fears!<br/><br/>Setting this monitor onto the platform tray of the teleprompter and securing it down was a breeze.<br/><br/>And the bright screen is clear as day through the 70/30 glass of the Glide Gear TMP-100.<br/><br/>Oh yes, indeed, I recommend this little guy, and I may even buy his bigger sibling model, just to get 'the bigger picture' when doing Zoom meetings using my TMP-100.

<span>This monitor does its job at a good price. If you need an external monitor for focus checking, or general viewing this works. It isn't perfect, but it does the job.<br/><br/>The picture isn't always color perfect, and it has issues with super bright sunlight, but it'll be better than any screen on the back or side of a camera.<br/><br/>There are a couple design flaws that this monitor inherits from whatever it's supposed to be a copy of, the battery compartment on the back can come off the contacts, while it's still "locked" in, and in general the battery adapter on the back worries me. Additionally it's pretty plasticy feeling all around, which is compensated for by the frames it ships with, but even with the frame on it feels like it costs, which isn't too bad considering the price, but don't expect it to compete with an Atomos display or something that's fully calibrated.</span>

I also was clearly visible in low light, as I rely on natural light from a window and sometimes cloud cover can dim me out pretty bad - so far this handles the low light change flawlessly. 5/5 for being 720p<br/><br/>Audio: I had a colleague rate the audio quality by switching back and forth between laptop (HP Elitebook) built in mic and the Logitech webcam mic - she said the Logi was louder, more clear, and less background noise. 5/5 sound quality<br/><br/>The ONLY con I can think of is that the camera lens has zero cover, it's always watching. I need a physical block over the sensor for peace of mind and have to find a solution here. Normal laptop camera covers don't fit this right because it would cast a shadow on the sensor since the opening is far bigger than a laptop's near pinhole-sized lens.<br/><br/>They should have built a very basic swinging cover for this!</span>

<span>My laptop is connected to a docking station and two monitors, so it's much easier to use an external camera than the laptop's camera. While I regularly make calls on my computer, I don't do too many video calls, so I didn't need a fancy camera. I'm pleased with the video quality, and the microphone works very well. I am now using the camera's microphone for all calls instead of the one in my laptop. My only complaint is that this camera has a narrow field of view, so I need to back away from it to properly frame myself. I think there is a widescreen mode, but my IT administrator blocks third-party software downloads, so I cannot install the Logitech software.</span>

<span>This review is for the â(Sceptre 20" 1600 x 900 75Hz LED Monitor 2X HDMI VGA Built-in Speakers, sRGB 99% Machine Black (E209W-16003RT Series) aka â20â 75Hz Wide Viewing Angleâ monitor.<br/>I got 2 of these for $115/ea. It was difficult to return them and go with two Samsung 1080p IPS 22â monitors instead. For some reason, the non-IPS screens (like these) have a hard time displaying an even black/gray screen. The pictures with the grayscale test have my very high-quality laptop monitor below them as a reference in each picture for what the black/gray screen SHOULD look like. The monitor is on the top of each picture and my laptop is below it. The laptop screen is mirrored on the Spectre monitor above it. These exhibit pretty bad âghosting.â To be fair, it is not as bad in real life as the camera makes the monitor look. But I still found it too distracting to work with. Because the screen is always darker at the top than the bottom (regardless of viewing angle), it can be difficult to see vertical scroll bars because it fades from normal at the top to washed-out at the bottom. Googling information can also be difficult because the color change of a site you have already been to on Google is more difficult to see at the bottom of the screen than at the top. It is also harder to work in Excel because the grid lines are not an even shade across the entire screen. It is not horrible like the HP V20 HD+ 19.5-inch monitor. But it is still not great. I found it too distracting to work with as a home office monitor. There should be 6 pictures showing the different shades of black/gray mirrored off my laptop onto the Spectre 20â monitor. The monitor in the picture also has a bad pixel a few inches from the top left corner that you can see in the darkest pictures as green. I personally do not take off points because my specific product/item has a flaw/defect. Even the best manufacturers have products that pass quality control. So I simply mention it and let readers decide for themselves if it is too common of a problem for them to decide not to purchase it. I only give bad reviews for âsystemic problemsâ that affect all of a product line like this. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>On the good side it does have some really nice features for the money. I will miss the dual HDMI ports and the speakers even though theyâre not very good. But this allows you to plug in a Roku stick and watch/listen to TV while working on the other monitor if you have two (see picture). I also personally liked the size better than the 22â Samsung 1080p monitors Iâm keeping. Two 22â monitors are a little big for my very small desk even when VESA mounted. The Spectre monitors are also VESA mountable which was another reason I purchased them. They come with screws that create a gap of about Â¾â between the monitor and a VESA mount (see picture). Iâm not exactly sure why they did this, but it does make it easier to access cables in the back and it was not an inconvenience for me. There are many different options for changing the brightness, tint, color, sharpness, etc. But unfortunately, because the screen is not even, if the top looks good the bottom looks bad and vice versa.<br/><br/>If you donât have much money and these are on sale for $120 or less, it might be a monitor worth considering. But the one I opened to try/test had a defective pixel so I had to return it anyways. And I never opened the 2nd one because I decided I just couldnât work with this monitor for most likely many years. The Samsungâs look fantastic straight out of the box without having to mess with screen adjustments. And I got them on sale from Amazon for $140/ea. For my needs, as a home office monitor(s), the Samsungâs are much better and worth the extra $25/ea. But the Samsung 22" IPS monitors are normally $165+/ea. It would have been a more difficult choice if I had to pay full price for the Samsungâs.</span>

<span>I cannot give a complete review because the box did not have HDMI cables for the application I purchased it for. I did read other reviews before buying. Some reviews said they got HDMI cables in the  box, others said they did not. I can confirm-YOU DO NOT GET HDMI CABLES WITH THIS MONITOR-BUY HDMI CABLES IF YOU NEED THEM. There, debate settled.<br/>  I will add to my review as I learn more. At this point based on how it was packaged, Iâll give it 4 stars tentativelyâ¦.. more to follow.</span>

<span>Writing a novel while suffering from migraine is enough of a struggle, without flickering screens.  This is amazingly better than the one it replaced.  My other computer is for internet or a movie; this one is for writing and editing (the most hours).  It was advertised as a gaming monitor.  Refresh rates are vital for any task involving screen time... even hunt &amp; peck typing.</span>

<span>I bought this Monitor Dec 13, 2015 and am still using it on my main daily computer and it's working great! It's sturdy.  I do play video games but not on PC so I don't know if this would be good for gaming?  It displays the little arcade type games I do play, very nicely.<br/>I've had no problems or issues with this Monitor &amp; am pleased with it</span>

<span>I am using this webcam in my home office for all these fun :( videoconferences.  It was easy to install with a good clear picture.  Now I will have to wash my hair more often because the resolution is so good.</span>

<span>All in all, the camera is a great value.  The pictures and comments say a privacy screen was included.  Although the packaging appeared original and unopened, the snap-on privacy cover was not included.</span>

<span>The camera part of this webcam seems to be fine, no complaints.  I wanted it in order to have a camera from a higher vantage point than my laptop camera, and it served that purpose.<br/>The microphone is not as good as I'd hoped, and so I'm returning it.  It was not muffled, exactly, but sounded like I was in a tunnel.  It did not seem to echo, and for someone without a different microphone, it is serviceable.  I had to speak up for it to play my voice back with a decent volume.  Also, I didn't expect this, although it may have been in the description, it didn't work as a speaker, I had to have return sound played through other speakers.  Tested with Teams and Zoom.</span>

<span>Iâve never had a problem with these. Great cameras. Handy privacy shield.<br/><br/>I donât particularly care for the microphone, but if I want a microphone Iâll use a headset or a dedicated, high quality mic.</span>
