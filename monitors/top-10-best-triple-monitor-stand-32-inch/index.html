Get your screens at the most comfortable viewing position to help reduce eye, neck, and shoulder strain. The counterbalanced gas-spring arms are the most adjustable mounts available and allow for easy and smooth movement in any direction, including height adjustment up and down, forward and back, monitor tilt, swivel, and rotation for ideal ergonomic alignment. This version is designed for monitors with up to 32" screens. It has a locking center mount and two fully adjustable gas spring arms for easy movement and adjustment of the left and right screens. The center screen is adjustable for height, tilt, and side angle. This version is best if locking one screen in the most optimal home position is desired for the center screen.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Pros:<br/>Easy enough to modify to work on the corner of a corner desk. Arms seem to be able to handle the weight of the monitors.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I have 3 27" monitors and it was/is a tight fit. There are very few positions I can place the monitors in that work. I was hoping for a bit more flexibility for placement with a $200 mount, but I pretty much have one configuration option. I assume this would work much better for smaller monitors.<br/>I wanted to configure my monitors to work in a single line (like shown in the photo), however, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to do that. If that is what you require, don't get this stand.<br/>I've been able to find a way to configure them so that I can work - center monitor raised slightly above the outer two - but a lot of people may not be able to tolerate that set up.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>As this stand is advertised as being able to hold 3 32 inch display's, it was a hack to get it to work. My center screen is the only screen I can put in landscape mode the side displays will not rotate into landscape mode as there isn't enough room. There's barely enough room for them to go into portrait mode, significantly limiting my adjustment options so much that I can't tilt any of my screens.<br/><br/>The center screen is as high as it goes, but the top edge isn't in line with the top edges of my side displays, I can't adjust this as the side displays are already touching the desk and cannot go any lower.<br/><br/>The overall build quality of this stand is quite nice and I'm sure it would be a really great stand if I were putting 26 inch displays on it. It's not big enough for more than 26 inch screens.</span>

<span>This is a very good product</span>

<span>I have a corner desk and got this. I knew I had space for the clamp, and it fits very snug. The adjustments do seem to work best if you can reach them from behind.<br/><br/>Assembly wasn't very difficult, and by default, all of my monitors made the arms sag down slowly. Adjusting the strength with the included wrench seems mandatory to match piston strength. Once this is done all adjustments work like you would expect.<br/><br/>I have 3 24inch monitors. They are 21.5 inches wide, and in a corner desk setup with a natural 3 monitor curve, they BARELY fit, I would say it's almost a minimum! This is best the side arms reach their distance limit. The advertised 32inch monitor max must only be for a setup where the center monitor is all the way back against the pole, or you use a 2 tiered setup with monitors on top.<br/><br/>This is still 5 stars for me, because when I upgrade to larger monitors, I will be drilling holes in my desk to use the included optional mount. It does look like you can mount this directly into a wall if you wish, but you will need your own screws from the looks of things.</span>

<span>If you are looking for a stand that will support dual 34" monitors (there just aren't any stands out there specifically for that), this will work! I have two Dell u3415w monitors (34" each). I was able to attach one to the left and right and then manipulate the stand until the two monitors were together (see photos below). My only complaint is that while my monitors each weigh well less than the weight specs on this stand, I still had to really crank down the screws to keep them in place. For that reason alone, I gave it 4 stars. I'd like to see this stand support the weight of heavy monitors just a little bit better but it does work.<br/><br/>I chose to use the option of drilling a small hole in my desk to use the clamp at the base of the stand to give it plenty of stability. Lastly, I placed my speakers below the monitors ONLY because I needed to place them someplace on the desk and I figured the extra support couldn't hurt. The monitors were holding position perfectly without that, but over time I might have needed to re-tighten them anyway so why not? :)<br/><br/>To all the naysayer "experts" who kept telling me this (and other similar triple monitor stands) wouldn't fit, do some math. A 34" monitor is only 32" wide and that places the center mounts at 16". So 2 x 16" = 32" and the width of the stand's span is 48". "That gives MORE than enough room to put two 34" monitors on a stand like this or on a similar triple monitor stand (remember, you don't have 68" of monitor inside the span of the stand. You only have 32" with the other 32" being on the OUTSIDE of the span. I have dyscalculia and even I was able to figure that math out :) I have seen others do this as well with other triple monitor stands.<br/><br/>Please note that my monitors are angled sharply (when viewed from the top-down pic) only because I prefer that viewing angle, not because of a space issue. I could have angled them wider but I find 68" of total monitor real estate to be far too wide to view without rotating my head like a sprinkler :)<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you have 34" monitors, you can use a stand like this for a dual monitor setup and this one is very reasonably priced.</span>

<span>This stand is much more solid than I expected and is very sturdy and high quality.<br/><br/>My only minor quibble is that the center monitor is slightly higher than the monitors on either side and I haven't been able to even them out, even after following the included instructions. It about 1/4 to a 1/2 inch difference but I can definitely live with it.<br/><br/>There is an option to use the metal stand or to bolt it directly to the desk. I opted to bolt mine to the desk and it works perfectly (though I did have to drill a hole into the desk, but my desk is quite old and cheap, so I didn't mind). I did try out the metal base with only one monitor attached and it seemed very solid. The base is very sold and heavy and seemed to me more than up to the task of holding up three monitors.<br/><br/>I left the swivel adjustments just loose enough to be able to move the monitors around, but not so loose that they will move on their own. This way I can tilt a monitor or two (or three!) to portrait if I am working with documents that could benefit from a longer vertical view. It takes 5 seconds to move a monitor to portrait and maybe 10 seconds to change the setting in Windows 7.<br/><br/>I'm very pleased with this purchase, especially for the very reasonable price and would definitely recommend it.</span>

<span>Very easy to assemble and holds up well once tension adjusted to match monitors.  My one gripe is that the nuts to adjust are hidden underneath caps with no obvious way to remove and not mentioned in the instructions.  It is easy enough to pry up the caps with a straight screwdriver.</span>

<span>Summary:<br/>If you are looking for a seamless clean look for 3 monitors, do not buy this. You will be wasting your time and money.<br/><br/>I have three 24" HP V242H monitors that I wanted lined up horizontally with a seamless look. Having worked with triple monitor setups over the last 15 years, one of the most important things is to get the proper viewing angle. When you are sitting 2-3 feet away, you do not want to swivel your head too far left or right to strain your neck. If you sit too far away, you will strain your eyes from reading. So it needs to be a perfect setup or you are just going to tire yourself out and be non productive.<br/><br/>First thing I noticed is that the base is absurdly humongous. On a regular desk, it takes up half the width! Not everyone wants to drill a hole in a desk to mount. By using this stand with its base, you effectively removed half of your desk space.<br/><br/>Second thing is that this stand breaks up at around 12-15 degrees at the curvature point. What happens is that the outer monitors push heavily on the outside edges of the middle monitor. At some point, it "breaks" and all three monitors cannot be angled anymore. This 12-15 degree angle offers very poor viewing perspective.<br/><br/>The only way I have been able to get these monitors inwards more to 20 degrees, is to continue to push the two outer monitors inwards and have their inside edges overlap the middle monitor. The disadvantage is that they don't line up well by "snapping" together to give that seamless look.<br/><br/>Another problem with this stand is that the manufacturer puts the caps on the areas when shipped, where they can be adjusted. Those caps are really hard to get off and look like part of the arm. I spent way too much time with monitors that kept falling forward and not being able to adjust them. Until I noticed that I can remove the caps and use the wrench, that problem went away. The manufacturer didn't show these locations in the manual and had the caps on by default - especially near the curvature points.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the center pole is too small diameter wise. It is not possible to feed three DVI-D and HDMI connectors through it. Also, the exit hole of those cables is too small. Try that with 3 DVI-D cables and it is impossible,<br/><br/>A better design would be deliver a product with arms that allowed up to 2-4" more in length and to let them slide in or out.</span>

<span>There was some reviews about the left or the right being uneven when you line up the monitors. Its true. But after being frustrated trying to get it to even I stopped and took a breather.

<span>I was a little worried about the bad reviews, but this desk mount turned out to be absolutely fantastic! It's super sturdy and has no trouble with my LG 4K 32" monitor that's pretty hefty. It's very easy to assemble and comes with all the hardware you need to attach your VESA 100x100 monitor (or 75x75).<br/>The VESA bracket simply slides onto the end of the arm and is secured by a solid thumbscrew.<br/><br/>The arm comes with the two sizes of Allen wrenches needed and they can be stored on the cable holder that clips on the vertical rod. You need to use the large one to adjust the tension in a couple of joints to match the weight of your monitor, so that it stays where you want it.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this monitor arm. It frees up a lot of space on my desk, allows me to adjust my monitor perfectly so that it's at the right height and distance from my face, it's super sturdy, and I was able to install it in under 10 minutes -- and the price is ridiculously low for such a well made product.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.</span>

<span>This is far from the ideal table mount for ultrawide monitors, but it is somewhat serviceable if you can live with some flaws. Please take some time to look at the screenshots I posted for an idea of how you would want your setup to look like.<br/><br/>1. With my monitor flushed back toward the wall as I possibly can, there is still a 8.75 inch distance from the wall to the monitor's screen (not back of the monitor's housing).<br/><br/>2. I have it so that I cannot see the "arm" attached to the pole because it would have been an eye sore to see both the pole and articulation arm. That's the reason why I have it at 5.75 inch from top of the desk to the bottom of the monitor.<br/><br/>3. The clamp method is solid, granted you have support metal framework or a sturdy wood framework that will allow the clamp to station itself properly. I have it just tight enough where I can't twist it any further without causing damage to my desk. It seems sturdy. The weight of my monitor is 18.7 pounds and it is an ultrawide monitor found here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XFXX5JH/?coliid=I18UWY3B4ZBTSR&amp;colid=3NQEL5RPRFI67&amp;psc=0&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br/><br/>4. The points of articulation are good, but they do not execute well. Tightening and loosening each articulation point requires a tool (provided), which feels archaic. The gas spring is a nice touch, but I had to find the perfect sweet spot where the arm and articulation point held firmly after using the tool and winding it up several times to get it right without it falling and slamming my monitor against my desk. This isn't necessarily the fault of the articulation points, but just the technology seems dated.<br/><br/>5. Range of motion has good options because of the multiple articulation points, but it feels stiff. Changing each articulation feels rusty. I understand that it shouldn't feel too "oiled up" because it won't have that sturdy feel. It does feel like a trade-off.<br/><br/>6. I went in expecting to get a fully articulated mount for different viewing purposes, but I think I ended up with a table mount that can only stay in one place or else the composition of my desktop setup looks imbalanced. As you will see in the images, the pole is mounted off-center so that I can have my ultrawide monitor centered properly. Because of the arm and how it articulates, there is no other way around it. You will understand this better if you do decide to purchase this mount.<br/><br/>7. For my first time installing a monitor table mount, it was overall an easy-to-moderate experience. There were steps in the installation that were frustrating, but I think that had to do more with how I wanted my setup to look like without compromise.<br/><br/>8. Because of the 8.75 inch distance from wall to monitor screen, the monitor feels to close for my viewing preference. The difference between this table mount and the original monitor mount is, 8.75 inch from wall and 6.75 inch from wall (original mount). The two inches makes a difference when it comes to desktop real estate.<br/><br/>If you plan to having it flushed against the wall, especially completely, this isn't the mount for you. If you want smooth and seamless articulation and range of motion, you may need to look elsewhere. Perhaps the Amazon Basics mount or the Ergotron LX. They are both in the $100+ range so I understand those mounts may not be ideal. But I'm an idealist when it comes to my PC gaming and desk setup so I will most likely look at a few other options.<br/><br/>9. VESA mount was easy to install. Even my monitor supports VESA 100x100. Most monitors do, so please check out your monitor and remove its original stand to measure it for yourself. Do not always trust the manufacturer's customer service because LG told me that my monitor is NOT VESA mount compatible. It's 70x70 and 100x100 VESA mount compatible.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:  I may or may not keep this mount. Perhaps, I need something simpler. Maybe just a pole and VESA adapter mount. I don't think I care so much for the arm and articulation because I found it too much of a hassle to center my monitor. Not to mention, not being able to have my monitor more closer to the wall was probably the deal-breaker for me. A couple of more inches back and I would have been pretty satisfied.<br/><br/>To understand more of what I tried to articulate, but done so poorly (haha), please check out the images below. The measurements I listed above are true. It may not look like it in the images, but I measured it.<br/><br/>I was not paid to write this review. My opinion is my own. I only hope to help others find good products and hopefully make their lives a little better. I hope my review was helpful.<br/><br/>Update: I ended up returning it because the gas spring was not working properly as it should. No matter how much I set it to keep the weight of my monitor up, it would droop and slam my monitor to the desk. It was working just fine for almost two days and then it malfunctioned.<br/><br/>As an alternative, I purchased WALI's other mount without the arm. I am able to flush my monitor further back (almost 3 inches further back than than this mount), and I'm very satisfied with it.

<span>I used these to attach my 3 monitors to my standing/sitting desk.. you know the kind that raises and lowers?  they are easy to use, and very sturdy.  Came out of the box with all the hinges VERY stiff so I loosened the bolts at all of the pivot points.  Nice cord keepers and plenty of range of motion for me to get my setup like I wanted.  However, I wish there were maybe a couple of choices in the box for the length of the clamp bolt. It is so long that it hit my wood desk when lowering the standing desk keeping me from bringing it all the way down.  I ended up removing the bolt and cutting off the end, but if you don't have the tools for that keep in mind that when clamped underneath a standing desk (about 3/4" thick) the handle on the clamp bolt is 4.5" below the surface.</span>

<span>Just got mine and assembled it this morning. Seems very solidly built and I'm pleased with the quality. The instructions were only OK and the parts  and diagrams were too small for my liking.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, there is a longer "central" arm that your center monitor mounts to, and at either end, attaches to smaller "swing" arms which are where your left and right monitors go. There is an intentional design aspect where these arms can be angled so the left and right arms are moved to be angled towards you, which means the left and right monitors will also be angled that way.<br/><br/>These arms do NOT angle enough though, and the three monitor setup I have is now too flat, instead of the left\right being angled more towards my head. A side effect of this is that it makes this a not awesome setup for a corner cube desk as you cannot get the whole unit very far back into the corner, which was not a problem at all when I had my three monitors on individual stands.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is a good quality mount, well built, with some good features. The arms are sturdy and hold your three monitors well.  The outside arms are angled upward slightly to even further reduce the possibility of sagging over time.  However, that puts your middle and outside monitors at different levels sometimes, depending on what monitors your using and where the VESA mounts are on them.  We typically have a large middle monitor and two smaller outside monitors, and I've have occasions where that angle on the arms meant that the two outside monitors could not line up with the top or the bottom of the middle monitor and it looked odd.  The outside arms have tabs on the hinges that limit the swig distance, so the amount of adjustment you can have by rotating the arm isn't as much as it could be.  Also, the design of the spin/tilt/swing adjustment on each monitor is such that tightening that down is impossible once the monitor is mounted to the VESA mount plate.  The base on this stand is very heavy, which makes for a very solid stand that doesn't fall over, but if used in conjunction with a manually lifted sit-stand converter (like we do) it makes it more difficult to lift the desk into the standing position.  would also be very nice if they would add an optional grommet mount to the product, so you could choose to not have all that added weight from the base if you didn't want it.</span>

<span>I start with the cons.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- You can't adjust the tension on the swivel point that is just behind the monitor. It is very lose, and the simple weight of a cord can start pulling the monitor down to one side. This seems like a major MAJOR flaw to me. If it weren't for the Pros, I would have rated it a three star, but wow, does it ever go above and beyond in the pros.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Says it can hold 17 pounds. I was sure my bigger monitor was under 17 pounds. I ordered the arms for my two monitors. My smaller monitor is  maybe 7 pounds. But my bigger one... I realized is 22 pounds! Well, I figured it's an old monitor, maybe I would just keep both monitor arms, but only use one until I got a lighter monitor.<br/><br/>I went ahead and tried sticking the 22 pound monitor on the arm anyway, and tightened it to see what would happen. It holds it! Rated for 17, holds 22.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary, but these monitor arms shocked me with how much weight they can really hold.<br/><br/>- They are very adjustable, and easily adjustable.<br/><br/>- They are lighter than I expected, despite all that they hold.<br/><br/>- They just look nice. They are visually just about the most pleasing monitor arms on the market.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out a solution for how it slants so easily, but frankly, since they perform so well in all other aspects, there's no way I'm looking to an alternative. I just wish SIIG would have made that one last element adjustable too. (Seems considering that everything else on them seems to be.)</span>

<span>It's pretty rare that I rate something this high but this monitor stand was VERY well thought out in almost every aspect, but the best feature that comes to mind is that you install part of the mount onto the back of your monitor and then it slides/drops into place on the stand.<br/>My only suggestion/request to the maker would be to make the slide mounts on the stand "track" driven with a screw (yes it would make it more of a pain to initially set, but would make micro adjustments MUCH easier once the monitors are on it) and increase the hinge adjustment to more than 25 degrees.<br/>Love these things (I own two) and would highly recommend them!</span>

<span>Couldn’t stand the OEM stands that my 24” HP monitors came with so I gave these a try. To be honest my buddy had already purchased it for his setup so I know it’s durable. My question was going to be how easy is it to mount everything. It was easy. Really easy. I had the monitors mounted and back up and running in 15 minutes. The directions were easy to follow and everything was included in the kit. Just a little fine tuning to get the height and angles just right. I’m pretty happy with the setup. My desk looks a lot less cluttered.</span>

<span>For what you pay, this monitor stand is amazing.  It has great range of motion, it's easy to use, and it is exactly what I wanted.  The only negative I can think of is that the portion of the base that goes underneath whatever you clamp it to, is on the small size.  You can turn it to be either vertically or horizontally aligned which helps but thinner or softer materials (think particle board) could potentially wear out and cause a tear out.  I personally solved this with a 1/4" piece of plywood about 4 inches square.  I recommend this monitor stand.</span>

<span>I use the mount on my Fully desk and two SAMSUNG 23.5” CF396 Curved Computer Monitors. The arms have never let me down, in terms of holding the monitors in the position I desire.<br/><br/>Where this product falls short is where it's too short. I have used 3 different laptops with my setup, and each have blocked the bottom of the monitors with the top of the screens. I'm also 6'2" and find that the limited height of the center support is just 4-5" too short for proper head and neck positioning. If the arms were able to pivot vertically and raise the height of the monitors just a bit, I would be much happier with the product.</span>
