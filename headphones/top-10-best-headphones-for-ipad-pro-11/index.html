<span>I just got the earphones and haven’t had time to try them. When I opened the package, I thought they looked big. The only way I can fit them in my ears is to push pretty hard. That’s not comfortable. I didn’t see any extra tips in the pkg. I’ll try some I already have and if that doesn’t help, I’ll give them away.<br/>I finally gave these to my son. He said the sound is good but not great. I guess that’s expected when they’re inexpensive.</span>

<span>My 14 year old daughter wanted these and I asked her if she liked them and she said she loves them. She doesn’t have to wait for them to charge lol. She asked me weeks ago to buy these but when she said “Apple EarPods” I was expecting it to be in the hundreds so I kept telling her when I have extra money. Well that day came and we sat together and when I saw the price was not even $20 I told her I would have got these for you weeks ago if you would have told me they were cheap.

<span>I wanted to write a review that was as non biased as possible. I own a pair of AirPods Pro’s. I bought these beats for my job, where it can be it very loud. I didn’t want to run the risk of losing my AirPods. I saw the beats were on sale.<br/><br/>I like them a lot, for it to be a cheaper alternative for AirPod pros. The noise cancellation isn’t as good as the AirPod pros. In my opinion it’s not that much of a difference between the two. It’s noticeable difference but not an inconvenience either.<br/><br/>With either ANC or Transparency mood is on. The beats sacrifice some of the audio performance for either one. Sounds the same in either mood. When you turn noise control off, the bass, treble, and etc are amplified. For the AirPod pros it’s the complete opposite from the beats in terms of noise control. The bass is amplified in ANC or transparency mood; and sacrifices the audio performance with noise control off. Make sure to figure out what ear tips fit best in your ear to get the best quality.<br/><br/>To me they’re worth 89-110 dollars, I wouldn’t pay anything over it. Especially not at 150, but it’s a great quality for that price range I set if you can find it on sale. Whereas I’d pay full price for the Pros, and did.<br/><br/>All in all they’re a good quality pair of ear buds to get the job done. They’re a good cheaper alternative to AirPod pros. Would still serve as a great gift or to satisfy the average everydays needs.</span>

<span>I bought these after initially buying and returning the ‘beats pro fit’ which advertised basically everything these do with the addition of the silicon piece to better secure the earbuds in your ear.<br/><br/>I returned those because that piece made them uncomfortable to wear for more than half an hour or so but their sound quality and especially their noise cancellation were phenomenal—they sounded a bit better than these do. Not by an extremely large margin but especially in regards to the active noise cancellation, the Pro Fit did it better and I’m not sure why since they’re nearly the same product but perhaps they have more differences internally than I realized.<br/><br/>I’m tempted to return these and re-order the Pro Fit and just trying to find a way to make them tolerable to wear because I miss the level of noise cancellation they achieved.<br/><br/>Alas, these are still great earbuds and I’ll need more time with them to make the decision of whether or not to keep them. From only a day’s use I can say that they’re far more comfortable to wear for extended periods and the charging case they come with is of better quality than that of the Pro Fit’s (which isn’t saying too much to be fair).<br/><br/>I’ll update this after I’ve had a chance to use them at the gym a few times.</span>

<span>The sound quality of these ear buds is excellent, as with other Beats products the bass response is superb, which is lacking in the AirPods, IMO. Understandably, it's difficult to pack a lot of bass amplification into a tiny set of wireless ear buds, but Beats managed to do so. They also work with my iPhone 12 Pro Max as seamlessly as the AirPods.<br/><br/>The fit is nice and they stay in my ears better than AirPods; however, I do NOT like the physical buttons being directly on the outside of the buds, opposite your ear canals. I often have to adjust my ear buds and push them back in my eyes to optimize sound because they tend to move around, and this pauses the sound every time - SUPER annoying and dated design flaw. Also, the noise cancellation is pretty lame - not nearly as good as the AirPod Pros. I can hardly tell the difference with it on/off. Lastly, I'm not a fan of the lack of magnetic charging - it is USB-C only. As much as I would love for everything to switch to USB-C, Apple seemingly refuses to let go of their Lightning port, so I still have mostly Lightning cables and thus it would be nice to have magnetic charging instead of just USB-C.<br/><br/>All in all, this a great product at a good price, but if noise cancellation is important to you, you might want to spend the extra $ on the AirPod Pros.</span>

<span>O.K. I never thought I'd own a pair of beats earbuds, bud I do. And I have to stay, they're not bad. There's a (alright, there's a few) caveats, but not enough for me to return them. The build is the typically spun hardened plastic, of a oddly shaped buds that interestingly fit near perfectly. The buds are tiny, compared to many other brands. As mentioned they're oddly shaped, by two (also an oval shaped flat surfaced which is used to control the buds) angular sides and a round ball in front, where the canal protrudes that you attach your tips. The fit isn't bad, and once sealed it doesn't move around, or fall out whilst doing certain activities. I use XL sized silicone tips. I find they work best for me, for almost every bud I've owned or tested over the years.<br/><br/>If the fit is too short, you can always use double, or even triple flange tips. Which I use on occasion. Depends on the buds I'm fitting in question. That extra length can help get the seal you need for the most optimal sound reproduction.  Throughout this year I have tried a plethora of buds. From Sony's XM3, to Audio Technica CKS5TW And Nuarl (I plan to get them again, when funds permit) N6Pro's , which I actually (they have a really good sound, rich luscious bass, sweet and engaging mids, and to top it off, a sparkling treble, not over the top, mind you) liked, but the buttons were a little finicky. As to why I returned them.<br/>The biggest, most prevalent issue I came across was that most of them didn't fit properly, at all. I could barely get the XM3's in, and keep them in. As with Shures Aionic, another I liked and wanted desperately<br/>them to work out. Because they sounded great. The Studio buds are not a problem. It takes me seconds to insert and position them in my ears. The only (again, there's more than one) detraction I have, is that the  buds are easy activate whilst attempting to insert them into your ears. For me it's not a deal breaker. Oh, I almost forgot an important issue. And that is with the battery life. They average a minimum three plus hours. Which is not that long. Then again, who spends more than three hours listening to stuff ? Well, I do. These are for nighttime use mostly. I use them when my roomy has gone to bed. So I need to get an average fours plus. One night I got close to 5 hours. Guess it depends on usage.  What else can I say, other to try for yourself. . At the least, you can return them if you're not happy, right. I'm using them now, as I do at nights.<br/><br/>I'm going to buy the Philips Fidelio T1's. I bought and had to return for a replacement. But the delivery person did not deliver them, when they came. Why, I don't.. But I became infuriated and cancelled the order. to buy at a later date. I loved the sound. They have a hybrid configuration of a DD and a BA. For those who don't know the abbreviations, it's dynamic driver, and balanced amature drivers. That's , cause sound is impressive. And the price on them now, is 155$ A drop of a 100$ A good deal to me, for a worthy set of buds. all I'm gonna say for now. But I am going to acquire them I'll be editing removing any errors. But for now, enjoy. Hope it can help you decide</span>

<span>I'm impressed by these headphones, but at that price, I would have to be. I normally like wired headphones because they are just more reliable - no charge level to worry about, if they fall out, they're still connected, etc., but there are some things that wires become a problem for. So I thought I'd try the wireless ear buds.<br/><br/>1. Comfort 5/5. These are as good a fit as the wired Apple ear buds. I *hate* those little silicon inserts that the pro earbuds use and nearly all Android earbuds use as well. These are shaped hard plastic that fit snugly in the outside of my ear without making me feel like I have ear wax clogging my ear canal.<br/><br/>2. Sound 4/5. I generally listen to audiobooks and phone calls, not music. (For music, I prefer full room sounds, not something so close to my ear.) These earbuds are adequate for that.<br/><br/>3. Microphone 3/5. I wouldn't think the mic is a problem - phone calls are always fine with it, but for some reason I can't get the mic to work with Duolingo (a foreign language app that has some spoken tests)<br/><br/>4. Technology 4/5. Cool things about these earbuds:<br/>  * they detect when they're in your ear. You can set them to resume playing when you put them in and they can pause when you take them out. 5/5<br/>  * double-tap the earbud for different actions. I like using it to pause and resume. I wish I could configure the skip back to be 15 seconds rather than the whole song/chapter 4/5<br/>  * the case is also the charging device. You can charge the case itself up, but whenever you put the earbuds away, they charge back up from the battery stored in their case. It's very convenient! 5/5<br/><br/>5 Improvements. I wish these were a bit more configurable, and not so focused on music listening, but also supporting audiobook listening.<br/>  * I would like to configure the skip ahead/skip back to be a number of seconds (this could also be handled by Audible if it would introduce an auto-skip back of 5 seconds whenever you are interrupted, but that's a different complaint).<br/>  * I wish I could control the volume using the earbuds. I'm not sure how, but since they're touch-sensitive, maybe they would be able to track my finger sliding up and down along the earbud? Anyway, the only way to control volume is using your phone.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm happy with these. I got them new with a discount on Amazon, which means no free custom engraving from Apple, but I don't really care about that, so the $50 savings was better. These are very expensive and I don't think I would recommend them unless you have some money saved up for an extravagant purchase, but if you do get them, I think they're satisfactory.</span>

<span>Update:  So I still love these earbuds but they have a place.  Since I started using these I’ve bought the AirPods Pro too and because of that and the use of Jabra Elite 65T Active I’ve decided these have their own place.  So I live in an area with all 4 seasons.  So I run outside in the cold along with when it is warm.  Despite the fact that these are not rated as water or sweet resistant at all I decided to go ahead and try them.  For me these stay put really good in my ear (for running and normal use). They will not work well for functional training and will probably fall out.  Their sound quality compared to the Jabra and even better the AirPods Pro are much more flat.  Not much base at all in these.  So the place I’ve decided to place these in my life.  If I’m in an atmosphere where I want to hear what is going on around me I still prefer these over the AirPods Pro which have the “transparency mode”.  Also as I’m running outside I love the transparency mode on the AirPods Pro (AirPods Pro put their “hear through” feature on the Jabra Elite 65 T to shame).  But that being said if I’m wearing a winter hat you can hear the hat rubbing on the mics on the AirPods Pro.  You don’t get that with these.  So I’ll wear these while wearing a hat when running during colder weather and I’m still able to hear my surroundings without any distortion.  So for pairing, once paired these things are amazing.  I can walk around my entire house and not have any drops.  Now, Apple’s claim to fame is Airplay and the ability for you AirPods to switch seamlessly between Apple devices.  Well it doesn’t really work as seamless as they would like or we would like.  There are many times where I will switch to my Apple Watch to stream music to my AirPods and only one of the AirPods connect.  And something that has happened maybe twice they were not even recognizable.  The fix always seems to be just putting them back in the case, closing the lid, waiting a second or two and then it works.  It is just weird because there seems to be no reason to this problem.  It is completely random to even which single AirPod it connects to.  I haven’t removed a star for this fact because although annoying at times it still is a simple fix and a solid connection once they connect.  I hope this update helps.<br/><br/>I have had way to many wireless earbuds during my time on this Earth. These have become my all-time favorite all-day buds. Great sound quality and by far the most comfortable. I've worn them almost all day for the last 2 days to put them through their paces. No ear fatigue and great battery life. Also charges quickly in the case. The only thing I wish was they were at least "water resistant". Because of that these will not be my running we arbuds. In that case my go to will still be the Jabra 65t Elite Active. They have slightly better sound quality because of the adjustable EQ and awesome water resitance. Their drawback is because of their snug fit they really aren't comfortable for all day wear. Either way these buds and the Jabra are the best I've ever used. I hope this helps.</span>

<span>I am one of those people that the Apple AirPods fit perfectly. I have tried just about every brand (wired and wireless), but other than the beats pro, nothing else compares.  This may seem silly to some, but the thing I like most about the Wireless case is having the status light on the outside just below the lid.  I have, and sometimes do use a QI charger and it works a treat, if you have the patience to position them. The AirPods fit nicely in your pocket, but the truth is I just love the status light being on the outside of the case and not put wear and tear on the lid hinge.</span>

<span>Got them at the end of april, used daily and sometimes at night, they worked great,  unfortunately today i lost the sound in the left side.  It seems to be down at the plug not near the earphones.  Im not sure i want another pair, seems expensive for three months, but then, i used them pretty heavily.</span>

<span>I purchased the purple based on the photo - they look nothing alike as you can see. Look much cheaper. The ear bud is a shiny purple instead of matte. The volume control doesn’t have the markings shown in the picture either - just indents. The ear buds are very heavy. If you have small ears these will hurt you and fall out easily.</span>

<span>I liked the product when both sides of the earbuds were working! Nothing wrong with it at all except that it stopped functioning on the right side after about a month. It still works fine on the left side. I have no other complaints and wish that it kept working on both sides. I like to listen to audiobooks at night on my iPhone was perfect for that, And the earbuds did not bother my ears they were pretty comfortable. So buy this but maybe by two at a time. My fear now is that the second earbud will stop working. That’s the only reason I gave it only four stars. Oh and it’s a really pretty shade of pastel green! I would return them except it’s a hassle to do so and I am 70 years old. Returning things is not my thing.</span>

<span>I upgraded to these from my Airpod Pros. My left Airpod was cutting in and out, and sometimes turning off completely, so I donated them to my husband. I often had difficulty with the Airpods staying in my ears, no matter which set of adaptors I used. I'm happy to say I finally found a good pair in the Powerbeats that not only sound great, but fit perfectly in my ears. And, I've tried other earbuds prior including Bose and Samsung. I didn't have good luck with them staying put. But, these do! The ear wrap-around feature seals the deal.</span>

<span>Quality of sound is really good, it’s very comfortable, it worth! Cause is not too big how I imagined! The only three things I can complain is about there is no noise cancellation as AirPods Pro, the volume is not loud as airpods and if you’re listening any song, if you change the tab, the sound fails for a few seconds!  it's pretty annoying! if AirPods had a way to hold them in the ears, it would be the perfect and ideal earphone!  much better than powerbeats!</span>

<span>These are really amazing wireless earbuds. I'm gonna do pros and cons along with some other thoughts about this product. This review is written 4 months after using this product.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Battery life. The battery life is amazing. I never had these die on me except when I play video games all night. They also have fast charging which is very useful if you need to charge them real quick.<br/>2. Fit. The fit is really perfect. They feel comfortable and they stay in my ears perfectly. I exercise a lot and these earbuds always stay in my ears when I'm at the gym and when I'm running. If you are looking for some workout earbuds, then these will give you reliable and beautiful performance.<br/>3. Sound quality. The sound quality is amazing. Nice, clear and crisp.<br/>4. The Apple features. The extra features that the Powerbeats have when using with apple devices are nice but don't let those features discourage you android users from buying the Powerbeats. The features aren't important enough for you to decide not to buy them (Not gonna list out the features in order to make this review shorter)<br/>5. Range. The range is amazing. I can be listening to music on my phone and leave my phone in my room and walk anywhere in the house and still be able to listen to the music. The music starts cutting out depending on the amount of objects blocking the signal.<br/>6. Ability to wear with glasses. I can wear these with my glasses with no problem at all. I can take my glasses on and off and have no trouble.<br/>7. Good microphone. I use these earbuds for phone calls and video calls and the person can hear me pretty good. I can hear them perfectly fine. My brother tells me that I sound muffled but he can still hear me good.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. Pain. After wearing them for a couple of hours, I start to feel slight discomfort. This only happens after many hours so it isn't something i'm complaining about. Just felt like I should mention it so everyone is aware. The pain that is the problem is the major pain that comes after weeks of regular use. I'm not sure what is happening but it's like the Powerbeats is making the skin inside my ear peel off. I think this is happening because they are too tight in my ears. This has happened I believe 3 times and the goes away after I left my ears heal. As i'm writing this review, I am experiencing the major pain and I adjusted the left earhook so it's not as tight in my ear as before (Problem is currently only in my left ear). I'm not sure if I'm the only one who experiences this but if you can deal with this then don't let that discourage you from buying the Powerbeats (It isn't that big of a problem for me).<br/>2. Bluetooth connection on Windows 10 computers. I'm not sure if this also happens on other versions of Windows and android devices but sometimes there would randomly be a 1-2 second cut in the sound about every two minutes. This doesn't happen at all on my iPhone. I would also experience random disconnections on my laptop. Another thing about the connection is that it is weaker on my laptop than on my phone. Not sure why.<br/>3. Bulky case. This doesn't matter to me at all because I usually have a bag that I carry with me when I go to places that I can slip the case into. I'm just mentioning it so people can be aware. You can put it in your pocket if you want but it will look weird because there will be a giant bulge in your pants.<br/><br/>That's it about the pros and cons. Now it's time to talk about the problems I had with the Powerbeats. I'm having flashbacks of the problems I encountered while typing this part of the review. Problem 1. This only happened once but I will still talk about it. I was connecting the Powerbeats to my iPhone and forgetting them in the bluetooth settings because I was enjoying the animation that pops up when you pair them with your iPhone. Then all of a sudden they would not pair again. Man I thought they were already broken and it was the day I got them. I thought my $200 dollars went down the drain. But luckily I managed to get them to pair again after a long time of research and trying different things. What fixed the problem was charging the case because apparently since it was at I believe 30 something percent, it couldn't pair. Problem 2. This was the worst problem. I've had this problem happen twice in the last month and a half. One of the earbuds would not pair and sound would only come out of the earbud that was paired. I had to switch back to my other pair of wireless earbuds that I previously had until I figured out how to solve this problem. It took days of extensive research and multiple solution attempts before I finally managed to fix the problem. I was about to return them but luckily I solved the problem before I did.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Despite the cons and problems I encountered, I would still recommend these earbuds to anyone. If you encounter any of the problems I did, I hope you can easily solve them and if you don't, you can reply to my comment and ask me for my solution. Hopefully Amazon has a feature where you get notifications when someone replies to your review. If you read this whole thing, thank you and I appreciate it. If you didn't then thanks for taking a look at it.<br/>Update: I no longer experience the major pain in my ears and the skin peeling off after I adjusted the earhooks to get the right fit (Update written on 8/18/21).</span>

<span>At first I was a little disappointed that these headphones volume wasn’t as loud as I had wanted. After using them at the gym today I am thoroughly impressed! Best purchase I’ve made for headphones ever. The sound quality is amazing and these are perfect for the gym. I didn’t like my AirPod pros for the gym due to them falling out of my ears. I saw quite a few reviews on these headphones not being well-made, but quite the opposite. There is just enough weight to keep them on your head, but to also know they are great quality.</span>

<span>I love these headphones. I was a little worried about them based on reviews saying they are too tight. I have multiple piercings per ear and was worried it would irritate them with too much pressure. But the size of the headphones is perfect, the ears are the perfect size to sit in front of my piercings with no irritation. They are somewhat tight but not in a bad way. I bought these for working out so I wanted them to be a little snug and stay on with movement</span>

<span>Good quality headphones. Don’t know why I can rate battery life when they are wired headphones. But ya as long as their plugged in. Battery life is good XD. Only complaint is that you can’t buy these headphones without the mic. I have no need for the mic in these headphones as they are just for audio… and the mic is the highest failure point on them. So wish I could buy a set without. But they’ll do. Much better than the cheap knock off pairs that look the same, but are half price. I threw those away after a day being as they broke immediately.

<span>If you are too lazy to read my essay then I will give a quick rundown:<br/><br/>REAL Product - They are real apple earbuds, durable and people are lying<br/>Fit / Comfort - They will fit small ears amazingly and feel like nothing is there, big ears not so much<br/>Sound - Low end and mid is great. Nothing special, high end slightly lacking but its barely noticable<br/>Durability - Lasted me for 1.5 years so far, tough and will survive water (swimming, washing machine)<br/>Damage - None. They were perfect and still are right out the box<br/>Mic - Dont get for a mic. Its in the speakers themselves and are too quiet, but they are in 2 channels ig<br/>Tangling - They do get tangled but they are easy to untangle<br/>Overall - 9.5/10, get if you have small or average ears, they feel like nothing is in your ear<br/><br/>FULL DETAILED REVIEW:<br/>Im writing this to discourage the negative reviews that I see way too much about these things. They are REAL apple made products. They did not come used, broken, or anything. I bought these as I wanted some actual good earbuds that would last. I have used the samsung ones for about 2 years when I broke them, so I tried apple. I found some laying around in school (ik its gross) washed em, and they worked great. Sound quality is actually very good for earbuds, however I havent used any super expensive headphones that would blow me away and make these sound terrible in comparison. The low end or "bass" is very important to me and thankfully it is pretty loud, nothing outstanding or anything though. The High end is kindof lacking but not much, still sounds great. Mid sound is loudest, not overwhelming though, pretty good. Anyway, I lost those, so I ordered them, on Amazon. They came early, unused, undamaged, and they sound great. No complaints and they have lasted me for nearly a year. Now an issue you might have with these buds if at all are 2 things: Fit and Comfort. These will not fit everybody's ears, escpecially big ones. However, they fit in mine perfectly and within a minute I forget I even have anything in my ear, but thats just me. 2 is comfort, which some people have issues with. I think these are incredibly comfortable with the non-silicon tips. They dont hurt, but maybe thats just me. I hate the silicon tips, but some people dont. Either way, you can get used to them. Other things to mention; you can drown these in water or leave them in the wash accidentally and they will work fine. As long as their not in deep water for like over an hour, they should still work. also, Tangling is not a big problem with these. They definetly do get tangled, but they are very easy to ungtangle unlike other buds. Lastly, Microphone. I would not recomment these if you need them to have a good mic. I was surprised to test these and find out the Volume controller that has a mic label on it isnt actually a mic, the phones themselves are. And they are weird. They are wayyyyy too quiet and each but has its own channel, so you can talk into say the left bud and whoever is recieving your mic signal will hear only out the left headphone. You also have to have it so close to your mouth that you are pretty much making out with it. Besides that, they are amazing. Some people with love them, others will hate. If you have small ears, I recomment these. They come in a nice little box too. They will feel like nothing is there. 9.5/10 earbuds in my opinion. Best earbuds I have ever used. GET THEM</span>

<span>Sound quality is good enough for me. Bass is good. Overall sound quality is really full. I've bought Apple ear buds for years. They obviously work well with my iPod Nano, but in recent months, they also work perfectly with my Android phone. They're not as good as higher end ear buds when it comes to noise cancellation, but they're really quality for their price. They're comfortable, too. I used to wear them for ten hour shifts at work.</span>

<span>This is a great kit to keep earbuds and AirPods clean. The alcohol pads aren’t very saturated but I have isopropyl around the house so it’s not an issue for me. I keep the kit on hand and clean my AirPods every few days. Great product!!!!</span>

<span>I was a little overwhelmed by the number of options available on Amazon for AirPod cleaners… took a chance on this one and it was a winner. Easy to use and did the job. I was skeptical of the fountain pen-looking tool because I was worried it might cause damage but it ended up being very useful and safe. I didn’t need the blue sticky squares because all the other tools were enough to leave my AirPods spick and span. I like the pouch that they come in.</span>

<span>I got this since I noticed my AirPods were looking a little worse for wear. I tried it the moment I got it and the ease of use was amazing. Cleaned out my AirPods so fast and now the quality of sound has been awesome.</span>
