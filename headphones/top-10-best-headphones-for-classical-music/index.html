<span>I know now why all the hype for beats headphones.  Sound quality is amazing.  My only wish is that the ear “muff” part was a big larger for my big ears.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This pair of beats doesn’t have noise canceling. I have a second pair of ones with noise canceling. These have very good sound. They work great for listening to audiobooks and iTunes or watching movies. They Charge fast and they last long. Great Bluetooth! They fit on the ears and are comfy, but if you wear them for a long time can make your ears tired. They have micro usb which I had hoped for a newer charger. Overall I really enjoy these headphones.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I used Bluetooth and set the Beats Headset up to my Switch OLED and it worked right out of the box.  Easy setup and crystal clear sound/base and volume seem to be just right.  They fit snug.  Headset may start getting annoying after a couple of hours of ware but that’s okay as long as u take a 10-20 minute break or so to rest your outer ear.  Comes with a decent carrying case and all the cords needed to charge.  I paid $130 New and I feel they are worth every penny.  Thanks!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I use these at the gym and they work very well, they stay on my head even when i sweat, only thing is if ur hair is down it will get caught and occasionally hurts. I recommend these 10/10 love them.</span>

<span>The noise cancellation is okay haven’t tested it out much. The noise leak is also okay as well I tested it out on my MacBook and when it’s turned up fully you can hear the sound leaking a little not enough to really make out everything but down to a normal level I think it’s good. They get really loud if your using them to listen to normal music. I mainly got these for my music tech classes and for my guitar while I’m at school they sound a bit weird sometimes with my guitar but that could be for other reasons like my amp and the settings but they do what they’re intended to and so far I think they’re pretty good for the price these are my first studio headphones though I will say.</span>

<span>I’m in college and this is a really good set of headphones if you’re not sufficient in funds. Definitely not top studio quality, but still the best pair of headphones I’ve ever had. Price is definitely worth it.</span>

<span>So I got these yesterday, and I know I am not going to keep them for long (more on that later) so I want to get this review in ASAP. First off, while I know what I like &amp; I can recognize quality, I am definitely NOT an audiophile, so I'm not going to try &amp; tell you in TECHNICAL terms why these headphones are so great, but I can give a layman's perspective. Also, I am going to do a lot of comparing to the Samson SR850's I just bought AND my standby Koss PortaPros (which I compared the Samson's to in my review of them) Anyway, lets get started.<br/><br/>First of all the looks of these. My 13 year old daughter unboxed them while I was at work &amp; immediately exclaimed "These are NICE !" With that, she put them on, plugged in her iPod Touch &amp; didn't take them off until I got home several hours later. This from a kid who's favorite headphones are a purple pair of Knockoff Beats I bought at a flea market. They are MUCH better looking than the Samsons. The earcups are smaller &amp; lower profile, and the headband is covered in a stylish black leatherette. There is a LARGE AudioTechnica logo across the top of them, but who's going to be looking at the top of your head ?<br/><br/>As far as comfort goes, they are very comfortable, They are much lighter than the Samson's, and as I said smaller. The ear pads are suitably soft &amp; covered in the same leather like material as the headband. And while I doubt you could lie on your side comfortably with them on, they would be MORE comfortable than the Samson's in that position.<br/><br/>As for build quality, they are REALLY light, which worries me a bit, but they seem very solid. The main structure is definitely metal and the wires are thick &amp; well covered. The plugs also look a step up from your average headphone connector. While I am sure my kids would manage to break them eventually, I think they would last longer than your average headphone. And with me, they will be just fine.<br/><br/>Finally, lets talk sound. They sound AWESOME ! Really awesome. Much better than headphones at this price should sound. When I listened to the Samson's the first time I knew they sounded better than my Koss' ... but not by a lot. These are OBVIOUSLY better. The bass response is better, and everything else is CRYSTAL CLEAR ! Just stunning. That being said, they are not as loud as the Samson's which kinda surprised me since they are smaller &amp; closed back. But because of the better bass &amp; improvements across the full range of sound, I would definitely put these ahead of the Samson's AND the Koss' &amp; I am sure ANYONE who heard them all side by side by side would agree.<br/><br/>Now there are a few negatives. Like I said they are smaller &amp; Lighter than the Samson's. And I was looking for something LARGER ... so in that respect, they are going away from what I was looking for. And I still am surprised the Samsons are slightly louder. With the bigger size they should need more power to drive them properly. But since the M20's have less sound leak than the SR850's, this is really a non-issue.<br/><br/>And while they are very comfortable, after wearing them for a short time its clear that my ears are sweating in the M20's where they were not in the SR850's. Again, it may be because the latter are semi-open, but I think its because of the cloth covering on the SR850's pads AND because they are bigger.<br/><br/>Overall, even with the negatives, I would recommend these over the Samson SR850's w/o question. But, if that extra $15.00 means a lot to you, the Samson's are still an EXCELLENT Choice. And they will probably be my choice, since once my son HEARS these. he will be wanting to trade me the Samson's for them.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have had these for just about 36 hours &amp; I just had a perfect stranger come up to me &amp; ask me if I liked them.l He obviously knew a lot more about headphones than I do &amp; has much better equipment (a $170 pair of BeyerDynamics) but he was impressed with these especially at the price.<br/><br/>UPDATE to the UPDATE: I recently bought a Fiio E6 Headphone Amp &amp; when my son comes home from College, I will try these out with the Amp. Considering how much they improved my Samson SR850's (I would put that combination AHEAD of these now) I am sure they will sound even more awesome. However,  I will NOT be buying that Amp for my son. If he wants one, he can buy it himself.<br/><br/>IN RESPONSE TO .... the two questions .... First off the Amp improves the M20's as much as it improves the Samson SR850's. The sound is cleaner, and I prefer using the degraded setting on the amp with increased volume on my source on these as well.<br/><br/>Second, as I said without the amp, these sound nearly as good as the Samson's WITH the amp. So I feel I have done enough for my son in that respect. If he wants to UP the quality with the amp, that's his choice. Just because I am not paying for it, doesn't represent my feeling for him one way or another. Of maybe it does. Either way I feel secure in my role as a parent &amp; the opinion of one crank won't affect that.</span>

<span>Very happy with these ATH-M20X headphones. I bought them to get a sample of what the ATH-M50X might generally sound like.  I prefer these to my Sennheiser HD 599 SE which cost 3x more. The ATH-M20X have the mids and to a certain extent the highs which are missing from the HD 599's. If you want to hear ALL the music these are for you. I love hearing accentuations I've never heard in recordings I've listened to many times before. If you like bass heavy don't buy these. They aren't lacking in bass, the just aren't bass heavy.</span>

<span>A little background on my experiences with studio headphones in general: I've really struggled to find a good pair over the years that accomplished exactly what I was looking for and gave me a good way to monitor mixes when I don't have access to full studio monitors (which is, most of the time.) I've tried both closed-backed and open-backed variants of reference headphones and had mixed results with pretty much every one of them. These however, I haven't found a single issue with in terms of sound and results. They're extremely natural to my ears, and are very crisp and clear. To me, they don't have this huge, binaural-eseque soundstage to them compared to some other open-backed sets I've tried, but their openness does lend to everything sounding more clear and separate compared to the closed sets I've used, for sure. And I'd venture to say they are the most comfortable variant of open back sets I've worn as well. Ever since I purchased these I've noticed subtle mixing choice differences I have made in recent projects that have really elevated how consistent my tracks sound on various devices, in my experience - if I can get something to sound good on these, they'll sound great on everything else I try, and phenomenal on my listening sets of choice! I wouldn't say these offer anything spicy in terms of sound, or lean at all in the "fun" side of things. But for analytical use? These rock.</span>

<span>These headphones are magical. Especially for vocals, it made me fall in love with singers I never paid attention too before and I usually don't pay too much attention the the singer.<br/><br/>So much clarity. Its so easy to pick out parts of songs and just listen to that one thing.<br/><br/>However they aren't very comfortable. They CLAMP with the power of a thousand suns and I wear glasses. Pain.<br/><br/>Also it makes a lot of songs sound bad. A lot of pop songs that you probably like. My experience was these headphones made a song sound like a 15/10 magical experience; its like hearing the same song but its brand new to you<br/><br/>or it was a 2/10. Songs I already knew and loved sounded so bad that if I had heard them with only these headphones I never would have thought the song was good at all.</span>

<span>I have the bereynamic 1990 pros. Those are excellent I use those for Opera which I don't listen to classical music rock and anything that was made by a human that sounds really awesome.<br/><br/>I didn't want to wear those out though because those are like $600. I needed something to play video games with and still hear high fidelity electronic music without wearing out those headphones. I think these are perfect for that. There's good detail in the bass out of the box and everything's really balanced. You might have to toy with an equalizer to bring up the highs that you want, but that's not so bad considering that the $600 headphones I have have really sharp high frequencies. These are good because they have good detail in the bass without equalizing and you can still hear everything else in a balanced way.<br/><br/>I think the first thing you need to do with these is just plug them into an amp/dac and then play around with equalization so you might want to bring up the mids a little bit and make them more pronounced as I said everything's really balanced and flat it's not a bad thing but it does mean that if there are certain parts of a song that you like a lot you might want to make it more distinct.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that every song sounds a bit different and has different pronunciations and different frequencies if you equalize a song it'll sound amazing but then the next song played on that equalization setting won't sound as good you might be bringing up the highs when they're all ready too high. You can you can usually equalize for a particular music genre like electronic. An electronic I probably keep the highs the same to avoid the hi-hats getting into my ear too much but maybe increase the mids and the lows.<br/><br/>Still though after trying the $600 headphones and then switching to these 1 minute later there's not a huge amount of difference in the detail it's more about the headroom and the soundstage and those $600 headphones the 1990s really be these in that area but as far as detail these are still really good.<br/><br/>I also have the Bose quiet comfort 35 II's. These beat those out of the water. For $170 I don't know if you can find better sound quality.<br/><br/>They are very light I thought the box was empty when I first got it lol but it's actually kind of nice because these are the phones that I'm going to be wearing for like 12 hours straight while I'm gaming they're great . don't look around anywhere else just get these unless you can spend over $250. Maybe not even then. To get a huge significant upgrade from these you would probably have to spend close to $400 or more.<br/><br/>Take it all with a grain of salt though I got my first stack and amp maybe half a year ago and all of these headphones I referenced I've gotten within the past 2 years I'm not exactly an audiophile, but I am pretty good at picking the best products in the price points and I think I have done this with this product.</span>

<span>I have been using Sony noise canceling earbuds for the last couple of years. I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.<br/><br/>Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.<br/>The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).<br/>The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.<br/>The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.<br/>Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.<br/><br/>The issues:<br/><br/>I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.<br/>The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.<br/>The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.<br/><br/>Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.</span>

<span>No Doubt these are excellent headphones. Sony has taken an already established series and made them better. Some may not like that they don’t fold down but the case is slim and it should mean better durability in the long run so I have no issues with it at all as far as that goes. My only real complaints are that the wear sensor rarely works, really 1 out of 10 times will the headphones pause when I remove them…I don’t know if it is because of the sensor being set inside the fabric vs. outside like the M4’s, or something else. May be just my unit I suppose. I don’t absolutely need it to work especially since the touch controls work really well so I can live with that. The only other issue is for comfort. Don’t get me wrong, overall they are super light and comfortable but the light padding on the headband does cause some discomfort after awhile. A little adjustment and it is better but could be an issue for some. I also wish that Sony could do something to make the headphones power on and connect more quickly. If you have them connected to two devices it takes about 10 seconds to connect to both. However the connection is strong and I have no issues with that! And the multi point function works flawlessly!<br/>Noise Cancelling is no doubt the reason to buy these headphones and it is best in class, but as with all noise cancelling headphones there are limitations. It blocks a lot of noise, no doubt, but if the song playing is quiet or the quiet spots between tracks then noise can get through in those moments. It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best I’ve ever tested.<br/>Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.<br/>Sound quality is really good. It is not as good as some of my other headphones from Bang and Olufsen, Sennheiser or arguably even the AirPods Max, but is up there. For overall features and noise cancelling these cannot be beat! Another great thing is the speak to chat. It works really well but I keep it off most of the time because it’ll be triggered too easily with a cough or a hum but the great thing is you can toggle the feature on or off by pressing two fingers to the touch pad. Game changer! So if I’m entering a store, for example, I can toggle it on when I enter and then toggle it back off on the way out! That is so awesome to me! Makes the feature so much more sensible for me.<br/>One last note is on the color: I chose the “platinum silver” because I read the black was a finger-print magnet and I wanted to avoid that. This color is okay but kind of blah. But although the headphones are made of recycled materials it still has a slightly more premium build quality than some but is nowhere the build quality of some others like the Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay H95’s. But they are unbelievably light weight so that is a good reason to go with those materials. I also love the simple packaging they come in with no plastic and no waste. It’s a nice eco-friendly way to go and I applaud them for that! Overall, these are first-rate headphones and I would highly recommend them (even over the M’4’s as I like the new design and the sound quality, to my ears at least, is improved over the old model).<br/>Update: September 27, 2022. I had to downgrade these to 4 stars because of the wear sensor. Overall they are great, but the wear sensor not working is really bugging me because I feel it should work, after all the XM4’s had a wear sensor that worked much more reliably and since this is the follow up it should work at least as well, if not better. Curious if anyone else has this issue or if it’s just my unit. Also on several occasions the touch control has become completely non responsive and I’ve had to power them off and on again to get it to work again. A little frustrating (especially when you look like an idiot banging repeatedly on the ear cup trying to get it respond).</span>

<span>When you first get these headsets, you may think 'what is the big deal'?. But then you study the features, the taps, music adjustment settings, music and headphone features, the button, the noise-canceling, auto-shutoff, disable pause while taking, etc.  Touch and hold the right earphone to talk to Alexia.  Tap to hang up. Swipe finger up volume up, down for volume down. Left/Right previous and next.  "Alexia, what time is it?" "Alexia, set 15 min timer" and then when you want to lock people out, the noise canceling can certainly make people disappear. Perfect avoidance strategy as an reason to ignore somebody you don't want to hear. "I don't heaaar you" -- want to hear the clerk at a gas station or drive through and talk for a moment? Couple the right hear with your hand and it temporarily pauses while your hand is there, letting in all ambient sound in. Want to hear what is around AND music at the same time? There is an option that enhances both ambient sound and music at once. You keep both worlds. Or, you can just cancel noise canceling and it works like a regular headphone.<br/><br/>I am glad that I didn't own the previous versions of this headset, because I am understanding it is difficult for people with the WH-1000XM4 to get used to this headset because they are looking for everything to be in the same place they are used to it -- also the feel may be different. Since I didn't own the last version, I was able to give this headset a fair chance and explore all the new, more advanced features and superior sound it has, and I love it so much!<br/><br/>Also, did I mention these headsets can get LOUD? You don't need the volume turned up very high on these. Also, did I talk about the great call quality? My Poly headset was causing issues with the other side hearing me, but I have great call quality with these headsets. I don't have to deal with people not being able to hear me with these.<br/><br/>The only issue, is I wish they were a bit tighter or hugged better when riding my bike.</span>

<span>I'll keep this as short as I can as I'm sure there have been a lot more thorough reviews over this product so I'll talk about some unique pieces that I got out of these headphones that I haven't seen from other reviewers.<br/><br/>For one thing, the really annoying thing about the xm4 for me personally was that those headphones were just too small; I previously owned the xm3 and have worn those down from the time that I put those on and bought those up recently to replace them, but I needed to send back those because after having on the headphones for more than a couple of hours I would get massive headaches overall because the headphones were just too small for me personally. Going to these headphones these were much more comfortable for a longer sessions, which to me alone is worth the extra spending on these headphones.<br/><br/>They're slightly better sound-wise than the xm4's but it's not anything most people would notice. The biggest thing with these is better controls for multiple connections to Bluetooth as well as convenience for quick charging if you forget to charge these overnight but want a long session for walking outside for example.<br/><br/>The adjustment to your environment is more noticeable outside than it really is if you are indoors. As you expect with sony's these are the top tier in terms of immersion in other environments, so much so to a point that I actually had these on at one point during an after-service dinner party just for the noise canceling to muffle out the sound of the music being played, as I had a headache at the time. Extremely convenient as it also helped to focus voices around me as necessary.</span>

<span>These headphones work really well. They were easy to connect to my devices.  I like that I can connect my phone and TV at the same time. They are fair at noise canceling. It could be better for the price. The ear cushions go completely over my ears which I like since the ones that go on the ears starts to hurt after a bit. I would suggest these headphones for anyone who has to wear them for an extended period of time.</span>

<span>Do yourself a favor, save some money and never buy a BEATS product again. I purchased these Bose after the BEATS didn't even last a year before I found myself breaking out the solder, losing my mind and smashing them to bits. Now to Bose SoundLink: I was skeptical at best with the current trend in crap headphones but these babies deliver. After a year of usage no rips or tears in the ears or the top head band (I use them all day for work and at the gym). No issues at all but consistent quality sound and performance. What do you expect from a company based in Framingham Mass! Another quality product I hope lasts a few more years.</span>

<span>I had a pair of these for 4 years until the pads wore out, replaced them with the latest Sony WH ANRs and hated those. I ended up buying another pair of the Bose after a few weeks.<br/><br/>Comparing these to the Sonys which are 3x the price:<br/>- Bluetooth range is much better. And they switch between devices so much quicker and easier than the Sonys.<br/><br/>- Super light and hyper comfortable, you can wear them all day no problem and your ears don't get hot.<br/><br/>- Every time I coughed the Sonys would pause the audio or start Siri, they were mega annoying. The Bose are simpler but everything just works perfectly and as expected.<br/><br/>- Audio quality and bass is as expected from Bose, top notch.<br/><br/>- Battery life is insane. I use them all day for music and Zoom calls and only have to charge them every 2 or 3 days.<br/><br/>You won't regret purchasing them.</span>

<span>EDIT: After owning these headphones for just a few days over a year, read my updated review beneath the original!<br/><br/>After reading reviews and seeing nothing but outstanding remarks for these headphones, I decided to drop the cash and give it a shot. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I'm definitely an audiophile; I produced EDM music for quite a while which trained me to care about proper balance in songs. These headphones have AMAZING balance! Most expensive headphones that I've tried on just have a crazy boosted bass and it gives me a headache. Not to mention, it just doesn't sound good haha! Anyway, these headphones have super crisp highs, good mids, and crunchy bass. They really are perfect.<br/><br/>As for comfort, I could easily wear these things all day. Sometimes I forget I'm even wearing these headphones... They look pretty stylish and they aren't too big. The carrying case is pretty lowkey and it works fine, no problems there. Headphones charge fast and the battery lasts me about a week with daily usage.<br/><br/>I enjoy the little voice that sounds whenever you switch devices or turn on the headphones. It's not obnoxious in the slightest. Bluetooth is always a little finicky but these headphones connect almost flawlessly. They automatically reconnect to your last device and that makes things go A LOT faster! Switching devices is pretty simple too.<br/><br/>Using the included aux cord doesn't effect sound quality at all. Good for conserving battery life is you don't particularly need the wireless feature at the time of listening!<br/><br/>Overall, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. It was well worth the money and I would recommend these headphones to anyone AND everyone! If you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>As mentioned above, I've owned these headphones for a little over a year now and I'm still impressed. Even after 1 entire year of extensive use (multiple road trips, a whole school year in the backpack, recording, listening, calling) these still work flawlessly and I've had ZERO major problems whatsoever. Long story short, I'm still sticking with the 5 star review. Below is a little more detail:<br/><br/>Physical: No physical damage at all. I try to take care of my stuff, but accidents happen and these headphones have not sustained any scratches, dents, or cracked despite my heavy usage. The foam-ish headband piece still holds its shape. The earphones are still fluffy and squishy (no tears or deformities). At some point in my 1 year of ownership, the little piece of fabric that has the "L" on it (inside the left ear cup; it covers the electronics and such) started slipping out, but I was able to finagle it back in and there's been no problem since. I use the case basically whenever I transport these headphones and that's probably the main reason they've maintained physical integrity. Highly recommend using that case. It's small, sleek, and effective.<br/><br/>Sound: I haven't owned any other headphones since these so I can't compare the sound of other headphones to these, however, I'm about to purchase a Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro which is known for it's studio quality, neutral sound. I'll compare the sound when I purchase them. I have noticed problems occasionally when connected to multiple devices. If the headphones are connected to my iPhone and my MacBook I sometimes have a little lag when watching YouTube. But as mentioned by another reviewer, turning on and off the headphones solves this. I don't get too many phone calls, but the several calls I've had while wearing these headphones were crystal clear and easy to understand (on both ends, I asked). I've had several VERY minor issues with the Bluetooth connectivity overall, but Bose regularly puts out firmware updates for their hardware and they've solved many of these issues. I'd say check about once a month for updates on their update site: http://btu.bose.com/<br/><br/>The only negative: since these are over-the-ear headphones, they have some natural sound cancelling properties, but after I tried out some Bose Active Noise Cancelling Headphones at Target, I can't even BEGIN to explain how amazing the active noise cancelling was. With the Bose SoundLink headphones, the natural noise cancelling is good. It blocks out a majority of background noise and outsiders cannot hear my music at all (unless it's turned up very high... don't do that!). But with the active noise cancelling headphones, it's almost magical. You put those headphones on and it's just dead silent. These headphones are perfect as they are, but if you can afford it, go for a pair of Bose headphones with active noise cancelling. Just my suggestion.<br/><br/>Tip: If you use these headphones for mixing (which I'll update the sound comparison part of this review when I get my new DT770 Pro's), make sure to use the custom aux cable provided. This ensures there's no Bluetooth interference and you get the clearest sound quality. These aren't studio headphones, but if you want headphones to use in combination with studio monitors (as a reference listening device) or if you need a good pair of monitor headphones that can double as comfort/listening headphones, these work great.</span>

<span>I'll be quite honest that I first bought these when trying to find one of the cheapest reputable noise cancelling headphones that I planned to use exclusively for mowing.  I have a 3 acre lawn and spend hours mowing each week and the regular headphones just had to be jacked up too loud to hear over the drone so I finally jumped on these.<br/><br/>These headphones have been nothing short of great for me.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of people griping about options that may be missing and no app support and yada yada yada but the truth is, these offer a large amount of bang for the buck.  Noise cancelling and great, but not perfect when comparing to Bose headphones (shocker, right?)  Ears do start to sweat a little after an hour or so but that's not extremely surprising either.  Plenty loud, especially if you turn off the noise cancelling.  Perhaps this is par for the course, but I was slightly disappointed at how much bass you lose when you turn on the noise cancelling.  They actually shocked me at how much bass they have when comparing to other headphones 4 times their price.  I wouldn't go as far as to call them boomy but they do have a good punch.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, i've liked these headphones so much that i've had to keep moving them between the garage and the house as I use them to watch movies late at night when I don't wanna wake the rest of the family up.<br/><br/>They are a great budget friendly pair of noise cancelling headphones with a great battery life.  I'd buy again!</span>

<span>This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.<br/><br/>Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.<br/><br/>The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.<br/><br/>The Soundcore Headphones:<br/>These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.<br/><br/>Comparability and Software:<br/>These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.<br/><br/>Overall Sound<br/>I'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling:<br/>Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.<br/><br/>Comparisons:<br/><br/>Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.<br/><br/>Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.<br/><br/>Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.<br/><br/>The Overall:<br/>Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.<br/><br/>TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.<br/><br/>I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.<br/><br/>Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.<br/><br/>I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...<br/><br/>NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------<br/><br/>Sound Quality ---- 8/10<br/>These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as  most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.<br/><br/>DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORS<br/>I only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.<br/><br/>Comfort ---- 10/10<br/>These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.<br/><br/>Features ---- meh, not much to talk about<br/>Really the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.<br/><br/>Aesthetics ---- 6/10<br/>Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.<br/><br/>Connectivity ---- 6/10<br/>Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.<br/><br/>Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10<br/>You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!<br/><br/>Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)</span>

<span>First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park..

I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.<br/><br/>Active Noise Cancellation:<br/>Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..<br/><br/>Sound:<br/>I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..<br/><br/>They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..<br/><br/>Quality:<br/>The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!<br/><br/>Functionality:<br/>A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..</span>

<span>The noise cancellation is exceptional on these headphones. With 10 levels I can block out most of what is going on around me, when it is safe to do so. If you are someone that startles easily, like myself, you will probably get scared a lot because you will not hear what or who is walking up behind you. My husband finds this very humorous.<br/>The sound quality was every bit of what I expected from Bose. Crisp, rich audio, with an amazing range of clarity, from your treble to mid tones and excellent bass. It’s easy to slip into your own little oasis with these on.<br/>They are also quite comfortable, their padded band and ear cups are soft and do not apple much pressure against your head. They are very light weight and I can wear them for hours without issue.<br/>The included case is well made, sturdy and not overly bulky allowing my to pack it and take it with me anywhere. It has a storage compartment for your cables so you always know where they are.<br/>The battery life is excellent! I can go days without charging, but if I do need to charge, they replenish quite quickly and I am right back in business. I have easily gotten a full 20 hour charge out of these. I like that when you turn them on they immediately tell you how many hours they have left on their current charge and what devices they are connected to. This makes it easy to check how long you can use them on their current charge, before you head out somewhere where you might not have access to a plug. I found the time they tell me I have left on my charge to be quite accurate. I am able to connect to more than one device (like my iPhone and iPad) and they intuitively play the sound from the device I am using at the moment. I love that feature it’s easy to switch from watching something on my iPad to listening to music from my phone. Bose also includes a cable so you can plug directly to your device and go wired. I have not used this feature because the battery life is so long, I have not run into a situation where it was necessary.<br/>The buttons and touch features of these headphones are wonderful. I can turn Alexa (Siri or Google) on or off depending on my needs. I can control the volume sliding my finger up or down on the surface of one ear and can tap to pause and swipe to change songs. With one button I can rotate between 3 levels of noise cancellation that I can set within my app.  I have not had the chance to utilize some of the AR on these yet but cannot wait to try it on our next vacation, it will be like bringing along our own tour guide.<br/>I love that Alexa is built in. I’m an artist and when I’m painting in my studio it is very nice to be able to use Alexa to change my music without needing to touch my device or my headphones.<br/>I saved and waited to get these after trying them and comparing to the Sony competitive model and I am so glad I did. I found the bass of the Sony WH1000 series to be a little scratchy sounding and the overall sound just wasn’t as crisp as the Bose 700 series. I had a pair of Cowin E-7s and those, while they were great at their price point and did the job while I was saving up for these, they just weren’t even in the same class as the Bose 700. These, in my opinion (and I spent a lot of time putting headphones on and off, listening to how everything sounded on each), set the bar and everything else is just trying to measure up. Only the Sony WH1000 series could come close, but for me their sound quality still fell short. The only way to describe it was, you knew you were listening to a recording, whereas the sound from the Bose 700, you could close your eyes and it sounded like you were listening to it actually being played by the artist live the sound is just that crisp and clear no echo or scratch it’s clear vibrant and rich, everything I expected from Bose.<br/>I am very happy with my purchase, they were worth the wait and I would certainly recommend them to everyone!<br/>One Note I have very sensitive sinuses and when I put on noise canceling headphones, I can actually feel a pressure in my ears and sinus cavities, this does happen with the Bose as well (it happens with every brand I have tried if the cancellation is of any really quality). That said it does not deter me, nor do I feel it’s would be a reason I wouldn’t recommend them or give them a lower star rating. I can feel it when I activate the noise cancellation at its max level but everyone else I have asked to try them, can’t. So chances are very likely this will not be something that the average person even realizes. I can still use the noise cancellation and can block out enough that I never hear my husband walk into my studio until he taps me on the shoulder and scared the heck out of me. I only include this info in case there are others out there that also experience this, with the Bose 700 you can control the levels and it’s easy to step your way up through 10 levels of cancellation and find one that blocks the noise out, while still being comfortable to your sinuses. That is why I would recommend to everyone! Other headphones are cancellation on or off and if you are sensitive to it that can render the feature useless. Again not the case with the Bose 700 series. I use this feature all the time, have found the level that is perfect for me and the noise cancellation is amazing. It is so nice to finally be able to use this feature.<br/>I will also add that unlike other headphones the noise cancellation does not affect the quality of the sound I am listening to either! I have tried many where the sound completely changes the moment you turn it on, not with these. The sound remains crisp and rich and clear as it did without the noise cancellation. The only difference is the world around you gets quieter and the music sounds amazing! If you read this whole review Thank You if you are considering these headphones and trying to compare, in my opinion there is no comparison and I don’t think you will be disappointed choosing the Bose 700 series. I hope this info helped.</span>

<span>Can a Bluetooth (BT) headphone that sells for less than $80 beat an expensive Bose BT headphone? Let's find out!<br/><br/>HOW I DISCOVERED<br/>I was ironically turned onto the Bose 700 (proper model name is NC 700) by "Oluv's Gadgets" video channel, where he ripped the Bose to shreds! (Search for video "Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700-the worst?") And rightfully so, it turns out. Except at the end, where he did an impressive Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) test of multiple headphones along a busy road. (BTW: I and many owe Oluv a donation: he refuses all sponsorships, and Amazon inexplicably de-affiliated him! Check out his videos.) In his video, the NC 700 seemed near-silent compared to the others, which piqued my interest. I'd previously bought the Ankbit (a sub-brand of 1Mii) E600Pro, and was almost over the moon with it, and wondered how much better the Bose could be, at multiples of that price. Not much, it turns out. So this is a comparison, as much as a review.<br/><br/>CODECS<br/>Bose NC 700 HAS NO APTX!! I was shocked: even the Ankbit has AptX! (Update: it does have the proprietary Apple AAC codec, so there's that.) Not as much a problem, it turns out. SBC should be auditorily indistinguishable at strong signals, and is much more stable when dealing with weak signals. Technically, the lack of AptX should be a con, but strangely for me it became a plus, per real-life experience with AptX stability, and study of Bluetooth codecs. The Ankbit can connect on SBC like all BT speakers, but you can't override the auto-negotiation. In real life, codecs are a preference which, for most people, will be based on misunderstanding, so focus on compatibility and stability.<br/><br/>WIRED CAPABILITY<br/>The Bose NC 700 has a tiny, NON-standard 2.5mm wired headphone jack, NOT the standard 3.5mm (1/8-inch) jack!! The unkindest cut: Bose cheaped out, and this EXPENSIVE headset doesn't even include an adapter!<br/>The Ankbits don't even need an adapter, but they were STILL nice to include a fancy wired, TRRS smartphone-compatible headphone cable WITH AN INLINE VOLUME CONTROL WIRED REMOTE! Don't worry, it gets worse!<br/><br/>SOUND<br/>The NC 700 ranges from just "good, but NOT great" in BT (tuned/factory EQ'd) mode, to "bad" in Wired/ANC Off mode, to "downright awful" in Wired/ANC On mode! Yeah, you can install a famously INTRUSIVE Bose app into your inner sanctum and try to make it sound better in Bluetooth mode than Bose themselves could, with your own custom EQ. But the Ankbit sounds unbelievable right out of the box in BT mode, and still sounds pretty good in both wired (ANC On AND Off) modes. Surprisingly, the Ankbits had actually MORE bass in wired (no factory tuning) mode, which is slightly boomy: the Ankbit's BT tuning actually flattens the bass, reserving a bass bump for the lowest registers, making it have incredible bass for music, while amazingly also not interfering with spoken word.<br/> Sidenote: something I've not seen anyone discuss, even "Oluv's Gadgets" is the COMPRESSION EFFECT (lack of dynamic range), which is in addition to the Bose's poor frequency response. The Ankbit is fully dynamic-sounding. The Bose's true auditory flaws: the dearth of bass, combined with a lack of dynamic range, strangely make them excel at lengthy speech. If you listen primarily to talk, or just loathe bass for some reason, or you think I'm an idiot and that you can hear better than me, the Bose should do well for you. I still prefer the Ankbit overall, including for speech, partly due to their comfort.<br/> I'll give you a perfect analogy: the Bose 700 sounds like 'a decent $40 BT headphone'. I have one, I know. It's amazing what 40 bucks will buy now, but it's not the same as the Ankbit E600Pro at a higher price (you can also get promotions via 1Mii's newsletter). Which makes it even more baffling, that at [many times] the price of a median headset for the Bose, you get sound on-par with a median headset. (And far worse in wired modes.) In BT (tuned/EQ'd) mode, while not an enormous difference side by side, it's enough of a difference—for me—to actually "enjoy" the music, vs not enjoy it ("meh"). But I am finicky with audio. So, I wouldn't rely on the Bose if I could only have one headset. And noise cancellation had better be VERY high on your priority list. Also, there are many complaints of Bose users trying to use this headset for PC work, especially Microsoft Teams. Bose even sells an overpriced USB dongle to try to address the issue. Another Bose fail.<br/> UPDATE: there are "Bose NC 700 HP teardown" videos, where you can see how ridiculously tiny the drivers (speakers) are in relation to earcup size. Furthermore, Bose muffles the drivers by mostly covering them with what looks like a layer of thick aluminum foil, possibly to protect what may be an ANC mic suspended over the center of each driver. The small drivers themselves seem like afterthoughts, and further explain the low weight.<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELLATION<br/>The Bose's drivers are curved toward the ear canal by plastic 'ramps' or inserts. This apparently necessitates a small driver, hence reduced bass, and lower sound quality generally. I believe this is a tradeoff to achieve better ANC, which is where this product shines, NOT for music quality. As expected, the Bose is the clear winner in ANC over the Ankbit, altho the Ankbit does quite well. The Bose adds to this by apparently being one of the few who provide ANC to your audience in phone/headset mode (I haven't verified this). My female partner (who I've determined has low-frequency hearing loss) can't understand me with ANC on. Whereas I can understand everyone just fine, as long as I pause whatever's playing. So 'voice cancellation' depends on your hearing ability. And ANC will block deep voices better.<br/> Bose provides 3 levels of ANC from the headphones, but my partner and I only ever use On and "Off" ("transparent mode"), so the Medium just gets in the way. We both prefer Ankbit's physical slider switch, easier and simpler on/off for ANC (which still works when BT is off, BTW).<br/> With the NC 700, ANC IS NEVER OFF!! Level "0" is "Transparency Mode", which actually AMPLIFIES ambient sound!! That's fine, but let me fully turn the ANC mics off, if I want to! That also affects battery life. I think you might be able to fully disable ANC in the app, but then AFAIK you're stuck with no ANC at all, so the solution is worse than the problem.<br/><br/>CHARGING<br/>The Bose 700's can't charge while listening, did you know that?<br/>Yeah, they completely shut off when you plug in.<br/>The Ankbits happily charge while listening.<br/>Both charge via USB-C.<br/>The Ankbit included a charging cable (USB A to C, which is perfect for users with older tech who might not have a USB-C cable). The Bose included NOTHING. Except a fake 'quick start guide', which only insisted (in about 29 languages) that you install their app immediately!<br/><br/>SELF-NOISE<br/>Hiss or white noise from the ANC and BT circuitry is endemic in BT headphones. And BT headphones and speakers will quickly mute their output when you pause media, so it's difficult to study their true self-noise when transmitting sound. Self-noise (both in ANC/Standby, and while playing) is low on the Ankbit, but even lower on the Bose—but still detectable in a quiet environment. I'd say the Bose has quieter circuitry overall, including while playing. However, with the Ankbit you can truly disable ANC, which means 'no' noise when in Standby (nothing playing). If you're in a truly quiet environment and not playing anything, you won't need ANC, but it's still on with the Bose, so the hiss is there too, right when you could actually be bothered by it.<br/>If there is background noise, you probably won't be able to notice any hiss on either.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/>I feel like the Bose rated hours is overly-optimistic. It doesn't take long to go from 100% to 70% state of charge (SOC). The headset feels light, and sacrificing battery size had to be part of that. The other culprit is that ANC is never truly off, in any powered-on mode. Everyone knows ANC saps battery. Even if it's just sitting on your chest, ANC is active, and the battery's draining. The Ankbit will go for literally days with ANC off. Bose loses again.<br/> UPDATE: from the teardown videos, the NC 700 battery is 630 mAH (small). Ankbit claims an 1100 mAH capacity for the E600Pro, almost double, while probably also using less electricity, so that explains that.<br/><br/>COMFORT<br/>The Ankbit E600 Pro is definitely the clear upset winner, despite being slightly heavier. Bigger, wider cups FTW—and they fold, UNLIKE the Bose. The Achilles heel of the E600Pro is Ankbit/1Mii made the headband too long (the only fix is to wrap something around the headband). The NC 700 simply fits small (female-medium and smaller) heads better. The Bose cups touch my ears; Ankbit's don't. Bose earcups are tighter, and disappointingly vinyl-covered, not fabric. The 700's are not uncomfortable, but the E600Pro is one of the most comortable headphones I've ever worn. Ankbit wins again.<br/> I will say that I suspect the Bose design feels more sturdy. Neither are 'creaky', but the Ankbit feels more plasticky and fragile, and I've seen photos of broken Ankbit arms, but not Bose 700's (other Bose, yes). It doesn't seem common at this point, but Ankbit shouldn't use thin structural plastic. And I've had the plastic arm on a cheaper, gently-used BT headset break recently, so now I'm worried. The Bose 700 uses plastic for structure, but seems stronger.<br/> I've tried 2 wraps to lower the Ankbit's headband height for my partner, the simplest being an ACE bandage. Both worked for her, though we shouldn't need to do that. Even without the wrap, the large cups provided a bit of extra travel on her head, so it still fit, despite being too low.<br/><br/>ANC<br/>Bose wins: this is really what you're paying the high price for. But NEITHER are substitutes for real hearing protection (I've experimented). ANC can be helpful for less-serious noise like a vacuum cleaner or blender, but NOT as range earmuffs, etc. On that note, the Bose would give me weird, somewhat-painful pops from the speaker in the ear closer to a significant noise, such as blenders. So it really wasn't even useful for that. The Ankbit's noise cancellation wasn't good enough to run a blender AND hear my program, unless I turned it up to unhealthy levels, though it was helpful if Paused. Earmuffs were just better. Where ANC shines is background noise, such as air conditioners and traffic. Bose is the pioneer in ANC, back to the 1980s, but you'll pay for it. The noise cancellation reaches into higher frequencies than its competitors, due to more mics, better processing, and probably that weird 'ramp' inside the earcups (which ensuing small drivers I think are the culprit for the crap audio quality).<br/><br/>VOICE PROMPTS<br/>The NC 700 is overly-active with voice prompting, with a full TTS engine that sounds suspiciously like Microsoft's "Zira" voice, but some will like that. At least the Bose briefly pauses your media whenever it does one of its many prompts. But the auto-pausing can cause problems, or just not work at all with certain applications (in whole, it's a plus). The Ankbit features the famously-bad Chinese computer lady saying "ANC on", but thankfully that's the only voice prompt, the rest are beeps. The audio prompts of both the Bose and Ankbit are both too loud (hurts my ears, which is ironic for devices that are supposed to block noise). The best thing is that the Bose can actually verbally tell you the SOC (and WILL tell you, when you turn it on—even if you don't want it to), whereas the Ankbit won't bug you about battery level until it's already unhealthily low, so you have to be more proactive.<br/><br/>APP<br/>I encourage all users to NOT use "apps", unless they're genuinely necessary or important to you. Even then, for security I'd encourage you to install those apps on a "low security" device. I think it's crazy for people to do online banking on mobile devices, but it's somehow common. Let's put it this way: any device you'd do banking on, you shouldn't install apps randomly, especially on Android.<br/> There is no difference between "security" and "privacy". Bluetooth headphone apps are notorious for stabbing you in the back. Bose was not the only one discovered to be doing highly questionable things with their app. REMEMBER, these headphones have MICROPHONES, plus the apps can monitor mobile device activity and location. Bose furthermore infamously forced everyone to REGISTER just to use their app. It later blew up in their face, and I'm taking off an extra star just for this.<br/> I find the ability to customize an EQ compelling, but I'd rather have a device which didn't need its sound tweaked in the first place. Being extremely finicky, but also anti-app, I took a chance on the Ankbit E600Pro, which has no app. Thankfully, my gamble paid off. I'm overjoyed by the Ankbit's sound.<br/> I don't plan to install the Bose app, because I didn't buy the Bose for music (luckily). But if I do, it won't be on a device I use regularly, and I'll probably uninstall it when I get the EQ I wanted anyway. I also won't give Bose any genuine personal info, nor should you, but they can probably figure out a lot anyway, depending your device. The Bose app EQ isn't very sophisticated anyway (not many bands). I'll just keep the crappy default tuning, as it works for speech, and these headphones will never be great for music. I have better stuff for that.. including the Ankbit.<br/><br/>SWAGGER<br/>I despise the idea of buying/not buying a practical item based on looks or social BS. Both the Ankbit and Bose have a narrow headband profile which doesn't look as chunky as many over-the-ear 'phones. Of course the Bose "look" better, but you pay a price for the 'spacey' design: they don't fold, and hair can get trapped easier in those 'poles'. Though I hardly have any hair-pulling with either, I have less with the Ankbit (virtually none, it's amazing). For those of yous who would buy Bose based on 'impressing' people, I'll tell you that true audio enthusiasts almost universally dislike Bose, and oftentimes despise them. Bose is no 'hood ornament' for me, it's a mark of shame. The one thing I respect by Bose, is their ANC headsets. They make (expensive ones) for pilots, and I think were first to market with ANC. That's where my respect stops, and the "app" beef set the disrespect in stone. Bose is always-overpriced stuff that usually sounds 'good' but not 'great'. I think both "Ankbit" and "1Mii" are ridiculous names, but the company has pretty solid (China-based) support, and a warehouse in the US. I can't speak firsthand about Bose support.<br/><br/>CONTROLS<br/>I don't hate the Bose touch controls as much as I thought. Volume control can be more nuanced than the Ankbit, depending device. I still prefer well-implemented physical buttons. I've had numerous times when the touch-sensitive area rested on my shoulder or hands, and unexpectedly announced the battery SOC. You also can't use most gloves. But the Projected Capacitive Touch Sensor is well-implemented.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>You don't always get what you pay for. There are better choices for a lot less money, EXCEPT if you want the best ANC (and ANC for the microphone)—and are willing to endure Diminishing Returns for it.<br/> The Bose was an expensive experiment and gamble, but since my life partner and I were 'fighting' over the Ankbit, we needed another. And since the Ankbit was a bit too big for her, and I like to experiment, I held my nose and tried the Bose. I went into this knowing the Bose music quality would be sub-par. But we mainly use headphones for speech, so adding wireless has been liberating. I wanted to experience the state of the art with ANC. I nearly bought a Bluetooth-equipped 'hearing-protection' type muff, but thought we'd have comfort issues (she hates having her "head squeezed"). Pay your luxury tax and sacrifice music quality if you want the best ANC there is (but not the best "muffling": true hearing protection earmuffs will still blow it away).<br/> Despite the fact that the Ankbit doesn't even fit her right due to the too-long headband, my LP still says she would STILL choose the Ankbit, if she could only have ONE (though due to the fitment issue—and that alone—it was a hard question for her). That's even if I didn't wrap the headband to bulk it up! That's saying a lot. And she claims even she can discern the better music quality of the Ankbit. That's saying a lot too!</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>This review is my personal experience using both headphones.  I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones.  Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.<br/><br/>Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic).  Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.<br/><br/>PERSONAL USAGE<br/>I use these headphones primarily for work.  I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development.  I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work.  We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication.  Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.<br/><br/>PERSONAL PREFERENCES<br/>I really don’t like using in the ear headphones.  They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution.  Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me.  This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.<br/><br/>BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEAD<br/>My first pair of headphones were Beats Solo.  I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general.  Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3.  These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.<br/><br/>The functionality is about the same between the two.  With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements.  Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.<br/><br/>• Pros – Lots of colors.  Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity.  Useful when sweating or outdoor use.<br/>• Cons – Quality.  Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution.  Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general.  Feel cheap.<br/><br/>FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3<br/>I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member.  I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted.  I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.<br/><br/>There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality.  Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more.  My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time.  The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.<br/><br/>Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s.  One big thing I would like to see is app integration.  Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature.  Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.<br/><br/>The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two.  I found I used it a couple of times.<br/><br/>Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1.  These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.<br/><br/>• Pros –Very durable and well built.  Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work.  Slept with these on a bus trip.  That was my last memory.  Cheaper than the Bose.  Foldable, smaller case.<br/>• Cons – Less features than the Bose.  Misses on some sweet spots.  Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.<br/><br/>SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700<br/><br/>Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible.  Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t.  The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute.  When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up.  Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.<br/><br/>I’ve only had these for a month.  Was it worth paying up for it?  Honestly, I don’t know yet.  There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.<br/>So based on a month, here’s what I found<br/>• Pros – Seems like better sound quality.  More features and possible mute integration.<br/>• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.<br/><br/>TLDR / OVERALL REVIEW<br/>I won’t even compare the Beats headphones.  Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.<br/>METRICS<br/>• Sound Quality – Bose slightly.  My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be.  Spotify is what I listen to primarily.  The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.<br/>• Mute / Unmute – Bose.  The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.<br/>• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose.  There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10.  Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.<br/>• Microphone – Sony.  Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”.  Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.<br/>• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about.  Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy.  I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony.  It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary.  If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.<br/>• Headset Features, Bose wins.  Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them.  The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.<br/>• Headset Quality – Sony.  I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head.  Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t.  An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.<br/>• In the box – Sony slightly.  Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not.  I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.<br/>• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony.  Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.<br/>• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively.  Bluetooth location hasn’t changed.  Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.<br/>• Companion Application – Bose.  Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.<br/><br/>WINNER – Sony<br/><br/>I’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.<br/>With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone.  Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective.  So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.<br/><br/>Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.<br/><br/>I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again.  Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that.  Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire.  That’s something that’s a no-go for me.  I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement.  Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.<br/><br/>Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.<br/><br/>As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it.  I can see it both ways.  For me, these headphones are for basic usage.  The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade.  Defective products happen.  I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better.  Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.<br/><br/>I hope this helped someone.  Sorry for too much text.</span>

<span>Great headphones for the audiophile that wants quality entry-level, open-back headphones without breaking the bank entirely. They also make decent gaming/conference headphones due to the open back headphones since they allow you to hear yourself due to the open-back design.<br/><br/>Certainly would not recommend for public listening obviously because there is next to no noise cancelling and plenty of sound leakage. Again, this is inherit to the design.</span>

<span>Let me start this off correctly. These are the best and closest to perfect headphones you will be able to find overall. The 660 S is pure magic for your ears. It’s worth the price. 💯<br/><br/>We can’t really talk about the 660 S without talking about the 650. I had the HD 650 back from 2013 to 2016 until I finally sold them. The HD 650 are top notch headphones, but I switched over to the X2s at the time. I don’t regret the choice. The HD 650s need a lot of power and the X2s at the time had very little competition in the $300 segment. They had more soundstage and bass. The HD 650s, which the HD 660 S is attempting to dethrone here, is an absolute monster of a headphone. The 650s offer a fatigueless experience and have basically no major flaws. True for it's time. Then I got the 660 S!<br/><br/>The 660 S is the better headphone. It’s easier to drive first of all. Many of you may not even know what Ohms and sensitivity are. Let's say the 660 S is in many cases 30-40% louder on the same equipment. The 660 S can do everything the 650 and 600 do much better. Don’t let anyone trick you on this. It’s better – in every way. Through some sort of magical engineering, the 660 S takes the 650s top end veil off, without bringing up the highs. In fact, the highs are even further recessed on the 660 S. Don’t let this pull you back. All the details are there. Unless you’re a huge fan of V shaped headphones, you won’t find something better under $500 than this. That’s just how it is. You have to accept it. This is S tier all over the place. Let’s talk further about sound. I’m going to be brief.<br/><br/>The 660 S are the smoothest headphones I’ve ever heard. Highs, bass, and mids are absolutely and completely balanced. Bass is punchy, accurate, and present. Mids are, of course, the highlight of the 600 series and here you are getting the best mids nearly of any headphone unless you step up humongous amounts of $. The soundstage is fantastic. It’s not too wide or too narrow. It’s just right. Where these really shine is the treble for me. These present fatigueless, milky smooth, crystal clear, purely magical, ear soothing, and perfectly accurate highs. These are a 9.5/10 headphone and S tier. You can’t beat these even if you pay $500. If you can get them for less than $500 then you are getting the best deal of your life in headphones.<br/><br/>They are significantly better than the 650. We aren’t talking a little here. There’s a huge jump of at least 30% in clarity and imaging. Huge. I bought these and the Fiio K5 Pro. I’ve never heard sound so good in my life and I used the Creative Z with the HD 650s for years. As soon as I put these on and listened even for a little bit, I was floored by what I was getting. I said the highs were the best part right? The IMAGING!! What the heck? Let me tell you I listen to music from video game OSTs more than really anything.  Wow. Incredible. This will show you details in something as old as SNES music that you never even knew existed. The imaging on these has to be some of the best in the entire world. Sounds pop up all around you and it doesn’t just sound like two speakers hitting your ears. Phenomenal imaging. They sound so clear. If you’re on the fence like I was, just get these. Do it! They’re glorious. They’re glorious with any DAC assuming they have enough power. Yes, my K5 Pro sounds way better than my other DACs, but stepping down into a lower DAC is not a disappointment at all. They’re still top tier and the best.<br/><br/>Yea, I don’t care about all the Sundara &amp; DT 1990 hype. Those two don’t image like these do. If you absolutely must have the bass, then these may disappoint, but if you aren’t a bass head, then these are a no-brainer. I’ll also help you here. If you really can’t justify the pricetag of these, then get the Philips SHP 9500 with the K5 Pro or E10K-TC. This combo will probably be a little cheaper, but it will sound pretty good &amp; similar. The 9500 with the K5 Pro is quite exceptional. You won’t have the milky smooth highs though. But, if you *only* are in need of headphones, then get the 660 S. Do whatever you have to do to get your hands on them.<br/><br/>Here's another tidbit. You can repair the HD 660 S easily with spare HD 650, 600, or 660 S parts. Everything can basically be tool-lessly repaired in the 600 line. It’s extremely supported with cables galore everywhere. The issue with the Sundaras and the 1990s is that they’re not going to have the level of support that the 660 S has. There’s a reason that the 600 series have been going strong since 1997.<br/><br/>The 660 S is the gold standard now and every headphone should be attempting to live up to their magic. Yes, they’re legendary. Yes, the legend continues.</span>

<span>I’ve been using these everyday for work and working out for about 5 months now and they’ve held up fantastically and always work as expected. The noise canceling function works spectacularly and is great for whatever noise you may have to cancel out. I used it on a plane recently and it was so effective at cancelling out the loud engine sounds. Aware mode is awesome as well as I can use it at work or in public without feeling nervous that I might miss someone talking to me.</span>

<span>These sound good sitting at a desk or on a plane, but they don’t do a very good job with wind sound when walking or sitting outside. They also click if you push on them a little bit, which happens a lot with high back seats, such as on an airplane.<br/><br/>I think the click is due to the trapped air pressure inside the headphone while it Is pushed up against your face; it causes a plastic membrane inside to deflect and makes a click sound. It makes them sound cheap when it happens and I’m worried it will break them eventually.</span>

<span>I bought these for my husband, he had a cheaper set,  similar design, where the ear covers fold they were made of plastic, each had broken in that spot. I decided to buy him a sturdier set. I did my homework &amp; found Boise was the only one without that piece being plastic. Once he put them on he could tell the difference! High quality sound was amazing! Like night &amp; day! He wears hearing aids but he no longer needs them while wearing his headphones! They are true noise canceling headphones!! Wife’s buy at your own risk.. I can be sitting 3ft from him, screaming his name, trying to talk to him, it’s like I’m not even in the room!!</span>

<span>I use my noise cancelling headphones while I clean the house. It cancels out most of the vacuum noises so that I can hear the music.<br/>I usually use these headphones on the plane. I haven’t flown yet using these headphones, but my previous older model was aaa battery operated and was not wireless.<br/>The headphones, when I turn them on, give me a percentage of battery life left. I have a recharging cable, and wire for hard wire if I ever need to connect to to a plane’s radio. I did buy an extra plane connector that did not come with the headset. I spent around $10 for the item on Amazon. I use my 20w apple adapter and USB-C to USB adapter to connect to the recharging cable when charging.<br/>Bose is by far the leader in most headsets. The sound quality is far above that of most headsets I’ve tried. I got this during Amazon days and spent $229 for it.<br/>I would not let the battery sit at 100 percent without use and I would not let the battery be drained. Both of these things are bad for the battery. There is a one year warranty from the date of purchase and a battery life of 4-5 years on the headset. There is no way to change the battery.<br/>Bose always comes out with better headsets. I may upgrade mine in the future if it has the option to be wired for use with most plane audio/visual apparatus.</span>

<span>A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program.  While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review.  Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Excellent noise cancelling<br/>Very good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)<br/>Battery life<br/>Excellent Bluetooth range<br/>Automatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency mode<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Touch controls are simply awful!<br/>Dual Bluetooth device support<br/>Constant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabled<br/>Voice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make.  A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.<br/>Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left ear<br/>Somewhat complex set up process<br/><br/>Overall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones.  The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent.  This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available.  The Bluetooth range is also exceptional.  Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone.  They have long battery life and charge quickly.  They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful.  There are many other features with a range of benefit.<br/><br/>Comfort:<br/>They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush.  However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.)  If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.<br/><br/>They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses.  They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.<br/><br/>Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:<br/>These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously.  The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time.  I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones.  I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app.  I was then able to play music from the MacBook.  I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something.  It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky.  Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch.  Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device.  Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.<br/>This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where.  This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35.  I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.<br/><br/>While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device.  It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device.  Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2.  The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.<br/><br/>I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app.  This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices.  It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices.  You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device.  You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected.  You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.<br/><br/>Bluetooth range is excellent.  It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another.  The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.<br/><br/>Sound Quality:<br/>Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent.  For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones.  Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.<br/>The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable.  Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response.  More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep.  You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight.  The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies.  Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified.  Male and female vocals sound good and natural.<br/>The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment.  These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment.  High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.<br/>The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences.  I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.<br/><br/>If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones.  They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier.  That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.<br/><br/>I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth.  The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth.  I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones.  They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing.  The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound.  Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good.  Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.<br/><br/>I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet.  This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS.  You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it.  You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play.  I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better.  To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.<br/><br/>I did try the DSEE Extreme feature.  This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content.  I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music.  It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better.  At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies.  It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable.  This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used.  The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.<br/><br/>The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal.  I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup.  I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic.  There was some front/rear placement depth.  It was interesting to play with for a while.  What I found though is that it just sounded strange.  I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical.  Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable.  It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above.  Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks.  Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical.  By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.<br/><br/>Phone calls<br/>The audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations.  With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls.  They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.<br/>Phone call microphone:<br/>Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with.  Most people said I sounded fine.  I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone.  They said I sounded “far away.”  On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.<br/>They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19.  This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.<br/><br/>Noise cancellation<br/>These are fantastic at noise cancellation.  I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35.  At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call.  My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these.  I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these.  I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring!  Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music.  I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane.  Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice.  They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.<br/><br/>One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls).  These definitely exceed the rated battery life.  With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use.  I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge.  Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable.  On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic.  It is more than enough though.  It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use.  Almost any other use it should be more than enough.  I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.<br/><br/>Charging:<br/>These charge with a USB-C connector.  They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply.  They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it).  You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging.  I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity.  They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power.  In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick.  It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.<br/><br/>User interface:<br/>This is the worst aspect of these headphones.  The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable.  Simple buttons would have been much better.  Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing.  You try and turn the volume down and track changes.  To be fair, they do have a volume control.  The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.<br/>Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right.  Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume.  Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume.  Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that.  I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times.  Simple buttons would have been SO much better.<br/><br/>Voice assistant:<br/>Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device.  It will then want to pair with Bluetooth.  I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt.  If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.<br/><br/>Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app).  You could just say Alexa and it worked.  You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would.  It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app.  The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though.  This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content.  It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume.  Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems.  This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better.  It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google).  I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.<br/><br/>The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying.  At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard.  This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode.  While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode.  This mostly works.  In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it.  Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode.  There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet.  You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while.  Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.<br/><br/>Another feature is adaptive sound control.  This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions.  This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc.  I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.<br/><br/>As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying.  It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions.  This can be disabled in the app.  If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well.  (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!)<br/><br/> App<br/><br/>The app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones.  Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual.  The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more.  You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears.  I went through the whole process.<br/>There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK.  It can be a bit confusing.<br/><br/>The app does provide a lot of control and information.  It shows battery level, and the current codec in use.  This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details.  Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.<br/><br/>Case, accessories<br/>A nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35.  It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.<br/><br/>A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system.  The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling.  It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.<br/><br/>While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.<br/><br/>Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.</span>

<span>I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.<br/>Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in  the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.<br/>Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.<br/>I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.</span>

<span>Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).<br/>My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).<br/>In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.<br/>Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.<br/>Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.</span>

<span>I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II.  I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later).  The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II.  However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.<br/><br/>Sound: A-<br/>First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II.  Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy.  With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great.  A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality.  The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi.  Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback.  However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.<br/><br/>Noise cancelling: A-<br/>When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling.  It wasn't present with the XM3.  I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4.  I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely.  The XM3 still has some leakage.  The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better.  The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.<br/><br/>Multipoint Bluetooth: F<br/>This was the feature I had been waiting for.  The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once.  FAIL!  I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4.  I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed.  Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated.  So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth.  Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless.  This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device.  However, the way it manages connections is very poor.  I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer.  If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound.  Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio.  I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play.  If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless.  With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode.  They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed.  So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3.  I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them.  With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it.  But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet.  At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for.  I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.<br/><br/>Comfort: A<br/>Compared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on.  The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.<br/><br/>Controls: B<br/>I totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls.  Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead.  It's a small annoyance.  On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.<br/><br/>In-call: D<br/>One thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking.  Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it.  If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on.  Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated.  Super slow and awkward and unusable.  So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak.  When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day.  Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone.  I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them.  I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this.  Fail.<br/><br/>Auto-mute: F<br/>Sony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking.  Nice in concept - terrible in practice.  I just turned it off and left it off.  If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time.  So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening.  What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying.  So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous:<br/>I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone.  With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot.  It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching.  The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable.  I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great.  Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones.  This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones.  How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use?  It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product.  If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it.  The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3.  Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering.  The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3.  In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark.  I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones.  As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back.  Sadly, they are not as advertised.</span>
