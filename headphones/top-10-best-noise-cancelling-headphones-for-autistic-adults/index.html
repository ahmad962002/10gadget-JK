<span>I am on the autism spectrum and also have had two post concussion situations and these have saves me from chronic noise intolerance. I sleep with them on and find the hard shell very study for side sleeping. Eventually the over the head part starts doing weird stuff that molded plastic does and I have to wrap the top up with fabric so it doesn’t pull my hair out but other than that they’re magic. I’ve had three pairs—one stollen, one lent and never returned, and now this new pair.</span>

<span>This is very much a "buy once, cry once" tool. I have a much older 3M work tunes that only has radio (not even aux) that has lasted since jesus wore sandals and has been beat around the block many times. My older worktunes works great, but i really wanted aux and bluetooth. so far, the new worktunes is just as bulletproof as my old one, only now i don't have to listen to 20 minutes of radio ads while i'm working.<br/><br/>as regular ear pro, they aren't the best in the world. i have remmington ear pro for shooting that are WAY better at blocking sound, but the worktunes are definitely good enough for OSHA work</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have to have hearing protection at my jobs, and it's incredibly helpful to be able to hear one someone is calling me. Being able to listen to music/podcasts is a big plus too.<br/><br/>The first pair I had gave out after a couple years of regular, kinda rough use. I probably could have replaced the charging jack but these are reasonably priced.<br/><br/>I've had this second pair for quite a while, using them even harder and more often. Still good. And even though I fell off a roof with them this week, the sound is still pretty decent! You wouldn't know from seeing them, they didn't crack or anything.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I read the reviews and so far no one knows exactly how long the battery lasts. Well my fellow customers, I know the answer. 44hrs is the life of the headset. The first 60% will last 40 hrs. The last 40% gets eaten up in 3-4 hours. I work 10hrs shifts and I use it even on lunch, so I absolutely use it for all 10hrs of work. Don't expect crazy bass or it to get very loud, however, it's not a push over either. No one can hear your audio until you lift your head set. I ONLY used it for music because, where I work, calling is a fruitless endeavor for how loud it is. Highly recommend for those who do 40hrs work weeks. For the others, just charge after 3-4 days. Last thing, I have a very big head and these feel great even after 10hrs, just a little bit sweaty when you take them off.</span>

<span>We went to an air show and initially my 2yr old didn’t want to wear it but after one flyby with me covering her ears, she wanted it back on. After that she didn’t mind wearing it the entire air show. After that she didn’t want me to take it off.<br/><br/>I cannot say it is actual NRR per rating but I believe them since I do use 3M earmuff at work.

Loud noises can cause permanent hearing loss and even accelerate the process of becoming deaf. The need for hearing protection is often misunderstood and underestimated. Noise levels above 125 decibels for even short periods of time, can cause permanent hearing loss. When exposed to these decibels for longer periods of time The effects are even worse. Our high noise reduction rating (26NRR) ear muffs are one of the best ways to protect your hearing from damage.

<span>Obviously these things will not cancel out ALL SOUNDS.  However, they change the sound of a loud lawn mower or circular saw into a quiet lawn mower or circular saw.  The ear cups are also deep enough that I can wear my wireless earbuds without having them pressed into my ears like other earmuffs do. I wear them for long periods of time while doing yard maintenance or using power tools in my shop and have not felt any discomfort.  Pair these with a set of active noise canceling ear buds and you will be amazed.</span>

This year for the 4th of July I wanted him to enjoy himself outside with out worrying about the noise of fireworks.  He put them on, no fussing with having to adjust to his level. He ran around the yard, he helped light up some fireworks we bought, head set stayed on his head. Someone lit off a firework two houses  down and it didn't bother him one bit.

<span>They cancel noise well but still allow my son to hear me if I speak loudly.  A big plus is that they are pretty comfortable for such inexpensive earmuffs.  So many kiddos with noise sensitivity would not keep them on if they weren't comfortable.</span>

<span>Bought these for my students in fourth grade. They fit but I wish the band was a bit longer and more adjustable. Especially for students that have slightly bigger heads. Overall, cute colors and does the job! I tried them on and it does truly muffle the noise.</span>

<span>These were a great price. Although my 2 year old refused to wear them. I put them on and didn’t feel that they canceled a ton of noise (they did help some), but they prob didn’t fit me properly since they are for kids.</span>

<span> If all you're looking for is a simple cheap pair of noise canceling headphones, then these are for you. So far I have been able to use power tools with these and it has decreased much of the sharp sounds in which I wanted it to decrease. They are adjustable and holds their adjustments once on your head. I was even able to put on eye protection, which went around my ears, and the cushion was able to still mold itself around the glasses and maintain a decent level of noise cancelation.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a very basic noise canceling headphones for short periods of time and not looking to spend a great deal of money, then these noise canceling headphones are definitely the ones to go for.  They're not fancy but they're also not expensive which not expensive which works great for me at least. Even my teenage boys were able to wear them comfortably to get some noisy work completed. In total I bought 3, and all three worked as advertised for adult sized heads.</span>

<span>The function is fine, though it is noise blocking, not cancelling.  The spring that clamps it on the head is rather strong and is not adjustable. I can wear it over my glasses OK. Somebody with a large head might find it too tight. The length of the muff supports can be varied over about 1/2 inch but at its longest is only marginally long enough for me. I only use it for short periods so cannot comment on hours-long use.</span>

<span>Figured with a two pack we could use them for more than a few things. We've wood chipper with then and lawn mowed. They do muffle the sound. I can't really hear much of anything someone says. But they will come in handy when we go to monster trucks next year. I think they are fine. They muffle and protect from loud sounds. They fit my head, my husband and my toddler son's. Soo I think the fit is decent for multiple age ranges.</span>
