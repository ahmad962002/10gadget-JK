<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have the 80 *OHM's......<br/><br/>*(The unit of electrical resistance, named after the nineteenth-century German physicist Georg Ohm.)<br/><br/>....... and they are EPIC! This range comes in 32 ohm, 80 ohm and 250. These are what us audiophiles call a reference headphone. 32 ohms will run on most phone and laptops etc just fine. Want to really hear how good they are? You need a DAC. 80 Ohms will work on phones etc but won't sound good and will be very quiet. 250 Ohms needs a big DAC and Amp. Everyday listening go for the 32 Ohms. Reference headphones are tuned to a very flat curve and are not really for getting down and rocking out, although you can play with a parametric equalizer and they will sound amazing! I see folks here that bought the 250's and wonder why they sound bad. Needs power! Dac and Amps are not expensive. Want big sound, thumping bass, V shaped tuning then Skullcandy Crusher EVO will be more you thing. Beyerdynamic is a German company. With German build quality and amazing sound. Look great, comfortable for long listening. This model does NOT have ANC and thats fine because you don't need it. They are closed and well insulated. Also NOT wireless! Audiophiles don't really do Bluetooth listening as it's limited in dynamic range. Most will want the 32 ohms. But if you wanna get gloriously pure sound then buy a Small DAC and boogie! 11 out of 10 RECOMMENDED!</span>

<span>GET THE ASURION 3 or 4 YEAR PROTECTION PLAN! - At the time of this review the 3 year is available but not the 4; when I bought this headset they had a 4 year plan.<br/>I've owned the 250's since late October 2020, this is my first audiophile headset and I've loved it for 2 years.<br/><br/>THE COMPLAINTS:<br/>I'm forced to dock a star (for overall quality) because I lost audio in my right ear piece completely and had to send it in for repair. I got an email notifying me today that it couldn't be repaired which basically meant it would be cheaper for them to refund me the current price for a new one instead of repairing it and sending it back to me.<br/><br/>If I had to guess it was something called the "driver" that went bad since I've heard those are expensive to replace but ultimately I haven't been told what exactly failed.<br/>My next complaint is the lack of a detachable cable/jack at the point of connection with the headset itself; this is worthy of docking another star particularly for the 250's since the cable is coiled and heavier on the connection point but I won't do that with this review because I still love this headset.<br/>Furthermore I do not allow the entire length of the coiled cable to dangle from the connection point, granted it is still a possible point of failure that cannot be easily dealt with... without voiding the warranty.<br/><br/>THE REVIEW - 250 OHM:<br/>This is my first audiophile headset with a dac/amp (FiiO K5 Pro); from day one I have enjoyed the sound experience with this headset. It was an ear tingling experience that was like a massage when I first got them which was very exciting.<br/>Compared to all the terrible "office/gaming headsets" I've wasted money on over the last 15 years this headset stands above them all a champion amongst the rabble.<br/><br/>The sound is outstanding - The clarity of being able to hear everything happening in a song is something I've come to love and nothing sounds too distant or quiet/buried with this headset. When I first got the headset some of the highs did sound a little bit harsh/sharp but with time I either got used to it or it aged out with use.<br/><br/>For the bass enthusiasts - The bass may be a little lacking but I personally feel the bass is as it should be; I refuse to dock a star for a non issue. If you want more bass then get the 80's if you don't mind sacrificing the benefits of the 250's which in my opinion isn't worth it unless you plan on owning both variants of the headset.<br/><br/>The ear pads are quite comfortable - I wear glasses but I've never experienced any uncomfortable pressure being applied to them when putting the headset on.<br/>Unfortunately, If you've had your headset awhile like I have and notice external noises are louder than they used to be then chances are your ear pads are sunken/worn down and need replacing. I believe there are 3rd party replacements available but it's been about a year since I went looking.</span>

<span>I'm no expert, but I am slowly building up my affordable studio, to be a content creator, and I also love making music with Reason, and these are my first high quality studio headphones with a good even spectrum of sound reproduction and I am absolutely in love with these. Amazing sound. It also picks up most or all sub bass. I know there are supposedly better things out there, but this is like 99% or 98% perfection for a reasonable price. Good enough for my needs. And, with the 32 ohm, you don't need to buy an amplifier.<br/><br/>They grip a little tight on my big head, so prolonged use can become a bit painful.<br/><br/>!!Warning!! My wife liked them so much I had to buy her a pair.<br/><br/>Tip: if you are using Windows and the sound is distorted, make sure you go into your Windows sound properties and turn off the Equalizer, and also turn off Loudness Equalization (which will cause horrible distortion at times)</span>

<span>Edit: The plastic L/R parts WILL crack on the inside and eventually break.  With heavy use(most or a good chunk of every day), you can expect them to crack within around a year, though they may still work perfectly fine.  Over time the cracks get worse to where they need to be replaced, and while beyerdynamic will replace them free of charge(at least under warranty), they're around $45 shipped on their own.  This all said I suggest getting 3D printed replacements, they can be found on thingiverse.  You should be able to find them by looking for beyerdynamic slider repair kit.  There is also another version under "Remix" on that page which looks similar to the originals.  As well I found one with a more appealing L and R if you click "Thing Details" and click the TinkerCAD link, then find the one under "Original &amp; Copies" on that page.  I would also suggest ABS plastic as it should be durable enough, and generally better than PLA for a part under any sort of stress.<br/><br/>TLDR?:Overview at the bottom.<br/>Amazing.  I upgraded from the AudioTechnica ATH-M50's, and I'm glad I did.  In terms of overall clarity I can't say that they blow the M50's out of the water or anything, but I love the sound of these cans.  While a frequency response graph may not agree completely, I'd say they have that fUn curve, flat enough to not be too overwhelming, but definitely more bass and treble than mids.  And my god the bass, if you think the M50's are bass monsters I'd say you're crazy(even before hearing these), it might be the really good isolation on these helping out, but they boom.  Again it's not overwhelming, but very punchy out of the box, and either I've grown used to it or it has slowly died down some over time(which can happen as the clamping force calms down, and possibly burn in if you believe in that).  If you don't understand what I mean, think of a gun shot in a movie or videogame, it's brief but loud and hard hitting....so it's like that, the bass is "punchy"(or tight) as in it hits you then stops, and it's like you can feel the impact.  It can make playing a first person shooter like Battlefield 4 very engaging.  The highs on the other hand are quite harsh and sharp in my opinion, in a way that any bad quality audio can become quite obnoxious, or a song that was recorded in a way in which some highs are already kind of harsh to listen to(guitar solo in Daft Punk's Aerodynamic, love the song, but those highs still feel harsh).  So basically sibilance or other bad artifacts in a recording can become quite noticeable.  These are meant for professionals and often used in studios so it should be expected that they be rather accurate and unforgiving.<br/><br/>The clamping force out of the box is easily bearable, they might be tight to someone used to a very light headphone, and possibly fatiguing to some.  To compare to the M50's again, when I got mine(M50's) I thought I was going to return them the second I had put them on my head.  M50's NEED to be stretched out some, otherwise I could almost guarantee you'll experience fatigue wearing them.  That said the M50's do stretch out fairly fast.  Anyways as I said the clamping force is strong but nothing that should stop people from being able to wear them for a few hours thanks to the comfy pads.  The pads are nice and soft, but strong enough to hold up and not give in under pressure, and the cans are big enough that they should fit the vast majority of ears, unlike some "circumaural" headphones that end up with the pads resting on all but a child's ears.  In my opinion the sizing of the headband could be better, the spacing between notches leaves me with one side 1 notch longer than the other.  Not a huge issue but somewhat bothersome.  The 250ohm version will very likely benefit from a dedicated amplifier, if you don't have much money but are using this on a PC, the Objective2 amplifier(sold by many different audio companies) are nice amplifiers for the money, and about the cheapest that can handle many high end headphones pretty well.  Note that some desktops might handle them well enough these days, but I'd suggest using the rear output as it's usually better, but depends on the built in audio solution on the motherboard.  My only other con is that they use a coiled cable, now I don't hate coiled cables, but I do find they're often way too tight and not forgiving enough to be useful.  I guess I could also say that the headband is pleather and feels rather cheap, but as it's replaceable along with many other parts of these headphones, for that I can forgive it...especially as most headphones headband's padding are built in and can't be replaced.<br/><br/>Edit: The included travel pouch feels cheap, but is plenty big enough to fit everything easily. I tried them out on a friend's laptop, it was some fairly cheap laptop from his work, and it easily powered these past comfortable levels.  That said I didn't do any serious listening, but I was quite sure the quality of the audio solution built into it wasn't that great.(End of Edit)<br/><br/>Note: The ATH-M50's are over 2 years old, maybe even closer to 3, so the clamping force on them is fairly weak, and being someone with glasses means they likely don't get a perfect seal.  Therefore take some comparisons with a slight grain of salt, I'd still prefer the 770's over the M50's but they aren't bad cans by any means.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Pros:<br/>-Tight boomy bass without being overwhelming<br/>-Clear enough for many professionals(often used for studio monitoring)<br/>-Fun U(or V) sound signature<br/>-Comfy velour pads<br/>-Quality materials<br/>-Most parts are replaceable(fairly easily for the padding)<br/>-Great passive noise isolation, but can still hear if needed<br/>-Big enough to fit most heads/ears<br/>-Carry bag can hold the headphones and cable easily, it's huge...though cheap feeling<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Sharp/harsh highs<br/>-Sizing the headband could have better fine adjustment<br/>-Pads need replacement every 1-2 years depending on usage(even with cleaning they will flatten out and change the sound)<br/>-Coiled cable is rather tight and unforgiving<br/>-Clamping force *might* be too much for the more sensitive(nowhere near as bad as ATH-M50's)<br/>-250ohm version may not reach full potential with portable use/weak built in amplifiers on products(to be expected from high impedance versions and there is the 80ohm version...and now 32ohm)<br/>-Pleather headband feels cheap, but it is replaceable</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought these for an oddly specific reason, I needed a headphone with a flat side so I could attach a head tracking unit to for gaming. I have a collection of headphones already, but none were suitable (or I was unwilling) to slap some velcro on them. I've heard good things about these in the past, and they were the right price.<br/><br/>Like most budget headphones (and even some more expensive ones), the pads are hot garbage. They're thin, have no real padding, they don't seal, and they're on-ears which can be remarkably painful if you have certain ear piercings, or just sensitive ears. Change the pads. I already have several aftermarket sets, so I found a velour pair that fit them. They're slightly too big, but they were my smallest set. I've ordered another set that should fit better.<br/><br/>They do clamp quite a bit. I'm a bigger guy, 6'4" and around 275, so I have a decent sized noggin. Since they're plastic, they should break in over time. If not, I'll put them around something to stretch them out. The clamping force is definitely noticeable, but so far, after wearing them for several hours at a time, it hasn't gotten to the point where I feel like I have to take them off.<br/><br/>Sound isolation is great. I've been using mostly open and semi open back headphones for a while now, and it caught me off guard how much these shut out. They're almost as good as putting ear plugs in.<br/><br/>The sound is good. Really good. I have a fairly sizeable collection of incredible budget headphones from brands like Koss, Superlux, Samson, Fostex, Monoprice, AKG, Philips and more. What really surprised me about these is how clear they are. They bring out things that I haven't heard out of my other headphones, and they make everything sound good. Some headphones are very clinical, if your source is bad, they sound bad. These are a headphone that make everything sound good. High quality FLAC? Sounds good. Old 128hz MP3s that you've had for 20 years? Sounds good. YouTube's crappy compression? Sounds good. It's odd to have a headphone that's as detailed as these, yet still makes everything sound good. Usually there's a compromise between the two.<br/><br/>I'm very sensitive to highs, and I was worried that these would be unusable for me, as most "flat", monitoring, or detailed headphones grate on my ears. I'm happy to say that the highs with these are pretty relaxed and easy to listen to. Sibilance is something I simply can't tolerate, it's the one thing that will make me rip off a set of headphones immediately. Songs like Marilyn Manson's If I was Your Vampire can be torture on some headphones. With these, it's fine.<br/><br/>Mid range is present and very full, though I've found vocals can be recessed sometimes. I don't know if it's due to the recording or maybe the pads I'm using, but I'll see if it changes when the new pads come in. I've only noticed it when listening to certain songs.<br/><br/>Bass is very present (not with the stock pads, no seal means no bass). I had to retrain my ears because I was using something pretty bassy the past few weeks, so at first these felt very thin in that area. But now that I've spent several hours with these, I can say that they do have a pleasing amount of bass, but it isn't going to make your ears wiggle or anything. These are meant to be monitors after all, but the mid bass is still fairly punchy. It does reach down farther than I expected. I don't recall what exactly it was I was listening to, but I was surprised at how far down the sub bass went.<br/><br/>These don't have a super wide soundstage, but that's to be expected with a closed back headphone. It does decently well though, when using these in gaming I don't find myself wanting to reach for one of my open back pair. They image pretty well, and separation is above average for a pair of sub $100 cans.<br/><br/>If I had to compare these to something, they almost sound like my Edifier R1280T speakers, just without the massive soundstage. To compare them to a headphone, think a closed back, warmer, fuller sounding AKG K240. Maybe not quite as detailed.<br/><br/>I can't speak for durability yet as I just got them, but they feel good, a lot more solid than expected.<br/><br/>I purchased these as "Like new - Used", for under $18. Other than the 6.5mm adapter being missing, I can't tell they've been used. (And I don't care about the adapter, I have tons of those things floating around.) They're brand new. Not a single hair, spot of skin oil, or spec of dust on them. So I won there.<br/><br/>These things are great! Very much recommend.</span>

<span>I was recommended this all the way in 2015 by YouTuber MKBHD and I was very happy with my purchase. It has served me many years of great listening. I used it mainly for video editing and just general music listening. Overtime the cups had a bit of wear and tear and even one of the latches broke on one side so it didn’t sit correctly on my head. Since I had a warranty I just contacted them and they replace it for me so I commend them on that front. This is a good priced set of on ear headphones for the price and would highly recommend if you were I. The fence about it.</span>

<span>I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‑Technica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‑Technica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:<br/><br/>------------Sound Quality------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - Winner<br/>Highs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than Senhiser<br/>Mids - Quite good representation<br/>Lows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled well<br/>Overall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)<br/>Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh sounding<br/>Mids - Nothing special, no major issues<br/>Lows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back design<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd Best<br/>Highs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.<br/>Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddied<br/>Lows - A bit boomy but very spacious<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>Highs - Quite good representation, a bit cold though<br/>Mids - Nothing special, no major issues though<br/>Lows - Too over-emphasized<br/><br/>-----------------Comfort---------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770 - Winner<br/>Perfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic Premium 990<br/>I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599<br/>I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>These were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.<br/><br/>----------------Usability---------------<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 770<br/>These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average.<br/><br/>Beyerdynamic DT 990<br/>These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. But I could not hear others quite as well as I could with the HD 599's.<br/><br/>Senhiser HD 599<br/>The interchange-able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go. The cable is also thinner and more flexible than the Beyerdynamic cable. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. The only downfall is the issue I had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where I would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer.<br/><br/>Audio Technica ATH M-50x<br/>I really love the long coiled cable that came with these. To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you.</span>

<span>I am a classic music lover, and this product fits my needs perfectly.  I was tired of putting up with shoddy designs that fall apart. Often it is the foam isolation that fails. In my lab I located a worn-out pair of Bose earphones, and I was determined to effect some kind of repair. I invented a new design that yields an earphone that is at least the equal of the best on the market, including Bose, Sennheiser, and even ATH.<br/><br/>I will tell you how to do it.<br/><br/>I begin by pulling apart the sticky elements that hold the earphone together, until I am left with a foam ring and a few pieces of cloth. The process continues --<br/><br/>1. Stick the foam ring and pieces of cloth back onto the earphone cup.<br/><br/>2. Mount a single layer of Beige Masking Tape over the cup, pulling on the tape edges to create a flat surface. An overlap of perhaps 3/16 inch between pieces of tape can be used.<br/><br/>3. Fold the edges of the tape around the edge of the cup, to hold it in place.<br/><br/>4. Apply a thin ring of Gorilla Expanding Glue to the surface of the tape and use your forefinger to distribute it uniformly over the entire surface in the thinnest possible layer. You want to minimize the weight of the resulting membrane.<br/><br/>5. Set aside to dry - about two hours.  I did this five times to perfect my technique.<br/><br/>This process has unexpected consequences. The masking tape acts as a membrane interface between the cup and the ear. Before coating, the tape is floppy with poor frequency response.  But as the glue dries, it permeates the tape, creating a semi-transparent membrane with perfect compliance to the sound wave. This may be observed in process.<br/><br/>As the glue dries, the frequency response suddenly increases to equal that of the best of good headphones, and the new membrane will respond to every nuance in the available sound.  Expanding Gorilla Glue is a MAGIC component in this design. The combination of Gorilla Glue and Masking Tape yields a new membrane that is unsurpassed in acoustical properties.<br/><br/>An even greater surprise comes when we see there is no aperture in the new membrane. The cup is completely covered with a continuous membrane that delivers complete<br/>compliance with the sound wave. Then the great rolling bass and bell-like treble of the Steinway Model D concert grand piano is fully revealed.</span>

AKG'S MOST POPULAR PROFESSIONAL HEADPHONE. A classic design which has become a standard in monitoring. Now with Varimotion XXL capsule for studio sound at home and for portable use. The 'integrated semi-open air' design incorporates a highly accurate dynamic transducer, and an acoustically tuned venting structure behind the element produces a naturally open sound quality. The circumaural (around-the-ear) pads are designed for hours of wearing comfort, while the steel-cable, self-adjusting headband construction and single-sided professional quality audio interconnect ensure extended reliability in demanding professional studio applications. Proven, popular, excellent - New, improved and even better. Made in China. The item includes the OFC screw type cable.   From the Manufacturer   The AKG K 240 Studio is an update of the "classic" AKG K 240 Monitor. The new K 240 Studio delivers even wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity than its well-known and widely-used predecessor. The secret to the semi-open K 240 Studio's sound quality is the new XXL transducers in acoustically tuned vented enclosures with circumaural (around the ear) pads. The circumaural pads envelope your ears nicely and reward you with smooth, solid bass and well-balanced, articulate mids and highs.Founded in Vienna, Austria in 1947, AKG has built a legendary reputation in the professional audio industry for products that perform flawlessly. The reputation of AKG and its celebrated quality are built on more than 55 years of experience, incredible design, meticulous craftsmanship and a clear understanding of what truly sounds right. AKG introduced the K 140 in 1974 and the K 240 Monitor in 1975, which became the most widely used headphones in recording studios and broadcast facilities worldwide. Generations of musicians and audio engineers use these AKG products to create great mixes, hit songs and albums cherished by millions around the world. The new AKG Professional Studio headphones carry on the tradition of these audio tools and are a sound investment that will pay handsome returns with years of flawless sonic performance for professional recording engineers and demanding users of high quality home or portable audio equipment. Delivers solid bass and well-balanced mids and highs XXL Transducers with Varimotion DiaphragmThe new XXL transducers use AKG's patented Varimotion diaphragm to ensure extremely accurate response at any listening level. This technology creates a diaphragm that is thinner, more elastic toward the outside edges for more powerful bass response and thicker, less resonant in the center for pure, accurate mids and clear, detailed highs. The large size of the transducers makes the overall sound more life-like and three-dimensional to capture the emotional and sonic content of your soundtracks.Gimbal-Type SuspensionTo ensure your listening comfort, AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a self-adjusting headband with a flexible steel structure to deliver optimum fit for your headphones without any fiddling. The structure is flexible, yet strong enough to allow bending for single ear use and is durable enough to withstand rough handling. A gimbal-type suspension ensures the earcups of all AKG Professional Studio models will conform to the shape and size of your ears without pressing on them for hours of fatigue-free, comfortable listening.Wear Them As You LikeRugged construction, a non-twisting headband, and powerful sound allow you to use your headphones on a single ear only or wear them in any other way you may prefer. AKG Professional Studio headphones are ideal for DJ and live sound use because they are durable enough to withstand the roughest kind of handling during transport or on stage.Detachable Cable with Mini XLR ConnectorThe new AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a detachable input cable for easy replacement if ever necessary. The cable and headphones use mini XLR connectors for perfect contact and secure mechanical connection. The cable is made of 99.99% oxygen-free copper and has gold plated plugs on both ends including the screw-on 1/8" to 1/4" stereo jack adapter for maximum signal transfer.Perfect for Portable AudioYou need good quality audio for all your listening--including computer, minidisc, portable CD or DAT player--as well as in the studio. Owing to their high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the AKG Professional Series headphones are efficient enough to be used with these lower level output sources and still deliver the high definition sound you need when working in the studio or on stage. The excellent workmanship AKG headphones are known for and high quality components ensure loss-free transmission and reproduction of high-resolution signals from all types of digital audio sources.

<span>I’ve only had these a short time, but so far so good. I needed them for a temporary WFH scenario where normal studio monitors wouldn’t do. My previous headphones’ ear pads and cups were starting to deteriorate and flake off. Since I’d bought that brand/model twice and had the same issue, I decided to switch to the industry standard AKG headphones. I’d seen them being used by others for years, but never owned a pair myself. They’re comfortable, seem to have a flat, even frequency response and they’re lightweight to boot. I notice a bit quicker ear fatigue than my previous brand. Not because of how they sound, but it just feels nice to take them off after, say, half an hour of use. But they’re comfortable enough to wear while working. Would recommend.</span>

<span>For the price - you won’t find a better set of studio headphones - these are great headphones - and their biggest advantage is their semi-open back design - this allows you to get a more natural sound - more air in the headphones - I don’t recommend mixing or mastering with headphones - but using something like this with its semi-open back design at least allows you to get a little better more natural sound in your headphones - it’s at least a good start.</span>

<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm going to start with the cons because there are so few that it's easier to say what these do wrong compared to everything else.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- no rumbling bass. I personally like this, as I find heavy sub-bass such as in Beats Solo 2 headphones or most other consumer sets to be a bit grating after a while, to the point that I have a headache. These headphones are definitely not for bass-heads in any way. You'll be able to tell the rumble is there, but it's not nearly as prevalent as in other headphones. As a result, if you are a bass-head, you'll probably think these are a bit weak. Instead, you'll be hearing the tone and the notes of the bass a lot more than you would with other headphones in the same price range.<br/><br/>- sound leakage/isolation. These are semi-open headphones, meaning sound can get in and get out easier than in a closed-back headphone. Again, I personally haven't had a problem with this yet, but it does limit where you can use them. I found that 50% volume on my laptop was both perfectly loud enough for the music to ring through with power and clarity, while also not bothering those around me. As for sound coming in, I could hear my parents and the TV, but not enough to make out any words. These allow you to be aware of your surroundings, but at the same time they wouldn't work for a train or air travel, as the lack of noise cancelling allows the sounds of the engines and track to overpower the music.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>- the sound. Thanks to the semi-open design, the highs and mids in these headphones are beautiful. You can see for yourself how the semi-open cups change this by covering them with your hands while you're listening, doing so makes the music a bit more claustrophobic with harsher treble. Everything I've tried with them, whether it be Kendrick Lamar, Dying Fetus, Miles Davis, or Nirvana, has sounded better than I've ever heard. These are designed for studio recording, and as a result have a very flat and even sound that doesn't emphasize any particular frequency. They're bright, but not ear piercing. They have bass, but it doesn't drown out the rest of the music, even on an insanely bass-heavy album like 21 Savage &amp; Offset's "Without Warning." Since these are made for studio recording and production, you'll naturally get as close a sound as possible to how the music is supposed to sound, without modifications to any particular. I've been able to hear details in some songs I had no idea were there, and it's a wonderful experience to relive some of my favorite albums with this more studio accurate sound.<br/><br/>- comfort. These headphones are very, very light, with soft leather cushions and a leather headband. While it's a bit odd for headphones that sound this good to be so light initially, it's actually quite nice and allows for extended listening without discomfort. No adjustment is needed when putting these on; instead of having the locking sections most headphones do for adjusting them, these have springs in the headband. This allows them to fit comfortably by just putting them on, without figuring out exactly where each cup needs to be to make it feel right. I personally found the cups to be big enough for my ears to fit almost completely inside of them, but I've seen some complain that they are too small, so take note of that. One of the other benefits of the previously mentioned semi-open design is allowing some air to come through as well; my ears did not get nearly as hot as they did with Beats or Sony Gold or any other closed back headphones I've used, which is something I have been dying to have for a long time.<br/><br/>- looks. Of course this is completely personal taste. I think these headphones look awesome, but I can understand if someone else doesn't. AKG makes another model that is a bit less retro looking called the AKG M220 which might be more someone's style. They're pretty much the exact same headphones, except with a white and black color scheme and a price point that's about $2 higher than these.<br/><br/>- wire. The wire this thing came with is long, longer than I've seen in most stores outside of Fry's or Best Buy. That works great for me, as I'm going to mainly use these in my dorm where I need to move around. You can also buy a replacement wire if this one isn't long enough that's 25 feet. Speaking of replacement, yes, these headphones have a replaceable wire, meaning it's not really a big deal if the wire breaks. It might be a bit difficult to find a cable for them though, as instead of a normal aux cord, these have a 35mm plug on one end and a mini XLR on the other that plugs into the headphones. It's a stronger fit than other headphones I've used with removable wires, but also a slightly confusing design choice. These also come with an adapter for larger plugs such as those you'd find on the headphone port of a receiver, not something I myself needed but welcome nonetheless.<br/><br/>- price. I got these for around $68, an insanely low price for how good these are. You can easily go over $100, $200, or even $300 to try to find headphones that are better than this, but if you're just looking for something to listen to music or even do some of your own recording, these are perfectly fine. As well, that removable wire and other reviews I've seen from trusted source means these are insanely durable; you may never need to buy another pair of headphones again.<br/><br/>In short, these are the best headphones I have ever come across. The sound leakage and lack of sub-bass could be a problem for some people, but personally they weren't massive enough to bring the score down. If you're on the fence, absolutely get these or their sister product the AKG M220's, you won't regret it. Samson makes a model that is clearly based off of these, and from what I've heard they're slightly heavier on the bass, though I personally went with these because of the removable wire and trust I have with the reviewers that recommended these.</span>

<span>My review of the AKG K 240's is a few months in the making.  I've purchased entry level headphones several times in the last number of years, primarily Sennheiser PX-100s and the Koss PortaPros.  Notice that I listed only two headphones, that's because I've had to buy them several times.<br/><br/>Various issues.  First pair of good cans I ever bought, a family pet destroyed.  However, specifically the Sennheiser PX-100s came apart on their own.  Several times.  Sennheisers excellent warranty system got me into new ones every time,so they have not been a bad experience, but it is kind of upsetting to have something you purchase fall apart on it's own.  I digress, but only a little, as durability is a factor here.<br/><br/>The end game of AKG K 240s usage?  I like them, for good reasons.<br/><br/>What I've noticed in the length of I've had them:<br/><br/>The initial cord that comes with the cans is long.  Way too long for casual use.  Chairs run over it, stuff gets snagged, it's an extra foot of cable in your pocket, it's not a portable cord, it's the stay still and love them cord, which makes the cord an excellent cord to come packaged in the box.  Have not yet purchased a smaller cord, but am quite happy that this feature exists to take advantage of.  Most cans, the cord gets messed up, you need a whole new pair of headphones, with these obviously anything happens to the cable, and you can be up and running again with a new cable, and everything's great.<br/><br/>Important point:  Sound.  The sound.  That's why you're buying cans.  That's why you're here now.<br/><br/>The sound is great.  Let me color that tho, my initial experience, meaning first song I played, (after taking off the PortaPros which I had been using religiously for the last year) I could not figure out what happened to all my bass, especially seeing as how these things are so large.<br/><br/>I'll get into the size in a bit, but first things first, the sound.<br/><br/>Today?  The sound is perfect.  It's wonderful.  The profile is one you can get used to, minimal fatigue for good reason, and the precision and granularity feels like you are hooking a stethoscope up to your audio tracks.<br/><br/>Really.<br/><br/>It's great for gaming since, key word here, clarity and directional sound provide great auditory information and it's intuitive.  Nothing's off about the cans in that department save the curious lack of bass when I was someone else, putting these on for the first time.  Lots of headphones amp their bass response.  AKG wonders who these people are.<br/><br/>They're semi-open, which is better for clarity than closed, and great for environmental awareness.  If you've only had closed back phones, assuming you're aware this difference exists, AKG allows your environment to aurally hit you're ear, and the headphones provides a listening stage which sits somewhere nestled inside of it, if you can even believe that.  You're playing XBOX, maybe listening to some tunes, and you can hear your friends nearby.  They can't hear your music, maybe lightly if they're sitting next to you, but you can hear them talking, and your tracks are not in the background, but around you, and the conversation is somewhere all outside of that.<br/><br/>So fidelity is the word here.  In my limited headphone experience, they are of a high caliber in the fidelity department of the Sennheiser PX-100, Grado, PortaPros, and what else is in the entry level good-cans bracket.  The grados I've never had the pleasure of utilizing, but the AKGs are right up there with the other guys, providing a better depth of sound.  Stethoscope to your tunes, baby.  You buy these, you're a doctor now.<br/><br/>Anyway, I used to never want to be caught dead in public wearing anything this big, which is why the sennheisers and koss were such friends of mine, but these look so nice, no one minds.  People just kind of think they're nice or I'm flashy.  They're comfortable around the neck in public for me, but I'm a big guy.  The gimbal suspension makes them always comfortable to wear.  Gimbal means you don't adjust the phones to your head, they adjust to you, however you have them.<br/><br/>So Kudos!  Buy them for yourself, or if they're a gift, and you've made it this far, you're not going to be wrong buying these.<br/><br/>There are other pros, but I couldn't recommend the durability, listening profile, aesthetics, and engaging price any higher.<br/><br/>Cons?  They're not over the ear pads, but they're obviously not supposed to be, so if size is a con, or the fact that they're semi-open is a con, then there's that.  Outside of design, the only cons is that, if you've never experienced them, they look like they should explode your head in bass, but they don't.  Meaning some music can feel like something's lacking when making the transition, but the fidelity of the phone brings the bass into a good contrast of the whole sound profile.</span>

<span>I use these for listening to music, playing games, and watching movies/shows. They are working great for all of these! Sound as good as much more expensive headphones. The only downside is that it's tight on my head, causing too much pressure. To help this, I just stretched them out over a few nights by putting them on my chair's headrest. Almost fully extended across and they didn't break, so that speaks for the build quality also. They seem very durable so far and I don't see any weak points. After doing that, they feel comfortable. Ear pads seem great so far. I tried replacing them with thicker pads, but it made my ears too far away from the speaker, which make it sound worse. So I'm keeping the default pads. No modifications needed.<br/><br/>I currently have a cheaper DAC/AMP while using the Dolby Access app (paid) on Windows and Peace equalizer (just some slight changes). All of those combined make these headphones shine. I can hear a lot more detail in games, crisp enough with bass for music, and nothing these headphones can't handle so far. No ear piercing sounds, no peaking, and good bass. Definitely recommend for the price. Better than headphones 6 times the price.</span>

The cord is all smooth no curling in the cord. Many other ear phones have curling chords that can pinch the hairs on you arms when playing a musical instrument. Even just listening a Curley corded earphone will snatch your clothing or hairs on your body.

<span>8/28/2022 - I bought these back in 2014. They continue to work to this day. Where the cup attaches to the headphone band broke this morning. Considering that's the only issue I've had in 8 years, I'd say even the Gen1 is still a great deal for some really nice headphones.</span>

<span>Very nice sound. Full range is there, and everything is well balanced. Some of the best sounding cans I've tried. Relatively flat response, but not boring or bland. Still great for general listening. The bass tight and clean, and not over emphasized. Mids are full but not muddy. Highs are clear and rich, not harsh like cheap headphones. These are more comfortable than the 40x and 50x from Audio Technica, but still a little heavy, and they could use a bit more padding on the headband, perhaps. But still pretty comfy for a heavy duty pro set of cans. Ear pads are not that thick so there is some potential for tips of my ears to get sore eventually. Hopefully I can find a some thicker replacements. My only real complaint is the coiled cable that comes with them. It's so short and heavy the audio source has to be really close to my head. Fortunately Shure sells a 2.5m straight replacement which I bought and now I can use these for recording and playing my digital piano. Isolation is decent enough, but I haven't tried recording vocals with them yet.  Build quality seems study enough for studio use. Headband is metal inside. But the cups don't rotate so they are not as portable as DJ headphones. Overall I would recommend these to any producer or anyone else who works with audio professionally.</span>

<span>Audio quality is great, I have a big head and these do not crush it. Adjustment is fine on the top. I monitor recorded audio/video for work and these will be perfect for that.</span>

<span>The drivers way above the price range for sure. They sound just about as good, if not better than my trusty old ATH-M40xs.<br/><br/>The only problem with sound is that, because I have a wide head already and I'm stretching out the headband to the max, so much as a yawn will widen my head even further, making this headband emit cracking/popping and squeaking noises as it stretches, around 1.5x as loud as what I'm listening to. It's really disruptive to movies and music. Metal-structure headbands generally don't have this problem, in my experience.<br/>Now, they are my dedicated studio monitor headphones. Like the name intends lmao. The cracking and popping noises, although distracting, doesn't mean it degrades driver performance so they're still very useful for monitoring.</span>

<span>Replaced my 20 year old Sony Studio Monitor headphones. While the sound is not quite as good as the Sonys, they cost about 20% of what I paid for the Sonys, and they're MUCH more comfortable.  I use them for keyboard practice and some hobby recording and they're adequate.</span>

<span>These headphones absolutely require headphone amplification, a quality DAC unit, and a set of Brainwavz earpads. After pairing to an FiiO K3 unit (USB 2.0 @ 32bit, 384kHz), replacing the earpads and running an 8-hour break in, these things sound absolutely incredible. The earpads that came with the unit allow for a bit of a "boxy" sounding, but very, very precise and clean sounding highs and lows. Replacing the earpads allows the precision sound to be fully experienced, while also isolating the sound better (reducing most of the sound other people hear). To be clear, the bass isn't going to vibrate your skull, but it is clean, precise, and powerful, while the volume can go to max without distortion. The mids and highs are crazy clean and can get very, very loud, again without distortion.<br/><br/>$50 headphones<br/>$20 pads<br/>$100 DAC<br/><br/>Worth it.</span>

<span>Obviously not the best of the best, but also not the worse! Budget friendly with studio quality attributes! Very comfortable over ear cushions. Attractive brushed gold design, They sound great and do the job. They are very basic but as I mentioned they do the job! I’ve mixed quite a few projects down using these and the songs came out great. I still use these daily although they were intended as a back up. Thank you!</span>

The K72 Bundle from AKG is a closed-back and over-the-ear studio headphone that features professional-grade 40mm drivers and a self-adjusting headband that is light and comfortable. It can be used with a broad range of playback devices in applications for rehearsals, recording studios, live stages, and more.

The frequency response is 16 Hz to 20 kHz and provides an accurate monitoring solution, which delivers extended low-frequency that gives definition to kick drums and bass guitars.

The 40mm drivers deliver high sensitivity for a powerful output, plus an extended frequency response that reveals every detail.
