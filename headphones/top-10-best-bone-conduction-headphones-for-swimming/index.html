<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I use these two to three times a week, for an hour or so at a time. Battery lasts a long time! Not super comfortable under a swim cap though, will take some fussing around to find a position that works for you. Only complaint, mp3 only! You have to download whatever it is you want to listen to prior…</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>In the beginning, there was the Finis mp3 swimming devices. And it was good in that conducted sound through the bone next to  the ears. It was expensive ($100+) but worked well. Until it didn't.<br/> After my third one died in as many years, I moved to a relatively inexpensive Syrn swim buds. It, too, was good but are in-the-ear buds. At times, the ear plugs would flood or come loose during a swim. Annoying, but for the price, it was what it was. In truth, I liked them so much, I bought one as a gift.<br/>Then a friend raved about the Shokz swim device (then called Aftershokz), which is nearly 3x the price of the Syrn buds. I bought one two swim seasons ago (I swim nearly every day) and they've been flawless, at least so far. The convenience of bone conducting sound and the music quality itself are sooo much better that, to me, it's worth the extra coin. If you can afford them, go for it. If not, the Syrn is a cost-effective option</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I swim laps with these on. They are very comfortable. I don't even realize I am wearing them. I swim 1 to 2 hours at a time and haven't had to charge them yet and the battery is still on high after at least 10 hours of use. The only downsides I have with them are having to convert audiobooks to mp3 files to play and there is no way to fast forward or rewind so if I hit the wrong button I will have to start the book back from the beginning. I'm still super happy with them and they make my swim more enjoyable.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I previously had in ear MP3 players for swimming. Usually after 2 or 3 laps with my old set the sound would be like an echo.The quality of the sound in these is far superior. I only use them for swimming; the sound is actually better under water than above water. There is a little bit of a leaning curve in wearing them and trying to stabilize them with my goggles but they are overall comfortable. I am very pleased with them. I also really like having a carrying case; my previous pair were in a Ziplock bag.</span>

<span>These are fantastic!  Easy to record music onto these headphones.  The aural notification ‘on’ and ‘off’ when wearing these in the pool are also great.  Even tells you what your charging status is.  Easy to put on and off, and not even noticed while swimming, other than the music.  Sound in the pool is great.

<span>Overall these play music really well when they work.  Loading the music is a little funky because there is no bluetooth - you need to connect them via wire and then drag your music onto the device.  You can't sort the play order - the play order is always the order you put the music on the headphones.  You can't just add a song to the middle of  your play list.<br/>I loved having bone conduction music while swimming (don't like putting stuff in my ears) but my first pair only lasted less than 1 year.  At $200/each I probably will buy a 2nd pair but just be aware that even being careful with them they do not last very long.</span>

<span>I’d never considered headphones for swimming: I enjoy the water in my ears, the silence, no distractions, no push notifications, etc. However, I do like having music from the pool deck, depending on what the lifeguard is playing. I saw these advertised on 9to5mac as being a perfect companion to the Apple Watch (Ultra in my case). I figured they were inexpensive enough and it would be nice to have some tunes for certain workouts. I’ve tried them twice now. The first swim, it took me a bit of playing around to make sure they were paired to my watch, then start my workout (which locks the screen). The connection was very spotty and I took them off after 100 yards or so of choppy audio. I tried to be more prepared for my second attempt. I made sure I had an album downloaded to my watch, got them running in the locker room, showered with them successfully and then up to the pool deck. Once I hopped in, it was back to choppy audio and inconsistent connection. I’d get a half second or less of audio at a time. Again, I took them off after 100 yards and figured I’d trouble shoot after my swim. When my workout was complete, I paired them again. As soon as either my watch or the headphones were submerged, the connection went out. If both are above water, they worked well. It seems as if the Bluetooth audio cannot be transmitted underwater. I guess that makes sense, but I know people that have BT devices in their scuba kit to transmit PSI to a dive computer, but that probably doesn’t rely on as robust a connection as BTA does. I’m guessing in order to use these for swimming, you’d have to transmit files to the headphones themselves rather than rely on a Bluetooth connection, but in the days of streaming music services, manual file transmission is like going back to the stone ages. When I look back at the original ad I saw, I see it says “ Connect your iPhone, Android, or any music enabled smartwatch – and enjoy running &amp; biking with streaming music.” A very subtle omission there tells me all I need to know. Unfortunately, these will be going back.</span>

<span>- Comfortable as long as you want to wear them since nothing goes in your actual ear.<br/>- Waterproof so you can use them in a pool / at the beach / the lake / gym / running / etc<br/>- Really comfortable to talk on as a phone. It’s strange but cool…the person’s voice is just…in your head but you hear things normally around you.<br/>- For me, they ironically did not work well in the pool for lap swims but they’re great in all other scenarios. I just couldn't get a good non-muffled sound in the water, especially with earplugs in.<br/>- Good for biking / running / etc since you can hear everything around you as clear as you do with no headphones in<br/>- They’ve been nice for virtual meetings and for driving..people say my voice sounds clear.<br/>- Annoying that they boot into mp3 mode no matter what. I'll never use that mode, but you can't have them boot into mp3. Easy double-click of a button, but an annoyance.</span>

<span>The sound is very good but the USB connection flakeyness makes them unusable.  When I first took them out of the box I read the directions that essentially tell you how flakey they are by telling you not to touch them once connected.  And they follow up by telling you that if the connection to the USB is lost then you have to cycle the power on your computer AND the headphones to get them to work again.  Right out of the box they connected for a moment but even as I VERY gently set them on the desk to charge for the first time the connection was lost.  I rebooted the computer and the headphones...still no connection for data.  Charging works just fine though.  Their last hint was to try a different USB port...so I did that mor gently that I have EVER done with any usb device as not to disturb the the connector on the headphones...and it worked!  I moved my keyboard far from the overly sensitive headphones and began to transfer some podcast mp3 files along with about 20 songs.  The instructions say that you can organize your files into folders like “podcasts” and “music” so I did that.  All the files transferred but strangely very slow.  After they finished charging I took them to the pool excited to give them a go!  Well...this is where the disappointments really started.  The instructions to tell the player to go into the first folder (click the “M” button twice) did absolutely NOTHING!  No mater what I did - nothing in the music or mp3 folders could be accessed.  The only thing that worked is the stock files in the root folder.  I thought, well that is “blanked” but decided to dry off and put the music in the root instead and give it another try.  I plugged the dry headphones back to their little SUPERSENSITIVE little magnetic connector so as to ensure nothing was going to disturb them AND...nothing.  Would not connect at all.  Ok...I rebooted (cycled the power all the way off and waited 30sec before turning back on) the computer and the headphones.  This time I first connected the magnetic connector to the headphones to ensure they would not move at all when I plugged the usb end into the computer.  I ever so gently plugged them in again and....NOTHING, again.  So I very gently unplugged the USB end and tried all the 5 other USB ports  - each did...say it with me now...NOTHING!  So most people would pack them up and ship them back, but me, nope...I’m way to stubborn than that.  I tried the power cycling thing at least 8 more times.  Note that the power charging function of the USB connection never failed once, just the data.  I even cleaned all the contacts with electronic contact cleaner and a q-tip.  Can you guess what happened...NOTHING!!!  So I thought, maybe turning them off over night might do something, anything, to make them connect.  This morning (the next day) I gave the computer and the headphones one more shot from a fresh, rested evening of both being shut down.  Yep, h2o Sonar headphones are brilliantly consistent in their design and quality...NOTHING happened again.  So I thought maybe my USB ports are confused (as hinted at in the directions because it couldn’t possibly be the design) and needed a reset.  So I looked up how to reset the usb controller on my Mac...I’ll give you a moment to contemplate what happened next...nu...nu...”NUTHING”, LOL!<br/><br/>Why is it that these can connect via Bluetooth but they don’t have a way of loading using that data stream...seems like a much better idea for waterproof  items (and clearly more reliable than the current method).  C’mon engineers - you really need to figure this out.<br/><br/>Lastly - the bluetooth streaming works just fine but it’s next to useless when swimming because Bluetooth can’t penetrate water.  Ive got much cheaper and better sounding options for non-swimming headphones.<br/><br/>I’ve ordered a replacement to see if this was an isolated experience.  I’ll update the review if anything new comes of it.</span>

<span>I have read a lot of reviews on this product before I purchased them. Many of the poor reviews I took with a grain of salt before I had the opportunity to check them out for myself.<br/>A few negative post I have seen mention poor sound, hard to connect to a PC for downloading music and another related to the charging cable that breaks easily.<br/>1st, it's common sense any music will be muffled under water through bone conduction technology. It's a sealed speaker that radiates the sound on your cheek bone so you hear sound. When you go under the water and your ears fill with water or you use ear plugs it's much louder. If your looking for the clear sound that you would get from having ear buds in your ear, this is not it.<br/>2nd, There is no problem getting the device USB to be recognized by your PC. Just follow the directions and don't try to install music when your player has a dead battery.<br/>3rd, there was a bad post about breaking the device by putting the charging cable on wrong, breaking the pins. It's a magnetic charging cable that.only goes on one way. If you inspect the charger you will see the plug is molded to fit a specific way. It has a magnet in it so it will stick to your player really quick. Just make sure the short side where the pins are aligns with charging contacts on the player itself.<br/>Prior to purchasing this device I have used Finis bone conduction for almost 20 years, prior to anything else being available. Finis was good, but the durability was awful. I was lucky to get 18 months out of a pair. They usually went out in less than a year. Either the wire frayed, the battery died, the player charging contacts would get corroded. This last time my Finis broke I wanted to try something else with all the new options on Amazon.<br/>I tried the mp3 player that mounts behind your goggles, with a really nice pair of water proof headphones that came with all kinds of ear buds to fit almost any size ear. They sounded awesome out of the water. But swimming was another story. They were more of a hassle to use. Most days one ear or the other did not seal properly and I could not hear much. I did not like the short wire hanging on the side. The other option was buy ear goo to help seal. Why go through all that to get your tunes working for a swim.<br/>I ended up returning the mp3 player and the water proof earbuds. and went back to a bone conduction player.<br/>This time I tried the H2O brand over Finis. I have to say I was surprised when I took them for a spin. My opinion the sound quality is better than the other brands. The tabs on the side make it easier to get on and off my goggles each day. I don't have to spend the extra time trying to get a good ear fit. I like how the device warns you when it's turning on or turning off. It was very simple to get setup for my AM swim, put them on, turn on your music and start swimming, no hassle trying to get an air tight seal with earbuds.  If you take you swim as serious as I do everyday this would be an awesome tool for you!</span>

<span>I’ve been a competitive swimmer on the US Masters team for most of my adult life.  After a rotator cuff tear I stopped swimming with the team and swimming by myself proves to be pretty uneventful lol I got myself an iPod shuffle waterproofed several years back, it worked well for a couple years, replaced it with another iPod shuffle which also worked well but around that time I start seeing these type of bone conduction headsets so I knew on my next purchase I would try one of these since the shuffles are now obsolete.<br/>I don’t understand all the negative reviews, these things work great, the sound quality is fine I don’t know what people are expecting… It’s not gonna sound like your JBL Home entertainment center but to get me through the workouts I hear everything clear.  I don’t understand people talking about the connection being difficult, my connection is fine with the cord….now I will say loading songs onto it from my iMac was extremely slow, and the iMac is not even six months old so it’s probably just the way it is which is very annoying, so after a few hours… Yes I am an idiot it took me a few hours to get what I wanted on the player, but now that that hell is over they work awesome.  I agree with others on here about why can’t you just use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to load songs onto this player that would make life so much easier and you could probably do it straight from your phone.  I heard people complaining about when you come up on breaststroke or butterfly the sound goes out… Yes the sound by maybe one DB got lower, but not enough to make me not hear what I’m listening to or take my concentration off my strokes or drills.  I’ve only used it three times this week, about to use it again today. If this player takes a crap on me without lasting like the iPod shuffles did I will update this review.  But so far so good and anyone with even a small amount of computer know how will be able to easily transfer the songs. I used my iTunes and again like I told you I’m just dumb it took me forever but it does take a long time to load the songs… but who knows Maybe I was just doing it wrong.  So if you’re in the market go ahead and pull the trigger, because for me swimming without music is not an option.</span>

<span>The sound quality is quite good, and the unit made swimming much more enjoyable after I hit a wall at 2200 yards.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the unit started having problems about 5 months in. About 50 uses. First, one of the sound-transmitting pads got partially stuck within the housing. (See pic) It still seems to work, but is a lot more buzzy than it used to be. A couple weeks later I noticed that it went from battery life lasting for 3-4 swims to just one. The culprit appears to be that the unit has begun to turn itself on without buttons being pressed. This happens in my swim bag, on the charger, or when it’s on my head after having turned it off. The buttons are now far less responsive than they were when new, so perhaps everything is sticking or corroding inside.<br/><br/>As it stands, it’s borderline usable. Better than nothing, but I’d expected more longevity and durability from something at this price point.<br/><br/>Note: I hand washed them after each use and stored them in their own dry pocket. These should still be pretty darn close to new condition after less than 65 hours of gentle use. They’re pretty close to dead.</span>

<span>I read the reviews and thought the sound quality wouldn’t be as good as I expected, but I think it’s great. I had a previous set of headphone for swimming That went into the ear canal, the aftershokz sound much better. Great fit, they stay on my head during turns no problem. I’m swimming freestyle so I can’t say how well they’ll stay on for other strokes. I wish they had the option of fast forward / rewind through the track (they only skip or rewind to the next track). I listen to audiobooks and you have to be careful adjusting the volume. Overall though,  best set of headphones I’ve ever used for swimming.</span>

<span>These headphones are thoughtfully designed.  Great for swimming and other water activities, as well as workouts such as running, walking, biking, gym workouts, and more!!  Sound quality is great for headphones.  Great battery life, very easy to charge (about 2 hours to charge), very easy to load music, very lightweight, buttons are easy to feel and use.  My husband is hard of hearing and I’m a musician, and we both love them!  Thank you for GREAT headphones, AfterShokz!!!</span>

<span>Impressive sound outside water, but sounds even better in the water. First time using bone conduction headphones, and was skeptical about the technology, but amazing how clear music is heard.<br/><br/>Construction seems sturdy, but lightweight. Feels comfortable--nice wrap around the head and ears.<br/><br/>Easy drag-and-drop process for loading files onto the storage, and with 4GB of space, plenty of room for ample selection of songs or other files to work out with or to listen to during whatever activity.<br/><br/>A little pricy, but well worth it. Seems well-made, and has a 2-year warranty to back it up. I'd try other Aftershokz products.</span>

<span>These are bone conduction headphones with remarkable sound quality (at least for me).  They work with hearing aids on (my wife loves them) - had to get a second pair so we'd each have our own.  I like having the situational awareness of being able to hear the enviornment around me.  When I need to shut it out (like a load machine) foam earplugs do the job (and the tunes or phone calls) roll on!<br/><br/>Also found a neat trick you can do with these and your phone is to give a hybrid tour - you are present for the people you are with (giving a tour to) and on a zoom call on a phone you can connect with others who are on the call, who can hear what is going on during the tour.  Unexpected benefit!<br/><br/>Would recommend this type of headphone for flexibility (generally) and these ones specifically - they seem to work really well.  If I lost them I'd go buy a replacement without hesitation.</span>

<span>This is amazing. I wish I had discovered this years ago. I have had hearing issues since I was a kid and have lost much of my hearing in my left ear as I have gotten older. I tried a friends pair on and it was like a whole different world! I hear tones and depth of sound I have never heard.<br/>I like the fact nothing is stuck in my ears and they are very comfortable. I have used them with my phone for phone calls and music (easy to switch between a call and music), with my computers and my new tv.<br/>Several of my friends and coworkers have purchased these since I got mine from my experience with them.

<span>Reports are that these sound noticeably better than other bone conduction headphones, but those must be worse than mediocre given what I hear with these.  3 stars for mediocre sound, lame controls, and unimpressive value for the price.  Details follow.<br/><br/>USE CASE (background info, skip ahead to SOUND QUALITY for product comments):  My use case for this was a little unusual - I wanted to listen to music from my phone in a car that lacks Bluetooth or aux-in.  Headphones seemed unsafe, FM xmitter no longer an option due to lack of open freqs in my area, and upgrading w/an aftermarket stereo isn't worth it for a 10-yr old car that I plan to sell on fairly soon.  I thought bone conduction might be a good solution since it wouldn't block my hearing for traffic sounds, alarms, etc.  I read that sound quality wasn't the main strength of these athletic-oriented headphones, so figured I'd splurge and get the OpenRun Pro since it's consistently rated among the best in this category for sound quality (and I was avoiding the cost of a new car stereo after all).<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY:  First things first - to my ear the sound quality is perfectly fine for spoken word (audiobooks, podcasts, etc.) but not at all satisfying for music, lacking both bass and high end.  In one sense I'm glad I got these because anything with lower quality would be unacceptable and I'm not seeing any models consistently rated higher for sound; on the other hand, judged solely for spoken word, perhaps a less pricey option might have sufficed.  I think these are probably the worst sounding speakers or headphones on which I even try to listen to music (e.g., the affordable little Photive Hydra waterproof BT speaker I keep in my bathroom is much more pleasing).  I've also used these for a few phone calls and they sound great for that.  Folks on the other end seemed perfectly happy with mic sound.<br/><br/>ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:  Quick plug here for the option that didn't occur to me until later - I recently got the Oraolo M110 wearable (around the neck) BT speaker, and it works far better as a  car audio solution than the Shokz, mainly due to superior sound quality (while still leaving ears open to hear the surroundings), for about a third of the cost.  If I'd thought to check this out a couple of months ago I'd never have bought the Shokz and saved myself some money; the Oraolo may not hold a candle to proper over-ear headphones, but it's head and shoulders above the OpenRun Pro.  Because I used them for the same purpose, I'll mention a few points of comparison in the following comments.<br/><br/>UTILITY &amp; BATTERY:  Despite the above, I do still use the OpenRun Pro with some frequency since I already have them.  They're great for listening to podcasts around the house without disturbing others or while driving, you barely notice you're wearing them, and being worn directly on the head the sound is unaffected by head movements (none of which I can say for those neck speakers).  They're not as quiet for folks around you as, e.g., in-ear or over-the-ear headphones, but they're not at all loud in that regard, MUCH quieter than, e.g., neck speakers.<br/><br/>Battery life is usable (at least a few hours), but nothing like the 10 hours they claim (but see below regarding potential warranty issue).  They certainly don't last as long as other BT headphones and speakers I have, but all this may be understandable given their size and weight.<br/><br/>FEATURES/FUNCTIONS:  Apart from sound quality, this is where I have a few gripes.  Controls are on both left and right sides, with a single multi-function button on the left speaker used for play/pause/answer (1 click), FF (2 clicks), and REW (3 clicks), and a rocker on the right temple controlling power and volume. The problem with this arrangement is that it's so hard to time the 3 clicks for the rewind/skip-back function that it's nearly useless, with the headphones usually doing a FF &amp;  pause instead (so of course then you have to REW further...); I usually give up after one try and use my phone.  This would all work much better with a rocker switch in the left temple like the one on the right to control FF/REW, leaving the main button on the left speaker dedicated to play/pause/answer.  Really awful design as it stands.<br/><br/>WARRANTY?:  I think that REW problem is just the way it works (or doesn't), but there might be another explanation, given an even bigger problem - the OpenRun Pro sometimes randomly shuts itself off with an alert tone while in the middle of playing (so it's not a silence time-out, which they also do); it does power right back up when you hit the right temple rocker switch .  I've noticed that this issue is addressed in the Shokz OpenRun troubleshooting guide with "File a warranty claim", so this might be a known manufacturing defect - if so, I'll update here.</span>

<span>These headsets are a game changer for me. Using them is such a pleasurable experience!<br/>It's important to understand the advantages and disadvantages:<br/><br/>1) These go outside your ears. Sounds is transmitted through the bones and some through the ears. This allows you to hear your music without canceling the ambient noise. As long as the environment noise is low, the experience is fantastic. If you are riding a bike by the freeway though, the noise will easily overpower the music and ruin your experience.<br/><br/>2) Because the ears are not covered, using them for calls gives you an amazing experience, where it feels almost as if you were talking to the other person in front of you. I cannot stress enough how much better these are for calls than regular in-ear headsets. I use them daily for all my conference calls and would not change them for anything else. The built-in microphone also uses bone conduction and works very well and reliably. I gave it 5 stars for noise cancelation meaning cancelation of everything but your voice. Of course outside noise cancelation for what you hear is non-existent.<br/><br/>3) Fit is excellent. These will NOT fall from your ears, even if you are working out. I have some issues with them itching the back of my ears sometimes, but in general they are far more comfortable than anything else I've tried.<br/><br/>4) The controls work very well. The only gripe I have is that press and hold of the left button is supposed to let me use Siri but I have not been able to make that work.<br/><br/>5) Battery life is very good and they charge fast.<br/><br/>6) They have multi point pairing. This is an awesome feature that allows me to use them at the same time with my iPhone and my computer. It is not perfect, but works as expected most of the time. Sometimes I just have to turn them off an on to have them re-connect, but that is easy to do.<br/><br/>Overall, just a great product. As long as your audio expectations are met, you will be very happy with them. I just wish they were a bit cheaper...</span>

<span>These are great for me. I have lots of ear problems so over and in ear headphones were problematic to say the least. The open ear concept is a godsend for me. I do wish there was a way to make bass more noticeable but that is just the nature of all current bone conduction headphones. The overall sound is good enough for background noise and podcasts. Movies are decent. The 90 degree angle ear hooks are uncomfortable at times but not a deal breaker. Overall fit is snug but not too tight. Its not going anywhere but also not squeezing and pinching your face. Battery life is decent I wear them for about 10 -12 hours a day at work and a charge at lunch keeps them topped off and going till i get off. These are OSHA approved earphones so it's nice to be able to have a loophole for the safety rules on earbuds in the workplace. Overall I recommend shokz as a brand but if you can make splurge for the openrun do it but if you can't then these still will be your new friend. I go everywhere with these and i am very happy with my purchase. Will be getting more when I can.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Yeah, this is the TLDR review :)<br/><br/>I wasn't looking but ran across these bone-conducting headphones and was a little skeptical even though I understood the concept and it seemed solid. I vacillated between options at several different price points before deciding to start roughly in the middle. Also, this brand has a pretty solid reputation from what I've found. I found the idea interesting, and I chose these over a couple of others in the same price range.<br/><br/>I am a music composer and producer and I have a studio in my home, so I'm always looking for different ways of auditioning my compositions in different environments and on different equipment, so I basically saw these as just another way to hear how my productions sound. I also like to use binaural beats and thought this would be a good option (assuming they worked well enough) and I can do that while keeping my ears open to my surroundings.<br/><br/>Now, I always pay attention to packaging, even though I realize some manufacturers try to be slick and put a lot into the packaging and not much into the product. Nevertheless, these come in a nice box with a quality feel to it, so that was the initial positive. If you're like me and have never seen this type of headphone before, you'll probably think they look a little weird, as I did. They have a nice, quality feel to them and seem sturdily built. I got the blue ones, because of the blue strip I think looks cool, but I didn't realize they come with several other alternative strips so you can have a different decorative design if you like.<br/><br/>One thing I worried about, and it turns out I needn't have, is how much pressure they would apply on the area where they are designed to sit, which is right in front of your ear canal. Too much pressure there would likely cause headaches. The pressure is barely noticeable within a moment or two of putting them on. The frame between the two 'speakers' is rigid titanium so it keeps a permanent curl that maintains enough pressure to be able to hear them consistently no matter how you move your head. That frame though, will sometimes hit the collar of my shirt and change the angle and pressure of the pads, but not by much and not enough to negatively affect the overall sound to an unacceptable degree, and least to me.<br/><br/>And speaking of sound...<br/><br/>They sound amazingly good considering how they work. I thought bass would be too thin but it's not. It's not going to rattle your chest, but it's surprisingly deep, fat and present. I've listened to several of my songs that are at various stages of completion and they all sound true to the level they're at. A polished, fully mastered tune sounds, well, polished and fully mastered! Also, when I listen to binaural beats, even with ambient sounds mixed in, they sound clear and immersive. They are able to get loud enough that ambient sound is not distracting from what you're listening to, unless of course it needs to be (e.g., urgent or emergency situation).<br/><br/>I haven't yet turned them up all the way (haven't needed to) or used them with a phone call, so I can't comment on either right now. They charge via USB-C, which I prefer, but charging time is a little long considering you only get about six hours of use on a full charge. I would have preferred around 10-12 hours ideally. They can't be used while charging (connecting the cable turns them off), but I can't imagine who would need to anyway. Pairing them with my phone was no more complicated than pairing any other Bluetooth device; you just have to remember to start with them OFF when you want to pair them. They come with a nice little drawstring bag for storage, but though I'm not likely to use it, it's a nice touch.<br/><br/>If you want a richer, more immersive sound, you can just plug your ears; a pair of simple foam earplugs will do. Of course, you will lose the advantage of being able to hear your surroundings clearly, but that may be what you want from time to time. Some brands come with earplugs, but these did not.<br/><br/>There are two reasons I deducted one star: charging time vs battery life, and the fact that the frame sometimes hits my collar and slightly moves the pads. I would only have deducted a half a star for both issues if I could have. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend these to anyone wanting to check out this relatively new tech. I don't know how close to the quality of these I could have come with a cheaper set, or how much better a more expensive set would sound. I just know I'm very satisfied with these. Give your ear canal a break and try them, I think most people will find them surprisingly effective.</span>

<span>I did not expect to like these headphones as much as I do. They’re lightweight, comfortable they stay in place and the sound is good. I wasn’t expecting amazing sound as I would from my Bose, AirPods, Beats because this headset isn’t going in or over my ear, but the sound quality is good and I get to hear everything around me which is what I wanted for my outdoor runs. I hate having to keep pushing earbuds in or worrying about them falling out of my ears. So far the Shokz OpenMove have stayed in place and are comfortable nothing fancy and they do everything as advertised.  Extremely happy with my purchase that now I’m wondering how much better the pro version must be. Perhaps something I buy in a few months since it’s apparent I enjoy collecting headphones 🙃</span>

<span>I was so curious how these worked and what they would be like so I ordered them. Best choice I’ve made because these headphones are fantastic. The only real complaint I have about them is they can be uncomfortable at higher volumes because the vibration tickles your ears, but other than that the sound quality is great. They’re easy to clean because there’s no little crevices that stuff gets caught in, they’re so comfortable I forget I’m wearing them most of the time, the controls are simple when you need to pause/lower or increase volume, and the battery life lasts days. I’ve forgotten to turn them off some nights and the battery was still charged the next morning. Great headphones I can’t stop recommending!</span>

<span>It's amazing to finally have the option of listening to music on runs with zero problems or hassles. Thank you Shokz.  Here's the back story:<br/><br/>In the old days, I used to snake headphone wires under my shirt and strap a massive iPod on my arm to listen to music. The armband slipped off, the wires got tangled. Smaller iPods were junk and couldn't handle much if any abuse or sweat. Smartphones are just too big and clunky. Music capable smartwatches are amazing and compact, but Bluetooth headphones and anything stuck in my ears quickly gets sweaty and uncomfortable. Jabra Elites, for example, sound good, but fall out multiple times every run.<br/><br/>After having pretty much given up on having music on runs, a colleague turned me onto Shokz. What a find. Paired instantly with my Garmin Fenix. The sound is way better than I expected would be possible with bone induction (and just good period). The headphones stay comfortable throughout the runs I've been on, and the playback stays flawless.<br/><br/>For me at least, and I would venture other folks who like to run hard and thus sweat a lot, these things are a game changer. Get them. You will not be sorry.</span>

<span>The sound quality is on par with current top of the line bluetooth headphones. With them being as light as they are, I regularly forget that I am (or am not) wearing them. The volume doesn't get super high but it is worth noting that at the loudest volume, you can tune out the world. If inserting earbuds (not included), it can be even louder, though sound quality does deteriorate, leaving a really cool muffled effect. Charging is super fast and hassle free with the magnetic charger (about 3 foot long). And in optimal conditions, the bluetooth range can actually exceed what is listed in the product description. The ONLY complaint/criticism I might have is that it would be nice if they manufactured hard cases like the ones sold for this product by Hermitshell(?) and that I wish they sold longer charging cables. I personally don't have current need for one but I know that situations vary and change. Thank you, Shokz, for an amazing set of headphones</span>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got these headphones for lap swimming and other aquaric exercise.  They are waterproof and held up while I swam, except when I went completely under water, the Bluetooth would disconnect. I also wish there was an adjustable option, the head band was too big for my head and I had to tuck the headphones under my swim cap to get them to stay in place while I swam. I also wish the buttons were easier to push and it was easier to tell when the headphones were completely off (maybe a beep or specific sound)  if I were to find a better option I would go with the other option. These headphones met my minimum usability requirements but have leaps and bounds to go towards improvement.</span>

<span>I have had these for over a month and ran the Brooklyn Half Marathon with them. They are great so that you can listen to music but still hear your surroundings. Taking calls with these does not really work, but I did not buy these for that reason .. I purchased them to be able to hear cars and people and have conversations while I run and still hear music in the background. One of my favorite things is that there are lights on the back of the ear piece and it can blink or just stay on!</span>
