<span>Bought these thinking I might get lucky without the ear going dead....I was wrong.<br/><br/>Worked perfectly fine for 2 months. Sat them on my hi-hat last night (like normal) when I was done.<br/><br/>Went to drum this morning and the right ear was just dead. Followed another users review on how to fix. Even though my right ear went dead, it was the "Red wire" in the LEFT ear cup that had come unsoldered.<br/><br/>A quick fix, and their back to working again just fine.<br/><br/>HEED THIS WARNING, YOU MAY JUST HAVE TO FIX THESE IN A COUPLE MONTHS!</span>

<span>I tried these on a Simmons SD1200 set and packed these up for return with in 30 seconds. First there was no power or volume to these in any fashion. I get better and fuller sound out of a set of $30. iem's.<br/><br/>The did offer nice noise cancellation from what I felt for the 30 seconds I wore these.</span>

<span>Sound and noise cancellation are fine. They get a little warm around your ears after wearing for a while. Build quality is not the best. The plug on the pair I purchased started coming apart. Alesis customer support was helpful and did an exchange by mail. They said that the old pair would go to their quality control team to review. Now this second pair is getting a hole in the cord.</span>

<span>I will echo what others have written. Happy with the quality for the price. When the earphone shorted out after 6 months I got in touch with Customer Support. They asked for a return, on their dime, and said I would receive a new set in about two weeks. Glad to know this company stands behind its product. Hope the new headphones are  little more rugged.</span>

<span>These headphones offer great hearing protection. I used to practice the drums with a regular pair of earbuds in, and I could sense that it was damaging my hearing. Sometimes I would use musician's earplugs, but those aren't great if you're trying to play along to something. That was my motivation for getting these headphones, and I haven't looked back since. I have had them a little over a year and I use them every day.<br/><br/>The sound quality is decent. In my opinion, these are ear protection and the fact that you can listen to music through them is a bonus feature. They're great for playing along to something on the drums, but I wouldn't recommend them as 'listening headphones'.<br/><br/>They look pretty cool compared to other ear protection, so I guess that's a plus.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that they are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. I usually take a 2 minute break after every 20 minutes of practicing because of this. You could probably get around this by putting some foam on the headband, but it doesn't bother me enough to want to put in the effort.<br/><br/>Overall I'd highly recommend these to any drummer, even in light of the discomfort issue.</span>

<span>Unlike most customers for this product, I just use these for listening. I'm not a drummer. That said, I can't imagine wearing these for long even if I was a drummer. I was hoping my ears would get used to it but they just hurt more. Maybe it's because I have a big head (I wear size XL hats) but these are relief to take off.</span>

They better sound Awesome....  signed one peed off .....td-30 kv pro, V Drum owner<br/><br/>Well, 5 days later and still not happy about the cheap cable, very thin and stiff, not like a quality one And not removeable. Also the head band and swivel brackets are plastic?  They should be some sort of metal. These would not last with someone that is even a little rough with their equipment. With all the minuses they have I have to say they do sound unbelievable! They are the best sounding I've ever owned for the Aplication they are intended for. I am an individual who is careful with my equipment so I will keep them and pray my the cable lasts.

<span>I just got the RH300-V so time will tell in terms of durability, but honestly these sound really great. They are a little treble-y compared to my Sony headphones but that translates to some pretty incredible clarity in the ear. Comfort wise they are adequate. They felt a little stiff at first but after wearing them for 4+hours earlier I didn't have any discomfort at all, so I'm good with it. My primary use for these is with an Alesis electric drum kit and they sound amazing. Best I can explain it, it feels like I was previously wearing some sort of sound filter with my previous headphones and now I have removed it. Everything just sounds so much more clear and pronounced, the sound quality is just excellent. Overall very happy, now just hoping they last.</span>

<span>I bought two pairs of these about 5 years ago.  The sound quality isn't great but isn't terrible especially since I use to play along to music.  The big flaw really is the adhesive they use to hold the ear piece to the headphones.  These have come off multiple times. Going to try gorilla glue next to see if that holds but since they are also showing their wear and starting to get less and less comfortable I might consider a different product if I can find a good set on sale.</span>

<span>I'm a professional drummer. I've been using Vicfirth isolated headphones for years so I thought I should try something new.<br/>Why not? Right?:)<br/>I bought two of Alesis drum headphones(one of them which I thought it was pretty good broke in a month(cable issues) and the other one wasn't isolated well so I couldn't wear them while drumming) and I ended up here buying KAT headphones. I liked it at the beginning but one of the sponges for my R ear ripped off after using it about two months...which I don't understand when my 5 year old Vicfirth headphones still works well.<br/><br/>So one time I was using Kat headphones for a gig (I played all day that day so my ears were hurting a lot from using in ears. That's why I used Kat headphones for the back up for my hearing  protections) and R ear sponge was keep moving away from the position so I had to change my headphones to Vicfirth headphones and I really realized how the sound quality between them were so different.<br/><br/>Wow...It was really different. Vicfirth headphones sounded WAY BETTER.<br/>WOW...I was like...😱😱😱😱😱"WHAT???"<br/>Yep. I'm sorry Kat percussion but I don't want to lie here. If you're playing drums like here and there, not often? You not gonna have a problem with this item but if you're playing drums more than two hours everyday and you want to wear this item while drumming? I wouldn't recommend this item. Just buy Vicfirth headphones. Don't waste your money!  Thank you for reading. Hope this helps!:)</span>

<span>Love these! My teenaged son is a dedicated drummer (they'd work great for adults, too). The headphones let you practice while listening to your favorite recorded tune WITHOUT having to turn your favorite tune up to 11 on a speaker just to hear it over your own drum playing. Instead, the headphones let you to listen to your tune at a normal volume through the headphones themselves -- via a standard headphone jack input. Then you play drums. That's it. The headphones filter MOST damaging exterior drum sounds but let in enough to hear yourself play. A must for anybody who wants to practice a lot but who wants to protect their ears.</span>

<span>I had a pair of Extreme Isolation headphones prior to this pair and these are 1)  less expensive 2) just as comfortable and 3) same sound quality.  The only complaint is the cable for the jack is quite stiff AND it's too short.  I had to buy an extention just to go from my head phones around 1 of my drums to my phone holder).  A longer, braided cord like a patch cord that goes to an amp would have been the best however, something a bit more pliable so it doesn't stay in such a curly shape.  Despite that, I'd buy it again.</span>

<span>This is only my second day of usage but I am pleased. I was concerned after reading the reviews, but I'm literally using them now with my TV and they work great imo. Grant it, I'm not an audiophile,maybe I don't have too refined an eardrum, but they sound great to me. Super clear, excellent bass that's adjustable on the app which I love. They could probably be little louder for the teens and twenties that want to blast themselves to kingdom come, but other than that I don't have any complaints yet. Will update if I come across any bugs. I can see how these might be uncomfortable for adults will average size ears because the ear phones are definitely smaller than average. But if you're getting these for a kid, or are an adult with really little ears like me then these are perfect. Other over the ear headphones have been way too big for me, so I would buy cheap child size ones but the volume and quality would be poor. So these are a great find for an adult with small features.<br/>I'll also add the disclaimer that this is the first quality pair of headphones I've purchased, so admittedly I may not have a basis of comparison for judging these. I will say that these are far superior than any $25 -$30 pair I've had before.<br/><br/>Also not sure about the noise cancelling ability of these yet. Probably not on par with other noise cancelling brands like Boise, but those are like $300 and these were under $150 so you get what you pay for on that score I suppose. I love using headphones since I live with others and have a night job and go to bed late, and these are great for my listening purposes.</span>

<span>I love these headphones. I was a little worried about them based on reviews saying they are too tight. I have multiple piercings per ear and was worried it would irritate them with too much pressure. But the size of the headphones is perfect, the ears are the perfect size to sit in front of my piercings with no irritation. They are somewhat tight but not in a bad way.

<span>I finally bit the bullet and decided to buy these after reading the reviews. I was desperate for a pair of noise cancelling headphones when I was trying to finish my college thesis in a house with 6 rowdy roommates. These were a lifesaver. I finally was able to focus. Additionally. It helped me not feel as overstimulated when I went to somewhere like the grocery store, or dulling traffic noises when I went on a walk. I would always be so surprised when I took the headphones off at how loud the ambient noise around me was, even though I didn’t pay any mind to it before. It’s not perfect, for example when riding the bus it would dull out most of the engine noises, but when we hit a bump I would hear some popping noises as it would be quite Loud and very close. Still much better than without the headphones. It was also really important to me to have comfort, since I have multiple ear piercings and the beats headphones I tried earlier would press into them which would be pretty painful. Even if I found a good position for it, it would still hurt my head after a few hours. With these, I don’t have that problem! They fit completely over my ears, so I never have to worry about my piercings, and the cushioning is very soft so I’ve worn these bad boys for hours and hours and never felt any discomfort! Unfortunately I lost my pair at a bar a few months ago, and I was bummed because they were great headphones, but so expensive. I finally decided to repurchase them after catching a flash sale because I do truly think these are worth the money. I’m not an audiophile, but i do really love the sound quality as well. I hear new things in songs I’ve always loved by listening to them with these. The cons of this product are the following: 1. I wish these headphones worked with the Findmy feature or at least had some other way of tracking their location when lost. I know other Bose products do, and I think that for $300+, it’s not unreasonable to ask for a locating feature so I don’t lose these (again). Especially since these headphones already have their own app. The other con is that these headphones are not water resistant. I don’t think it’s a huge deal breaker for me as I don’t plan on wearing them swimming, but sometimes I worry about walking in a light drizzle with them on. Nothing has actually happened so far when I have done this, (usually I can just put my hood up or something)  but the booklet it comes with specifies that any water is something to avoid, so it does loom in the back of my mind. All In all though.</span>

<span>I did a lot of research looking into bluetooth headphones; as someone with hearing damage and is very picky about how their headphones rest on their ears, I knew I couldn't settle. I bought various other pairs before trying Bose Quiet Comfort, such as KVIDIO (Not tight to head/sound leaking, bassy sound), Sennheiser 350BT (Pinched my ears, quieter than other sets, could hear myself in calls and couldn't turn off in app), and Soundcore Q35 (Entirely different sound depending on the device and if plugged in, couldn't listen to music and be in voice call at same time without plugging in), all of which had their dilemmas. I really wanted a nice pair of bluetooth headphones for cheap, but in my search I recognized that wasn't possible, so I saved up what I had and thankfully snagged this on discount (bought for $180).<br/><br/>The sound is absolutely immersive; my worries about these headphones was that the bass was going to be too heavy, as SONY bluetooth headphones and other sets in this price range are usually very bass heavy. Fortunately, that wasn't the case with Quiet Comfort; it's strong, but it doesn't overpower. The mids and treble sound great too, and I can't say I've had any issues with listening to music, calls with friends, etc, other than those friends having shoddy microphones (No problem though).<br/><br/>The fit on this set is also solid; I have noticed in warmer weather that my ears get sweaty, but that's to be expected with any headset that's over-ear. My only note is that I noticed the inside of the headphones have molded to my ear. When I first got them, the meshy material with the L and R was flat, but now it's slightly caved in. I'm not sure if it's impacted anything, because I haven't heard a difference in sound, and they don't feel different. I will keep an eye on it for when I update this review.<br/><br/>The controls are simple, a switch on button and three buttons to turn up, down, pause, and skip music (and if on mobile, to use your voice assistant) on the right cuff. On the left, the only button is the noise cancelling (two settings; aware and noise-cancel). I enjoy that this headset has two ports, one for charging, and another to plug them into the device to use instead of bluetooth. However, I will note to anyone that uses these headphones plugged in; when the set is in wired mode, it disables bluetooth, and when still on it sounds incredibly quiet. And, when turned off and plugged in, the EQ and Stereo Sound disable, so using the headphones without them being on is really rough. These doesn't steer me away from using them though, as I mainly use them on and via bluetooth. I mean, to be honest, who uses bluetooth headphones with a wire anyway unless they're dead?<br/><br/>I'm also actually pretty impressed by the battery on these. They last me all day and night, and I plug them in when I sleep. They charge really fast, and I've only had two occasions of low battery, mainly due to me forgetting to charge em.<br/><br/>Overall, my only worry onward is the deterioration, if there is any, and possible connection issues. Haven't had those yet, and hopefully I won't in a year.</span>

<span>Bluetooth sound is excellent.<br/>Audio cable sound is SO unsatisfactory that I simply cannot keep them. They are useless for any in flight entertainment, etc .<br/>I opted to exchange, and Amazon is sending me a new set. If the new set performs the same with the audio cable I will simply return for a full refund.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The second set is everything you expect from a Bose product. Audio cable is nice and tight, and sound is excellent just like when on Bluetooth. I will be keeping these.</span>

<span>I've owned these for half a day so far and have decided to keep them around. I'm an audiophile who spends money on kickstarter earbuds, custom-made preamps, and (in general) quality hardware which reduces my audio experience as little as possible. Trying these cans in-store at BestBuy allowed me to appreciate the hardware quality of the exterior... quality matte plastic moulding, amazing comfortable faux-leather surfaces on your skin, and a synthesized voice and audible feedback to assist with your navigation of the three hardware buttons and touch controls make these headphones easy to wear during work sessions, public transit commutes, or in a crowded home with loud kids. As a brand new product, the tension on the cans over your ears and on your head can become uncomfortable within an hour of use. Subjectively, I don't consider my head to be particularly large or larger-than-average and will need to play around with adjusting the cups to sit lower or higher on the band which also release/tighten the tension respectively to see if this becomes a long term problem with use. Taking short breaks with the headphones off (10-15 minutes) helps and gives a good excuse/reminder to take a break from work to relax the body/eyes/ears.<br/><br/>The sound quality is reasonable for the headphones. When using the headphones with noise cancellation off, ambient noise seems to lack a very strong low end frequency response (sub ~250Hz, not measured) and might reduce your meatspace experience in some cases where mixed ambient and input audio are desired. That said, direct input still seems to perform quite well with solid frequency response all around which lets the very highs and very lows to be pretty well-balanced.<br/><br/>A test using the headset for phone conversation over bluetooth yielded very nice results. The setup involved the cans paired with my laptop streaming music and my Project Fi Pixel 3 phone on standby. Using the Google voice assistant to start the call resulted in some clumsy voice detection/understanding problems ("I'm sorry, I didn't get that, who would you like to call? I don't know that name, who would you like to call? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Dialing..." _sigh_) which I don't believe are the fault of the cans at all. The test included loud ambient music in the room with the person wearing the headphones and found the other user to experience practically none of the ambient noise through the call with a very clear bead on the callee's voice despite close proximity to the music source playing at a moderate volume (such that the ambient music was leaking through the room walls and making it hard to isolate whether the headphones were leaking the ambient noise into the call...which it seemed _not_ to do with this casual test setup). Noticeable was the (300-700ms) delay from the user on the headphones which seemed to not be present from the non-headphone user. It was hardly a concern and either due to the latency in the network transmitting the audio (which, again, was a local wifi call between handsets.... though I am unsure if the handsets route audio locally or not) or possibly in the audio processing from the headset. This latency was par for most mobile calls and should be completely unnoticeable in a remote environment when you're not there to hear to source before the transmitted audio through the headset.<br/><br/>A few gripes about the design and ergonomics of the device:<br/>- the button placement: very easy to accidentally active these buttons which adjusting the placement of these cans if not aware/careful.<br/>- the direction of earcup rotation: when placing the cans around the neck/shoulders, the earcups rotate up (into the air) rather than down (onto your chest). Questionable choice here as it makes the headphones somewhat uncomfortable to hold there, but perhaps Bose never expects you to remove the phones... unsure if that's a reasonable expectation or not.<br/>- the synthetic leather matte black surface inside the top of the headset and on the earcups attract oil and will certainly show for those of us with that sort of skin. This may require some extra TLC and upkeep to keep as pristine as one might like. The white set might fair better in this regard.<br/><br/>Overall summary:<br/>A pricey purchase that I would have trouble justifying as a personal expense (these were expensed by my employer and intended for daily voice conference usage and isolation during work hours in busy coffee shops) and really comes down to the longevity of the product over time. If these headphones end up lasting me longer than 5 years, I would be VERY satisfied with the purchase. At a price point closer to $250-300, this would be a much easier personal purchase to make.<br/><br/>As a user which "babies" their hardware, I am eager to see whether this will stand the test of time. Direct input (from a bluetooth source that is not ambient noise) has a very solid frequency response which does not noticeably detract from the music experience. Longterm use may be uncomfortable depending on your head size. The noise cancellation works wonderfully and almost too well, leaving me at a "5" setting more often than a "10" as complete cancellation feels too isolating and uncomfortable to feeling the lack of "air" around me. BLE connection to multiple devices (two) at once allows for seemless transitions between either input. This is also a first time purchase of a Bose product. Looking forward to seeing how the device matures and support is handled over time. Firmware updates are provided automatically to the headset through their app. Battery life "appears" long but I have yet to complete a full discharge cycle to be sure. I was pleasantly surprised to find the phones report +5 hours of use remaining at 20% battery charge and +20 hours at full charge (the audio assistant delivers the charge level as "hours of use" remaining, not battery level...which is still viewable in the Bose Music app. Nice touch, Bose).</span>

<span>*Introduction:<br/><br/>I bought the Bose NC 700 right around the new year in 2021, so about a month ago. Like many people, I've been working from home for the past year. However, I have 2 young children who can get noisy, so I wanted some noise cancelling headphones. Also, I like listening to music and gaming, so I'll address that as well. Here is my review, broken down by subject:<br/><br/>*Noise Cancelling:<br/><br/>When I set out to get a pair of noise cancelling headphones, my main priority was, of course, noise cancelling. Naturally, I gravitated towards Bose due to their fantastic history here. I have never owned a pair of active noise cancelling headphones before, so I can't really compare to anything. However, I can say they are amazing. Any low-frequency constant noise is basically gone. I have a small office room with 2 central air registers; I can't hear either of them with the headphones on. I can hear my kids when they are loud, but the "punch" is gone, and it feels like it takes a level 10 crying baby, down to a level 7. All of this is without music on. Turn any music on, and it becomes near impossible to hear anything. I mean it; turn on some rock or rap and kiss noise goodbye. I'm sure the offerings from other companies are great too, but these are wonderful at noise cancelling.<br/><br/>*Sound Quality:<br/><br/>Sound quality is difficult to measure as it's subjective, so I'll try my best. I think the Bose NC 700's sound quality is pheromonal. I can hear lots of fine detail, and nothing has ever felt clipped or muddy, unless the music itself is. I personally really like the sound signature (think how the headphones are tuned, not how "good" they are), but a lot of people want more bass. Keep in mind, these do have good bass, but they won't turn your brain to mush.  I am not a bass lover, so these are great for me. I typically stream Spotify from my computer or phone at the highest quality setting and set the app's EQ (see below for more info) to low = 0, mid = 2, high = 5. So, if you really want bass, I would try the Sony XM4's, but these sound really good and clear.<br/><br/>*Design / Comfort:<br/><br/>This is probably the trickiest for me to review. I’ll start with looks. I think they look cool and different from other headphones. They have a good amount of adjustability and feel pretty solid. They have 3 physical buttons: a noise cancellation level button, and voice assistant button, and a Bluetooth pairing / power button. However, I do not like the silicone headband. It feels cheap (to me at least) and isn’t overly comfortable. It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t feel good. Same goes for the leatherette ear cups. They’re fine, but do not feel premium. For nearly $400 I want something more luxurious.  As a quick aside I’m 6’ 4” and wear glasses. After 6 ish hours wearing these off and on the tops of my ears where my glasses sit starts to hurt. The clamping force (for me) is a bit tight. You can reduce the clamping force by extending the earcups, but for my head it makes the earcups be too low, and that’s not comfortable either. It’s not a terrible thing, but I’m usually happy to take them off at the end of the day. That’s still almost a full work day’s time which is pretty good.<br/><br/>*Battery life:<br/><br/>They are advertised for 20 hours, I’m not sure how much time I actually get but it sounds about right. I usually charge them every other day or every 2 days. I like the battery is measured in hours rather than percentage. Since I don’t travel this isn’t a big deal anyways, but you can get better battery life from other headphones.<br/><br/>*Touch controls:<br/><br/>Touch controls work fine for me. I think this comes down to preference. I’ve had no trouble getting used to them, even swiping up/down for volume. Somehow the volume swipe considers your speed or force to change how much you adjust volume per swipe. A full swipe up / down is about 25/30% in windows.<br/><br/>*Bose Music App:<br/><br/>This section (and the next) is where my review goes off a cliff. I hate the app. When I first got the headphones, the “simple” paring that the little user pamphlet outlined didn’t work. I had to manually pair through my phone. When pairing with my windows 10 laptop, I initially couldn’t get it to work at all. I had to find this post: Steps to pair NC 700 headphones with Windows 10 - Bose Community - 293028 to get it to work. Also, my headphones came uncharged. Between the lack of charge and Bluetooth issues it took about 30-45 minutes before I first heard anything with the headphones.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when you open to music app to change to EQ or something else, your headphones will not be detected. The only solution I’ve found so far is to reboot. This is extremely annoying since it takes about 10-15 seconds to reboot your headphones (see below for why that is).<br/><br/>Another annoyance is that the self-voice level option for when you’re in headset mode is buried withing the app settings. This should be part of the initial settings when you first open the app. You also cannot map it to a tap combo short cut. I would love to be able to do that since I’m adjusting all the time due to my surrounding sound levels when I’m on a call.<br/><br/>1 Last thing, and I wasn’t sure whether to put this in the app or headphone software section. You cannot disable the multiple Bluetooth connection feature. Are you on a zoom meeting on your laptop and you get a call on your phone? Guess what, your audio, both input and output, automatically switch to the phone ringing in your ears. Listening to Spotify on your phone and then the windows chime plays? The windows chime interrupts your music. Even if your windows volume is muted, the audio switch to no sound for the duration of the windows chime. This wouldn’t be a problem, if you could disable the feature. You could unpair and repair devices manually, but if you unpair your phone where the music app is installed, the music app will “forget” the device and you have to go through the setup process again for a new device. It’s mind-boggling stupid and I can’t believe this app made it to market as is. For reference I have a One Plus 6T. Related to this, I’ve never had a successful switch from computer to phone when a call comes in. I can hear the ringing initially, but not the caller once I accept the call. Also, they cannot hear me at all.<br/><br/>*Headphone Software:<br/><br/>The headphone’s software itself is annoying. Not quite as bad as the app, but far from good. Upon startup, the headphone’s voice will tell you the amount of battery you have left and the 2 devices you’re currently connected to. At first this didn’t bug me, but after a while, it is extremely annoying. Most of the time, I know what devices I’ll be connected to. Just let it be a triple tap shortcut or something similar.<br/><br/>Also, there are definite problems somewhere along the chain of input microphone processing. Often my colleagues say I’m cutting in and out when I talk in lower tones. This usually occurs when the central air is running, and it’s input noise canceling is running. As far as I know, there’s no way to reduce or turn off the input noise cancelling. This is frustrating, since one of the selling points for these headphones is good mic quality. It’s very disappointing.<br/><br/>*Summary:<br/><br/>In summary the headphones sound great, but the day to day software issues make these a hard pass at $400. I don’t have the Sony XM4’s or other competitors for comparison, but I cannot recommend against these headphones enough. This will be the first and last Bose product I will own for a long time.</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>Can a Bluetooth (BT) headphone that sells for less than $80 beat an expensive Bose BT headphone? Let's find out!<br/><br/>HOW I DISCOVERED<br/>I was ironically turned onto the Bose 700 (proper model name is NC 700) by "Oluv's Gadgets" video channel, where he ripped the Bose to shreds! (Search for video "Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700-the worst?") And rightfully so, it turns out. Except at the end, where he did an impressive Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) test of multiple headphones along a busy road. (BTW: I and many owe Oluv a donation: he refuses all sponsorships, and Amazon inexplicably de-affiliated him! Check out his videos.) In his video, the NC 700 seemed near-silent compared to the others, which piqued my interest. I'd previously bought the Ankbit (a sub-brand of 1Mii) E600Pro, and was almost over the moon with it, and wondered how much better the Bose could be, at multiples of that price. Not much, it turns out. So this is a comparison, as much as a review.<br/><br/>CODECS<br/>Bose NC 700 HAS NO APTX!! I was shocked: even the Ankbit has AptX! (Update: it does have the proprietary Apple AAC codec, so there's that.) Not as much a problem, it turns out. SBC should be auditorily indistinguishable at strong signals, and is much more stable when dealing with weak signals. Technically, the lack of AptX should be a con, but strangely for me it became a plus, per real-life experience with AptX stability, and study of Bluetooth codecs. The Ankbit can connect on SBC like all BT speakers, but you can't override the auto-negotiation. In real life, codecs are a preference which, for most people, will be based on misunderstanding, so focus on compatibility and stability.<br/><br/>WIRED CAPABILITY<br/>The Bose NC 700 has a tiny, NON-standard 2.5mm wired headphone jack, NOT the standard 3.5mm (1/8-inch) jack!! The unkindest cut: Bose cheaped out, and this EXPENSIVE headset doesn't even include an adapter!<br/>The Ankbits don't even need an adapter, but they were STILL nice to include a fancy wired, TRRS smartphone-compatible headphone cable WITH AN INLINE VOLUME CONTROL WIRED REMOTE! Don't worry, it gets worse!<br/><br/>SOUND<br/>The NC 700 ranges from just "good, but NOT great" in BT (tuned/factory EQ'd) mode, to "bad" in Wired/ANC Off mode, to "downright awful" in Wired/ANC On mode! Yeah, you can install a famously INTRUSIVE Bose app into your inner sanctum and try to make it sound better in Bluetooth mode than Bose themselves could, with your own custom EQ. But the Ankbit sounds unbelievable right out of the box in BT mode, and still sounds pretty good in both wired (ANC On AND Off) modes. Surprisingly, the Ankbits had actually MORE bass in wired (no factory tuning) mode, which is slightly boomy: the Ankbit's BT tuning actually flattens the bass, reserving a bass bump for the lowest registers, making it have incredible bass for music, while amazingly also not interfering with spoken word.<br/> Sidenote: something I've not seen anyone discuss, even "Oluv's Gadgets" is the COMPRESSION EFFECT (lack of dynamic range), which is in addition to the Bose's poor frequency response. The Ankbit is fully dynamic-sounding. The Bose's true auditory flaws: the dearth of bass, combined with a lack of dynamic range, strangely make them excel at lengthy speech. If you listen primarily to talk, or just loathe bass for some reason, or you think I'm an idiot and that you can hear better than me, the Bose should do well for you. I still prefer the Ankbit overall, including for speech, partly due to their comfort.<br/> I'll give you a perfect analogy: the Bose 700 sounds like 'a decent $40 BT headphone'. I have one, I know. It's amazing what 40 bucks will buy now, but it's not the same as the Ankbit E600Pro at a higher price (you can also get promotions via 1Mii's newsletter). Which makes it even more baffling, that at [many times] the price of a median headset for the Bose, you get sound on-par with a median headset. (And far worse in wired modes.) In BT (tuned/EQ'd) mode, while not an enormous difference side by side, it's enough of a difference—for me—to actually "enjoy" the music, vs not enjoy it ("meh"). But I am finicky with audio. So, I wouldn't rely on the Bose if I could only have one headset. And noise cancellation had better be VERY high on your priority list. Also, there are many complaints of Bose users trying to use this headset for PC work, especially Microsoft Teams. Bose even sells an overpriced USB dongle to try to address the issue. Another Bose fail.<br/> UPDATE: there are "Bose NC 700 HP teardown" videos, where you can see how ridiculously tiny the drivers (speakers) are in relation to earcup size. Furthermore, Bose muffles the drivers by mostly covering them with what looks like a layer of thick aluminum foil, possibly to protect what may be an ANC mic suspended over the center of each driver. The small drivers themselves seem like afterthoughts, and further explain the low weight.<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELLATION<br/>The Bose's drivers are curved toward the ear canal by plastic 'ramps' or inserts. This apparently necessitates a small driver, hence reduced bass, and lower sound quality generally. I believe this is a tradeoff to achieve better ANC, which is where this product shines, NOT for music quality. As expected, the Bose is the clear winner in ANC over the Ankbit, altho the Ankbit does quite well. The Bose adds to this by apparently being one of the few who provide ANC to your audience in phone/headset mode (I haven't verified this). My female partner (who I've determined has low-frequency hearing loss) can't understand me with ANC on. Whereas I can understand everyone just fine, as long as I pause whatever's playing. So 'voice cancellation' depends on your hearing ability. And ANC will block deep voices better.<br/> Bose provides 3 levels of ANC from the headphones, but my partner and I only ever use On and "Off" ("transparent mode"), so the Medium just gets in the way. We both prefer Ankbit's physical slider switch, easier and simpler on/off for ANC (which still works when BT is off, BTW).<br/> With the NC 700, ANC IS NEVER OFF!! Level "0" is "Transparency Mode", which actually AMPLIFIES ambient sound!! That's fine, but let me fully turn the ANC mics off, if I want to! That also affects battery life. I think you might be able to fully disable ANC in the app, but then AFAIK you're stuck with no ANC at all, so the solution is worse than the problem.<br/><br/>CHARGING<br/>The Bose 700's can't charge while listening, did you know that?<br/>Yeah, they completely shut off when you plug in.<br/>The Ankbits happily charge while listening.<br/>Both charge via USB-C.<br/>The Ankbit included a charging cable (USB A to C, which is perfect for users with older tech who might not have a USB-C cable). The Bose included NOTHING. Except a fake 'quick start guide', which only insisted (in about 29 languages) that you install their app immediately!<br/><br/>SELF-NOISE<br/>Hiss or white noise from the ANC and BT circuitry is endemic in BT headphones. And BT headphones and speakers will quickly mute their output when you pause media, so it's difficult to study their true self-noise when transmitting sound. Self-noise (both in ANC/Standby, and while playing) is low on the Ankbit, but even lower on the Bose—but still detectable in a quiet environment. I'd say the Bose has quieter circuitry overall, including while playing. However, with the Ankbit you can truly disable ANC, which means 'no' noise when in Standby (nothing playing). If you're in a truly quiet environment and not playing anything, you won't need ANC, but it's still on with the Bose, so the hiss is there too, right when you could actually be bothered by it.<br/>If there is background noise, you probably won't be able to notice any hiss on either.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/>I feel like the Bose rated hours is overly-optimistic. It doesn't take long to go from 100% to 70% state of charge (SOC). The headset feels light, and sacrificing battery size had to be part of that. The other culprit is that ANC is never truly off, in any powered-on mode. Everyone knows ANC saps battery. Even if it's just sitting on your chest, ANC is active, and the battery's draining. The Ankbit will go for literally days with ANC off. Bose loses again.<br/> UPDATE: from the teardown videos, the NC 700 battery is 630 mAH (small). Ankbit claims an 1100 mAH capacity for the E600Pro, almost double, while probably also using less electricity, so that explains that.<br/><br/>COMFORT<br/>The Ankbit E600 Pro is definitely the clear upset winner, despite being slightly heavier. Bigger, wider cups FTW—and they fold, UNLIKE the Bose. The Achilles heel of the E600Pro is Ankbit/1Mii made the headband too long (the only fix is to wrap something around the headband). The NC 700 simply fits small (female-medium and smaller) heads better. The Bose cups touch my ears; Ankbit's don't. Bose earcups are tighter, and disappointingly vinyl-covered, not fabric. The 700's are not uncomfortable, but the E600Pro is one of the most comortable headphones I've ever worn. Ankbit wins again.<br/> I will say that I suspect the Bose design feels more sturdy. Neither are 'creaky', but the Ankbit feels more plasticky and fragile, and I've seen photos of broken Ankbit arms, but not Bose 700's (other Bose, yes). It doesn't seem common at this point, but Ankbit shouldn't use thin structural plastic. And I've had the plastic arm on a cheaper, gently-used BT headset break recently, so now I'm worried. The Bose 700 uses plastic for structure, but seems stronger.<br/> I've tried 2 wraps to lower the Ankbit's headband height for my partner, the simplest being an ACE bandage. Both worked for her, though we shouldn't need to do that. Even without the wrap, the large cups provided a bit of extra travel on her head, so it still fit, despite being too low.<br/><br/>ANC<br/>Bose wins: this is really what you're paying the high price for. But NEITHER are substitutes for real hearing protection (I've experimented). ANC can be helpful for less-serious noise like a vacuum cleaner or blender, but NOT as range earmuffs, etc. On that note, the Bose would give me weird, somewhat-painful pops from the speaker in the ear closer to a significant noise, such as blenders. So it really wasn't even useful for that. The Ankbit's noise cancellation wasn't good enough to run a blender AND hear my program, unless I turned it up to unhealthy levels, though it was helpful if Paused. Earmuffs were just better. Where ANC shines is background noise, such as air conditioners and traffic. Bose is the pioneer in ANC, back to the 1980s, but you'll pay for it. The noise cancellation reaches into higher frequencies than its competitors, due to more mics, better processing, and probably that weird 'ramp' inside the earcups (which ensuing small drivers I think are the culprit for the crap audio quality).<br/><br/>VOICE PROMPTS<br/>The NC 700 is overly-active with voice prompting, with a full TTS engine that sounds suspiciously like Microsoft's "Zira" voice, but some will like that. At least the Bose briefly pauses your media whenever it does one of its many prompts. But the auto-pausing can cause problems, or just not work at all with certain applications (in whole, it's a plus). The Ankbit features the famously-bad Chinese computer lady saying "ANC on", but thankfully that's the only voice prompt, the rest are beeps. The audio prompts of both the Bose and Ankbit are both too loud (hurts my ears, which is ironic for devices that are supposed to block noise). The best thing is that the Bose can actually verbally tell you the SOC (and WILL tell you, when you turn it on—even if you don't want it to), whereas the Ankbit won't bug you about battery level until it's already unhealthily low, so you have to be more proactive.<br/><br/>APP<br/>I encourage all users to NOT use "apps", unless they're genuinely necessary or important to you. Even then, for security I'd encourage you to install those apps on a "low security" device. I think it's crazy for people to do online banking on mobile devices, but it's somehow common. Let's put it this way: any device you'd do banking on, you shouldn't install apps randomly, especially on Android.<br/> There is no difference between "security" and "privacy". Bluetooth headphone apps are notorious for stabbing you in the back. Bose was not the only one discovered to be doing highly questionable things with their app. REMEMBER, these headphones have MICROPHONES, plus the apps can monitor mobile device activity and location. Bose furthermore infamously forced everyone to REGISTER just to use their app. It later blew up in their face, and I'm taking off an extra star just for this.<br/> I find the ability to customize an EQ compelling, but I'd rather have a device which didn't need its sound tweaked in the first place. Being extremely finicky, but also anti-app, I took a chance on the Ankbit E600Pro, which has no app. Thankfully, my gamble paid off. I'm overjoyed by the Ankbit's sound.<br/> I don't plan to install the Bose app, because I didn't buy the Bose for music (luckily). But if I do, it won't be on a device I use regularly, and I'll probably uninstall it when I get the EQ I wanted anyway. I also won't give Bose any genuine personal info, nor should you, but they can probably figure out a lot anyway, depending your device. The Bose app EQ isn't very sophisticated anyway (not many bands). I'll just keep the crappy default tuning, as it works for speech, and these headphones will never be great for music. I have better stuff for that.. including the Ankbit.<br/><br/>SWAGGER<br/>I despise the idea of buying/not buying a practical item based on looks or social BS. Both the Ankbit and Bose have a narrow headband profile which doesn't look as chunky as many over-the-ear 'phones. Of course the Bose "look" better, but you pay a price for the 'spacey' design: they don't fold, and hair can get trapped easier in those 'poles'. Though I hardly have any hair-pulling with either, I have less with the Ankbit (virtually none, it's amazing). For those of yous who would buy Bose based on 'impressing' people, I'll tell you that true audio enthusiasts almost universally dislike Bose, and oftentimes despise them. Bose is no 'hood ornament' for me, it's a mark of shame. The one thing I respect by Bose, is their ANC headsets. They make (expensive ones) for pilots, and I think were first to market with ANC. That's where my respect stops, and the "app" beef set the disrespect in stone. Bose is always-overpriced stuff that usually sounds 'good' but not 'great'. I think both "Ankbit" and "1Mii" are ridiculous names, but the company has pretty solid (China-based) support, and a warehouse in the US. I can't speak firsthand about Bose support.<br/><br/>CONTROLS<br/>I don't hate the Bose touch controls as much as I thought. Volume control can be more nuanced than the Ankbit, depending device. I still prefer well-implemented physical buttons. I've had numerous times when the touch-sensitive area rested on my shoulder or hands, and unexpectedly announced the battery SOC. You also can't use most gloves. But the Projected Capacitive Touch Sensor is well-implemented.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>You don't always get what you pay for. There are better choices for a lot less money, EXCEPT if you want the best ANC (and ANC for the microphone)—and are willing to endure Diminishing Returns for it.<br/> The Bose was an expensive experiment and gamble, but since my life partner and I were 'fighting' over the Ankbit, we needed another. And since the Ankbit was a bit too big for her, and I like to experiment, I held my nose and tried the Bose. I went into this knowing the Bose music quality would be sub-par. But we mainly use headphones for speech, so adding wireless has been liberating. I wanted to experience the state of the art with ANC. I nearly bought a Bluetooth-equipped 'hearing-protection' type muff, but thought we'd have comfort issues (she hates having her "head squeezed"). Pay your luxury tax and sacrifice music quality if you want the best ANC there is (but not the best "muffling": true hearing protection earmuffs will still blow it away).<br/> Despite the fact that the Ankbit doesn't even fit her right due to the too-long headband, my LP still says she would STILL choose the Ankbit, if she could only have ONE (though due to the fitment issue—and that alone—it was a hard question for her). That's even if I didn't wrap the headband to bulk it up! That's saying a lot. And she claims even she can discern the better music quality of the Ankbit. That's saying a lot too!</span>

<span>This is not the first set of Shure earbuds I've owned.  I had a set of the E2c's, which were fantastic.  After about 5 years of hard labor, they finally gave up the ghost, and suffered the usual death by cable rot to which that series of buds were so prone.  So I took to the search for a replacement, and these were my criteria...<br/><br/>1.  They must be in-ear style buds, with the option to switch the sleeves (The piece that goes in the ear).  Also, they must include those swappable pieces.<br/><br/>2. They must have a good warranty of at least 2 years.<br/><br/>3.  They must not cost more than ~100 USD.<br/><br/>4.  They must sound great.<br/><br/>(These are in no order of preference, and all considered equal)<br/><br/>So with that in mind, I also need to mention that I was partial to Shure.  Mostly, because the E2c's were my first real good set of earphones, and broke down all my stigmas as to "Why would anyone pay so much for headphones?"  So here is my review.<br/><br/>The Sleeves - There are 2 different types of sleeves bundled with this set; one a flexible rubber, the other a re-expandable foam.  Each has three separate sizes, to help you find a good fit.  I tried both.  The foam sleeves feel nice, so long as you insert them like earplugs.  They expand nicely to your ear canal.  They offer fantastic sound isolation, and stay inside.  The rubber sleeves are comfortable, but they are constantly being pulled out of your ears by the very stiff cord.  I will try them again once I get the cord broken in a bit more, but for now, I'm going with the foam sleeves.<br/><br/>The Warranty - 2 years, not bad, but my E2c's had 3.  From what I hear, the cable rot issue is still going on, but I will expand on that in a minute.<br/><br/>The cost - If you can get them for 100 USD, then do it.  I think they are normally 2X that price.<br/><br/>The Sound - At first, I was a bit worried.  I was hearing some odd pops in the earphones.  Pops that I shouldn't be hearing from a headset this expensive.  But, that turned out to be from the player I had them plugged into.  I tried a different source, and no pops.  They are at least as good as my E2c's were when I first got them.  There is some talk about the lows and highs and all that, and I don't know about all that.  I know that I was getting some weird looks at the restaurant I was at when I was headbanging and booth-breaking (sit down dancing at my table) to the music.  I listen to a lot of rock, electronica, and trip hop, and it all sounds great.<br/><br/>Other Stuff - I mentioned the cables, and for good reason.  Shure has a history of cable rot; the insulation on the wires literally rots off, and results in dead headphones.  To combat that, they have added 2 features.  One, an additional layer of insulation around where the wire goes over the ear (The most common place of rot).  This likely extends the life of the cable, which makes it even thicker than it already is, which makes it VERY stiff.  This stiffness leads to the cable not staying in place, and needing some serious breaking in, which in turn could lead to breaking the wire.  So be careful, and be patient.  If you use the foam sleeves, then it isn't that big of a problem.<br/>The other thing is that they made the cable able to be detached from the earpiece, which means you can replace it if it goes bad.  This is nice, except that, it's proprietary.  It is unlikely that Shure will still have these cables in a few years available for purchase or otherwise.  So while it's a nice feature, you likely won't be able to use it for anything other than changing the color of your wires.  (It would likely be a good idea to order a spare once these earbuds are discontinued).<br/><br/>I also want to comment on the case that comes with the set.  At first, I didn't like it, becasue my previous Shure's had such a nice case.  It was solid, with an insert in the middle that you could wrap the cords around and place the drivers inside of.  This case is soft, and has no way to manage the cables or drivers other than jsut stuffing them inside, which is what I didn't like at first.  But over time, I have grown to like how much more compact it is.  The soft case fits easily into my pocket, and keeps everything pretty contained (the last case bulged a lot).  And I've never once had an issue where I felt they were compromised as a result.  So I would say the soft case works quite well, and has a sharp looking Shure logo on it.<br/><br/>So that's my experience with the 215's.  I recommend them to anyone that knows how important a good set of headphones are, but doesn't have a lot of money to dedicate to them.</span>

<span>These monitors sound great and the compressible tips make for a perfect fit every time since they fill up in your ear, although that makes them very high pressure and slightly uncomfortable. I do happen to have very sensitive ears so for most, it should be perfectly fine.<br/><br/>The cable is very basic and can tangle, so if you want higher quality, go with the next step up.<br/><br/>These work fantastically and I can blast my drum set at any volume and still hear my music or met perfectly. A great pickup for cheap.</span>

<span>okay, so first, the bluetooth works better than any other i have used.  it still suffers from the side-effects of all bluetooth, cuts out in the cold, distance and obstruction level to the source but it cuts out A LOT less than MANY other bluetooth headphones i have used.  this literally puts all others (i have used at least 10 sets of bluetooth earphones including many highly rated ones) to shame in sound quality and functionality!<br/><br/>second, the sound quality, of high-end earphones with isolated drivers, this is clearly above the rest i have used.  the sound is well balanced and very crisp and clear for a single driver earphone.  i have the competitions also and i would say the shures have better sound.<br/><br/>lastly, these were a bit uncomfortable at first but when you use them and as you use them, most of it is just pressure points on your ears and they will get used to that.  on my 5th wearing, i was really used to the feel and they didnt bother me at all.<br/><br/>on top of all of that, this is ipx4 so really, REALLY helps make these more wearable because if not, water will get in these over time and will ruin them as they have for many other ones.  the ipx4 is only splash proof and it would be nice to have a higher level but even as that, i can wear these to the gym working out and not worry about them failing.<br/><br/>seriously, i have really high-end earphones for clear sound but these may be overall my favorite earphones!</span>

<span>I think these in-ear monitors are a good value but i had the darnedest time trying to a get a perfect fit. I haven’t figured out how to get the foam pad inserts off and replace them with the multiple others that came with it. The directions were very confusing.  I’ll have to ask some of my band mates. This is my first time using in-ear monitors.</span>
