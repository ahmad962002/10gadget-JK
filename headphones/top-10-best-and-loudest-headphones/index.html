<span>These headphones are pretty amazing, they have the best bass I have heard on headphones 10 out of 10! And if you are nerodivergent like me and love bass these headphones will not disappoint at all! All in all a great sensory experience for anyone that loves to feel the bass. The sound quality is really really good the bass doesn't distort the sound quality, they are built very nice and have some weight to them. They also come with built in Tile which comes in handy if you miss place things around the house, they come with a nice case that is plush on the inside and has pockets to hold the charging cable and AUX cable.</span>

<span>For years I've been searching for headphones with a lot of bass and a lot of volume. I've gone through so many web searches for headphones with both, and I'm always disappointed with what I get. Finally I've come to this set. Now first off, I like my music louder and I like more bass than most people, I think. For what that's worth. I find these headphones... loud enough for sort-of loud listening for long periods. I'd like them to be louder, but if they were, they wouldn't really be safe for long-term listening. So they're adequate from that point of view. Now the bass, is where these really shine. I never thought I'd find headphones that had TOO MUCH bass, but these headphones can get there. These headphones produce surprisingly solid and deep bass. I thought the vibration effect was going to be a gimmick that I would just turn off, but unlike other Skullcandy earphones, this effect works. Even with the bass adjustment slider at only 20%, music has a very full, solid bottom end. When I do some rap with a lot of bass, I can turn the slider up more, and although it's nowhere near as loud, it's similar to being in a car with good subwoofers, just surrounding you with bass. Listening to rock and heavy metal, the drums and bass are much more full and really gives the music some body. I really wish I could get another, like 3 db out of these headphones, but so far they're pretty usable for listening to music all day long while I'm working. And if you like bass, trust me, these headphones are the only game in town. Don't even bother with anything else, it'll be crap.</span>

<span>This headphone is very capable of deafening you permanently in minutes. No joke, do not recommend giving them to young children as it could quite easily harm their hearing forever! Headphones are very well made and ooze good quality. Not keen on the carry pouch as opposed to the much nicer cases. But even the pouch is top quality materials and perfectly adequate for it job. I thoroughly recommend using the Skullcandy app to get the most out of your phone. Crusher EVO even comes with a built in tile tracker. Not sure why? Using a parametric equalizer is essential to get the most out of these VERY loud headphones. Its quality of sound is surprisingly good. But these are about bass, lots and lots of bass! There is a manual bass slider on the headphones and well places actual buttons for controlling your media. Comfort is not great. Ear wells are very small and the head cushion is not well designed and pressed down hard after a while. But, these are not something you will want to use for hours and hours. Because they are so powerful! It's really like being too close to the main speakers at a rock concert.....on your head! They don't use traditional drivers and as such can get more range without muddling the mids highs and lows. These are fun, not to be taken too seriously. If you like really punchy bass, read, BASS and have access to IEM'S or open backs, then get them. They are really fun! These are seriously powerful headphones and you only get one set of ears. But, you don't need the volume to get the bass as its got it from the bottom of the dial! It's a solid headphone. Well made and look great. Battery life is amazingly good 40 to 50 hours easy and it just feels nice, everything is just done right. I like mine and when I want to feel like I'm at a concert they work wonders. Movies sound excellent! No ANC and no LDAC is a shame. But who needs ANC? Trust me, you won't hear anything apart from your music! LDAC missing is a shame. But they still sound good. Can be used wired and have a port on each ear. Some people think they have motors in them to just vibrate the bass. They don't! They don't use traditional speaker cones and that sound is real! They are just fun, very loud and very well made headphones. For this price point you can't do much better. 10/10 Recommended.</span>

<span>Firstly the box was very weighty. The headphones feel great, though I found they sat weird on my head and it took a minute to find how they sit best for me. The headband isn't very padded. The pride decal on the headband looks very cheap. It's a nice touch it just doesn't look like it was executed as well as it could have been.<br/><br/>The bag is nice feeling pleather with embroidery details and a rainbow strip at the opening. The inside is super soft and has two pockets for cords, etc.<br/><br/>The headphones have little to no noise canceling, BUT they also don't seem to bleed sound so you can blast your music and won't disturb others. I had my music with the haptic bass all the way up and my wife said she maybe heard a tiny sound but she had to strain to try and head it.<br/><br/>Sound quality is great as expected from Skullcandy. Know WHAT sort of sound experience you like. Skullcandy in general tends to lean into bass more then high range so that's to be expected.<br/><br/>The Haptic Bass is the key feature here. Having music at a reasonable volume and the haptic base slider even just a little up gives a nice physical bass feel that enhances bass in music. Turning the volume and haptic bass all the way to the max will vibrate your soul. General agreement in my household is you lose out on the high and mid ranges with it turned up. The bass drowns out a lot and you get a more muddy sound. Personally I was looking for something that would be more bass heavy and don't care about losing the highs in exchange for heavier lows. With the bass turned off you can watch a show and it sounds just fine.<br/><br/>Final thoughts if you're looking for headphones to give you a heavy bass but also work well for basic listening (podcasts, shows, etc) these are perfect.  Overall I am very pleased with them. Fingers crossed I don't wear out them out to fast.</span>

<span>I bought these as a gift for my college student sister who has some sensory issues, headphones are both vital for noise cancellation and the physical fit on her head. She finds them extremely comfortable and will even wear them when not connected to block and muffle the sound of her annoying roommate. She says the sound quality, noise cancellation, and sleek look of these had been the best quality she’s ever owned. Her snapchats she sends while using these sound so crystal clear compared to no headphones. The charging time is accurate and they last a whole day of use for her.

<span>I did quit a bit of research into my next pair of headphones - I do several cross-continent air trips a year, and truth be told, lots of people in a confined space like an airplane irritates me - so i strive to block it all out completely.<br/><br/>These do not quite fully isolate the wearer - but they do a darn-good job for the price, and the audio is Skullcandy-"excellent" - I like the deep/rich R&amp;B style bass that most Skullcandy products are known for.<br/><br/>My only gripe -it is not covered (yet?) by the Skullcandy phone app, so I can't adjust any parameters yet - but they do sound excellent in default mode.<br/><br/>Ambient mode works very well - if someone is coming up to say something, I tap the button twice, and they suddenly relay the voices around me into the speakers.

<span>I use these for listening to music and podcasts as well as noise cancelation on flights and when I’m reading and am very happy with them. They fit my smallish head comfortably. I’m sure there is a reason behind it but it is frustrating to ne that the included charge cord is exclusive to only these headphones and that it is only 3” long. Super awkward and if I lose it there is no other cord that will fit the charge port that I can use. My old Hesh 3’s at least used a universal style charge port. Now I have to keep track of a new style just for these which has proven more than once already to be a pain. Otherwise they have been a great upgrade and replacement to the old style.</span>

<span>I like my new headphones, but my only complaint is that the noise cancelling feature puts a lot of pressure on your eardrums. I know that's how all noise cancelling works, but the feeling of pressure in your ears is not exactly pleasant - and for some reason - these make me feel more disoriented than other brands I use. I tend to listen without the noise cancelling feature engaged, which is fine. The headphones create a solid seal around your ear regardless, so little noise leaks through. Overall happy, but still getting used to the pressure.</span>

<span>Apple AirPods Pro user here!<br/><br/>My AirPods started crackling and Apple would not replace them and I refused to pay $250 to have them replaced.<br/><br/>For the price point, these are well worth the money! In fact, I would have definitely paid $150 for these earbuds.<br/><br/>ANC is not quite as good as the AirPods, but still blocks out most background noise. The only thing I wish is that they had a toggle on/off for the ANC.<br/><br/>The sound quality is great! I’d say they are 100% on par with AirPod Pros (except without the crackling crap). Good bass without cutting out high frequencies. Good balance in the EQ’s, even without the high-def. drivers in the AirPod Pro’s.<br/><br/>The comfort level is basically as good. The only reason for me is because I switched so I was just used to the way the AirPods feel in my ears, so that’s just personal preference.<br/><br/>Most importantly, they have USB-C charging, something Apple does not have. This is where Apple is behind on a lot of things in their devices. But then again, their phones are the only ones that take thunderbolt 2’s, so it’s good marketing I suppose.<br/><br/>Great earbuds overall!</span>

<span>For no reason in particular, it took me a while to make the switch from wired earbuds to wireless. While I've had a couple of Bluetooth mics over the years, they were all the single-ear models with mini boom mics that only worked for phone calls and made you look like a stock broker or Hollywood agent about to throw a fit at the Starbucks barista. Respect your food service workers, they put up with a lot. In any case, I figured I might as well try headphones that I wouldn't fall asleep on/get snagged on a door handle and mess up my phone's headphone port/strangle me.<br/><br/>Not knowing what exactly I should expect with wireless headphones, I figured that for the time being, I should get something relatively cheap so I could get an idea of what I did and didn't want from a headset. Plus, I travel and run outdoors a lot, so the potential for losing something that was normally physically tethered to me and my device was high. I've paid good money for headphones before (I have a couple of very coddled Sennheisers for when I really want to try and feel impressive to strangers), so I was all for paying less than $20 for what was essentially a test drive set that I'd wear to death (see my history with headphones above).<br/><br/>PACKAGING:<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about the box. It arrived unharmed. Production value was fine enough. The logo and packaging wasn't that far removed from the Beats by Dre sets. As someone who saw a lot of knockoff Beats in bazaars in Afghanistan, it struck me as funny but not a red flag. Those ones weren't half bad either (or so some buddies claimed, during their mid-deployment career transition to retail wholesaler). Good enough branding to catch a well-meaning grandma shopping for her grandkids off guard. You'll end up with these and some Transmorpher DVDs.<br/><br/>The carrying case was nice, kind of a faux carbon fiber external and a soft fuzzy interior. Pliable enough to where you couldn't use it as a bludgeon, but firm enough to where you'd notice if you started to sit on it. Just don't sit all the way on it - it isn't really carbon fiber. It fit the headphones, and a 3-inch charging cable that I never really used because only Luddites don't have at least one micro USB cable magically appear in your junk drawer.<br/><br/>After the headphones, tiny cable, and case, the only other item was the instructions. They were not written by someone who speaks English as their first language. Probably not second, either. Whatever. Google Translate did the best it could.<br/><br/>SET UP:<br/><br/>Translation problems aside, the quick start guide was simple enough that you'd get the gist. Actually pairing them to my Galaxy S9 was also simple, although I had to do it three or four times until the two devices actually got to know each other. I'm an introvert, so I didn't hold it against them. Once paired, reconnecting was easier, but still not instant. I'd say the rate of automatically pairing on the first try was about 90%. I'd have to turn on the headset and set my phone to scan at pretty much the same instant, but that was easy enough to learn (I don't set my phone's Bluetooth to "always-on," so perhaps I'd do better if I had). Exact same experience pairing the set to my Alienware home computer and Apple iPad mini (4th gen, I think - it was a gift that was new in 2018). So, it pairs easily across Windows, Android, and iOS hardware as if they were the same.<br/><br/>CONNECTIVITY AND EASE OF USE:<br/><br/>The button layout is pretty standard if you've ever had headphones with phone control functions. There's a single multipurpose button on the right bud that handles power, playing/pausing, and answering/hanging up calls. Above that is a volume rocker that handles previous/next track with a long press. Each button has a satisfying, tactile click to it that leaves little to the imagination. Response is immediate, you know when you've pressed the right buttons. Sensual and effective. Good times.<br/><br/>The range is better than I anticipated for what I paid. I live in a 600 square foot/65 square meter apartment, and I've neglected to realize that I set my phone down on the table by my front door while listening to music in my bedroom down the hall and on the other side of a wall. It's never broken its pairing with my devices. That being said, I've probably never tested the range beyond 50 feet/15 meters. Beyond that, I'd probably permanently lose one or both devices to the ether. I won't risk it. I'm forgetful sometimes.<br/><br/>It will, however, skip repeatedly at random. This is my biggest problem with this set, and it loses half a star for it. I'd be listening to music with the phone in my left pant pocket and the sound will cut out or "skip" like if you bumped an old CD Walkman. Sometimes, it would last a split second, sometimes it would garble for five or six seconds. Holding my phone directly next to the headset would always improve it, but if I put it back in my pocket, it was 50/50 whether it stayed normalized. After fuzzing out for a minute or so, it would self-right itself and I'd be good for the next few hours until it repeated itself. I could never find a rhyme or reason for why it went when it did, but it seemed to get worse the more I used them for phone calls and not just music. Calls were a mess, and I had to ask a caller to repeat themselves at lease once or twice every conversation. However, as much as I listen to music, phone calls were a very small portion of the headset's workload. Honestly, it was a minor inconvenience, but given that it only has two functions (streaming audio and streaming calls), it's a glaring one.<br/><br/>Another small issue is the low battery warning. A voice tells you that the battery is low, and you'd be lucky to make it more than ten minutes before it shuts down. The battery's good for six hours, and since I'm pretty good at topping off my devices, it was rarely an issue.<br/><br/>AUDIO QUALITY:<br/><br/>As a disclaimer, I'm not an audiophile that can lecture on the specifics of sound quality. I can't debate the merits on one brand over another. I can't afford recording studio-quality. I've tried many headphones over the years, with price points ranging from "no-name-found-only-at-gas-stations" to "well-to-do-but-definitely-not-country-club-member." I do know the difference between bass and treble, and not much else. For reference, I have some Sennheisers that proved my all-time personal gold standards for headphones (an HD 558 for home use and a CX 300B MK II for travel, with a MX 365 for daily use).<br/><br/>These are not Sennheisers. They're probably not even Jbuds.<br/><br/>I'm not saying they're bad. Actually, they're quite good - for the price point. Basses are good (when they're occasionally there), but tend to get drowned out by normal street traffic. Everything else is sharp and vocals are clearly defined but it all feels muted to a degree. If I were to sum it up, it's as if I were listening to a decent headset through a dense pillow. I'm confident the problem isn't my sound settings on my phone. I've never really tried to fiddle with the equalizer, but I've used both my wired Sennheiser earbuds and a JLab J4 wired to much greater effect under standard settings.<br/><br/>Audio quality during phone calls is hit-or-miss, and I suspect a lot of that was because of the "skipping" issue mentioned above in the Connectivity section. Since conversations aren't constant streams of audio like songs are (mine aren't, at least - no judgment on you fast talkers), it's harder to gauge. Voices sounded tinny a lot of the time, but clear. I've been told I sounded fairly clear when I talked through them. I only ever had trouble hearing callers when I was walking down a busy street.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>I still don't know enough about the performance gap between wireless and wired headphones, if there is one at all anymore. It is 2020, after all. That being said, my experience with Otium was far more positive than negative. Despite connectivity issues that led to some occasionally garbled audio during music and calls, the ease of use, good battery life, feather-light weight, and solid construction make this a great choice for someone looking for a simple wireless headset at an entry-level price point.<br/><br/>Sadly, I lost my headset after accidentally leaving it in the back of an Uber. Considering I bought it for $17, owned it for about a year, and it would cost me at least $15 in fees to Uber to retrieve it, I chalked it up to a loss. That being said, if I still had it, I could easily imagine owning it for at least a year after that, something that I'd never consider with a wired headphone at the same price. The performance was totally consistent throughout that year. On the plus side, this gives me an excuse to get more in-depth with the range of wireless headsets out there. I'm using my $20 wired Sennheiser MX 365s for now, but I definitely miss the qualities of being tangle-free. Even if I don't return to Otium, they definitely helped me get my foot in the door. I'll definitely give them a lot of credit for that.</span>

<span>My number one reason for loving these headphones is the fact that they are the first pair that has ever come close to fitting and staying in my ears while running. They come with 4 or 5 different bud sizes, and I use the smallest ones.  Unfortunately, the piece that goes around the ear is still slightly too big, so when I really work up a sweat running, the left one tends to fall off. I think most people won't have this problem and they are otherwise very comfortable and secure. The material is a little tacky (in a good way), but not sticky. It doesn't bother me at all when I'm exercising.<br/><br/>My number two reason for loving them is how easy it is to connect, disconnect and control media. It automatically picks up my phone and laptop beautifully. When I am in range of both devices, it tells me my "headset is connected" twice, so I know both have been picked up. I can listen to content seamlessly between phone and laptop. Battery life is great.<br/><br/>I don't use them for noise cancelling, so I don't really notice if they are doing that; however, I can always easily hear what I'm listening to...which makes me think the noise cancellation must be decent.<br/><br/>If I were to make any improvements, it would be 1. Offer a smaller size for the wrap-around ear piece; 2. Have some sort of indicator of whether the headphones are on or off...sometimes I forget if I've turned them off or not.<br/><br/>That's about it! I got on here specifically to write a review because I'm so happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>These Otium Bluetooth earbuds are overall good, for their price point. What that means is, I didn't expect the world from them, and for that, they have not given me the world either. I purchased these to use as a cheap work headphones that hopefully would also be okay to use as a mic while on a call from time to time as well. I'm not sure where the mic is supposed to be, evidently built in somewhere, but on only one or both I don't really know. Headphone-wise they easily suffice. Microphone-wise.. meh. Callers on the other end seem to only hear me 1/2 the time, at best (usually less though), no matter what I do to try and make it better, and I find myself disconnecting them and putting my phone to my face so I can be heard, completely negating one of the main uses of them. People on the other end say everything but my actual voice seems really loud/amplified. I can hear them just fine, but a lot of times it's not the other way around for whatever reason, bummer 😕.<br/>Their pairing speed is flawless &amp; top notch to my phone, and they vocally inform you when they are paired &amp; unpaired, which I like. Sometimes they don't quite unpair/turn off so quickly though, and they just wind up chucked into my lunch pale to turn themselves off whenever they feel ready to 🙄, which they do after a certain period of time from not being used (during the drive home). So these do have a couple little issues, or my pair for sure at least. I'll probably demote them to outdoor yard/property work headphones where I'm making a lot of noise &amp; wouldn't be on the phone at that time anyway (mowing/snow blowing). So I'll be looking for a different pair to use for what I was hoping to accomplish with these in the first place. That being the case, I'm on the fence between 3 or 4 star overall rating for these. Guess I'll be nice.</span>

<span>I definitely recommend these earbuds to anyone not wanting to break the bank. I've had these earbuds for quite some time now and I must say they are VERY durable.<br/><br/>I've slept in theses earbuds more times than I can count and they have yet to break on me. I've also dropped them a few times as well and they hold up to this day. I take these earbuds with me to work due to me not wanting to lose the individual true wireless earbuds, I normally loop the earbuds through my bra strap to keep up with them when I'm no the go.<br/><br/>The sound and base quality are not bad at all for affordable earbuds. I have bought certain name brand earbuds that do not sound nearly as good as these. The nose canceling is definitely not bad as well. So, if your looking for some affordable earbuds that give good sound, base and noise cancelation quality, for an affordable piece, look no further these won't disappoint.</span>

<span>Overall these earbuds met my expectations. Great sound quality, great battery life, small compact sturdy carrying case, smooth connection, fit comfortably for long periods of time. Personally I really like that the side control buttons on the earbuds are physical buttons rather than touch controls.<br/><br/>With the side control buttons you can perform the following actions:<br/>Next Song - 1 press left<br/>Previous  - 2 press left<br/>play/pause - 1 press right<br/>accept/end call - 1 press right<br/>siri/google assist/bixby - 2 press right<br/>You can also just use only the right or left earbud in mono mode and then 1 press will be play/pause and 2 press siri...<br/><br/>Cons<br/>These earbuds are not on the list of supported devices for the JBL headphones app so you won't be able to do any EQ customization or personalization.<br/><br/>There are no way to change volume with the buttons which would have been nice to see. The one time I've found this to be a headache is when using the earbuds with my Samsung smart tv which didn't allow me to change the volume of the earbuds from the remote or settings. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be way around this because these earbuds are not supported on their app.</span>

<span>Let me preface this by saying that I went with these to replace a previous JBL model that I had very good use out of. The batteries simply stopped holding a charge after nearly 4 years of daily use.<br/><br/>I am going to break this up into a few points that I hope help others when deciding on this product.<br/>1. I mainly use these for audio books at a rate of around 90 minutes a day, give or take. I have used them for hands free calling as well. They preform well at both functions. Though I do not listen to music with them very often, the sound quality is average. They are small ear buds, do not expect a huge sound from them.<br/>2. The battery life seems to be as good if not better than the previous model. I get about 2 weeks use at an hour to hour and a half per day nearly every day, so 15-20 hours per charge.<br/>3. The ear buds them self are very comfortable. They feel very light and I often forget I have one or both of them in. The noise cancelling aspect is adequate without completely blocking out background noise that you may need to hear. The straight portion that aims down from your ear helps to keep them in a good position.<br/>The controls on the side of the ear buds are ok. I had to keep in mind that they were relying on touch, rather than a button press, but once I was used to them I had the pause, fast forward, and rewind controls down pretty good. I like that they are more reactive than the previous model which had a hard push needed to actually get them to pause and there was no ff/rw option.<br/>4. Now the part that I do not like at all. The charging/storage case is just designed poorly. Either the case needs to be a little larger or the top needs to open all of the way, not just a 90 degree angle. This makes the buds very difficult to get out of the case. I have dropped these more in the past 2 weeks than the past 4 years with the prior model just trying to get them out of the case.<br/><br/>I am going to say overall that I give these a generous 4 out of 5 for my usage (again I do not listen to music through them often).</span>

Bose Sport Earbuds are designed to energize your exercise with acclaimed lifelike sound and a comfortable secure fit. Get ready to beat your personal best, again and again. Bose patented acoustic port design and premium, high-efficiency drivers combine to deliver big sound from a small acoustic package. Bose signature Volume-Optimized Active EQ automatically adjusts the bass, midrange, and treble based on how loud or soft you play your music. And Bose new StayHear Max tips create an airtight seal with your ear canal — critical for hearing the deep low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and for blocking the ambient noise around you so you can focus on your music and your workout. Bose Sport Earbuds come with three sizes of StayHear Max tips, so you can find the right fit for you. Every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep your Bose Sport Earbuds securely in place — without need of an ear hook — no matter how much you shake your head or jump up and down.Bose Sport Earbuds go through rigorous quality testing for durability. They’re also rated IPX4 for water resistance, which means they’re protected against sweat and light rain. The electronics inside are wrapped in special materials that protect them from moisture, so your earbuds stay in top shape, just like you. Bose Sport Earbuds feature a capacitive touch interface. On the right Earbud, tap to play or pause music and to answer calls. And on the left Earbud, double-tap to engage a Shortcut function of your choice like checking your battery level. If you get a phone call, instead of interrupting your workout, simply tap the right Earbud or press and hold it to reject. If you answer, you’ll hear the call clearly in both ears. Meanwhile, your caller will hear you clearly, too — thanks to the beam forming microphone array that separates your voice from surrounding noise.Bose Sport Earbuds provide up to 5 hours of battery life per charge. They’re charged by placing them in the included charging case. If the case is charged, it will automatically charge the earbuds. The status lights on each Earbud will pulse white, while they charge before turning solid white and then off when fully charged. When the case is fully charged, it can provide a 15-minute quick charge for up to 2 more hours or two full charges for up to 10 more hours.Bose Sport Earbuds offer complete freedom of movement. As long as you’re within 30 feet (9 meters) of your device, you’ll hear whatever you’re playing. And with Bose custom-designed antennas hidden inside each Earbud, dropouts are rare.Bose Sport Earbuds connect to the free Bose Music app, which lets you name your earbuds, set the controls the way you like them, check your battery, and more.

<span>I own Bose QC 35 wireless II headphones, and the Soundsport Wireless Free earbuds. Both pair simultaneously with with my smartphone and tablet through the Bose Connect app, so I rarely have to worry about connecting/disconnecting a device. My Soundsport Free’s battery finally died after two years. They are great earbuds...great fit, sound. So it was natural to order the new Bose Sport earbuds to replace them.<br/><br/>To my surprise, the new Sports required that I use the new “better” Bose Music app. Whatever it’s mysterious advantages, the new app will only connect the earbuds to one device at a time, so I have to swap the connection every time I switch between my smartphone and tablet. This is better? And I have to use two different apps for two Bluetooth wireless headphones from the same manufacturer? Makes no sense. Bose...it’s simple. One app that can control all your Bose wireless products...like Sonos. Really your current approach makes you look very second tier from a software perspective. Get with the program.<br/><br/>The Bose Sport earbuds don’t fit quite as well as the Soundsport Frees for me. I use the midsize tips, and they look to be the same size on both but on the Sports the material is a little stiffer and more grippy (intentional I’m sure), but this makes them have more pressure against the ear which is a little less comfortable than the Soundsports, but I don’t notice after a while and they are still comfortable, just not AS comfortable. All depends on your ears though, and they are light and will never fall out, and a great design overall IMHO.<br/><br/>The controls operate through touchpads on each earphone. People rightfully complained that there were no volume controls, but they added it to right earbud through a software update and it’s hit or miss but works okay when running, though very imprecise. The overall limited controls...no ability to skip back a track, but can skip forward, doesn’t really bother me, but maybe it does others. Overall I think the approach is to have fairly simple controls on the earbuds that you can operate without searching for a little button. I think it works overall, and once you get used to it you can execute basic controls without breaking a step - but you’ll still “miss” a lot. Oh...and a  feature where if you take out the right earbud the music stops is actually very useful..a feature I can say really makes things easier for a runner like me seeing people I know on the street.<br/><br/>The sound is excellent, clean and deep bass (not “tight” or punchy) but accurate, with a wide soundstage with clear highs that you can play loud without hurting your ears. The sound doesn’t hit you up we the head with anything...just tries to present the whole picture accurately, and does this very well.<br/><br/>The phone capability is okay. Fine. No better than the Soundsport Free. Sometimes people can hear me and sometimes they can’t. Blech.<br/><br/>I’ve considered returning them, but for my use...mostly for running, working out and walking, they work well. Still pretty comfortable, very secure, good sound. Case is small enough for my needs but not svelte as many prefer. Battery life doesn’t compete well with competitors. There’s no reason Bose could not have added more charging hours in the larger case. What a miss competitively. But for me, 15 hours from a fully charged case and earbuds is plenty. There’s no noise cancellation...but I want to hear the cars coming. Not a need for me for this device.<br/><br/>The software thing really grates though. They need to add multipoint connectivity for this device via the app, and allow older devices to use the new Bose Music app. Like soon. They also should add some equalizer capability on the app.<br/><br/>Another weird thing. The bluetooth connectivity button is on the case, not the earbuds. Probably a way to make the earbudy ligher or simpler. BUT, as happened to me, if you go out or on a run and the earbuds are not connected to your device, there is no way to connect them without the case. I did the software update which disconnected them, then went on a run and by the time I realized this I was a half mile away and had to go without. Annoying. Im not sure what advantage this confers to the consumer. Maybe that's why the case is larger and doesnt have more battery supply. Who knows? I wish manufacturers would explain why they do things like this.<br/><br/>From a competitive feature standpoint, these earbuds don’t compare well with, say, Jabras, but if you appreciate the sound and comfortable, secure fit, you might end up preferring them anyway, especially as new software updates come out (I hope).</span>

<span>Update (10-29-21)<br/>I have made the decision to keep these and highly recommend to those looking for fit, comfort and sound quality. If you have the sound quality issue I had in the original review you could always return them.<br/><br/>Look, controls and app are kind of primitive, in fact once set up I deleted the app.<br/>However, the Sound can not be beat and this is what its about, sound quality. Now lets take this one step further, remember these are "work out buds" ?<br/>Well, let me say that they are comfortable as heck and the ear pieces that come with them are quite unique so no matter what you do you will always have a good seal and they will stay in your ear!<br/><br/>Long story short, I would highly recommend these to anyone, whether they want sport buds or not.<br/>The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 are the way the controls work (but you will get the hang of them) and the primitive app (which I dont really much care about)<br/><br/>If you want something smaller check out the Jaybird Vista 2, great buds too, just different ways.<br/>I am enjoying the sound of these Bose.<br/><br/>Update (10-25-21)<br/>I have seen some reports on the same issue I have been experiencing, I can not confirm this but its possible the sound quality takes a dive after the firmware update which when you download the app you are forced to do.<br/>Some have reported what I have experienced. (KEEP in mind at first I heard great sound then it went bad so returned them and got another and still have issues, sometimes good sound and other times bad.)  Out of the blue the earbuds sound quality becomes so compressed that some speculate phone compression in the earbud is being activated when listening to music. I have no idea if this is the issue and no experience in this area but it does seem plausible, for some reason the sound becomes warm and flat, void of upper midrange and treble.<br/>Anyway, some people said their solution would be to put the earbuds back in the charging case and then remove right away and replace them back in your ears. They say this fixes it. I dont know if this is true but I have tried it and I do know right now they are working great, the only thing is I cant confirm that placing them back in the case and removing is the reason.<br/>Anyway, what I have now is that "Bose" sound back and very satisfying I removed the app from my phone and using them without the app. I figured I would try them out this way for a while before considering returning them.<br/>I suppose a call to tech support could help, maybe they are aware the firmware update is bad? Possibly be able to replace it with the older working firmware? I dont know, we will see. It was good that I found other comments related to my experience. Who knows? maybe bad luck, but shouldn't happen.<br/><br/>I would recommend someone try them out, you have nothing to lose but if you have sound quality issues then just return them, dont look back and go to another brand, but if they work and keep working I think my long review says it is worth it or I wouldnt be trying so hard.<br/><br/>They are really comfortable and when working right sound great. I can easily overlook the less then robust phone app and touchy/flakey controls on the earbuds themselves.<br/><br/>Or you could just go right to the Jaybird Vista 2 which is another great earbud, that one is a keeper for me but I also like a second set and trying to make these Bose work.<br/><br/>(Original review below)<br/>So disappointed in these Bose Sport Earbuds,<br/>This is my second set after returning the first set directly to Bose thinking the set I got was defective. Well, guess what, this set will be returned to Amazon.<br/>These earbuds could have been great, super comfortable and best of all they fit perfect, even for me who sometimes has issues with earbuds coming loose in my left ear. I could do anything in these buds, working out, working around the house and they stay perfect, as well as super comfortable.<br/><br/>Just the fact that a company like Bose can turn out a product like this makes me loose all respect for the company and I have known their products since the 901 series 2 many decades ago.<br/>I also lost all respect for the so called "review sites" that praise these earbuds with links to sell them to you.<br/>Lets face it, the Bose name, makes people feel safe, well, they won't when people like me can show you products like  Jaybird Vista 2, Beats Power beats Pro, JBL Reflect Mini NC with far superior sound quality and much smoother operation.<br/><br/>Negatives =<br/>1. Sound quality is way to warm, percussion instruments sound like they are in the next building, muffled and distant.<br/>2. Touch controls are primitive, yeah, once you practice a week or two you can get it pretty good. But OMG I must activate SIRI on my iPhone XR a dozen times a day when all I want to do is adjust the volume, which by the way, adjusts in far too apart increments.<br/>3. I don't understand the equalizer, something I would expect from a third rate product, has hardly any effect on the missing midrange and upper midrange/treble.<br/>4. Just a miserable experience from the touch controls to the one size fits all app, to the obnoxious sound quality.<br/>5. Battery life isn't the greatest either.<br/><br/>Positives =<br/>1. Super comfortable and stays in place, pure genius the way these sit in your ear.<br/>2. Nice case<br/>3. Quality feel<br/><br/>Summary,<br/>If you REALLY need a good fitting earbud where other buds give you a problem these will most likely solve that problem. Don't expect much from the app which is ok with me. I just could not get over the over the top "warm" sound quality but maybe its something you make like but avoid at all cost if you like to hear the crips tones of percussion instruments, symbols ect.<br/>Voice comes out ok, front and center, even if warm, don't expect much emotion in the voice.  Everything else sounds like its in the next building.<br/><br/>Call me crazy, don't know what they were thinking or who was in charge of this earbud development because they forgot about sound quality. I think its so bad it will turn me off to the brand. Way overpriced if you are expecting top quality sound.</span>

<span>Got these primarily for music while running/activity. And I am impressed as to how perfectly they fit. I have smallish ears and for whatever reason, only those ear buds with ear hooks (small protruding hooks on earphones) work for a secure fit on my ears. Although I am not an audiophile, I just love the sound quality. The bass by default is not great, but once you fiddle with the bose music app, it just gets so much better.<br/>I have yet to check on battery life, but its been just a couple of hours of music listening and I haven't charged the earphones. They came charged to 70%.<br/>I haven't used them for phone conversation, and would probably won't ever use them as it's not my need as such.<br/><br/>I am hopeful these will last for years to come. Time will tell.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend these earphones to someone who likes good fit and wants to listen to music while workouts/runs etc.</span>

<span>I bought the model sold in 2020 and loved them. They fit into my ears comfortably and went in easily. The left bud stopped working recently and since I loved the last pair I decided to go with Bose again after comparing with AirPods. Sound quality is the same Bose quality but I will say they are difficult to get in initially due to the change of the shape of the speaker piece itself. Pretty bummed about that because while I’m trying to fix it into my ear my fingers touch all the random thing on the bud like Siri and it’s just annoying. I’m gonna keep them because once I get them in they are fine but just something to keep in mind when purchasing.</span>

<span>I wanted to love these, but as an iOS user I find the alternative to be easier to use and better sound quality. These as us aren’t bad - the sound quality is pretty good and the noise cancellation is great. I don’t like that I have to download a separate app though to manage the settings and I find them to be a bit sensitive with the slightest touch/graze. Battery life is fair/decent, I can listen to an audio book for a few hours without interruption.<br/><br/>One benefit I do like is the custom audio settings for different audio types; I.e. Adjusting the bass level for certain genres of music vs. adjusting the clarity for audio books.<br/><br/>Comes in a nice compact case and a couple different ear buds to match comfort/fit.</span>

<span>These Apple EarPods are pretty nice, and moreover they are cheap. I’ve been an Apple user for quite a long time, but for some reason I was never interested in using their EarPods. However, I eventually decided to give them a try, and I don’t regret at all. They are very comfortable to wear, sometimes I even forget that I have them on. In addition, they don’t block any noise, which I like because I like the fact that I am still aware of my surroundings and able to have conversations with people. Last, the sound quality is good despite a lack of bass in my opinion, and that’s the reason why I only gave them four stars.</span>

<span>I want to preface this before I say anything about these headphones: I primarily use headphones for music and podcasts while I am cycling, running, or sitting at my desk at work. I use Spotify for music, and I am not an audiophile. I am not comparing these to a pair of Sennheisers with a lossless audio format as my source. I also am using an iPhone 7+ and iPad Air 2 for my devices in this review.<br/><br/>I have been waiting on a getting a pair of truly wireless headphones because none seemed to be worth it to me. The battery life is usually dismal for obvious reasons, and most had complaints of cutouts between the earbuds. Some friends of mine have Air Pods and they all said they didn’t have cutout issues and battery life was pretty good. But, I just didn’t like the design of the Air Pods and they sounded “hollow” to me. But I get their appeal.<br/><br/>I am so glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro (PBP)! I was using the Jaybird X3 before I got these, and I think the sound is on par with them. One of my main annoyances with the X3’s was that the cord would tug once sweat built up on my neck while exercising, and I couldn’t use the cable shortener they provide because of the way my helmet is. I went for a bike ride yesterday with the PBP’s, and they were fantastic! It was a little windy, so I did get a little wind noise. I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these because I think that would make the noise isolation much better. My ride was around 2 hours and I still had 80% left on the PBP battery.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1. The case: it’s actually smaller than I thought, but would still be uncomfortable in a pocket. I think the 9 hour battery life on the actual headphones make this acceptable, but this may be deal breaker for some.<br/><br/>2. Ear fatigue: I didn’t have any fatigue during my ride, but my ears were definitely a little sensitive where the hook was resting after I took the headphones off. I’m hoping this gets better as I wear them.<br/><br/>3. Like the Air Pods, the PBP’s can only be connected to one device at a time. They will pair to all Apple devices on your iCloud account, but if you want to switch between devices, you have to go into your Bluetooth settings and select them. On Android you will need to pair each device separately.<br/><br/>4. I usually listen to a podcast when I go to sleep. These are not comfortable to lay on if you are side sleeper like I am. Also, the button the headphones will get pushed by the pillow. The button doesn’t require much force, which is great because your not shoving the headphones into your ear. Not a huge deal, but just thought I would mention it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1. Great sound for Truly wireless, I think.<br/><br/>2. Great fit for exercise.<br/><br/>3. Pretty good sound isolation, but like I said, I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these.<br/><br/>4. Actual headphones are smaller than I thought they would be, and they don’t look weird on you when you are just walking down the street.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you use an iOS device and use headphones while exercising, I can’t recommend these enough! In my opinion, the $250 price tag is worth it given where other truly wireless headphones are priced.</span>

<span>Thoroughly impressed with this product. For years I have avoided mainstream electronic brands like Beats, but now I am a believer. These things just work. They way that they're supposed to. 90% of the time, which is good enough for me. I have used wireless earbuds from other brands, like JBL, Sony, LG etc but none lasted very long or if they did, they did not work correctly most of the time. All had issues like connectivity, battery life, being plugged in but not charging for whatever reason.. issues of which do not exist with these buds. I was fed up and went back to wired earbuds for awhile.. until I "upgraded" to smartphone with no audio jack. I got these specifically because they have a loop that goes around the earlobe so it can never fall out. This was important to me since I am a cyclist and bike for long distances at times, so need something that will stay in my ears. The audio is good enough for most people. Not quite audiophile level, but im sure they do not expect that from Beats. Strong bass, crisp mids. Works very well for phone calls and people can usually hear what im saying, and I can hear them.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish I could change is the size of the case, its kind of big and bulky. if it was half the size that would be more ideal, especially for traveling, but honestly cant complain since the case actually charges the buds a number of times (not sure how many), and once they are full the battery can last all day long. Get them !! They are worth the money</span>

<span>I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.<br/>I'd give these a "4 1/2 stars out of five"<br/><br/>On the good side:<br/><br/>1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone.  I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want.  Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional.  But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/>2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.<br/><br/>3)  As for the fit:  these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out).  The fit is perfect.  (See my notes further down for the "comfort")<br/><br/>4) I've rarely had problems pairing.  I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone.  I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.<br/><br/>OK, the "not so good" side:<br/><br/>1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.<br/><br/>2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life).  You "can" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.<br/><br/>3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure.  Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.<br/><br/>Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears "breathe".<br/><br/>Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5.  The three things I mentioned are not "deal breakers" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours.  As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Also, there is no ANC.  Yes, there's "noise reduction" but not cancellation.  I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC.  However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.<br/><br/>So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them.  I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking).  I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.<br/><br/>I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if "the grass is greener" with another set.  I have to be honest, after buying these,  my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.<br/><br/>Most reviews I've read are positive on this product.  Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive.  I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.</span>

<span>I have used these earbuds for 2 years and four months.  Granted I am a mature woman, but I am an almost daily workout fanatic.  Keeping that in mind, I have put these earbuds through a lot of sweaty indoor and outdoor workouts.  I have traveled with them.  The earbuds have sat in my hot car for hours.  My point is that after 28 months of heavy usage, Beats earbuds have retained their high sound quality.  In fact, through jogging sessions, power walking, using the Stairmaster, etc., these earbuds NEVER fall out of my ears. My only complaint is the microphone. In 28 months, these earbuds have been connected to my iPhone X, 11, and 12.  With each phone, my callers often complain that they can’t hear me well.  Despite my one complaint, I still highly recommend these Beats.  Run, don’t walk to your cart.  Go buy them.</span>
