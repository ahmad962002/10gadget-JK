<span>I have been using these for 2 weeks now for work from home service calls and zoom meetings etc. Good sound. Like that volume control and mute can be changed using the button on the cord as opposed to on the actual headset itself. Great product for the price.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The volume control is inline with the headset  and it hangs in such a place that it gets hung up on the edge of my seat's arm rest  or the table edge. I the volume control is a great idea, however, I have unknowingly disabled the audio because I hit the top of the control.<br/>The headset (speakers) are great, sound quality is great, Just need to remove the volume control or place it closer to the end of the cable where it is out of the way.</span>

<span>Got a pair of these for work in... 2014?  and bought a pair for myself.  One of them has finally about given up the ghost, so I wanted to eulogize it.<br/><br/>This headset has been a solid, dependable piece of kit in my tech life.  Reviews of my sound quality during conference calls have always been good.  Crucially, it has its own mute button and a mic that can slide up out of the way.<br/><br/>The playback quality is pretty good.  You won't get amazing bass out of them, but they are a hell of  a lot better than the built in laptop sound, and don't suffer too much bleed to the area in general.<br/><br/>They are padded, but don't confuse that for sound proofing. When I throw these on to focus, I won't realize my coworkers are talking to me, but working at home, my dog's barking pierces these like an arrow.<br/><br/>The plastic of the head band is somewhat supple, which is a blessing and a curse.  You get a little more flexibility out of it, but it will also start to flex in nerve-wracking ways.  Throwing these in a backpack requires a prayer or spell in hopes that they come out in roughly the same shape.<br/>A couple of hours is about all I can stand to wear these in a stretch before starting to get a headache or cauliflower ears. The ear pieces slide down, so there is some level of adjustment, but they will only really want to get so wide.<br/><br/>The cord is incredibly long.  I've had a foot or two of it wrapped up into a little coil with a twist tie and seldom have cause to unfurl it.  The mic mute and volume controls are on a little plastic piece with a clip that you can kinda clip to the upper half of the cable (thinner gauge) so it's a little closer to hand.<br/><br/>Speaking of the volume controls, they are very sensitive, and it's very easy to lean against them and suddenly find your volume at 0% or 100% before you realize what's happening.<br/><br/>The failure of my pair has been a slow process over a few months of mostly light daily use (30-60 minutes of meetings on average).  They would sometimes not be recognized by Windows despite not being unplugged any time recently, but replugging would generally resolve this.  Then one of the earpieces developed a loose connection and would occasionally lose sound until I wiggled the wire a bit.<br/><br/>Will I get another pair?  I think I'll see what else has appeared in the last 8 years since I first started using these.  But I still have my backup pair.<br/><br/>Do I recommend these?  I know many of the points in this review seem rather negative, but consider: this is a device that I have continued to use over the course of 8 years.  That relationship has required some adjustments and sacrifices,  but ultimately has served well.  I ended up recommending them for an old company to use as standard starter kit for new hires, and I continue to think they have a place in the office.</span>

<span>I bought two Logitech headset models for work use (with Microsoft Teams).  The models were Logitech Zone "Wired USB" version ($115.00) which is "MS Teams certified" and Logitech Headset H390 ($29.95).<br/><br/>Maybe I'm crazy but I like / prefer the sound, fit, feel and long term comfort of the lower priced H390 headset.<br/><br/>Both claim to be Noise Cancelling.<br/><br/>PROS of the H390 model:<br/><br/>Has a warm sound but is not lacking treble<br/>Microphone has a gutsy pickup<br/>Delivers music playback surprisingly well!<br/>Noise Cancelling may be superior to the Zone!!  (even with air conditioner 2.5 feet away!)<br/>Good volume oomph!  (i.e strong microphone pickup &amp; output, strong headphone speaker volume).<br/>It has a normal, standard sized, USB "A" plug.  (Thank You!!! Thank You!!!)<br/><br/>---------- Vs. -----------<br/>Logitech "Zone" (wired version)<br/><br/>*  Way more money<br/>*  They ship it with a USB-C type plug (I later found a Logitech provided tiny adapter that converts it to USB-A end plug).  My personal bias:  I don't consider USB-C to a hardy connector.  It's (to me) the unfortunate wave of the future.  Yes I know all of it's feature improvments, I personally just don't like it.  Had I noticed it was USB-C, I would not have ordered it.<br/>*  The Zone plays stereo music back but music sounds better to me on the cheaper (H390) model.<br/>*  The cord on the Zone has this woven outer skin wrap that resembles "cordura" (the nylon backpack woven fabric material)  that has the effect of creating microphonics whenever it inevitably rubs against my shirt (yes I'm using the little clamp provided on the cord - no difference).  In short - physical rubbing (when you move) your shirt or your body against the outer cord material can be heard as a raspiness (like grrr / rrrr)  in the headphones and it's annoying to me.  It sets my teeth on edge.  Some many not notice or be bothered by this, it bugs the hell out of me.<br/><br/>WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE LOGITECH ZONE?<br/>*  Uhh it looks cooler.  It has the visual cool factor.<br/>*  It has more treble, it's clear and refined...YET... I cannot say that, overall, it has the most balanced sound - especially for long hours of wearing.<br/>*  The noise cancelling on the Zone works, I think, but noise cancelling success seems to be more immediately apparent to me when using the H390.<br/><br/>MY VERY BIASED OPINION OF THE "ZONE WIRED" FOLLOWS, OK?  YMMV<br/>If you:<br/>1)  Need headphones with a USB "Type C" male plug as your native, out of the box , connector...<br/>2)  Want to look cool wearing a headphone with more modern styling<br/>3)  Want to unnecessarily part with an additional $90 dollars<br/>4)  Don't value long term comfort.<br/>5)  Don't need the ability to listen to music enjoyably in your off time (due to a fuller range warm and balanced sound)<br/>6)  Can live with the fact that the inline mute switch is not hardy and the flexible surface skin of the switch will quickly deteriorate...<br/>Then nothing is stopping you from ordering the Logitech Zone.<br/><br/>Yes, I know that music playback is not a primary focus of these headsets, that may have been a low blow.  For my ears and body the lower priced Logitech H390 delivers the audio and comfort goods for way less money.<br/><br/>To be fair:  Some people with different head types may do better with the Zone.  My head is medium to larger sized.  My PC is Windows 10, both headsets were discovered immediately once plugged in.<br/><br/>MORAL OF MY STORY:  Spending more money does not necessarily deliver better outcomes.  Sometimes it merely delivers "cachet", bragging rights and complication.<br/><br/>ADDENDUM:  8-28-2020:  I am returning this Logitech Zone headset as the plastic cover for the inline Mute switch is degrading at an accelerated rate after very little use.  I added this issue above to the reveiw.</span>

<span>I love the sound quality and these headphones are comfortable...BUT...as I experienced discomfort only with long hours ( I like to occasionally binge programs) in the bony outer part of my right ear that became sore and was painful. Good thing at the same time, I also purchased EARPHONES just in case of any unforeseen issues. Glad I had them to give my ear a rest. Haven't went back to the Headphones yet since the earphones worked equally as well, Still very much like these Headphones though. I recommend to Buy...for short term use.</span>

<span>These and the other Chinese brand that are exactly the same are pretty good for the price.  I have owned 3 andnthisnis my 4th pair. Like anything else the cable does eventually good bad at the plug end however every set has lasted me over a year. I think the shortest time frame was about a year and a half and that is using them basically every day for hours on end. Sound is not broadcast quality by any means but it's not terrible either.

Sometimes they have to be plugged and unplugged a couple times before the sound works, and sometimes it just doesn't seem to want to work at all (and yes, the volume is up). But overall they work about 95% of the time and they were pretty cheap, so...</span>

<span>I use this in the office, where it is often quite loud, for calls.  The picture showing the mic range of movement shows *exactly* the range it can move.  If you like it lower, find another headset.  I also find it tough to move it out of my peripheral vision when worn &amp; no mic needed, but my hair is fairly thick.  The boom is also stumpy compared to other headsets I have had, but folks on the other end have told me my voice comes through loud &amp; clear.  On the ear covers, the foam covered bit is on a swivel-like thing to give it the flexibility to fit one's head.  The compression to keep it in place is sufficient w/o being too tight.<br/><br/>I am annoyed that I failed to notice prior to purchase the lack of in-line volume and mute controls so I must use the mute in the application and keyboard-based volume controls.  I will NOT be buying this one again.</span>

<span>This headset is great for sensitive outer ears, but its mic picks up everything in the room. You will torture anyone you're talking to if you eat or have a fan pointing at you while wearing it.

<span>This is a decent gaming headset with decent sound and great mic quality. These qualities do not compensate it’s problems though.<br/><br/>Left and right audio<br/>If you rely on sound for both sides, I can’t recommend this. This headset will randomly cut out sound on one side until you unplug it and plug it back in. Sometimes the audio quality will also decrease for no reason.<br/><br/>Mic<br/>For the mic, the quality is great, but there’s an audible buzzing sound that you can hear in your headset along with other people being able to hear it. I found no solution to making it go away, even decreasing the volume boost and the normal volume. OBS also detects this buzzing and can cause a disturbance. Though the flip to mute feature on the mic is a cool addition and works really well.<br/><br/>Volume<br/>The headset isn’t very loud. Even with maxed out windows and headset volume, it was hard to hear voice chat in some games. So if you rely on high volume to play, this isn’t the headset for you</span>

<span>I will just make a simple Pro/Con list.<br/>But first, a notice. The noise cancelling of this set is too damn good lol. Not sure if that is bad or good for anybody, so I figured I would get it out here. NO, they are not a replacement for a full-blown "Noise Cancelling Headset" that you might use if you have sensitive ears or meditate or whatever. But it is good enough that I can only BARELY hear anything around me. Kinda weird at first.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Microphone quality is perfect for the price-point. Nice and crisp, and I do not have to speak too loudly to be heard, BUT it does NOT...I repeat, it DOES NOT, pick up audio from the background (by that I mean somebody would have to be basically shouting next to you to be heard)<br/><br/>- Padding on the headband is peachy. I barely notice it is there because it is so soft.<br/>- Not a very heavy headset. It feels sturdy and dependable, but is also oddly flexable.<br/>- Ear cuffs are strange. Very soft, and I don't sweat with them on.<br/><br/>- The volume dial is on the right ear cuff, on the outside as a very smooth dial. Trust me when I say this, the volume is SUPER LOUD. I have the dial turned all the way down, and it is the perfect volume to listen to my music while I play a game, or for when I want to watch a movie.<br/>- It comes with an adapter, so you can use this headset with a device that only has the basic 3.5 MM audio jack, like your smart phone devices, or tablet...<br/><br/>As another neutral note, the audio gets ridiculously loud if you turn the dial up all the way, so always make sure to turn the dial all the way down before you play anything through this headset. Accidently bumped the dial when I went to bed, and the next time I put them on it scared the crap out of me and kinda hurt the ears, so be warned.<br/><br/>---Cons:<br/>-The audio quality is absolutely horrible if you turn the volume up even a bit. I hardly ever have to turn my volume up with this headset, but when I do the audio starts making the speakers  start that "spitting" noise, no matter what I am listening to, and no matter the device. In my head, an 80 dollar headset should NEVER do that. On a personal level, I never need to turn the audio up to that point, so for ME, it is a non-problem but I figured it might be a problem for other people. BUT, if you keep the volume at an acceptable level (aka human hearing levels, HA) the audio quality is very nice. Not too "bassy" and not too high pitched.<br/><br/>- The microphone sticks out a bit in the "upward/off" position, scared me more than once while going to put my hands behind my head to stretch, or even to pull my hair back a bit (I have pretty long hair)<br/><br/>- Speaking of long hair...might just be me with me with my "Shirley Temple Curls" lol, but this headset always seems to pull out one or two hairs along the part where the headband connects with the ear cuffs. That is just a risk with allheadsets though, so I just mention it. Nothing to do with the rating.<br/><br/>-- Bit of a personal negative...no braided fiber cover for the cord. Just standard rubber or whatever, and it feels like it is going to peel away faster than it should. That is just me. Though as before, for 80 dollars, I feel it should have a braided fiber cord.<br/><br/>-And finally, the biggest turn-off...there is nothing to download. The headset just simply...is. There is no audio tuning tool, or equalizer, or drivers of any kind. So I suppose it is a BIT positive, because it is just plug-and-play, but AGAIN, FOR 80 DOLLARS...is an equalizer too much to ask?<br/><br/>So all together, I feel this is a good product. If you want a good microphone, and a comfortable wear...buy this.<br/>However, I will never be buying this particular headset. For what you get, 80 dollars is too much to ask.<br/>Sennheiser makes great products, but this price-point to quality ratio is not adding up.<br/><br/>I have bought 50 dollar headsets, that lasted me 4 years...that one had a very quality soundcard built in that allowed you to change the volume, and adjust the 7.1 audio, change the balance from side to side and back to front, let you hook up a blu tooth set to it, and had ports on the sound card that let you actually hook up a real sound system to it. AND it had an audio suite (eq, voice changer, mic audio range choices, audio quality changes...literally anything you could possibly need). Roccat Kave XTD is the headset, if you were curious. Best headset ever. Just wanted to try something new here.</span>

<span>I've been using these headsets for years, they are very good. As with any headset you have to be careful of bending the wire at the base. I usually start losing sound in one ear in 6-12 months so then I just order a new one. I figure any headset would have this problem so I keep ordering the same one. I use it on the go often enough that it is probably just reasonable wear and tear.</span>

<span>First, a complaint about Amazon's shopping process. This isn't the first time this has happened, but it's been a while. I had decided to buy the Logitech H110 headset because it had separate headphone and microphone plugs, which would work with my desktop computer's front audio ports. I had the H110 on the screen and I clicked the "Add to cart" button. It was only after my order had shipped and I got the confirmation email that I realized Amazon was sending me the H111, which has a single TRRS plug instead of two TRS plugs. Instead of sending it back, I decided to order an adapter that would split the single plug into the two appropriate plugs, since it would avoid the hassle of a return, and I would be able to use the H111 with my cellphone as a full duplex headset. This solution worked fine for my purposes (chatting while playing Rust and other multiplayer games), but I was not happy that I had to spend an extra $7, nearly the cost of the headset, to be able to use it.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the actual product review. First the good: I've had reports that my voice sounds excellent in game, and my own testing with recording software has been very positive. The microphone is great at picking up my voice and attenuating surrounding noise, and has adequate pop filtering via the foam guard. The bad: The headphones sound terrible. There's simply no way you're going to enjoy the sound coming out of these earpieces. It seems like Logitech never thought someone might enjoy music or any kind of lifelike background sounds. This would be fine if they were tuned for voice reproduction, but even voices sound like the person is shouting into a tin can from across the room. Bass? What bass? With this headset, enemy footsteps are indistinguishable from innocuous nature sounds in Rust, which can get you killed pretty quickly.<br/><br/>The headset is fairly comfortable to wear, though after about an hour it can start to press on the earlobes a bit. Some shifting around every now and then helps with that. They are lightweight and the cord is more than long enough.<br/><br/>Overall, unless you just need a casual gaming headset with a TRRS plug for modern laptops or phones, you should avoid this set and spend a few dollars more on something that will be more comfortable and sound better.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought these since it seems every currently offered pair of headsets are noise canceling and I'm tired of my gaming friends telling me someone is at my front door because I cannot hear the doorbell.  When connect this to my PS4 controller I sometimes have to disconnect and reconnect because I sound scratchy to everyone.  Not too often though so not a big deal to me and seems to happen on some games more than others.  When connected to my laptop for google hangouts it works great.  The mic is a bit directional so you can place it in such a way as to avoid outside noise (such as if I have a fan on my right side, I place the mic on that side of my head and so it's facing away from the fan and it lessens the noise from the fan to everyone).<br/>Has a little bit of a flimsy construction, but you should expect that for the price.</span>

<span>I bought them to replace my H110's that had broken because the wire coming out of the left earphone had gotten wonky and I could only hear on one side.  So to hopefully avoid that I carefully taped my new H111's so that the wire near the ear wouldn't be able to move around.  So after using these for a few months, lo and behold my new pair of H111's are now broken because the wire near the connector had gotten wonky now instead.<br/><br/>As far as performance when they aren't broken, I would say for the price pretty decent.  The stereo sound isn't bad at all, and the mic isn't bad either.  I do Let's Plays with them because I'm too cheap to buy anything nicer, and sure the sound quality you produce isn't going to make you jump for joy.  But it's really not all that bad, especially when put back to back against microphones in a comparable price range.  Honestly, for this price these are probably the best headset you can get.  But like I said...just wish they didn't keep breaking.  I hate that I'm on my third pair in a little over a year.<br/><br/>But the ultimate main reason I stay with this brand is because they're the only cheap headset I can ever find that go over the top of my ear instead of around my ear.  It makes a HUGE different to me, because stuffing my ears into little holes in new style headphones makes them ache after about 20 minutes.  But these I can wear literally all day, every day with no problems.</span>

<span>I was leery of these at first because I'm very picky about how a headset sounds and how it fits on my smallish head.  I don't usually even like anything over my head. I use these to watch TV without disturbing others' sleep. The sound is really great - crisper than what I hear coming directly out of the TV itself.  Now I use them even when I'm not trying to be quiet, because I hear better with these than watching TV from elsewhere in the room.  Super easy to set up, and they look nicer than some big clunky black ones.  It's over the head, so not my favorite, but they're lightweight and not bothersome.</span>

<span>The mic noise cancelation is amazing and after using asus armor create (asus aura) it perfected the mic even more, they are comfortable headphones but because they only surround the ear and dont go alittle farther out they can hurt your ears after awhile, the volume control and mute function is very strange, it looks like a dial but its not its like a switch and a button. Button mutes the mic<br/>The sound quality is not what money can buy OUT OF THE BOX. After using asus armor box (asus aura) the sound quality is levels above what it was out of the box. One thing i dint like about the packageing is alot of reviews on youtube about this headset they dont have the wind noise filter, that is included inside the package but they seem to all miss it inside the packaging, its taped to the side of the black box and very very hard to see a very bad place to put that the internal microphone according to my friends on ps4 sounds better then the external mic, you cant plug this headset in the ps4 directly (well you can) if you do they will reconnect and disconnect over and over again because of interference i used a powered usb port<br/>It fixed that problem as far as i know anyhow. Idk if my external hdd had something to do with it or not. But all the reviews on the headset that says the sound quality is bad must not of messed with it in asus aura, thats what makes me love the headsets and i believe it saves the settings done on asus aura to the headset or the 2.4 chip so it applies those settings on your phone or ps4 or anything these are truely amazing, only negative is that the cups arnt bigger and they ant 50mm speakers but the standard 40mm</span>

It will disconnect and reconnect a few seconds later.  As a result I will not be buying another one of these.<br/><br/>This is disappointing because the headphone is otherwise well-made.

<span>I wanted to like this because I am a fan of Asus in general. For the price, it isn't worth it. Yes, the headset is comfortable. Yes, it has good range. Heck, I even like the USB-C connector.What I cannot get past, however, is the audio quality. Out of the box, the headset is set to do some major noise canceling to the point it distorts my voice to anyone listening so badly they had choice words to say about the setup. Even so, it did not filter out noise that I was told sounded like some sort of windstorm going directly into the mic. When the software from Asus was downloaded to attempt to fix the EQ settings, profiles only stuck until the computer rebooted. Then defaults came back with a vengeance. The mic in the one ear cup is so poor it sounds like I am on the telephone at that, so using it alone is not an option. For 200 bucks and some change, I expect more from a headset... Better bass, crisper music, software that works, or better yet, a button on the headset itself to turn off noise canceling if it is going to be so severe that one's voice sounds like it's coming from a crappy laptop mic. Pretty sure the bulk of the price was for the casing because surely it wasn't for the audio Asus built into this thing.</span>

<span>I bought these not expecting much out of them, but boy was I wrong!!! These have the best sound quality out of any headset I’ve ever gotten. I have an Astro A10 head set and these surpass it!! I can tell which direction an enemy is coming up on me from so much easier in Fortnite, now!!! And the mic doesn’t pick up any background noise at all!! It’s the best headset I’ve come across so far, and I’ve gone through a lot of trial and error and returns to find the perfect pair for myself!! I can officially stop looking :D buy these, you won’t regret it!! Plus they’re super comfy and feel nice around my head!!</span>

<span>So far so good!<br/> Comfortable on my ears, I can adjust the fit on my head. The sound that comes through is really clear and it does block a lot of background noise as well. Very nice so far for the price</span>
