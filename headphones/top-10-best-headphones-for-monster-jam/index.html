<span>Bought a pair for my 4 year old and 6 year old for Monster Jam. Worked great and fit both of their heads. Very durable! My kids ran around the house with these days before we needed them and they held up great. I put them on my head to compare them to the noise blocking of my gun range earmuffs and they seemed to block the same amount of noise.</span>

<li><span class="a-list-item"> Hi-Res Audio: Custom oversized 40 mm dynamic drivers produce Hi-Res sound. Life Q20 active noise canceling headphones reproduce music with extended high frequencies that reach up to 40 kHz for extraordinary clarity and detail.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> Reduce Ambient Noises By Up to 90%: Our team of engineers conducted more than 100,000 tests in real-life scenarios to fine-tune Life Q20’s 4 built-in ANC microphones and digital active noise cancellation algorithm. As a result, the hybrid active noise cancellation can detect and cancel out a wider range of low and mid-frequency noises such as cars and airplane engines.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 100% Stronger Bass: Our exclusive BassUp technology conducts real-time analysis of the low frequencies to instantly strengthen the bass output. Double press the play button when listening to bass-heavy genres like EDM and hip-hop for an amplified listening experience.  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> 40-Hour Playtime*: Up to 40 hours of non-stop playtime in wireless active noise cancellation mode (at 60% volume) is extended to an enormous 60 hours in standard music mode. A single charge gives you enough juice to listen to over 600 songs or soundtrack multiple long haul flights. And when you’re in a rush, charge Life Q20 active noise canceling headphones for 5 minutes and get 4 hours of listening.  </span></li>

<span>I’ve had these for several weeks and I’m using them extensively today &amp; wanted to leave a review. I bought these for the noise cancellation feature. I do not tolerate ear buds in my ears &amp;  I wasn’t looking for a headset to play music to cover up unwanted noise, I wanted a set to simply block irritating sounds. These have been extremely useful for that with nothing but the noise cancellation feature on. It seems to do very well canceling noises that are just loud enough to set me on edge, but not actual loud noises. Today I was able to use the noise canceling feature alone to block some machine humming and some hammering from the construction site in my neighborhood. I like using this feature alone when I’m working so that I can continue to hear the alerts (albeit muffled) from my computer while still blocking out the excessive noise outside. When I need additional noise filtering, I will add some white noise from my favorite app which completely blocks out any noise that I’ve come across including crying babies, lawn mowers, and loudly arguing neighbors. I also enjoy listening to my podcasts with these &amp; find the sound quality decent, especially for the price. I do find it difficult, but not impossible to sleep with these on. Battery life is great, I’ve charged it just once since getting them. I also like the announcement through the device when you turn it on with the battery level.</span>

<span>Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.<br/><br/>If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.<br/><br/>The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.<br/><br/>Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want "world around dissapears" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointing<br/><br/>Edit #1:<br/>The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:<br/><br/>«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»<br/>Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says "Noice Cancelling", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent)  sure noice cancelling was active.<br/><br/>«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»<br/>Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.<br/><br/>Edit #2:<br/><br/>I was "finally" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and "- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.".<br/><br/>For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song "A a a a a a a a a Very good song" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.<br/><br/>I tested in various scenarios:<br/>1.) In my car, windows down.<br/>2.) In my car windows up.<br/>3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).<br/>4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).<br/>5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.<br/>6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).<br/>7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.<br/><br/>My results:<br/>1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.<br/>2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.<br/>3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.<br/>4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.<br/>5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.<br/>6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.<br/>7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.<br/><br/>But, in scenarios 5, 6 &amp; 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).<br/><br/>Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing  more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.<br/><br/>Edit #3 (and Final):<br/><br/>Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.<br/><br/>That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.</span>

<span>Wow.  I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.<br/><br/>I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous.  I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.<br/><br/>Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers.  The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive.  The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great.  My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.<br/><br/>After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year.  I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?!  Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.<br/><br/>Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.<br/><br/>I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable.  I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great.  MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!<br/><br/>Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy.  After that, I put on my go-to sound check song ("Sacrilege," by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.<br/><br/>I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care.  The "silent note" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately.  The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.<br/><br/>The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.<br/><br/>So I tested the ANR.  I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again.  The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys.  I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys).  THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.<br/><br/>With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys.  Period.  It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.<br/><br/>In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere.  I mean it.  They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR.  They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8" jack.<br/><br/>Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies.  I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application.  If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away.  If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.<br/><br/>That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.<br/><br/>There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.<br/><br/>1.  The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears.  Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight.  It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in.  If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.<br/><br/>2.  The battery life isn't that great.  To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them.  However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without.  My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48.  Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.<br/><br/>3.  They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs.  This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have.  Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).<br/><br/>Hope that helps you make a decision.  I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.</span>

<span>I've owned three of this model of headset now. They all die from the same exact design flaw. I'm not willing to buy another but if you learn from my mistakes you'll probably enjoy good performance for a long time.<br/>Don't wear them around your neck. That's pretty much it. As you can see from the photo, the plastic framing holding the joint just above the earpiece isn't designed to handle much stress. A lot of the time I leave my headset on the desk when not in use, and that provided a long enough lifespan for me to tell you the good parts:<br/>Call quality is great, I never have any complaints. The noise cancellation (for the wearer) is about a third as good as more expensive headsets or earbuds I've tested, which makes sense as they're about a third the price.<br/>Battery life is pretty good. I can get through a six hour conference call marathon, but it'll leave me using laptop speakers and mic by the end of the day because you can't charge during use.<br/>Comfort is better than par. Anything under 4 hours at a stretch has been no problem for me. I'm relieved to take them off after five or more hours of calls.<br/>Unfortunately I forgot, after maybe nine or ten months, what not to do with this pair. I was up from my desk, getting a coffee, and wore my headphones out of the room in case there was a question that needed my response on the call (there wasn't). When the call ended I lowered the headphones to my neck rather than place them on the kitchen counter.<br/>After grabbing my coffee, heading back to the office I gripped the headphones in one hand, grabbing the center of the headband, and pulled back to take them off my neck. This wasn't a forceful motion at all. I felt only mild pressure from the headphones against my neck, no real discomfort, but sliding them off my neck in this manner was enough to end them.<br/><br/>Like I said, this makes 3 for 3 of this model that died in the same way. The first was a similar story. I grabbed by one ear piece and tried to sort of curve it around the neck to take it off, breaking that same joint. Pair number two lasted the longest. I remembered every time to grab with both hands on the earpiece, every time I took it off my neck, but a few dozen repetitions was too much for that joint by the earpiece. They cracked and broke in the same place, pretty much the same way as you see here. This now makes a third pair of Soundcore Q20 that broke in the same manner through normal use.<br/><br/>If you're confident you'll never wear these on your neck, and you'll only ever gingerly move them on and off your head with both hands holding both earpieces, they're honestly a great performing headset for work calls, good for an audiobook while mowing the lawn or blowing leaves, and not bad for music.<br/><br/>Just don't buy these if you like to hold your headphones on your shoulders, draped around your neck, like many of us do. They can't handle the strain.</span>

<span>Update: there's this weird noise that it's making. I want to say like white noise in the background that just buzzes whether there's music playing or nothing at all when it's turned on. I don't remember my other pair of headphones doing this...<br/><br/>Overall short to the point review, they are good but a bit fragile so do take note of that.<br/><br/>In long, knowing they break is why I bought another one on Amazon rather than going to Best Buy where I got my first pair. They are pretty neat. You can extend the ends to make it a bit looser around your ears. It comes with it's own charger and aux cord should the battery run out and can switch to that. It was easy to connect to my computer with Bluetooth and I had no issue there. It even turns off by itself when not in use for some minutes to not run the battery down.<br/>One tip I would like to give that I figured out with both headsets is that the switch for the noise canceling drains your battery even if you turn off the headphones. If you leave the switch on it will drain out your battery to the point where you'll have to charge them.<br/>That's just my take on it.</span>

<span>Sound quality is amazing. Better than my generation 1 beats studio headphones.  I just wish there were slightly better padding around the ears. After wearing them for 30 minutes or more(at gym), my ears can feel a little irritated and uncomfortable at times.  The tight fit is good for the gym because they don’t budge when I’m working out, they remain tight. If they had a little more cushion for the ears they would be 5 star quality at a great price. I’d give them 4.5 stars if I could.</span>

<span>The noise cancellation is exceptional on these headphones. With 10 levels I can block out most of what is going on around me, when it is safe to do so. If you are someone that startles easily, like myself, you will probably get scared a lot because you will not hear what or who is walking up behind you. My husband finds this very humorous.<br/>The sound quality was every bit of what I expected from Bose. Crisp, rich audio, with an amazing range of clarity, from your treble to mid tones and excellent bass. It’s easy to slip into your own little oasis with these on.<br/>They are also quite comfortable, their padded band and ear cups are soft and do not apple much pressure against your head. They are very light weight and I can wear them for hours without issue.<br/>The included case is well made, sturdy and not overly bulky allowing my to pack it and take it with me anywhere. It has a storage compartment for your cables so you always know where they are.<br/>The battery life is excellent! I can go days without charging, but if I do need to charge, they replenish quite quickly and I am right back in business. I have easily gotten a full 20 hour charge out of these. I like that when you turn them on they immediately tell you how many hours they have left on their current charge and what devices they are connected to. This makes it easy to check how long you can use them on their current charge, before you head out somewhere where you might not have access to a plug. I found the time they tell me I have left on my charge to be quite accurate. I am able to connect to more than one device (like my iPhone and iPad) and they intuitively play the sound from the device I am using at the moment. I love that feature it’s easy to switch from watching something on my iPad to listening to music from my phone. Bose also includes a cable so you can plug directly to your device and go wired. I have not used this feature because the battery life is so long, I have not run into a situation where it was necessary.<br/>The buttons and touch features of these headphones are wonderful. I can turn Alexa (Siri or Google) on or off depending on my needs. I can control the volume sliding my finger up or down on the surface of one ear and can tap to pause and swipe to change songs. With one button I can rotate between 3 levels of noise cancellation that I can set within my app.  I have not had the chance to utilize some of the AR on these yet but cannot wait to try it on our next vacation, it will be like bringing along our own tour guide.<br/>I love that Alexa is built in. I’m an artist and when I’m painting in my studio it is very nice to be able to use Alexa to change my music without needing to touch my device or my headphones.<br/>I saved and waited to get these after trying them and comparing to the Sony competitive model and I am so glad I did. I found the bass of the Sony WH1000 series to be a little scratchy sounding and the overall sound just wasn’t as crisp as the Bose 700 series. I had a pair of Cowin E-7s and those, while they were great at their price point and did the job while I was saving up for these, they just weren’t even in the same class as the Bose 700. These, in my opinion (and I spent a lot of time putting headphones on and off, listening to how everything sounded on each), set the bar and everything else is just trying to measure up. Only the Sony WH1000 series could come close, but for me their sound quality still fell short. The only way to describe it was, you knew you were listening to a recording, whereas the sound from the Bose 700, you could close your eyes and it sounded like you were listening to it actually being played by the artist live the sound is just that crisp and clear no echo or scratch it’s clear vibrant and rich, everything I expected from Bose.<br/>I am very happy with my purchase, they were worth the wait and I would certainly recommend them to everyone!<br/>One Note I have very sensitive sinuses and when I put on noise canceling headphones, I can actually feel a pressure in my ears and sinus cavities, this does happen with the Bose as well (it happens with every brand I have tried if the cancellation is of any really quality). That said it does not deter me, nor do I feel it’s would be a reason I wouldn’t recommend them or give them a lower star rating. I can feel it when I activate the noise cancellation at its max level but everyone else I have asked to try them, can’t. So chances are very likely this will not be something that the average person even realizes. I can still use the noise cancellation and can block out enough that I never hear my husband walk into my studio until he taps me on the shoulder and scared the heck out of me. I only include this info in case there are others out there that also experience this, with the Bose 700 you can control the levels and it’s easy to step your way up through 10 levels of cancellation and find one that blocks the noise out, while still being comfortable to your sinuses. That is why I would recommend to everyone! Other headphones are cancellation on or off and if you are sensitive to it that can render the feature useless. Again not the case with the Bose 700 series. I use this feature all the time, have found the level that is perfect for me and the noise cancellation is amazing. It is so nice to finally be able to use this feature.<br/>I will also add that unlike other headphones the noise cancellation does not affect the quality of the sound I am listening to either! I have tried many where the sound completely changes the moment you turn it on, not with these. The sound remains crisp and rich and clear as it did without the noise cancellation. The only difference is the world around you gets quieter and the music sounds amazing! If you read this whole review Thank You if you are considering these headphones and trying to compare, in my opinion there is no comparison and I don’t think you will be disappointed choosing the Bose 700 series. I hope this info helped.</span>

<span>Can a Bluetooth (BT) headphone that sells for less than $80 beat an expensive Bose BT headphone? Let's find out!<br/><br/>HOW I DISCOVERED<br/>I was ironically turned onto the Bose 700 (proper model name is NC 700) by "Oluv's Gadgets" video channel, where he ripped the Bose to shreds! (Search for video "Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700-the worst?") And rightfully so, it turns out. Except at the end, where he did an impressive Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) test of multiple headphones along a busy road. (BTW: I and many owe Oluv a donation: he refuses all sponsorships, and Amazon inexplicably de-affiliated him! Check out his videos.) In his video, the NC 700 seemed near-silent compared to the others, which piqued my interest. I'd previously bought the Ankbit (a sub-brand of 1Mii) E600Pro, and was almost over the moon with it, and wondered how much better the Bose could be, at multiples of that price. Not much, it turns out. So this is a comparison, as much as a review.<br/><br/>CODECS<br/>Bose NC 700 HAS NO APTX!! I was shocked: even the Ankbit has AptX! (Update: it does have the proprietary Apple AAC codec, so there's that.) Not as much a problem, it turns out. SBC should be auditorily indistinguishable at strong signals, and is much more stable when dealing with weak signals. Technically, the lack of AptX should be a con, but strangely for me it became a plus, per real-life experience with AptX stability, and study of Bluetooth codecs. The Ankbit can connect on SBC like all BT speakers, but you can't override the auto-negotiation. In real life, codecs are a preference which, for most people, will be based on misunderstanding, so focus on compatibility and stability.<br/><br/>WIRED CAPABILITY<br/>The Bose NC 700 has a tiny, NON-standard 2.5mm wired headphone jack, NOT the standard 3.5mm (1/8-inch) jack!! The unkindest cut: Bose cheaped out, and this EXPENSIVE headset doesn't even include an adapter!<br/>The Ankbits don't even need an adapter, but they were STILL nice to include a fancy wired, TRRS smartphone-compatible headphone cable WITH AN INLINE VOLUME CONTROL WIRED REMOTE! Don't worry, it gets worse!<br/><br/>SOUND<br/>The NC 700 ranges from just "good, but NOT great" in BT (tuned/factory EQ'd) mode, to "bad" in Wired/ANC Off mode, to "downright awful" in Wired/ANC On mode! Yeah, you can install a famously INTRUSIVE Bose app into your inner sanctum and try to make it sound better in Bluetooth mode than Bose themselves could, with your own custom EQ. But the Ankbit sounds unbelievable right out of the box in BT mode, and still sounds pretty good in both wired (ANC On AND Off) modes. Surprisingly, the Ankbits had actually MORE bass in wired (no factory tuning) mode, which is slightly boomy: the Ankbit's BT tuning actually flattens the bass, reserving a bass bump for the lowest registers, making it have incredible bass for music, while amazingly also not interfering with spoken word.<br/> Sidenote: something I've not seen anyone discuss, even "Oluv's Gadgets" is the COMPRESSION EFFECT (lack of dynamic range), which is in addition to the Bose's poor frequency response. The Ankbit is fully dynamic-sounding. The Bose's true auditory flaws: the dearth of bass, combined with a lack of dynamic range, strangely make them excel at lengthy speech. If you listen primarily to talk, or just loathe bass for some reason, or you think I'm an idiot and that you can hear better than me, the Bose should do well for you. I still prefer the Ankbit overall, including for speech, partly due to their comfort.<br/> I'll give you a perfect analogy: the Bose 700 sounds like 'a decent $40 BT headphone'. I have one, I know. It's amazing what 40 bucks will buy now, but it's not the same as the Ankbit E600Pro at a higher price (you can also get promotions via 1Mii's newsletter). Which makes it even more baffling, that at [many times] the price of a median headset for the Bose, you get sound on-par with a median headset. (And far worse in wired modes.) In BT (tuned/EQ'd) mode, while not an enormous difference side by side, it's enough of a difference—for me—to actually "enjoy" the music, vs not enjoy it ("meh"). But I am finicky with audio. So, I wouldn't rely on the Bose if I could only have one headset. And noise cancellation had better be VERY high on your priority list. Also, there are many complaints of Bose users trying to use this headset for PC work, especially Microsoft Teams. Bose even sells an overpriced USB dongle to try to address the issue. Another Bose fail.<br/> UPDATE: there are "Bose NC 700 HP teardown" videos, where you can see how ridiculously tiny the drivers (speakers) are in relation to earcup size. Furthermore, Bose muffles the drivers by mostly covering them with what looks like a layer of thick aluminum foil, possibly to protect what may be an ANC mic suspended over the center of each driver. The small drivers themselves seem like afterthoughts, and further explain the low weight.<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELLATION<br/>The Bose's drivers are curved toward the ear canal by plastic 'ramps' or inserts. This apparently necessitates a small driver, hence reduced bass, and lower sound quality generally. I believe this is a tradeoff to achieve better ANC, which is where this product shines, NOT for music quality. As expected, the Bose is the clear winner in ANC over the Ankbit, altho the Ankbit does quite well. The Bose adds to this by apparently being one of the few who provide ANC to your audience in phone/headset mode (I haven't verified this). My female partner (who I've determined has low-frequency hearing loss) can't understand me with ANC on. Whereas I can understand everyone just fine, as long as I pause whatever's playing. So 'voice cancellation' depends on your hearing ability. And ANC will block deep voices better.<br/> Bose provides 3 levels of ANC from the headphones, but my partner and I only ever use On and "Off" ("transparent mode"), so the Medium just gets in the way. We both prefer Ankbit's physical slider switch, easier and simpler on/off for ANC (which still works when BT is off, BTW).<br/> With the NC 700, ANC IS NEVER OFF!! Level "0" is "Transparency Mode", which actually AMPLIFIES ambient sound!! That's fine, but let me fully turn the ANC mics off, if I want to! That also affects battery life. I think you might be able to fully disable ANC in the app, but then AFAIK you're stuck with no ANC at all, so the solution is worse than the problem.<br/><br/>CHARGING<br/>The Bose 700's can't charge while listening, did you know that?<br/>Yeah, they completely shut off when you plug in.<br/>The Ankbits happily charge while listening.<br/>Both charge via USB-C.<br/>The Ankbit included a charging cable (USB A to C, which is perfect for users with older tech who might not have a USB-C cable). The Bose included NOTHING. Except a fake 'quick start guide', which only insisted (in about 29 languages) that you install their app immediately!<br/><br/>SELF-NOISE<br/>Hiss or white noise from the ANC and BT circuitry is endemic in BT headphones. And BT headphones and speakers will quickly mute their output when you pause media, so it's difficult to study their true self-noise when transmitting sound. Self-noise (both in ANC/Standby, and while playing) is low on the Ankbit, but even lower on the Bose—but still detectable in a quiet environment. I'd say the Bose has quieter circuitry overall, including while playing. However, with the Ankbit you can truly disable ANC, which means 'no' noise when in Standby (nothing playing). If you're in a truly quiet environment and not playing anything, you won't need ANC, but it's still on with the Bose, so the hiss is there too, right when you could actually be bothered by it.<br/>If there is background noise, you probably won't be able to notice any hiss on either.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/>I feel like the Bose rated hours is overly-optimistic. It doesn't take long to go from 100% to 70% state of charge (SOC). The headset feels light, and sacrificing battery size had to be part of that. The other culprit is that ANC is never truly off, in any powered-on mode. Everyone knows ANC saps battery. Even if it's just sitting on your chest, ANC is active, and the battery's draining. The Ankbit will go for literally days with ANC off. Bose loses again.<br/> UPDATE: from the teardown videos, the NC 700 battery is 630 mAH (small). Ankbit claims an 1100 mAH capacity for the E600Pro, almost double, while probably also using less electricity, so that explains that.<br/><br/>COMFORT<br/>The Ankbit E600 Pro is definitely the clear upset winner, despite being slightly heavier. Bigger, wider cups FTW—and they fold, UNLIKE the Bose. The Achilles heel of the E600Pro is Ankbit/1Mii made the headband too long (the only fix is to wrap something around the headband). The NC 700 simply fits small (female-medium and smaller) heads better. The Bose cups touch my ears; Ankbit's don't. Bose earcups are tighter, and disappointingly vinyl-covered, not fabric. The 700's are not uncomfortable, but the E600Pro is one of the most comortable headphones I've ever worn. Ankbit wins again.<br/> I will say that I suspect the Bose design feels more sturdy. Neither are 'creaky', but the Ankbit feels more plasticky and fragile, and I've seen photos of broken Ankbit arms, but not Bose 700's (other Bose, yes). It doesn't seem common at this point, but Ankbit shouldn't use thin structural plastic. And I've had the plastic arm on a cheaper, gently-used BT headset break recently, so now I'm worried. The Bose 700 uses plastic for structure, but seems stronger.<br/> I've tried 2 wraps to lower the Ankbit's headband height for my partner, the simplest being an ACE bandage. Both worked for her, though we shouldn't need to do that. Even without the wrap, the large cups provided a bit of extra travel on her head, so it still fit, despite being too low.<br/><br/>ANC<br/>Bose wins: this is really what you're paying the high price for. But NEITHER are substitutes for real hearing protection (I've experimented). ANC can be helpful for less-serious noise like a vacuum cleaner or blender, but NOT as range earmuffs, etc. On that note, the Bose would give me weird, somewhat-painful pops from the speaker in the ear closer to a significant noise, such as blenders. So it really wasn't even useful for that. The Ankbit's noise cancellation wasn't good enough to run a blender AND hear my program, unless I turned it up to unhealthy levels, though it was helpful if Paused. Earmuffs were just better. Where ANC shines is background noise, such as air conditioners and traffic. Bose is the pioneer in ANC, back to the 1980s, but you'll pay for it. The noise cancellation reaches into higher frequencies than its competitors, due to more mics, better processing, and probably that weird 'ramp' inside the earcups (which ensuing small drivers I think are the culprit for the crap audio quality).<br/><br/>VOICE PROMPTS<br/>The NC 700 is overly-active with voice prompting, with a full TTS engine that sounds suspiciously like Microsoft's "Zira" voice, but some will like that. At least the Bose briefly pauses your media whenever it does one of its many prompts. But the auto-pausing can cause problems, or just not work at all with certain applications (in whole, it's a plus). The Ankbit features the famously-bad Chinese computer lady saying "ANC on", but thankfully that's the only voice prompt, the rest are beeps. The audio prompts of both the Bose and Ankbit are both too loud (hurts my ears, which is ironic for devices that are supposed to block noise). The best thing is that the Bose can actually verbally tell you the SOC (and WILL tell you, when you turn it on—even if you don't want it to), whereas the Ankbit won't bug you about battery level until it's already unhealthily low, so you have to be more proactive.<br/><br/>APP<br/>I encourage all users to NOT use "apps", unless they're genuinely necessary or important to you. Even then, for security I'd encourage you to install those apps on a "low security" device. I think it's crazy for people to do online banking on mobile devices, but it's somehow common. Let's put it this way: any device you'd do banking on, you shouldn't install apps randomly, especially on Android.<br/> There is no difference between "security" and "privacy". Bluetooth headphone apps are notorious for stabbing you in the back. Bose was not the only one discovered to be doing highly questionable things with their app. REMEMBER, these headphones have MICROPHONES, plus the apps can monitor mobile device activity and location. Bose furthermore infamously forced everyone to REGISTER just to use their app. It later blew up in their face, and I'm taking off an extra star just for this.<br/> I find the ability to customize an EQ compelling, but I'd rather have a device which didn't need its sound tweaked in the first place. Being extremely finicky, but also anti-app, I took a chance on the Ankbit E600Pro, which has no app. Thankfully, my gamble paid off. I'm overjoyed by the Ankbit's sound.<br/> I don't plan to install the Bose app, because I didn't buy the Bose for music (luckily). But if I do, it won't be on a device I use regularly, and I'll probably uninstall it when I get the EQ I wanted anyway. I also won't give Bose any genuine personal info, nor should you, but they can probably figure out a lot anyway, depending your device. The Bose app EQ isn't very sophisticated anyway (not many bands). I'll just keep the crappy default tuning, as it works for speech, and these headphones will never be great for music. I have better stuff for that.. including the Ankbit.<br/><br/>SWAGGER<br/>I despise the idea of buying/not buying a practical item based on looks or social BS. Both the Ankbit and Bose have a narrow headband profile which doesn't look as chunky as many over-the-ear 'phones. Of course the Bose "look" better, but you pay a price for the 'spacey' design: they don't fold, and hair can get trapped easier in those 'poles'. Though I hardly have any hair-pulling with either, I have less with the Ankbit (virtually none, it's amazing). For those of yous who would buy Bose based on 'impressing' people, I'll tell you that true audio enthusiasts almost universally dislike Bose, and oftentimes despise them. Bose is no 'hood ornament' for me, it's a mark of shame. The one thing I respect by Bose, is their ANC headsets. They make (expensive ones) for pilots, and I think were first to market with ANC. That's where my respect stops, and the "app" beef set the disrespect in stone. Bose is always-overpriced stuff that usually sounds 'good' but not 'great'. I think both "Ankbit" and "1Mii" are ridiculous names, but the company has pretty solid (China-based) support, and a warehouse in the US. I can't speak firsthand about Bose support.<br/><br/>CONTROLS<br/>I don't hate the Bose touch controls as much as I thought. Volume control can be more nuanced than the Ankbit, depending device. I still prefer well-implemented physical buttons. I've had numerous times when the touch-sensitive area rested on my shoulder or hands, and unexpectedly announced the battery SOC. You also can't use most gloves. But the Projected Capacitive Touch Sensor is well-implemented.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>You don't always get what you pay for. There are better choices for a lot less money, EXCEPT if you want the best ANC (and ANC for the microphone)—and are willing to endure Diminishing Returns for it.<br/> The Bose was an expensive experiment and gamble, but since my life partner and I were 'fighting' over the Ankbit, we needed another. And since the Ankbit was a bit too big for her, and I like to experiment, I held my nose and tried the Bose. I went into this knowing the Bose music quality would be sub-par. But we mainly use headphones for speech, so adding wireless has been liberating. I wanted to experience the state of the art with ANC. I nearly bought a Bluetooth-equipped 'hearing-protection' type muff, but thought we'd have comfort issues (she hates having her "head squeezed"). Pay your luxury tax and sacrifice music quality if you want the best ANC there is (but not the best "muffling": true hearing protection earmuffs will still blow it away).<br/> Despite the fact that the Ankbit doesn't even fit her right due to the too-long headband, my LP still says she would STILL choose the Ankbit, if she could only have ONE (though due to the fitment issue—and that alone—it was a hard question for her). That's even if I didn't wrap the headband to bulk it up! That's saying a lot. And she claims even she can discern the better music quality of the Ankbit. That's saying a lot too!</span>

<span>I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.<br/><br/>Microphone and Playback<br/>The B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophile<br/>E285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Brand<br/>Bose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).<br/><br/>Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!<br/><br/>ANC<br/>When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.<br/><br/>In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.<br/><br/>Connectivity<br/>The E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.<br/><br/>Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.<br/><br/>Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!<br/><br/>App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Voice Assistant<br/>Couldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.<br/><br/>I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>On the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.<br/><br/>Comfort and Style<br/>While the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.<br/><br/>Extra<br/>The E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.<br/><br/>Issues<br/>B700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.<br/><br/>There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.<br/><br/>Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.</span>

<span>First thing I did was turn on my stereo and test the noise cancelling. I put on a loud song and played with the noise cancelling levels. It really works and makes a huge difference. It's not a dead silence because that isn't realistic. But from my perception it cuts 40-50% of the noise down. I look forward to using them when I fly.<br/><br/>They sound fantastic. It's Bose so you know the sound is going to be quality.<br/><br/>My Android (Pixel 5) connected to the headset immediately. I'm curious to see how realistic the claimed 20 hour battery life is. The Bose app on Android works is easy to use and has all the adjustments that you need.<br/><br/>The ear pads are comfortable. The head padding is comfortable. The headset doesn't feel like it would be annoying after 30 mins (although I will be testing that). It feels good.<br/><br/>I got these on sale for $285 (normally $379). I think $379 is a lot for a headset and so is $285 for that matter. But are worth it at that price point? That's an individual decision. $285 was my price point.</span>

<span>I have housemates who work days, while I worked 10+ years on 12-hr nights, so **I** am awake all night, &amp; I don't want to disturb them. I know that I won't b/c if I remove the headphones for any reason I don't hear much at all, even when I'm still holding them. Noise cancelation is probably good. IDK b/c the house is quiet when they're in use. I also don't know about volume control. I don't see any buttons or slides for volume on the phones. I have used them for both my Android phone for YT &amp; Prime Music &amp; Video, &amp; my DVD player. The sound is fine for my use, but may be underwhelming for people who are not casual users as I am. They aren't expensive (I wouldn't be able to have them if they were!) &amp; as they say "you get what you pay for". I think I got my money's worth! Only a few Cons, &amp; no deal breakers. 1) I sweat a lot  &amp; my ear pinnae get wet &amp; slick!  I don't necessarily blame them  for that! 2) I get wound up in the cords. 3) they don't fit exactly. Not extended at all &amp; they're still a bit too big. 4) I use them in bed &amp; the hard cup hurts my ear &amp; I end up getting a headache. Plus they slide about if I move! I can't bear ear buds b/c the canal of one ear is abnormal &amp; the bear hurts as soon as I try to place the bud, AND the bud keeps falling out! &amp; 5) maybe related to con #1, the inside of my ears itch while I'm listening. All in all, they are pretty good for inexpensive headphones. I just hope they last!</span>

<span>If you've ever had to walk in a single file line with your class to your local computer lab in elementary/middle school then you already have an idea as to what these headphones' sound quality is like. They are comparable to the cheap headphones every school bought for the students.<br/><br/>If you need a quick pair of headphones for some odd reason then these are perfect, but if you're going to use these for gaming/discord calls it is NOT worth using. (They work fine, but there are better headphones out there for such things)<br/><br/>Very good if your old pair of headphones broke and you need a cheap pair to hold you over until you can afford a new pair. I would NOT suggest these long term and you should go for a better quality headphones that has better sound quality.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect pair of headphones but gets the job done. In these rare circumstances like what I'm going through, these are a lifesaver.</span>

<span>It's rather nice to find that over-the-ear headphones are back in style.  I needed a new all-purpose pair, and when I found these, I clicked fast.  And when they arrived and I tried them, I was wowed!<br/>First, there was the frequency response.  12Hz-22kHz?  I was slightly leery, since my past experiences with that ultra-low-end response sounded like I had a cheap sub-wolfer blasting in my ears, even at low volume.  But Sony's cracked that - with these phones, the lows were rich without rattling, no matter what genre was on my player.  (At the other end, the slightly-higher frequency response makes opera sopranos and higher-pitched jazz instruments sound delightful - just in case you were wondering.)<br/>And these phones work nicely with anything that has a 3.5mm headphone jack - mp3 player, home sound system, computer, whatever.  The sound is nice, the pads are comfy and the cord doesn't get tangled.  Also, the L-shaped plug has a nice indentation on it, so you can more easily push the plug into the jack.  If you've never worn headphones that fit over the top of your head, it might take some getting used to, but for me it was a homecoming.<br/>That flat fold is nice, too - just be sure to follow the diagram carefully and be gentle.  Also, the instructions tell you that one side of the headphones is marked "right," but it isn't.  There is a dot on what I assume they consider the proper side, but the shape of my head made a more snug fit with the dot on the left.  I don't notice any difference, so the dot may actually indicate "left."  At the price, it's not worth fussing about.<br/>Since I walk through my day with a soundtrack whenever possible, noise cancellation is pretty important.  These headphones do pretty well in traffic, but I wouldn't try, say, mowing the lawn with them.  Even on the road, the traffic registers as a sort of swishy background, but I could still hear my music clearly.  I haven't tried them with a podcast or NPR or BBC yet, so someone else will have to report on that.<br/>For general purposes, these headphones deliver great sound at a great price.  I highly recommend them.</span>

<span>I like the fact that this Sony ZX series wired over ear headphone is comfortable on my head and over my ears. These Sony ZX Headphone are not totally outside noise canceling, which I prefer.  I have hearing issues, especially when my husband has his new big TV sound louder than my TV in the next room.  When he is watching sports on his TV he gets emotionally involved with the game and loudly commenting on how they are playing that sport, as if they can hear him.  I can hear through the headphone, when he shouts but it is very faint and does not bother me at all.  Depending on my concentration while wearing the Sony ZX headphones I noticed that I can't hear the doorbell or someone knocking on my front door and sometimes I can not even hear the phone ring.  I also, noticed that the sound quality is very good for this Sony ZX Headphone that do not have a control for volume on the set itself.  This Sony ZX series headphone is not wireless, which I am finding out that the newer TV's do not have a connecting plug to connect to a wired headphone.  Do not forget to get a connecting wire or cable from the back of your TV to were you sit to view your TV, unless you are less than 3 ft from you TV, in which case you will probably not need to be buy any headsets to hear your TV.  I have a connecting cable (20 feet plus) from the back of my TV plug to my sitting area, which is approximately 10 to 12 feet away from my TV.  I have been using this Sony ZX Series Headphones for over 20 years and I am very satisfied with the performance and quality of this product. Hope this helps!</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>- Fairly Immersive.<br/>- Amazing experiences.<br/>- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.<br/>- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)<br/>- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)<br/>- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.<br/>- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.<br/>- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)<br/>- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.<br/>- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.<br/>- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.<br/>- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.<br/>- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.<br/>-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.<br/>-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.<br/>- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.<br/>- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.<br/>- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.<br/>-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.<br/>- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)<br/>-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.<br/><br/>IMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:<br/>- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.<br/>- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.<br/>- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.<br/>- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.<br/>-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.<br/>- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)<br/>-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.<br/>-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.<br/>- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?<br/>- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.<br/>-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.<br/><br/>I have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.<br/><br/>Seeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.<br/><br/>Be considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.</span>

<span>I'm a gamer but not so much into VR. I've got an older Rift that I liked to mess around with but I wanted something portable. This is where this set shines. I purchased it, got it set up, and messed around with it some before I went on a trip to visit family, taking this with me. I have a few nieces and nephews that like playing games and this was a hit with them. My youngest nephew is 5, and, with some help from my sister, had a blast looking around. My older nieces loved the simple games and my brother-in-law and sister loved a variety of games and apps you can get for it. This is what my take on it is:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Portable: This is a great set to take with you on trips or throughout the house. There are no cables that need to be hooked to a computer in order to jump into a game. It's not super bulky, so throwing it into a suitcase is not too bad. I keep my original packaging and threw the whole box into my suitcase.<br/>-Great for casual or new to VR gaming. This set is good for anyone wanting to experience VR for the first time or not wanting to spend a ton of money on a higher priced set. Personally, at $400 for the 256GB version, this is a great value to jump in from time to time to play a game or watch a movie<br/>-This is also a great way to hang out with friends in a virtual landscape. I've watched movies in a virtual theater, played around in VRChat, and played some games with others<br/>- I loved the ability to set your own zones. You are able to set a play zone when using the headset. This keeps you from bumping into things and will automatically alert you when getting close to that barrier and then turn off the app you are in to a black and white view of your surroundings. That was a nice touch.<br/>- No need for external sensors to track you<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- This is not a high powered VR set. It is great and will play quite a few games, but it won't square off to higher priced units<br/>- Battery life is definitely low. I don't play it long, but when I was visiting family, I was lucky to really get a couple hours out of the headset before getting low battery warnings. You'll want to get a cable to attach to a charge source if you plan to do long plays.<br/>- I miss the headphone style speakers that the Rift had. The sound isn't bad, but without the headphones, you get sounds from around you.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good way to get into VR for a fraction of the price of high end ones. This is something good for the family and anyone wanting to travel and take their games with them.</span>

<span>I really didn't know what to expect. I've done the phone VR cardboard devices and wasn't impressed and I even owned a vr headset many years ago but this thing is a game-changer. I have stopped like 80% of my computer gaming and do most of my gaming in VR now. It's just so much more satisfying that it is hard to explain. There are issues but for the price they arent deal-breaking issues.<br/><br/>You can't really adjust the focal point, the lens will move to 3 different spots for the width of your eyes but if you are between then you have to try to stop it between the 3 slots you can move them to. If you wear glasses, I higly recommend you search for prescription lenses that can be bought fairly cheap and you won't need to wear your glasses inside the device.<br/><br/>The base head strap is crap. You will want to replace it pretty quickly after purchase. Battery life also is low, which leads to you buying a headstrap with a built-in battery as well. The stock battery is max, 2 hours.<br/><br/>Sound, it's.....ok. If you want immersive sound you will want either earbuds or some external over-the-ear setup. The sound isn't terrible, you can hear everything going on but its just not immersive at all.<br/><br/>Now for the surprise. I'm over 50, I HATE exercise, I can not stress enough, just how badly I hate exercise. With that said, there are some great games that give you a heck of a workout and it NEVER feels like you are exercising. Eleven table tennis is a very realistic ping pong simulator that will have you sweating like made while playing. Since you never have to chase the ball around the room to be able to serve again, you are constantly playing, and its absolutely worth the price if you ever loved playing ping pong.<br/><br/>Now, I will share a little about me, I'm a stroke survivor, on year 10 post-stroke. Have about 30% usage of my left side. Beat saber has changed my life. Nothing I have done for my left arm has ever really strengthened it but beat saber has started making it stronger. You just get into the music and just try and try. I will probably never play on expert+ and I'm OK with that.  It's fun exercise that never feels like exercise. I can not recommend these two games enough. I can easily lose track of time and when I am done, I sit down and think, holy cow, I am tired now.<br/><br/>I have bought lots of games from lots of different genres. You can sit on the river bank fishing in real VR fishing, you can watch tv shows and movies on the big screen with the Bigscreen beta app. Lots of VR or 360-degree content to watch that's free.<br/><br/>If I was forced to give only 1 answer to what I think of the quest 2 headset, It would be this. It's an amazing experience! It really changes many things about the way you think. Gaming is different in VR. You're not just gaming but you are immersed in the games. It changes how you game, it gives a sedentary person exercise that they would have never gotten before and you will never feel like you're just working out.<br/><br/>I really can't stress enough just how much this could change your life. It's not perfect by any means but I can only see it getting better and better.</span>

<span>So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.<br/><br/>My real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.<br/><br/>You have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.<br/><br/>For instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.<br/><br/>An app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience.  I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.<br/><br/>The travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.<br/><br/>Another problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.<br/><br/>People complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.<br/><br/>Also, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.<br/><br/>So I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.</span>

<span>I bought these when my old headphones went out.  I'd had my previous pair for going on five years.  I know, unheard of.  I just wanted a pair that were noise cancelling, wireless and had a long charge life.  These delivered and then some!  These cancel alllll the noise, EVER!  When I have them on, I cannot hear anything outside of what's playing in my ears.  I tested the theory with my two toddler nephews, Baby Shark and Paw Patrol and a 15 year old on his PS.  These headphones blocked it all!  They are very comfortable, the sound quality is awesome and the mic is crystal clear.  I easily connected them to my phone, iPad and laptop.  I'm impressed.  May buy a pair for my office.</span>

<span>These headphones are great for watching movies, listening to music, completing online training classes or anywhere else you are not required to talk. However, the deep bass they mention is lacking. Unfortunately using these headphones during a phone call, Zoom call, WebEx, etc. are lacking as microphone quality is lacking and impacts the ability for the remote side to hear you. On two occasions, during a zoom conference, I asked if everyone could hear me and was told by multiple individuals that it sounded really muffled and hard to hear.<br/><br/>If you just want these to just listen, then by all mean purchase as they are great for that but if you plan on using during conference calls, online classes, etc. where you must speak find something better.</span>
