<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm no audiophile, gotta get that out of the way.<br/><br/>Three stars?  This is because of the cable, maybe nit-picky, but touching/movement of the cable resonates a very annoying sound into the headphones.  Also, if you grew up with a telephone with a coiled cable you will receive flashbacks about how awful they are.<br/><br/>So audio quality, these are definitely the best headphones I've ever used.  Plugging them into my Mac Book Pro with with DAC and dolby atmos turned on is absolutely amazing.  Must repeat, I am no audiophile or claim to have a heightened sense of hearing, also, my first "professional" set of headphones.  I do own Bose QC35, HyperX, Airpod Pros, all with their own function, but these Sennheiser's definitely have better sound and bass compared to my other headphones.<br/><br/>I will probably gift these to a friend and buy another pair with a replaceable straight cable, but with the fault I mentioned I still think they are amazing but would not buy this specific model with the same cable again.</span>

<span>I needed a pair of headphones with strong passive noise isolation. I was originally going to get this over a year ago, and now I finally did. I'm glad to say that I don't regret buying them, because they sound so good and yet deliver sound isolation that comes close to a pair of ear defenders.<br/><br/>I've seen mixed reviews about the 280 Pro's sound quality for personal use, but the sound seems to work out well for me. Despite wearing glasses, the subbass doesn't seem to roll off at all, which helps up for the slightly underemphasized midbass. Pretty much anything that doesn't rely heavily on midbass is going to sound amazing on these headphones. Music that is midbass heavy will sound a bit dull without using EQ. The mids sound fantastic, and so does the treble. The treble is slightly underemphasized from 2k to 8k, which helps reduce harshness, but doesn't sacrifice any clarity at all. Soundstage is very good for a closed-back headphones, and imaging is spectacular to say the least.<br/><br/>Comfort-wise, I find them very comfortable to use for hours at a time. I feared they might be a little too clampy at first, but that doesn't seem to be an issue for me.<br/><br/>Sound isolation is second to none among the headphones I have. It even outperforms the Koss Pro4S in sound isolation. Both measure similarly in sound isolation from InnerFidelity's measurements, but from personal experience, the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro beats the Koss Pro4S quite a bit in sound isolation. These come so close to ear defenders in sound isolation that it isn't funny. The outstanding sound isolation ensures that you can listen to your music while cutting down external noise to a dull roar if not blocked out entirely. Sound leakage is almost nonexistent.<br/><br/>The coiled cable is permanently attached, which isn't too much of a deal for what I use them for, but it certainly is going to make it awkward to use while taking walks or going out in public. I still have my Koss Pro4S, which I use for those purposes anyway, so the Sennheisers stay at home.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. Sure, if the midbass was at the same level as the subbass, it would make these headphones more fun to listen to, but I'm not going to complain given their outstanding imaging, soundstage, and clarity and lack of major peaks and dips in frequency. 9/10 for sound quality, 10/10 for sound isolation, imaging, clarity and soundstage (by closed-back standards).</span>

<span>The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro "New Model" Assembled in the USA is a game-changer for me. Over the years I have tried several Senn Closed-Back headphones only to wonder how they could make some of the best Open Back Headphones and some of the worst Closed headphones. I'll back up a bit. My first pair of headphones was a pair of Koss Pro 4AA's. I had just gotten out of the Army and it was 1971. I loved them. I still have a pair of Koss Porta Pros to this day. My current headphone collection includes the Sennheiser HD 580 Jubilee, HD 650, and the New Model 280 HD Pro. I also have a pair each of the  Fostex T50RP MK3; the Sony MDR V900HD and the Sony MDR 7506, The original Audio Technica ATH M30 and the ATH M40fs, as well as a vintage pair of JVC HA-D990's that are not for sale.  None of these headphones are.<br/><br/>While none of the above info proves anything where my headphone expertise is concerned, it does prove I have good taste where headphones are concerned. So here's the thing. With the New Model HD280Pro Sennheiser has shown the World that it can make a very competitive Closed-Back headphone at a price almost anyone can afford. In addition to the New Model Senn 280 I also recently bought a pair of Audio Technica ATH M40x headphones. In my opinion, they are not even close to being as well built as my Old pair of Audio Technica ATH M30s. In direct comparison the Old M30s make the relatively New ATH M40X cans seem like a toy to me. Nor did they have near the sonic relationship with either my Solid State Emotiva A-100 BASX Amp or my Little Dot MK II tube amp. At about the same price the New M40x was not an improvement over my Old M40fs cans. In my opinion the M40x is a joke compared to my M40fs cans. About the same price, but not even close in every other respect. The M40x is a throwaway can, the M40fs is a keeper. The New Model Sennheiser HD280 Pro is a keeper as well. Very Neutral can. Lows, Mids, and Highs are ready to reveal what has been recorded.  If you don't like their sound it is probably your Sound Souce that is at fault. Some Bands are really not very good. Some Recording Engineers are not very good either. Some Bands and some Recording Engineers are great. The New Model HD280Pro will reveal which it is. Become an Audiophile. If Zen is selling water by a river, then being an audiophile is learning to know the difference between dogs barking and a host of singing angels Don't get me wrong. Sometimes barking at the moon is just what the good Doctor ordered. But nothing compares to the singing of angels. I think I will shut up for now and try out my New Model Sennheiser HD280s on two of my favorite angels. George Jones, and Patsy Cline. It doesn't get any better than that. Amen..</span>

<span>I got these in June 2021. Was surprised that they sounded so bright given that they have a reputation for being dark sounding but I didn't mind. I listen to mostly metal and rock, stuff with instruments and these were fantastic. Unfortunately the pads fell apart in about 8 months. I replaced them with Shure HPAEC1540 pads (a bit pricey but worth it. They don't change the sound much and are more comfy than stock pads). I was happy with this setup until the right side driver just up and died on me at the end of July 2022. I used them heavily (6 hours daily on average) but am very careful and took care of them as best as I could. I didn't get any shorting or anything before it happened. Just unplugged for the night, tried in the morning and nothing. Even opened it up to check for issues with the cabling and everything seemed normal. The driver was dead. I was very disappointed. Loved these things up to that point. So yea, great sound but they may die on you.<br/><br/>I've since replaced them with Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pros and am happy again as the sound signature is similar but with improvements in the bass regions. The build quality on these and Beyer's reputation also inspire confidence in their durability.</span>

<span>I bought the k361-bt versions, and I will stand by these headphones having an incredibly good sound. While they don't come with ANC and have a proprietary cable, the benefits of the sound alone are worth the money.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after about 2 months of use, the right ear cup suddenly gave out. I have been very careful with these headphones and generally place them gently because of the way it folds. But just today, as I decided to plug them into my laptop just for general use, no sound was coming out of the right ear. I'm afraid I believe it might be one of the wires being loose, as even in wireless mode it still has no sound coming out of the right cup.<br/><br/>I still stand by it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mid range priced pair of cans. Unfortunately I won't be able to appreciate them for a while now. I am absolutely devastated because these have beeny favorite pairs to go to for the past couple months.</span>

<span>One sentence review: Give them a chance to break in.<br/>These are my favorite "walking around" headphones.  They're comfortable (still a bit sweaty in hot weather), and durable.<br/>Sound is pretty good (still not as good at my AKG k702's, but I can't walk around with the K702's, as they're open back.)<br/>Would I buy them again? Yeah.  Probably.<br/>They're closed backed, so the sound-stage is small.  I realize I've gotten spoiled on my open back, huge sound-stage, headphones.<br/>They don't draw a lot of power, so you can use them with your cell-phones to play music (No mic. Remember that), without a need for an amp.<br/>All in all they're pretty good. Still a tiny bit of muddiness in the lower ranges, but like I said, I've been spoiled on my open-back headphones.<br/>Old review.<br/>I've been using AKG products for the last 20 years.  I just got the K371's today, and while they are comfortable, and they seem sturdy, I've noticed a lot of muddiness across a broad range of sound.  Especially the lower range. Maybe it's because they're closed backed (My AKG K702's sound WAY better), or maybe they need a break-in period.  But this isn't just flat sound.  It sounds like  I'm listening to them though a wad of tissue paper in the ear-cups.<br/>Will update in a few days, but if they don't improve, I'm going to have to send them back.<br/>Update:  A few days later, and sound has improved slightly, it's still a very "In your head sound". There's still some muddiness, but seems to be slowly getting better.  Sound stage is small. This is not some subjective thing.  Literally, some notes do not come across clearly.  These are good headphones, but unlike some of the other reviewers claim, these are NOT audiophile headphones.  I wouldn't even say they're good for reference. They're good walking around headphones, and are very comfortable (save for the ear sweat caused by the pleather ear-cups). For a comparison, the  AKG K702 is an audiophile headphone, and I can hear notes in that I cannot hear with these headphones. I've listened to the Grado's and those sound great as well (I'm going to buy a pair of those when I get the money), but those two headphones are open back, and no good for walking around.<br/>Buy the K371's if you want decent (and I mean DECENT.) headphones, that are sturdy.  They come with three cables, some of which are worth $40.00 alone.  So the three cables have to be worth at least $75.00 if you bought them by themselves. A short, straight cable.  A long straight cable, and a coiled cable (which is great).  You can use them in standard 3.5 and 1/4 plugs.<br/>Am I disappointed?  Yes.  But they're not horrible. The sound isolation and extra cables make the purchase a decent value.  Build quality is great, though.  Save for those ear-cups. Pleather on closed backed headphones?  Really?</span>

<span>UPDATE:<br/>After 7 months of use 5-6 times a week, for ~5 hours a day, I woke up to find a crack in the headband's plastic, going all the way through the band. I do not have a large head, I have never dropped or warped these, and haven't otherwise abused them other than nearly daily use (which I though was the point of headphones?). Since the headband isn't reinforced in any way, this has caused a distortion of the headband, and is now putting pressure on my head where the crack is, rendering the headphones 100% unusable.<br/><br/>Photos are attached of the crack and warping. The cups are discolored due to me dying my hair purple, so that's not on the manufacturer.<br/><br/>I'm downgrading my review to 1 star because WOW, it's only been 7 months and I seriously researched the bejeebus out of these before buying. I did contact support to see if they'll help me out, but I doubt it because I'm outside of 30 days by a lot. If they want to help me out, I'll update the review again.<br/><br/>Protip to anyone buying these: Register them for warranty right away, because the serial number is only on the packaging itself.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2:<br/>I was surprised to get a reply from Phiaton support, who offered to RMA the headphones. I got a brand new pair back, complete with new accessories. While this is awesome, I don't trust or use these headphones anymore, because they cracked. Rating is staying at 1 star because for $200, I expected better.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>I've had these headphones for 4 months now, under heavy use nearly daily.<br/><br/>These headphones are delightful! Setup is fast and easy, and I can easily connect to 2 devices. I don't recommend trying to connect to both at the same time, even though that is technically supported, as phone calls will distort violently sometimes.<br/><br/>Music sounds great, touch controls are easy to use, charging time is quick. I like that if I DO manage to kill the battery, I can just plug in the cord and keep on, mic and everything. While they are not "noise cancelling" they definitely muffle sound from being over-ear and well-fitted. I recently took them on an 8.5 hour plane trip, and it was seriously comfortable in regards to outside noise bleed. Touch controls will either lightly vibrate or gently beep in ear when you do something; responsive, but not overly sensitive!<br/><br/>The fit is pretty good for the ear cups. I have attached lobes and a cartilage piercing, so the elongated over-ears are a must for comfort, and it takes 3-4 days, wearing them for 4+ hours daily before I notice ear fatigue. Since I do dye my hair purple and got the white set, I do have some discoloration on both cups from excess dye; however, I have not noticed stray dirt or excess dust. They're usually left out if I'm not travelling, and I've had no problems. The top/headband fit is very comfortable, and I find the weight is easy to manage on top of my head. I saw a previous complaint that the headphones had slid down because they're light - and this is true. If you are headbanging, they will move around unless you really get a great headband fit, and even some then. These puppies are LIGHT!<br/><br/>Folding the headphones up can be tricky. I recommend pushing the cups all the way up to the band, then folding in, and storing in the case with the band pointed away from the case's seam; they fit better that way for whatever reason. The fold is a semi-aggressive snap, and will feel like you might break your expensive toy the first few times. You won't, believe me, I tried. If they're left folded for more than a few hours, the cups will have a slight intend on each long end, but it goes away quickly, and I haven't noticed a difference in cup feel at those parts.<br/><br/>What else? Charging time! The user books will tell you how long these take to charge, but it's under 4 hours for 8+ hours of constant phone and music use for me. If you're impatient, then you can use the cord that comes with so you don't have to put the headphones down. There are lights on the right ear cup that have fancy patterns, but these are useless when you have them on your head. I guess it lets everyone else know how cool you are, though? Mic is crystal clear, and does a great job killing background noise. Cute voice tells you when the device is dis/connected, and vibrations will give alerts for certain items when connected to phone.<br/><br/>Overall, I would buy another pair of these (possibly in a different color unless I stop dyeing my hair purple) without hesitation!</span>

<span>Light.  Comfortable.  Good build quality.  Sounds GREAT without EQ.  BT performance is on par with other high-end sets and has good reception.  Mic works very nicely.  My voice was noted to be crisp and clear, with no echoing or tunnel/muffled sound.  Background noise in a typical office environment was not an issue.<br/><br/>At first, I though the matte gray part on the side of the headphones on the headband sliders were plastic, but upon further inspection, they are metal.<br/><br/>Comes with a durable hard case and the headphones fold nicely in it.  Also, when folding the headphones in the case, they do not smash the ear pads, which is not the case with many other sets out there (ahem, Beats Studio Wireless).<br/><br/>The touch controls are some of the best I've experienced.  They are not too sensitive, yet responsive, so Phiaton has hit a nice balance here.<br/><br/>As far as the sound, as noted, they sound EXCELLENT without having to do anything with the EQ.  If you love QUALITY BASS, this is for you.  The bass is clean, defined, and rumbles.  It is not bloated, muddy, nor does it lack definition.<br/><br/>The only con, is these are not well suited for the gym, jogging, or anything requiring constant movement.  For me, this was why I deducted a star, because it would slip around when I bent down (house work, etc.).  Other than that, especially for the price, they are a good buy.</span>

<span>My husband basically purchased this for the software that comes with the interface for the price. As a beginner studio recording local artist, the equipment seems to be durable as fat as the interface goes, but we have not experimented to much with it as of yet, due to learning the software first and foremost.<br/>The software is not self explanatory, meaning, if you have never seen/recorded anything in your life, then opening the software is overwhelming. I see how-to videos in your future. (It's daily in ours!)<br/>I did NOT give this a higher rating due to the other basic equipment that was included in the kit, mainly the headphones. My husband plays daily, 2 hours after work, and 4-8 hours on the weekend, so the headphones have gotten a lot of use since our very recent purchase date. (5-7-21) The headphones have already broken (the wiring came out from the actual headset.) and I have already purchased another set from Amazon.<br/>I recommend this product for the recording software that comes with it and the interface itself. Great to start out, but if going to use daily, intensely, then I recommend upgrading the headphones, mic, etc.<br/>By the way, my husband is a drummer and guitar player.<br/>I have yet to need tech support, so no rating.</span>

<span>I've purchased 2 pairs of these so far and they both broke in exactly the same place and both just a few months after the 2-year warranty expired.<br/><br/>Sound quality is great, they felt really "tinny" when I first started using them, but that had more to do with me being used to really bass boosted headphones before.<br/><br/>They're pretty comfortable for extended use, although I did replace the ear cups with velvet ones because plastic ear cups have never been my thing.<br/><br/>I'd say it's a good purchase, if you don't mind replacing them every 2 years.</span>

<span>I've used the M50Xs for the past 6 years and they've been incredible, but they're now super glued in 3 spots due to heavy use. It was time for a new pair, and I've read and heard that the M40Xs are better, if not on par with the M50Xs. It's only been a few days with them, but I have to say, it's all true. All the sound quality, comfortability, and closed-back noise isolation is here for $50 less. I'm not really an audiophile, but I like music and I feel like I'm actually able to pick up more detail on these than my M50Xs. My main use for these is gaming, and they have great directional imaging for footsteps and gunshots and whatnot. If you're on the fence between the 40s and the 50s, save the money! Get these, you won't be disappointed.</span>

<span>I know the frequency response is TECHNICALLY better on the M50x, but for me I just like the sound of the M40x way more. I would definitely recommend trying to find some place to listen to both of them in person and making your decision, but for the price difference I would recommend these over the M50x especially to someone on a tighter budget. I've been using these for well over a year now and I love them, never had a single issue. The locking headphone cable is a nice touch, and I appreciate how long the cable is and that you also get a telephone-style coiled cable as well if you need a shorter one.<br/><br/>The only thing that is annoying about them is that you can't just use any standard 3.5mm cable, it seems like it HAS to be the ones that come with these. IF you're someone who gets cables shredded for one reason or another frequently, you may want to either stay away from these and go with something that can be replaced more easily, or buy a bunch of extras if AT sells them individually (I honestly haven't checked). If you take care of your gear though, I really don't think you'll have an issues.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have worked in live broadcast radio for just shy of 50 years as I write this. About 20 years ago I also included some recording studio work and music production into my routine.  As well as doing voice overs and commercial production with my own company for decades.  A large part of every day is spent in headphones.<br/><br/>This includes also the production of thousands of radio commercials and voice overs every year.  All this work requires headphones.  Now, to be honest, for my daily live show I prefer Sennheiser headphones.  There are certain models that play LOUD without distortion, and are made of some type of mysterious flexible plastic that makes them indestructible, and they have easily replaceable plug in cables without the coiled cord.  And since when on the air every morning they are put on and taken off about a hundred times, they are perfect mechanically for that.<br/><br/>And I know that this review sounds like a Sennheiser review -- but hold yer pants on.  For audio production work - commercial production - voice overs - music mixing and mastering - a different kind of headphone is needed. Excellent full range sound -- clarity in the highs AND lows.  And the comfort to leave them on for longer periods when tracking, mixing, and doing critical listening.  I have found these Sony headphones to be excellent for this work.  I have produced thousands upon thousands of radio commercials and music tracks and productions in these 'phones.  Oh, yeah, you can spend more - a lot more - and get a different sound -- and really, when you get right down to it, headphones depend a lot on personal taste, your own hearing abilities, comfort, and most importantly what YOU get used to - that YOU can use as your own personal reference when it comes to doing sound as your job, or sound for your own enjoyment.  These are very good at meeting the needs for thousands of music producers and radio and studio people.<br/><br/>Be aware that some will review and say "I didn't like these headphones -- not enough bass" for example. That just might be because your source - your music - your amp - your system - isn't giving you the amount of bass you like. The idea isn't to buy headphones that will color the sound to what you like, but to give you an honest representation of the audio. This is why music sources have tone and equalizer controls on them.<br/><br/>I *can* tell you that I know for a fact that I personally know major players in the voice over business -- people whose voice you hear on movie trailers in the theaters and on thousands of major national and world wide radio and television commercials, and endless network television promos, who are using these headphones in the studio and there's a reason for that.  That main reason is that they give you a reliable indication of what your final product is going to sound like, and they're comfortable and reliable.<br/><br/>They also keep outside noise from getting into your ears.  They seal you in good and isolate you from stray noise and distractions.  Which also makes them great for critical work, but less handy in an on air situation when you might at least want to hear someone yelling at you in the room lol.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks I can share are, they are crummy for portable/traveling situations. They're somewhat awkward to put on and off (hence the Sennheisers on the air) and the foldable feature might be nice when you want to put them in the case (optional) and toss them in an equipment bag or suitcase for an away gig but I can't imagine using these in a more portable use.<br/><br/>Oh, and when you need to replace the ear pads (and you will) here's a tip -- the OEM Sony pads are relatively expensive.  There are pads for Beyer Dynamic headphones that fit perfectly, and equally comfortable, and much less expensive.<br/><br/>There are a ton of headphones out there. Some people prefer Beats, for example, which give you a very exaggerated bass response -- fine if you like hearing more bass than intended, but horrible if you want to know what your voice or music mix actually sounds like.  You often see popular singers in the studio in their videos wearing some sort of gaudy headphones -- that look like they're wearing huge pink coconut halves on the side of their heads -- nice visual effect but I can assure you the cats mixing the music aren't wearing those.<br/><br/>You can count on these Sony's for getting the job done. And you can count on them for comfortable and enjoyable music listening too. They're not just for studio work.</span>

<span>Good headphones, but be aware they are fairly “accurate” (except for slight db loss in low bass). If you are used to the typical bass-enhanced headphones, you may not like these. The design, though I love it for its classic looks, is a bit dated (exposed wires, etc).<br/><br/>In my humble, non-expert,  opinion, the best use for these is as a reference set in a home-studio; but I also listen to music from my iPhone via the Apple dongle (the phone with this DAC easily handles the  63 Ohms impedance).</span>

<span>I purchased these Sony MDR-7506 headphones a couple of months ago. More recently, I've also purchased Sony's very similar (but not identical - see below) </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Sony-MDR-V6-Monitor-Series-Headphones/dp/B00001WRSJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones</a>
<span>. My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because the V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered ($30 cheaper than the 7506's), and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.<br/><br/>These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of "over-the-ear" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensive </span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Koss-KSC75-Portable-Stereophone-Headphones/dp/B0006B486K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones</a>
<span> for occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first "quality" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.<br/><br/>Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have found:<br/><br/>- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone "for Digital", and the 7506 has blue stickers "Professional". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.<br/>- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but  if this is true - and I am not able to confirm whether or not it is - then maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).<br/>- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: "both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number."<br/>- The box for the 7506 states "neodimium magnet". The operating instructions included with the V6 state "samarium cobalt magnet". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.<br/>- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.<br/>- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.<br/><br/>UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]<br/><br/>According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:<br/><br/>- MDR-7506:<br/>  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity<br/><br/>- MDR-V6:<br/>  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity<br/><br/>I am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And I do believe that the two headphones have slightly different sound.<br/><br/>Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The "professional" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.<br/><br/>I've been using these headphones with the </span>

I'm just beginning to use them, but I have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that I will continue to be as satisfied with them as I am today.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.<br/><br/>If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.<br/><br/>The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.<br/><br/>Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want "world around dissapears" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointing<br/><br/>Edit #1:<br/>The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:<br/><br/>«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»<br/>Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says "Noice Cancelling", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent)  sure noice cancelling was active.<br/><br/>«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»<br/>Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.<br/><br/>Edit #2:<br/><br/>I was "finally" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and "- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.".<br/><br/>For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song "A a a a a a a a a Very good song" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.<br/><br/>I tested in various scenarios:<br/>1.) In my car, windows down.<br/>2.) In my car windows up.<br/>3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).<br/>4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).<br/>5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.<br/>6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).<br/>7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.<br/><br/>My results:<br/>1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.<br/>2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.<br/>3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.<br/>4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.<br/>5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.<br/>6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.<br/>7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.<br/><br/>But, in scenarios 5, 6 &amp; 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).<br/><br/>Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing  more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.<br/><br/>Edit #3 (and Final):<br/><br/>Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.<br/><br/>That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.</span>

<span>Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.<br/><br/>I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.<br/><br/>Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.<br/><br/>I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...<br/><br/>NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------<br/><br/>Sound Quality ---- 8/10<br/>These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as  most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.<br/><br/>DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORS<br/>I only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.<br/><br/>Comfort ---- 10/10<br/>These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.<br/><br/>Features ---- meh, not much to talk about<br/>Really the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.<br/><br/>Aesthetics ---- 6/10<br/>Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.<br/><br/>Connectivity ---- 6/10<br/>Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.<br/><br/>Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10<br/>You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!<br/><br/>Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)</span>

<span>I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick &amp; mortar store, but the price caused me to pause.  On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy &amp; Anker’s reputation for quality.<br/>I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results.  They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.<br/>Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality &amp; price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price.  He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were &amp; he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones &amp; didn’t pay $$$ for them,<br/>They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs &amp; battery is still strong, time fly by.<br/>There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones.  2) the headband could use a slight redesign.  Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about  (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit &amp; my hair gets pulled  so I have to adjust them &amp; keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!<br/>Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called &amp; I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find &amp; adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.<br/>They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about.  Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight &amp; no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first class<br/>Love these headphones, the ANC &amp; overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks &amp; sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some.  I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.<br/>Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.<br/>Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound.  I like a variety of music &amp; I hear good  bass, mid tones &amp; treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank &amp; with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, &amp; other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.<br/>Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad &amp; I appreciate that.<br/>I’ve had &amp; used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate  them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.<br/>Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop.<br/><br/> UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones.  That says a lot about the sound &amp; quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones &amp; that I recommended Ankers.<br/><br/>Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon &amp; Anker</span>

<span>This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.<br/><br/>Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.<br/><br/>The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.<br/><br/>The Soundcore Headphones:<br/>These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.<br/><br/>Comparability and Software:<br/>These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.<br/><br/>Overall Sound<br/>I'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling:<br/>Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.<br/><br/>Comparisons:<br/><br/>Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.<br/><br/>Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.<br/><br/>Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.<br/><br/>Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.<br/><br/>The Overall:<br/>Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.<br/><br/>TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.</span>

The circumaural (around-the-ear) pads are designed for hours of wearing comfort, while the steel-cable, self-adjusting headband construction and single-sided professional quality audio interconnect ensure extended reliability in demanding professional studio applications. Proven, popular, excellent - New, improved and even better. Made in China. The item includes the OFC screw type cable.   From the Manufacturer   The AKG K 240 Studio is an update of the "classic" AKG K 240 Monitor. The new K 240 Studio delivers even wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity than its well-known and widely-used predecessor. The secret to the semi-open K 240 Studio's sound quality is the new XXL transducers in acoustically tuned vented enclosures with circumaural (around the ear) pads. The circumaural pads envelope your ears nicely and reward you with smooth, solid bass and well-balanced, articulate mids and highs.Founded in Vienna, Austria in 1947, AKG has built a legendary reputation in the professional audio industry for products that perform flawlessly. The reputation of AKG and its celebrated quality are built on more than 55 years of experience, incredible design, meticulous craftsmanship and a clear understanding of what truly sounds right. AKG introduced the K 140 in 1974 and the K 240 Monitor in 1975, which became the most widely used headphones in recording studios and broadcast facilities worldwide. Generations of musicians and audio engineers use these AKG products to create great mixes, hit songs and albums cherished by millions around the world.

Delivers solid bass and well-balanced mids and highs XXL Transducers with Varimotion DiaphragmThe new XXL transducers use AKG's patented Varimotion diaphragm to ensure extremely accurate response at any listening level. This technology creates a diaphragm that is thinner, more elastic toward the outside edges for more powerful bass response and thicker, less resonant in the center for pure, accurate mids and clear, detailed highs. The large size of the transducers makes the overall sound more life-like and three-dimensional to capture the emotional and sonic content of your soundtracks.Gimbal-Type SuspensionTo ensure your listening comfort, AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a self-adjusting headband with a flexible steel structure to deliver optimum fit for your headphones without any fiddling. The structure is flexible, yet strong enough to allow bending for single ear use and is durable enough to withstand rough handling.

<span>Do not get these to listen to music, podcasts, watch movies, tv shows, audio books, or any kind of audio entertainment. And especially don't get this for porn! I'll explain why further down. This device is for professionals only. If you're not mastering or producing audio projects from music to podcasts etc, then you have no business here.<br/><br/>Put it this way. I have the AKG N60, which is way more expensive than the AKG K240s. I use the AKG N60 to listen to music, because music sounds way better on the AKG N60 than the AKG K240. When I make beats beats, I use the AKG K240. Because the sounds are more clear. It is easier to know how to pan and how to EQ sounds and their frequencies using the AKG K240 than on the N60. The N60 is meant for entertainment and chill. The AKG K240s is meant for work. Plain and simple. So if you're looking for entertainment headphones use the money you were going to use for this and buy headphones made for entertainment. If you're a producer, and you're here to WORK with professional studio/monitor headphones under $100 or under $80, this is for you. If you've made the mistake to get these for entertainment purposes, you will be disappointed and find the audio quality to be cheap. And that's your fault for not listening to the pros or doing your research. So if you're here for entertainment no need to read further, move on with your life and find something else. If you're here to WORK, please read on.<br/><br/>Now that we have that out of the way and the civilians are gone, let's get to WORK.  If you want great fantastic studio/monitor headphones that gives you musical orgasmic experiences, you want something that costs hundreds and hundreds of dollars. But if you want to get the job done and are under a strict budget, you're going to fall in love with these guys. Especially if you buy fluffier ear pad replacements like I did. Its so fluffy! And made the sound a bit more roomier, but also less punchy, and less pronounced, because the little speakers are further away from your ear. But somehow it makes the sounds clearer if you will, I'm guessing because its roomier with fluffier ear pads. Now, there's nothing wrong with the default ear pads. They are comfortable giving you hours of play. I mean WORK. I just took that extra step. Fluffier ear pads allow you to play even longer. I'm sorry, I mean WORK. Though not sure how healthy that is, breaking night because you cant stop creating, exploring and perfecting sound. These headphones are def! ;)<br/><br/>A few things to keep in mind as an audio engineer. These are no good for LIVE recording, or wearing these as you record vocals or instruments like a guitar or piano, etc. The reason being is because they are semi-open. Which means the sound purposely leaks out of the headphones and will leak into the mic, totally messing up your recording! For those you want closed studio headphones, not the AKG K240s. Now if you're making beats, mixing tracks, mastering audio projects, editing a podcast/interviews etc, these are perfect!<br/><br/>Let me explain this leakage in terms most can understand. If you want to listen to &gt;&gt;&gt;PORN&lt;&lt;&lt; privately without disturbing people next door, like your parents or other family members, these are a very poor choice! You can hear the noise leakage outside of your room from the other side of the door! So in short, if your place in making music is recording in a sound booth, stay away from the AKG K240's! The K240 is for those who work outside of the booth. The noise leakage helps in making the sounds clearer because it gives the sounds more room rather than trapping the sounds. Helps in panning, EQueing, etc. It's also helpful in hearing a potential attacker like Jason, Pennywise or Michael Myers stepping up behind you, giving you a chance at survival. But since you'll be working so hard, the chances of you falling asleep on your chair and falling prey to Freddy Krueger are very high! So if you feel tired, do the right thing. Turn everything off and go to bed. Your head will be more clear for the next time you tackle your audio projects. And Freddy isn't really into responsible audio engineers. Or is he?<br/><br/>One other thing I want to share, that I didn't know about these babies. This is no baby!! These headphones represent the birth of Generation X. Disco, Rap, Heavy Metal, House, Punk etc. The AKG K240s is basically a remix of the original 1975 K240 Sextett. And its exact look and golden colors make it a replica of the 1984 K240M.<br/><br/>These were used by producers who worked for many legends who came to be during the birth and revolution of digital music. Let that sink in, for all of you 808 Trap heads out there. Yup.<br/><br/>One thing to think about for Trap beat enthusiasts. People who know more than me, say these aren't that great for listening to bass music. That's kind of redundant information being that these aren't meant for chilling to music. They're meant for real work. Anyhow, imagine perfecting the most righteous 808 kick bass sound with the K240 and then mastering and mixing everything together so it all sounds perfect. Then imagine how that would sound to people listening to it through hifi speakers or headphones meant for listening to music and how insanely extra bass heavy it will sound while still sounding clear with all the sounds in place and arranged. That's what I'm experiencing right now. Results that go boom-boom with quality clarity. Something to keep in mind.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this for people who just want to listen to music? Seriously? Didn't I tell you to get lost already? You do not belong here! BEAT IT!<br/><br/>Do I recommend this for audio engineers who edit and master audio projects of all kinds trying to get professional studio headphones for under $80? Hell yes I do. And while you're at it, go get the fluffiest ear muffs you can find.</span>

<span>I’ve only had these a short time, but so far so good. I needed them for a temporary WFH scenario where normal studio monitors wouldn’t do. My previous headphones’ ear pads and cups were starting to deteriorate and flake off. Since I’d bought that brand/model twice and had the same issue, I decided to switch to the industry standard AKG headphones. I’d seen them being used by others for years, but never owned a pair myself. They’re comfortable, seem to have a flat, even frequency response and they’re lightweight to boot. I notice a bit quicker ear fatigue than my previous brand. Not because of how they sound, but it just feels nice to take them off after, say, half an hour of use. But they’re comfortable enough to wear while working. Would recommend.</span>

<span>For the price - you won’t find a better set of studio headphones - these are great headphones - and their biggest advantage is their semi-open back design - this allows you to get a more natural sound - more air in the headphones - I don’t recommend mixing or mastering with headphones - but using something like this with its semi-open back design at least allows you to get a little better more natural sound in your headphones - it’s at least a good start.</span>

<span>... if you understand that they are excellent STUDIO or detailed listening headphones. They are not light on bass, but also they do not unrealistically emphasize bass like consumer headphones do. I've been listening to these for about six hours now, and as they settle in and get broken in, they keep getting better and better. I've thrown all kinds of music at them - a LOT of classical piano, some orchestral works, cello, brass, a drum improv, 0-Daiko (huge Japanese drums), female and male vocals, rock incl metal, and more. They do a fantastic job on all of it. If you want smooth and accurate bass, the way it is being performed, recorded or produced, the K240s will do the job nicely, without overstating or understating anything. Mids are detailed and clear, so is the treble. They sound very similar to my studio monitors, which is exactly what I was hoping for. I don't want my headphones to alter the sound in any way. I want them to accurately reproduce it.<br/><br/>These are NOT noise-canceling or noise-isolation headphones. You will hear noise from the room, and the room (and any open mics) will hear whatever you are listening to on the headphones. That is just an instrinsic feature of open-back (or partially open-back) headphones. No bluetooth either. This is a wired-only headset. The cord has a female mini-XLR connector on the headphone end, and a 3.5 mm plug on the other (plus a 1/4" adapter).<br/><br/>The headphones don't appear cheap or poorly made. I plan to treat them with respect, hanging them up when not in use and that sort of thing. I've ordered replacement memory foam ear pads (Brainwavz) and a 3 meter cord. The provided ear pads and cord are more than servicable, however. The cord has a nice rubbery texture and is a good length. I just needed a little longer.<br/><br/>I recommend the use of a headphone amp or audio interface with these headphones. I'm using a DAC amp I got on Amazon for $50 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XJ89KV6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and I have found that I need to feed the K240s quite a bit more gain with it than the Philips headphones needed. If you have an underpowered audio section on your phone or tablet, it might not be enough for the K240. Most higher-end smartphones and laptops will be fine. However, still consider a headphone amp. Not just for volume, but for dynamic range, for signal to noise. You don't want your headphones to be starved for oomph when it matters most, and I think these could be underpowered and struggling in the wrong setting.<br/><br/>The best feature of these headphones is that they disappear. They are very light, and the sound is very clear and airy. As a result, I find myself forgetting that I am even wearing them. It's just me and the music. And that is a good place to be.<br/><br/>These are very tough to beat in the open headphones category, unless you are prepared to spend $400 for a pair of Sennheiser HD-600s and even then it's a bit of a horse race. Perhaps consider the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro for $150. But you can buy the K240s AND a decent small headphone amp for $100. Then sit back and enjoy them. That's what I plan to do.</span>

<span>UPDATE, BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Well, I'll be damned, its been exactly a year since I wrote this. It was pure luck that I checked my reviews today.<br/><br/>Anyway, build quality.<br/><br/>The M20xs I bought a year ago are still going strong, and I use them constantly when I am not on my computer. The cable is fine, the gold plating has worn off of the plug (that's normal after a lot of use), and the plastic doesn't appear to be worn. If I cleaned this thing very well, it would look brand new. However, not everything is in perfect condition, and that would be the padding.<br/><br/>I started to notice after a while that the earcups were starting to feel harder and harder. As a sanity check, I took a look at my dad's m50xs to see if they were still soft, and they were (he doesn't use them that much anymore). I looked into it, and apparently, the fake rubber-leather stuff Audio Technica uses in their earcups slowly deteriorates over time by getting harder and eventually cracking due to the stress of cushioning. This is a result of constant contact with body oils (this is why my dad's pair is still soft). Thankfully, these are replaceable, but they are $25 for a pair, which is quite a bit. I got these headphones for $30 dollars while they were on sale, for perspective. There is also the chance that they use some cheaper earcups in the m20xs, which wouldn't surprise me. In which case, the replacement earcups for the m50xs could be considered an upgrade.<br/><br/>What is more worrisome is the headband. Unlike the m50xs, which have a higher quality rubber on the headband, the headband on the m20xs is made out of the same material the earcups are. You can't replace it. Although its unlikely that the headband will get severely damaged from cracking since it doesn't exactly cushion, I can still see some dents in mine that don't go away.<br/><br/>Other than that, these are still my favorite general purpose headphones, and I still recommend them. I'm on the edge of replacing the earcups though. If it does break at some point, I might aim for the m40xs due to the shorter cable options, better build quality/materials, and better sound. I'll give it two more years and see what happens to them.<br/><br/>REVIEW:<br/><br/>So, I have never been wealthy enough to own a good pair of headphones. Hearing about the constant praise of Audio-Technica, I decided to pick of their budget pair of monitors, the ATH-M20x. My father has a pair of their M40x or 50x, but I am pretty much not allowed to touch them. That's why I can't say which ones they are.<br/><br/>As perspective and for comparison, the main headphones I used before these were the Sol-Republic v8 tracks, and I use a Logitech G230 gaming headset currently for my desktop.<br/><br/>The song I tested between these headphones was Ocean Man by Ween, because of the formidable range in pitch. I also remembered the song the day I did this, so it was a bit nostalgic for me to listen to it again.<br/><br/>SOUND QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, the first thing that struck me with these headphones was that the bass was much less compared to the other headphones. Now, this isn't a bad thing, because it let me focus on the other tracks in the song, such as the guitar and percussion, which became much brighter. This made the song sound much clearer than my other headphones, which lacked a little in mids and highs.  My Sols overall had much more bass, but the rest of the frequencies seemed filtered out because of it. It's mostly the same story with my g230s, but the highs are much better than the sols. Realizing this, I finally figured out why I couldn't hear footsteps very well in the game Counter Strike Global Offensive, which encourages me to buy another pair of the M20x for my desktop, as well as a mic. The only real issue I have with the M20x at this point is that I cannot hear bass drums very well if they aren't mixed loud enough, which is disappointing, as percussion is one of the most important factors in music to me. Overall, these have generally amazing performance in the audio range, despite the bass seeming only a tad bit weaker than it should be. If they boosted up a tiny bit, I would be satisfied. Not worth to take a star off however, especially for the price.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that these headphones are higher in impedance than normal, so I have to near max out my volume on my phone to get somewhere acceptable to me. This isn't a problem, but I'm afraid I may get some distortion in some songs. This is also sad, as I use a separate Creative Zen audio player for my high quality CD rips, which don't go as loud as my phone, making it essentially useless. They also don't really like to plug into my phone with the case on, so I have to jam it in the jack and hope it doesn't spring out. This is along with the other problem with my audio jack, which is that they always think I'm using an inline mic unless I unplug and re-plug and hope they see them as regular headphones. If it doesn't, then bumping the cord can cause google to start voice detecting, which is very annoying, as well as randomly pausing and playing a song. To reinforce it, this is a problem with my PHONE, not the plug. This is more of a me problem, however, they still have issues being plugged into a phone with a case. Making the end coned and the adapter it comes with internally coned would solve this problem.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY:<br/><br/>Now, one of main reasons why I bought a g230 was because they are very well built, and could take multiple falls off of my desk. Same goes for the Sols, which are pretty much designed like a tank due to the super strong headband and hard but not brittle plastic. The M20x however, seems like it would need a bit more care with the headband, since it is not topped with plastic. I usually just throw my Sols into my backpack everyday, because it can handle it. These will need a bit of extra attention to not tear up the foam on the headband. I tried buying a </span>

<span>, but the description lied to me and said that these headphones would fit. They didn't, and now I have to return it as soon as possible to get my 13 bucks back. They do fit my dad's well though because they fold, and is a pretty good case. Otherwise, the ABS plastic is nice on the drivers making them strong, and the headband has spring steel metal in it. There are no visible defects anywhere, not even unmixed plastics or rough spots on the foam. This is fairly impressive for a product made in Taiwan. Another thing I would have liked would be to color the logo inset on the sides of the drivers, it would make it easier to see. I assume this is to differentiate different models.<br/><br/>Now, the cord I have a bit of an issue with. The cord itself is very nice; it's well insulated and flexible. The jack is nice too, it appears gold plated and has a nice bend protector. The issue I have is that it's way to freaking long, at a staggering 3 meters. This may be a good thing for some people, but I am going to be walking around with these. I have to coil up the wire (thank god for that insulation) and put a cable management strip on it to shorten it. Now, there is a good 4 inch diameter coil in my pocket that is 1/2 an inch thick, and is VERY annoying. If they could have at least shortened it to maybe 1 meter, I would not be writing this. This is worth a star for me, so off it goes. Despite this, the cable has to be one of the best impeding headphone cables I have encountered, keeping out eddy currents very well, which would cause distortion with the huge coil I have to lug around. A good way to test if a cable is well insulated or not is to try and use the cable as a stylus on a touch screen. If the screen reacts in any way while playing music, the cable has failed the test. No matter how I tried, looping it, squishing it against the screen, it would not be detected. That is a good sign for a good cable, as no electrical fields are going through that thing. As a solution to the coil, I may do some research on the internals of the cord, and shorten it myself. If you are also hateful of this issue, the better ATH models have interchangeable cables that can be much shorter. To me, it isn't worth it to pay 30 to 40 extra dollars for that feature.<br/><br/>COMFORT:<br/><br/>So, my g230s are a very comfortable pair of headphones for me to wear, as they are over ears. My Sols on the other hand are on ear, which was a huge issue to me when I bought them. It's not that they were uncomfortable, but it was because of an odd problem I have with my right ear. My ear canals are extremely small, so I can't use earbuds, which is really my main reason of buying full on headphones. In this case, the Sols would squeeze my right ear shut! There would be no music to my right ear unless I physically held the driver, and stretched my ear a bit. Now, the M20x are also over ear, so that's great for me. It's actually the main reason why I bought these, I wanted a nice pair of over ears that would not impede my hearing. Not only this, I would say they fit even better than my g230s due to the many degrees of freedom, so I am extremely happy here. My issue was solved due to these headphones. The actual foam the headphones use is nice, definitely on the drivers. The headband foam on top is durable and a bit stiff, but not noticeable. The bottom foam seems the same as the drivers, so no problem there. All of the foam seems to be wrapped in a thin fake leather material, and it feels nice. My g230s are just wrapped in perforated fabric, which makes it a tad itchy.<br/><br/>MY OWN JUDGEMENT:<br/><br/>Now, because I like nice things, I want it obvious what I'm using is nice and worth it. I like to make a statement, so I buy things that fall under these categories:<br/><br/>1. Looks cool<br/>2. Does it's job well<br/>3. Lasts a long time<br/><br/>So, for it looking cool, I would say "eh." As I previously stated, the logo isn't painted in, so they just look like headphones from afar. My Sols on the other hand, look 100% sweet, with it's circular drivers, solid looking headband, minimalist logo, and shiny plating (that wore off around the edges of the drivers, sadly). These don't have that aesthetic I'm looking for, but they do look like monitors, which kind of makes up for it. To me, they just look intermediate, not pro.<br/><br/>For doing the job well, that is a definite yes. The cool factor to me can immediately be vetoed in the case that something works like a well oiled machine. This is that case. They just sound good, and anyone who would borrow these would tell. My sols aren't that good sounding, and my g230 is okay, so these are technically the best headphones I own at the moment. A case where this wouldn't be true would be Beats by Dre. Yes, the headphones look very nice, iconic even. Despite this, they pretty much are just a step up from those 5 dollar Koss headphones you buy at drug stores when you have nothing else to use (those headphones are very good for the price though, so I like them for that).<br/><br/>I don't know for certain yet if these will last a long time. This is another factor that directly goes with doing the job well, as having these factors multiply each other makes for a godly product. My Sols and g230s definitely fall under this category, as they have both lasted me 2 years. The Sols are almost done for, however, as the right driver's plastic cone buzzes on certain frequencies. The g230s look literally brand new and haven't degraded audio wise, so they have served me well, and will keep doing so. Beats by Dre also do not fall under this factor, as they must be treated like kings, or either they will shatter the moment you look at them (an anecdote from a friend). Because it misses the two most important factors, Beats headphones are useless to me, especially with the price they ask for. I will have to live with the M20xs for a while to see how well they do with this factor, and I am predicting another strong yes. And even if they only last me a couple months, they are still only $30, an amazing price for what these headphones are. One thing I realized that may break them is extending the drivers over and over again. The metal tracks that are attached to them go in and out of the headband, and you can feel them moving inside through the foam. You can even pinch it and make it really hard to move it (annoying sometimes), which means they aren't encased in anything. This leads me to predict that at some point, they will poke through the band. Because of this, I will not shorten them every time I stow them away. Someone posted a picture that looked like this happened to them, so I will watch out.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>These are an amazing pair of headphones that meet many of my quality standards, as I am a bit of a snob. They sound great, but bass drums can be too quiet or hard to distinguish. They are made very well, despite the freaking long cable and too thick of an end for the jack. They are very comfortable, and solved the issues I had with other headphones I owned. They succeed my personal checklist, but I will need to test for durability. So, as a final statement: if you are on a budget and want nice over ears for sitting down and listening to music, pick up a pair of ATH-M20X headphones. If you have more money, shoot for the M40x or m50x if you want to walk around or need better quality. I am pretty satisfied despite my current situation, so I hope you can enjoy these headphones more than me.</span>

<span>SO, JUST WHAT DOES "PROFESSIONAL" MEAN? These ATH-M20X "Professional Studio Monitor Headphones" may not be suitable for a dedicated audiophile--but for field work, podcasts, etc.--these are a great buy for the money.<br/><br/>For critical listening, I love my GRADO LABS open back phones which sadly, provide NO sound isolation whatsoever. When it comes time to record in noisy environments, the ATH-M20X "Professional Studio Monitor "Headphones are more than adequate for critical listening. These are NOT Noise Cancelling cans by any means, but they provide just enough isolation to make them valuable in the studio OR in an airport, etc. These are full-range phones with impressive bass reproduction (yes, you can fit a kettle drum inside your head.) They are NOT the most focused or best sounding cans--but for under 50 bucks, they are pretty damn good. I use them for podcasting and critical music mixing. Again, for audiophile ears, you you'd probably do better with GRADO SR60's (around $65)--but when sound isolation (not noise cancelling) is a must, I found myself impressed.<br/><br/>If you are a professional recording engineer, you should be able to afford $300+ cans that are noticeably superior--but for the rest of us, these ATH-M20X  Headphones are more than adequate for "studio work."</span>

<span>Very happy with these ATH-M20X headphones. I bought them to get a sample of what the ATH-M50X might generally sound like.  I prefer these to my Sennheiser HD 599 SE which cost 3x more. The ATH-M20X have the mids and to a certain extent the highs which are missing from the HD 599's. If you want to hear ALL the music these are for you. I love hearing accentuations I've never heard in recordings I've listened to many times before. If you like bass heavy don't buy these. They aren't lacking in bass, the just aren't bass heavy.</span>

<span>I've been using the MXL USB 006 USB microphone since 2009.  It sounds terrific.  But of course the problem is that it picks up all the hums and spurious sounds generated in offices, auditoriums, and home offices.  So I tried these.  They too sound terrific and do a terrific job of blocking out ambient noise.  To test, I had my PC fans roaring 3 feet away, and a 3 fan tower, uhmm, fan running 6 feet behind me.  I took my SPL meter out and read the same paragraph at about the same loudness.  I used the Plantronics Blackwire C720, my MXL USB006, this headset and the Shure WH20XLR Dynamic Headset Microphone  (ASIN: B0001DBZNM).  I used the SPL meter to make sure I was talking at about the same level.<br/><br/>Then I compared all four.  MXL USB sounded great, but picked up all the fan noise/hum - as expected.  Plantronics did an admirable job.  And for any casual use, I highly recommend it.  But the Shure mic did a slightly better job than the BPHS1 microphone.  Noise isolation was about the same, but I felt that the Shure mic sounded more natural.  And ultimately, I didn't need the sound support that BPHS1 brought to the table.  To sum up, if you need an all-in-one solution of sound and mic, get this unit.  If you don't, I'd recommend the Shure mic.</span>

<span>I'm a voiceover talent and a computer programmer, in the past I have produced and run nationally syndicated radio programs, from both the studio and the network.<br/><br/>I found the AT BPHS1 to be one of the better headsets, especially for those who are working from home, looking for solutions that are unobtrusive, ergonomic and allow freedom of movement. You'll need an audio interface with ample gain as this is a dynamic mic that produces a lower signal, intentionally. Dynamic mics won't pick up all the extra noises in your environment, but they will grab some.  Once you've set the mic's location, it won't move - it is most certainly broadcast quality construction. Additionally, the lengthy cabling allows you to move around, stand up, etc, without being jerked around like you're on a short leash. I've worked 8 hour days literally forgetting it's on my head. It's very comfortable.<br/><br/>Many of the comments reference podcasts. If you're got four of these plugged into something like a RodeCaster Pro, you're going to capture everything you're after. But, the BPHS1 is, without question, no replacement for an Electro Voice RE-20 or a Shure SM7B. You're still going to get a much better, useable signal, than many of the other options available, but don't fool yourself into thinking you're going to be purchasing something that will have the same kind of clarity as the other mics mentioned above.<br/><br/>UPDATE - 04.18.22:<br/>AS great as they sound, the cable is lacking, which is why they made the cable replaceable, they knew this. Plan on paying $40USD as part of this items ownership deal.</span>
