<span>I really love these headphones. I’ve been wanting beats for years and I definitely think this was a good investment. I had tested them out with my friends and turned it up to the loudest setting and they said they could barely hear what I was listening to. The battery life is pretty long, I feel like they underestimate the battery life because mine last for hours on end. The sound quality is pretty good too, but at the same time I don’t really know the difference between other headphones. They also have good bass to them which I really like. Sometimes I put the headphones on just to drown out the noise around me and not even play music which also works pretty well. You can turn off the noise cancelation setting as well if you need to. You can skip, pause, turn volume up or down on the side of the headphones. They come with a cord so if the battery dies you could plug it into your phone/computer the only thing is you would need a dongle to connect it to your phone because it’s the old fashioned headphone jack. Other than that it’s amazing. It came in brand new packaging they weren’t used. I definitely recommend!!</span>

<span>My headphones broke earlier this week so I looked to see if there were any headphones that I would be interested in buying. I saw these and that they were on sale for $140. What a steal! I’ve been wanted a pair of these for a few years now but they are expensive. I’m happy my old pair broke so I could swipe these at an amazing deal. It came in it’s official box too. The sound is amazing and the ANC is great too! Get yourself a pair!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Update 9/17/2022: After I wrote the review I found that on Android there are EQ apps that will help tune headphones to help them sound better. I personally use Wavelet now and with that these do sound really good now and clear up some of my criticisms about the sound in the original review. That being said, I can't find anything similar for iOS, so keep that in mind!<br/><br/>I'll mention first that I didn't buy these headphones at full price, or anything close to it. At their original MSRP ($350) look elsewhere and don't look back, these get blown away by Sony and Bose and others at that price point. Once you get down to about $200 though? These start to look more tempting.<br/><br/>I already have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's which have amazing sound, but no ANC, so they're great for around the house, but I needed a pair with ANC for work travel, so I took a chance on the Beats on a sale, and at a sale price, I'm pretty happy with them.<br/><br/>The sound isn't bad, I know I've heard other people say there isn't a whole lot of bass. It does seem like that varies heavily from song to song, some give a nice, but never muddy, thump, others do feel a little lacking. Highs are pretty nice and crisp and come through well, it's the mids on these headphones that tend to be a bit muddled. It's by no means bad, but I'm also comparing it to some pretty good can headphones in roughly the same price range and the Audio Technica's win hands down there.<br/><br/>ANC is probably the best feature of the headphones. It does a great job of keeping out engine noise when flying. Sony and Bose will do better at the Beats original price point, but at a sale price they do a very good job. You will run into a few weird quirks of it, for example I could hear it fighting the noise of a rough road while on a rental car shuttle which made for an interesting effect, but largely it just works and keeps out the noise well.<br/><br/>Battery life seems to be pretty much what they're rated for, so no complaints there and the build quality seems solid. When using the controls, you will hear a clicking sound from the press, which I know some people have criticized. But, despite that, the controls are easy and intuitive. The look of them is pretty nice as well, but it would be nice if the ear cups to rotate to be flat on your chest, but that's a minor nitpick.<br/><br/>Finally, the great irony, these actually seem to work better on my personal Pixel phone than my work iPhone, despite being an Apple product. The Android Beats app allows for better control of the headphones and the ANC, not to mention actually giving you a battery percentage as opposed to just a circle that gives you an approximate value. And with the Beats app installed, the pairing process was just as easy on my Pixel as it was for my work phone.<br/><br/>Overall, they're solid headphones, but wait to catch them at the right price.</span>

<span>I had a pair of Sony headphones and they were okay, but the noise cancelling wasn't as good as I thought they should be.  I fly a lot and just want to drown out everyone around me and be able to listen to shows on my iPad.  Always wanted a pair of Beats, but the price was out of my budget.  However, when Amazon had they two day sale, the price on these dropped down a lot and I decided to give them a shot.<br/><br/>I recently had to travel for work and these were GREAT.  Noise-cancelling was beyond what I could hope for and volume was great as well.  These fit my needs perfectly!</span>

<span>I just bought my second pair of these headphones.  They still work great, but after 5+ years the synthetic leather on the ear cups is disintegrating, as is the "soft-touch" rubberized finish on the trim.<br/><br/>From the new photos, it looked like the chrome trim was now darker, or more of a matte finish.  It's exactly the same.<br/><br/>Also, the chart on this product info page says that these use a USB-C charging cable.  They do not.

<span>Straight to business, let's address the cons (kind of) or misconceptions about these headphones. Yes, there is real bass but if you're expecting the headphones to shake out of how much bass there actually is, don't. As you've probably noticed already the bass slider isn't really for the adjusting how much bass there is inside of the headphones, but basically adjusting the haptic motors (the stuff in controllers and whatnot that makes them vibrate) . Also, these headphones are actually on the quieter side of headphones so if you were looking for loud headphones, look elsewhere. The sensory bass doesn't always work with a lot of songs and actually murders some of them, acting as a very annoying vibrator when you have it turned on. Alright, now that all of the cons I could think of are out of the way, let's go on to the pros.<br/><br/>The build quality is good, doesn't feel like I could break them unless I actually wanted to. They fit very nicely on my head ( what with the rotating earcups and flexibility and all ) I still have to adjust them sometimes but I think that goes for all headphones.<br/><br/>The fact that these aren't that loud are actually fine, I wear these for long periods of time ( don't want that tinnitus ).<br/><br/>Even my gripe with the fact that these murder some songs when you have the bass slider turned up, is kind of canceled out with the fact that you can just adjust it or just straight up turn it off for songs it just doesn't work with.<br/><br/>I really like putting these on with lo-fi music, the haptic motors really give extra oomph to the kicks and since these aren't that (hot?) in terms of tuning, I feel like it's a fun and pleasant experience with this genre and has mainly been what I've been using it for.<br/><br/>5/5 not what I bought it for but all things considered I'll take it.</span>

<span>These headphones are pretty amazing, they have the best bass I have heard on headphones 10 out of 10! And if you are nerodivergent like me and love bass these headphones will not disappoint at all! All in all a great sensory experience for anyone that loves to feel the bass. The sound quality is really really good the bass doesn't distort the sound quality, they are built very nice and have some weight to them. They also come with built in Tile which comes in handy if you miss place things around the house, they come with a nice case that is plush on the inside and has pockets to hold the charging cable and AUX cable.</span>

<span>For years I've been searching for headphones with a lot of bass and a lot of volume. I've gone through so many web searches for headphones with both, and I'm always disappointed with what I get. Finally I've come to this set. Now first off, I like my music louder and I like more bass than most people, I think. For what that's worth. I find these headphones... loud enough for sort-of loud listening for long periods. I'd like them to be louder, but if they were, they wouldn't really be safe for long-term listening. So they're adequate from that point of view. Now the bass, is where these really shine. I never thought I'd find headphones that had TOO MUCH bass, but these headphones can get there. These headphones produce surprisingly solid and deep bass. I thought the vibration effect was going to be a gimmick that I would just turn off, but unlike other Skullcandy earphones, this effect works. Even with the bass adjustment slider at only 20%, music has a very full, solid bottom end. When I do some rap with a lot of bass, I can turn the slider up more, and although it's nowhere near as loud, it's similar to being in a car with good subwoofers, just surrounding you with bass. Listening to rock and heavy metal, the drums and bass are much more full and really gives the music some body. I really wish I could get another, like 3 db out of these headphones, but so far they're pretty usable for listening to music all day long while I'm working. And if you like bass, trust me, these headphones are the only game in town. Don't even bother with anything else, it'll be crap.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Quise hacer esta reseña comparándolo con el modelo Original, Crusher Wireless, ya que lo tengo desde hace 3 años y eran mis audífonos favoritos hasta ahora.<br/><br/>Comenzaré diciendo que escuchar música en unos audífonos como estos es más que solo el sonido y se vuelve una experiencia divertida. Cada cambio de canción es una sorpresa al ver como el bajo haptico convierte una buena canción en una rumba.<br/><br/>Me encanta la música y tengo varios audífonos de distintas clases, On ear, Over Ear, In Ear, de Conducción Osea, y Neckbands. He pasado por JBL S400BT, Samsung U Pro, 1 More Double driver ANC Pro, Aftershokz Trekz Air, Nura entre otros , pero además he podido probar Bosé QC35 y los Sony's WH-x1000M3.<br/><br/>Comparado con Sony y Bosé, estos audífonos son distintos pero de buena manera. Quizás no tengan la apertura, el brillo y la calidad de esos modelos, pero depende los géneros que escuches, puede llegar a ser una experiencia superior.<br/><br/>Cómo tuve unos Crusher Wireless OG quiero compararlos con esos, y la principal diferencia está en la manera en que manejan el bajo. Los Crusher Wireless suenan como si tuvieses un bajo dentro del baúl/cajuela del carro, con un sonido potente pero plano que se siente porque pone a vibrar todo el carro, pero es boomy y hay canciones donde la frecuencia de bajo no la coge y la música suena como si tuvieras en nivel de bajo apagado, a excepción de uno que otro momento. Hasta ahora pensé que eran los audífonos con mejor bajo que había podido probar seguidos de los Sony BT950XB y los JBL S400BT, pero después de escuchar el poder de los Crusher Evo, es otra dimensión.<br/><br/>Este bajo siente como bajo de Sub Woofer o de uno de los JBL Boombox, con bajos profundos que retumban y hacen que se multiplique el poder del bajo.<br/><br/>Para ponerlo en palabras onomatopeyicas, el bajo de los CW suena Boooooooooooooommm plano mientras que los CE suenan Booo wooo wooo wooo y sientes cuando el bajo haptico va hacia adelante y hacia atrás.<br/><br/>Con el nivel de bajo apagado, los audífonos son decentes, con una buena amplitud/soundstage y separación de instrumentos. Son brillantes, pero no tan brillantes como los CW, sino más bien un poco tibios, sin dejar de sonar muy bien en altos y medios.<br/><br/>La opción de usar la App es muy buena, porque permite personalizar el sonido de los audífonos según nuestra respuesta a una serie de sonidos que vamos descartando. Aparte, tiene modo para podcast y otro para películas y todos funcionan muy bien.<br/><br/>En la parte física, me gusta la calidad de los materiales; se sienten más premium que los CW, y mucho más robustos. El peso es similarz aunque la fuerza de la diadema esmayor en los CW, haciendo que estos sean mucho más cómodos. Pero aún así, requieren de una ajustada cada hora más o menos para evitar la fatiga de la oreja. (En mi caso, ya que soy de cara ancha)<br/><br/>De los CW originales extraño los botones, que son más grandes y de mejor diseño + o - en vez de 3 botones.<br/><br/>Probé también los Crusher ANC y suenan muy similar, pero el ANC no es tan bueno así que no vale la pena pagar de más.<br/><br/>+ El poder del bajo<br/>+ los materiales de construcción<br/>+ La horma de la diadema es más cerrada y sobresalen menos por los lados.<br/>+ Estos usan codecs SBC y AAC, por lo que funcionan bien para Apple y Android. (Aunque a mí me gusta más el sonido en SBC, porque tiene mayor ganancia y el bajo pega más duro.)<br/>+ Los colores en los que vienen<br/>+ El precio<br/>+ El material de los pads es muy bueno<br/>+ El sonido es muy bueno y el bajo no ahoga medios y altos.<br/>+ Mejor respuesta a frecuencias bajas.<br/><br/>- El aislamiento pasivo es mejor en los CW. Estos dejan que entrar mucho ruido externo a bajo volumen. Aunque apenas subes ya no escuchas nada más. 🤣<br/>- Sigue viniendo con un Pouch(estuche suave) que aunque es práctico si los llevas adentro del maletín, para colgarlos por fuera con una carabina es mejor un estuche rígido.<br/>- No se pueden conectar a 2 dispositivos al tiempo como los CW originales.<br/>- No se puede usar el Bajo Haptico con la conexión por cable cuando están descargados como en los CW.<br/><br/>+ O - No he podido probar, pero los CW traían un micrófono en el cable que permitía usarlos de manos libres con la conexión por cable, estos no traen micrófono en linea, pero por los plugs, parece que usan el micrófono de los mismos audífonos. Cuando pruebe, actualizo la reseña.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>Once I learned how to set up a Custom EQ (the Settings icon under the EQ) I've been very pleased. What I like is (my taste): boost the bass 2 dbs, attenuate the 400 Hz 2, boost the 1K 1 (this combo gives some punch to the bass), then I boost up the 2.5K 2, the 6.3K up 4, and the 16K up 6.

<span>Out of the box, the bass was set to +9 on a headphone made for bass.  So, I can see how some people might've been turned off by this headphone.  I listen to wide range of music but mostly EDM and this headphone is made for that genre.  But, you have to install the accompanying SONY headphone control app on your phone in order to configure the sound to your liking.  Otherwise, it's too heavy on the bass.  With the control, you turn up the bass when you want to and turn it down when you want something more relaxing.  Decent highs and mids.  Good overall headphone but it's not for you unless you prefer brain rattling bass like me.</span>

<span>UPDATE (7/23/18):  I've had these for about 3-4 days.  I wrote a glowing review based on my first day of use.  Although,  I'm afraid after a few hours of use I have to say these aren't worth the money and not something I would use or could use.  Here are a list of things I realized and found out after using them.<br/><br/>1.  They literally crush your head.  They are very tight.  My son who is 15 has a pair and I have a pair.  Both of us complained of getting headaches and almost nauseous due to how tight they are on your head.  I've heard of some saying that they loosen up over a period of use, but I'm not going to wait it out.  They. are. tight.<br/><br/>2.  NO MID RANGE.  High's are highs and lows are lows... but no mid.  I tested the headphones with my PS4 playing Ghost Recon Wildlands and Far Cry 5 and the guns sound flat.  Yes, the bass is punching you in the head but that's about all you hear and feel.  I thought maybe I was crazy so I pulled out my Cloud 2's and switched back and forth for about 30 minutes.  I shot guns, threw grenades, tested the scope of sound (hearing ambient effects around you) and honestly, the Cloud 2's in my opinion kill these.  The Cloud 2's don't have the thunderous bass that the Crushers do but they have a awesome mid range where you can feel and hear the gun shot, grenade explosions, etc.  This only was one of the major reason's I couldn't keep the Crushers.  I cannot recommend these for gaming.  Especially for long sessions.<br/><br/>3.  I can't pair them with my TV, PS4, XBOX One.  Yes I hear you can get a dongle to assist in pairing the Crushers but I don't want to go that route.  I did use the wire that comes with the Crushers but there's a difference in sound between wired and bluetooth.<br/><br/>4.  Music sounds great .... For awhile.  I missed that mid-range and true bass.  These do not have true bass.  The bass is like listening to someone having a party behind a cement wall.  There's just something off about it.  You can only handle so much.<br/><br/>5.  HERE's the one where I can honestly say the Crushers kick butt.  Pairing these with your iPad or iPhone and watching a action flick on Netflix.  Tested it with Star Wars and the explosions and dialogue sounded great.  Although, I did plug them into my PS4 controller via the wire that comes with it and tried watching Netflix and there seemed to be a loss in quality of sound.  Switched back to bluetooth through my iPad and boom sound was thunderous and movies haven't sounded better.  Like sitting in a IMAX theater.<br/><br/>6.  All in all, we returned the Crushers.  For the money, I'd rather save some more cash and get some Astros with an AMP or use my Cloud 2's and hook them up through a small receiver which is also connected to my PS4 and turn those bad boys up and get all the bass I need but with Mid's and Highs.<br/><br/>I just can't recommend these.  I think the reviews are like myself... blown away the first few hours but then reality sinks in and you kind of realize what your dealing with.  It's sort of a gimmick and you can get better headphones with a less bass and still be quite happy.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/>I did a week's worth of research looking all over the internet for anyone really going into detail on whether the Crushers were a good gaming headset.  Well, now that I have them, I can safely say...  OH YEAH!  So here's a quick backstory...  I have been on the search for a pair of headphones that would allow me to feel the explosions, feel the bones crunching.  I have tried the Playstation Golds, Clouds, Astros, Sans, Sonys and none of them really had a deep pounding bass.  Don't get me wrong, all of them are great headphones.  I specifically bought the Cloud II's because to me for the price they had the best balance of sound and bass.  Saying that,  my son came running out of Best Buy and told me I had to try the Crushers.  Honestly, I laughed at him.  NO way.  I'll never buy Skull Candy or Beats.  Not for gaming.  I went anyway and holy crap did they rattle your head.  BUT, I still questioned whether they would produce good mid's and high's and would the bass actually sound good while gaming on my PS4.  So, my son ordered a pair on Amazon and they showed up today (7/19).  We plugged them into the PS4 and fired up Mad Max which has some awesome explosions and the cars rumble hard....  OH Man was it like nothing I've heard in a headphone.  The shotgun was deep and powerful.... The cars rumbled.  I mean rumbled.  Not a distorted bass but clean deep overpowering rumble.  Just awesome.<br/><br/>So, after trying them and testing them...  A few things popped out...<br/><br/>1.  The bass is truly something else.  Powerful.  I actually turned it all the way down to around 10% and it was just as good.  So imagine at 10% what it would feel like at 75%... It's nuts.<br/><br/>2.  The PS4 has always had a issue with not really allowing headphones to really go 'LOUD'.  It's like it limits the volume to a certain extent and then stops.  You can't go louder.  Same scenario with the crushers.  I was loud but not as loud as I would like it.  I compared them to our cloud II's and same situation.  We are aware they are bluetooth but still trying to figure out how to connect them to the PS4.  I'm sure that would fix the volume issue.  So because of this... the mid's and high's weren't incredibly loud but completely doable.<br/><br/>3.  Sound bleed was honestly very quiet.  My son had them cranked and I could not hear them.  Not bad.  So my wife won't get irritated while watching a movie on my iPad right next to her.<br/><br/>4.  THINK IMAX SOUND in your ears while watching an action movie.  No joke, explosions and someone getting a kick in the face is felt.  John Wick and Equalizer is awesome with the crushers.<br/><br/>Bottom line.  Well made, great sound, amazing bass like nothing I've heard.  For movies and games, no brainer in my book.  For music, even better.  BUT, keep in mind, it's not a true bass so for bass heads... these are awesome but for music purists...  I'd try something else.<br/><br/>Gaming with these is just awesome.  Experience it.</span>

When we brought the legendary ATH-M50x studio sound into the world of personal wireless audio, we created what are, simply, the best-sounding wireless headphones on the market. But we weren’t content to stop there. Introducing the ATH-M50xBT2, the second generation of our critically acclaimed M-Series wireless over-ear headphones, featuring a number of enhancements to improve performance and usability. But don’t worry – we’ve changed nothing about the critically acclaimed sonic signature. The M50xBT2 delivers the same exhilarating wireless listening experience as its predecessor, offering exceptional clarity and deep, accurate bass response. There’s even the option to adjust the headphone’s EQ settings, if you so choose – make the changes in the A-T Connect app and save directly to the headphones. In addition, we have greatly improved vocal pickup, incorporating beamforming microphone technology for clearer phone calls and communication with the built-in Amazon Alexa voice assistant. We’ve also added multipoint pairing to let you connect wirelessly to two devices at once. An updated USB-C connection, a low latency mode, and compatibility with high-quality audio codecs round out the enhancements.

<span>So far, fairly pleased with the ATH-M50xBT2 headphones. Been an audio technical guy my whole life and it’s what you’d expect, a wireless pair of any standard ATH pair. I will say I’m not a huge fan of all of the bells and whistles like Siri functionality, but Bluetooth connectivity is solid and sounds nice. Wish the battery was a little bit beefier, I do find myself recharging them maybe once a day after a lot of listening.</span>

<span>These are definitely the best headphones I’ve ever owned. Let me start by saying the sound is phenomenal. The bass, midrange, and highs are well balanced. I was so delighted to find that the AT- app allows you to adjust between various equalized settings which best suits your listening preference. That speaks volumes for headphones that cost around $200. These headphones are very durable, feel great over the ears, and look very good too. I own the first generation too but I bought these because they’re Bluetooth accessible. The volume isn’t as loud as my first generation but that’s ok with me because I don’t want to hurt my ears or go deaf. I highly recommend these headphones for the quality and value. You won’t be disappointed with these amazing headphones.</span>

<span>Incredible drivers. Crystal clear everything. I use them wired to my laptop most of the time, which is a far better listening experience over the weak bluetooth tech. The wired sound is so much more powerful.<br/><br/>The bluetooth is buggy. It supports two connected devices but even if one of the devices thinks about playing something the other device will not switch over. I have to press play on whatever device and then stop, then close the app and then just maybe the second device will play something. A few times it completely stopped responding on a full battery and I couldn't turn it off or on.<br/><br/>Another thing that is really confusing are the next and previous buttons. I still have no idea if I'm raising the volume or going to the next song. I don't think I've actually skipped a song on these because I just don't know how.<br/><br/>For this type of industry standard studio headset the bluetooth is a waste of money. Bottom line, amazing sounds, weak, weird bluetooth.</span>

<span>I use these for teleconferences, so it is important I can hear the details. The high quality sound is improved by the effective noice cancellation. My cohort and clients have never mentioned I sound “tinny” or “far away” as they have with other headsets. They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and I can get 3-5 days of work out between recharges. Highly recommend, especially for the price point.</span>

<span>I’m all about that headphone life and these are lovely for me, great noise canceling, great battery life, pretty decent bass and sound! Super comfy to wear and don’t slide off my head. Love these and I’ve owned a lot of headphones!</span>
