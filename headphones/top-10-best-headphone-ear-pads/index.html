<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>My husband travels a lot and loves his Bose headset. He lost his case and the ear cushions had seen better days. I couldn't find a Bose replacement case so went with generic but opted for OEM for the cushions. The new cushions feel great and work perfect. My only complaint is that they are kind of a pain to install. I had to used my nails to get them under the clips and wrecked my nail. A tool would help for install.</span>

<span>Great fit, made well. Works great at noise canceling and comfortable. A little pricy but I think worth it. Not too hard to put on. Just take your time and have something you can pry on clips. Not to bad to put on.</span>

<span>Perfect replacement for my original bose QC headphones. After years and years of daily use my QCs started to get soft and seperate at the seam so i picked these up and my headphones felt new again. Easy to install and replace and theyre top quality replacements</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>they are definitly difficult to put on, i used the blunt end of a key to push the ring under the tabs and that was easier than my fingers, i felt like i was gonna tear the seams using my fingers. Once they are on my headphones are back to good as new. I have the qc35 and qc 35 IIs and they sound amazing so i dont want to "upgrade" just because my earpads fell apart cause i sometimes fall asleep with them on. These brought new life to my units.</span>

<span>After several years of daily usage the foam covers got ragged, so I ordered the card with several pairs.  (I have both versions of the CS-00,  the USB and dual 3.5mm plugs in my office.)  I tried hooking the lip on the foam over the rim of the black disk and working around the perimeter, holding what was in place and gently stretching as I went around.  It was sort of like trying to put a tire on a rim.  It kept coming off.  Then I decided to pull the black disk off the ear cup.  It is held into place via 3 prongs.  Once that was done I could see the little pin points around the inner side of the disk.  Holding the foam onto them kept the cuff in place and with a bit of stretching it fit just fine.  Align the three large prongs on the inner surface  and snap them in place one at a time, and you are all done.</span>

<span>I love my SONY MDR-7506 that I got back in March 2018, and I use the headphones very regularly. I was so happy to find these replacement ear cushions after my first pair started wearing out in June 2022. Those who cycled through headphones know how that can be an unpleasant experience with ear-cushion material quickly falling off in bits, once the lifetime is up. I did not want to buy the generic ear-cushions because I enjoyed how the SONY ones felt. I was pleasantly surprised to find these on Amazon and ordered them instantly. They were delivered the next day and they look identical in shape and quality. Glad I bought these and now my best pair of headphones look good as new!</span>

<span>As some is the other reviews have said, these are really hard to install. The old pads were falling to pieces so they were easy to get off, but the new pads barely stretch over the rims. I was worried they would rip, but they didn't. The issue is that they are so tight that you get part of it on, then you pull the next part over and it pops off at the other end. Eventually I got them on.<br/><br/>I know these are genuine, but they definitely changed the sound on my ATH M50s. The bass is much more pronounced, and the mids and highs not as prominent. It's possible that the sound of my old ones had just changed over time as the material broke down and the drivers for closer to my ears. The sound isn't necessarily bad, just different to what I was accustomed to.</span>

<span>Sennheiser headphones are well known for their quality and durability. However, the ear pads will deteriorate over time, which will affect sound quality and comfort. Replacing the ear pads as needed is well worth it. The genuine Sennheiser replacement pads are quite expensive considering that they're two foam rings, but if you've shelled out for a nice pair of headphones in the first place, these are still well worth it.</span>

<span>I bought these to replace my 558's increasingly older and flatter pads. I didn't want to go aftermarket because I like how these sound and didn't want some ridiculous change. Plus, I like foam more than leather for my Sennheisers because of breathability. Anyway, on to the pros and cons<br/><br/>1. Actual, genuine replacements for the 558 series. They snapped right on, look identical, and feel identical to the ones I replaced (minus the 2+ years of wear and tear, of course).<br/>2. Also fits 598, 559, 579, 599, etc. They all use the same pads as long as you don't mind black instead of gray or brown.<br/>3. Easy to install. Just pop the old ones off and pop these on. There is an indicator dot on the inside of the pad. Attach the pad with the indicator on the outside of the headphone (line it up with the L and R printed on the outside of the ear cup) and they'll snap right in.<br/>4. Made my 558s feel brand new.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>1. $35+ for a set of foam pads is a little much even if they are genuine OEM parts.<br/>2. Availability is a bit of a problem. These seem to only appear in batches a couple of times a year.<br/><br/>I'd like to buy a couple of them and just have them hanging around for the "dry season" when Sennheiser isn't selling these, but at $35 per pair of pads, that's not economically viable. Still, I pick a pair up when I see them available and my old pads start looking really beat up. I've had my 558s for 6 or so years now and it's nice that I'll get at least another 18-24 months out of them. The only other con I have is Senneheiser doesn't use the same Amazon sell page for these so once these are sold out, you may have to look for a different listing to see if they're in stock.<br/><br/>A bit of advice for my fellow Senny owners. The new pads are gonna feel a lot less plush than your replacements at first. Mostly because it's been so long since you (and I, I did this too) experienced the pads brand new that we've all kinda forgotten how much stiffer they were out of the box. It usually takes 2-3 weeks for mine to "soften up" a bit and feel like the originals did.</span>

<span>I've owned my 558s for 5 years, the pads were completely worn. By worn I mean completely destroyed. 5 years of sweaty chad gaming and heavy metal required a replacement. These make my old set feel brand new.<br/><br/>I ordered these pads and also ordered a set of 569s so I could alternate between closed back and open back. Unfortunately I was sent 599s but I can't complain since I basically got the 599s for the price of 569s. Why is this relevant? Well the old 558s, new 598, and new 599 headphones all have the same ear pads right out of the box. Plopped these replacements on my old 558s and they feel the same as my new 599s minus the part where my 558s are a bit stretched and don't grip my head like they used to.</span>

<span>This padding set works very well for bringing old headphones back to life. I have had my headphones for over 7 years now. To say the padding was worn was an understatement; there was nothing holding the padding on anymore and all of the black covering had worn off both the headband and the ear padding. This set brought my headphones back to perfect working order for less price than a new set.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-OEM high quality<br/>-Comfortable and rejuvenates old worn headphones<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Price<br/>-Could be difficult to install if you have a weaker grip or large fingers<br/><br/>Install: It wasn't too bad, just make sure to stretch the headphones and headband out some before you attempt to put them on. One of the ear pads went on very easily then I fumbled for a minute or two with the other one. This isn't the first time I've put the headband on so I've had a little experience with that. It wasn't too bad you just need to start the ziplok style clips together on one side and then slowly slide the rest of the connection together. The biggest issue you may run into is that it takes a decent amount of finger/grip strength to get the padding on and those with larger fingers will notice more difficulty starting the headband. Sennheiser Top 50 on Youtube has a good video of how to replace the ear pads called "How to replace ear cushions on a Sennheiser HD 280 headphone"<br/><br/>Overall this is a good padding set to renew your worn headphones, they are high quality however the cost seems a  little extreme (considering it's almost 40% of the cost of a new set of HD280 PRO), thus the removal of 1 star. If you choose to go with these you will be surprised how much it improves your worn out headphones, mine feel brand new now!</span>

<span>First off - these are HARD to install. It took me an hour to get all 3 pieces on. But holy crap, it's amazing now! If you're one to get frustrated easily or try to install these like an ape, then DON'T buy them! But for the rest... I didn't realize how bad my old ones had gotten, I was just replacing because they were starting to crack and shed. The sound quality is SO much better than it was previously and I'm not just saying that because they're new - it genuinely sounds better. The bass is so much more "alive" now rather than just feeling like low noise, it's now vibrating as it should.<br/><br/>These are awesome but very difficult to install. Be warned.</span>

<span>Being the genuine replacements I had high hopes for these.  For the most part, they delivered.  They fit nice and make the headphones like new.  Installing them was a bugger.  This was to be expected though because it's supposed to have a perfect fit.  As suggested in some reviews, you might have to resort to using heat to loosen up the ear cups to get them on which is what I had to do.  Just use a hair dryer for a minute or so on medium to make the rubber more flexible and it should do the trick.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the original head pad was one solid strip as opposed to two separate cushions.  I don't know if there was a reason they changed this but I found it to be a slightly noticeable difference in comfort, however, not enough to refrain from recommending this product.  I would purchase them again.</span>

<span>These are great. I sleep with an earbud in my downward ear, and in the summer, I used to have to put a piece of paper towel on the end of the earbud to keep our moisture and prevent salt buildup from blocking the speaker vents. This wasn't ideal because the earbud and paper towel fragment would slip out with the slightest movement. These provide the same protection and also have the added benefit of helping the earbud stay in the ear with minimal effect to the sound. That's great!<br/><br/>The downsides are that they are a little tricky to get on, and they are a bit thinner than I'd like. These things could be necessary for them to function correctly, so I wouldn't consider these quality issues as much as attention to details. A thicker foam could effect the fit and sound, and it's probably good that they  have a small opening so that they stay on longer. I'm just letting buyers know what to expect.<br/><br/>They do fall off sometimes, but are very inexpensive. Still, I hate to waste, so I experimented with cleaning and reusing them. Surprisingly, they held up and are reusable! I know not many people would bother for a few cents, but, for me, it's primarily about not putting more foam in the trash.<br/><br/>I'll buy again, but these are going to last quite a while. Pleased.</span>

<span>I have a pair of Sony MH410C earbud headphones with a diameter of about 17mm.<br/>They fit perfectly (even if the listing says it's for Apple-made headset)!<br/><br/>The best part is the higher quality foam. Usually, the foam for these types of product tends to tear easily when you're trying to wrap it around the earbuds with your nails. That's not the case. The foam is more resistant than the ones I purchased in the past, which is indicative of higher quality material. On my first try, it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>Installation tip: I use a pair of baby scissors (the small ones with rounded edge) to enlarge the hole by introducing the tip in the hole and then spreading the scissor legs. While keeping that hole open, I find it's much easier that way to introduce a part of the earbud in the hole. It's a bit tricky at first, but you'll get the hang of it. Once a part of the earbud is partly covered, then it's relatively easy to get the rest of it to fit inside. The trick is to enlarge the hole big enough without tearing the cover.</span>

<span>A must for worn pads. Only buy sennheiser brand to keep it's " house" sound the same. Was somewhat of a pain to install. Kept snapping out as i was trying to get pads into the grooves. Remember to cup your hands around the yokes not putting pressure on the mesh screens.</span>

<span>I appreciated reviews describing installing these in the Sennheiser headphones (I have the HD600). But it still wasn't intuitive - I'll add my description here and hope it helps.<br/><br/>BTW:  I always get the original Sennheiser replacement earpads - these do affect sound quality (ensuring distance between ear/driver, quality of cushion, etc.) so after market brands - well I don't want to chance degrading the sound I paid for with premium headphones. I use after market headband replacement pads, as they are less integral to the sound quality.<br/><br/>To install:<br/><br/>first remove old pads:</span>

<span>They fit great and appear to be as good as original. Nice improvement over worn out pads, should have R/R sooner. A bit pricy but worth it.</span>

<span>No after market part quite does Sennheiser's compatible line of headphones justice.  If you have these headphones you really ought to have the real ear pads.  Without them the fit and sound just won't be right.You really need the real thing<br/><br/>It's a bitter pill to swallow - however - that these parts which likely only cost a dollar or two to manufacture are sold for $60.  Sennheiser deserves to make money, but markups like these are plain abusive.</span>
