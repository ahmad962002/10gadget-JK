<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I only just received these, but thought I'd give my first impression. I purchased headphones because I figured it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than in-ear type. I chose this model because they were on sale, seemed to be a diamond in the rough, and reviews indicated it would be good for large heads(I wear an XL hat size).<br/><br/>The build is average. They don't feel flimsy in my hands, but you can see the plastic parts are nothing special, strength-wise. The padding for the headband is a little uneven on the seam, as you open up the headband to put the unit on your head, it sort of looks warped. The 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone. The headphones can both swivel 90 degrees forward, maybe 35 degrees back, and 90 degrees downward. The swivel joint above the ear pieces allow them to fold upward into the headband.<br/><br/>I listened to about 45 minutes of music straight to start, and was pretty pleased. I'm not especially particular, but do like good sound. There's some good bass, classical music was clear. The headphones did make me realize I had low quality recordings for a few of my songs that I tried out(listening to the HD equivalent on YouTube cleared up problems I heard). I wasn't totally blown away, either. I do hear a little noise when they're plugged into my computer and nothing is playing, though not so for my iPod(so I'm not sure if this can be blamed on the headphones).<br/><br/>They are comfortable, but not as comfortable as I'd like. I do feel some pushing against my ears, the round ear pads aren't big enough to fit my whole ear. They do get warmer than I'd like. I definitely feel relieved to have them off. I think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour. I was a little hesitant to get over-ear headphones in fear of this, and unfortunately it did turn out to be a problem.<br/><br/>Who knows, maybe they'll wear in and improve. I'll update this review if I have more to report. For now, I'd say they're worth the cost, even if they aren't a shining diamond in the rough. If I could give about 3.5 stars I would; but for now, I'll give 3. They are accurately priced, and overall a typical quality product. Some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons.<br/><br/>Update 7/19:<br/>I've been stretching out the headphones on a box for a couple days, it's helped a bit. What's funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge! It's comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches...but the pushing against your head is the tight part. If you adjust them larger, they just fall below your ears, rather than loosen up.<br/><br/>Also, I compared them to the Sennheiser HD201. The TASCAMs have better sound, but the Sennheiser is more comfortable(they're lighter and the ear cups are oval shaped and fit better).<br/><br/>Update 7/23:<br/>I think the box stretching has been helping, I'm able to wear them for about 2 hours now before I notice them getting uncomfortable. Still a relatively short amount of time.<br/><br/>Update 8/9/2013:<br/>The headphones have been living on a box just wider than my head anytime they aren't in use. The comfort is marginally improving, I'm guessing due to the stretching out, my head/ears getting used to the pressure, and me learning ways to sort of adjust them periodically to shift the pressure. However, I think my rating will remain at 3 stars. The sound is good enough to give it a couple stars, and the price low enough for one more. However, a month should be long enough for the phones to break-in to a standard usable degree, and that hasn't happened to my satisfaction.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: I would suggest you find a different pair if you have an exceptionally big head(mine is about 24"/61cm circumference, or US hat size 7 and 5/8). The clamping definitely leads to discomfort, the round ear pads don't quite do the trick, and it makes your head pretty warm. It's not unbearable, but if you can find an alternative it's probably best. That being said, note that I have only reduced stars for the fit!! I can't speak for someone with a bit smaller of a head(and ears?)...if these fit comfortably, which I imagine they would for many people, they are a 5 star product! Great sounding, sturdy enough build, etc.<br/><br/>Update 11/14/13:<br/>A friend of mine picked up a pair of Audio-Technica M50s around the same time I bought this pair, and I was able to try them out and compare for a good half hour today. I'm not very experienced with sound quality, but I felt that the M50s were definitely the winner. The most obvious difference was the added volume, but generally the sound was more pleasing to my ears. The bass seemed more supported, higher notes felt smoother and less static-like, etc. Besides the volume, these differences weren't huge. I had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them. The point of this update is just to say that you aren't getting $150 headphones for $30 with the TASCAMs. You are getting very good headphones, the sound of which should more than satisfy most people. I think you're pursuing diminishing returns in sound quality alone to pay much more than this for headphones(in this case, you'd pay 5X more for the M50s...but I don't think you're getting 5X the sound quality). The M50s are significantly more comfortable(though they do make your ears warmer), and the build feels better(stronger, smoother adjustments, prettier, etc.). All these things combined, and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable.</span>

<span>These headphones have been given lots of praise in reviews for the price-to-performance ratio, and they are certainly amazing for $20. If you have a tendency to break headphones, or you want something cheap that can be easily replaced, these are for you. However, their sound isn't going to blow your mind. They sound very average. When people say headphones like Beats sound like $20 headphones, these are the headphones they are talking about. From my memory, they compete at about the same level - or maybe a little better.<br/><br/>The headphones have a low impedance, which means they can be used with phones or other devices easily. Many people criticize the long 9.8 foot cable, but it's not a huge deal in my opinion. Because it ends in 3.5mm, it's easy to stuff in your pocket, as opposed to some non-detachable cables that end in 6.35mm. The build quality is okay, I don't care for the swiveling ear cups or folding design. The headband is thin, although soft enough. Sometimes one of the drivers won't make any sound, but it comes back if you tap it. I saw another review talk about how one ear stopped working, this is probably why, you just have to treat it like $20 headphones and give it a good thump. The clamp between the two phones is very strong, giving me a headache after 30 minutes. I find I can use these while completely upside down, and they will not fall off. This can be looked at as a good thing, however. It was a joy using these while mowing the lawn, they also kept my ears warm during the cold weather.<br/><br/>The ear-pads aren't great. They're hard, and very shallow, which negatively impacts the sound. If you decide to get this pair, be sure to buy some replacements, such as ones with memory foam. TEAC skimped out on everything with this headphone except for the sound in order to make it the price that it is. Keep in mind it is now a $30 or $45 headphone with that included. The photo I have is of the headphones with some pads from AliExpress.<br/><br/>These headphones will not make your music more enjoyable. They will not make certain genres much more interesting and embark you on a musical journey like open headphones might. Really, they don't even sound that good without an equalizer. If you are looking purely at price-to-performance ratio, I would actually recommend the </span>

<span> for a little over $10. They are both IEMs, in-ear monitors, which do not have all the benefits of headphones, but their sound quality is about the same, maybe a little better. For the intended purpose of a studio monitor with a relatively flat sound signature, these will do the job, but I cannot recommend them. There are many closed headphones that are qualified for professional use, and there is a reason some cost a few hundred dollars. Apparently, the Shure SRH440 and SRH840 both fulfill this niche of inexpensive monitors much better, although I cannot personally compare them. I have seen the SRH440s go as low as $30 on eBay before, making them a better deal by far.<br/><br/>If you are curious how these sound, based on what people have said, it wouldn't hurt to order them. They are also modifiable, some people said they sound better with the back opened, others have inserted certain materials to shape the sound. Equalizers help, but they are not end-all solutions. While the TH-02's compete with some headphones 5 times the price, ones generally considered overpriced, you can find even higher quality headphones for sale that will blow these out of the water. Don't set up an expectation of amazing sound with these or you will be disappointed. If you have a low budget and have only heard earbud quality though, these are a great choice.</span>

<span>I was recently in need of closed headphones and curious about what the market offers. I thought I might share my findings with someone in a similar situation. The Tascam TH-02 turns out to be an excellent value among the eight headphone models that I have compared. Below is my review of these headphones.<br/><br/>I am a speaker builder with measurement equipment, so I know what is neutral and undistorted sound. Unlike speaker systems, most headphones have no crossover or frequency response correction circuit. So, it is critical to be able to know how much such uneven responses affect perception of their sound with respect to accuracy and neutrality. I have good sense of it since I have been measuring sound. But I do not have proper equipment for headphone measurement, mostly importantly a dummy torso/head, nor am I willing to invest time in making a DIY setup. This is the reason why my search and audition have been limited to headphones for which measurement data exist, with some exceptions (see below). I made use of three different sources for the data: InnerFidelity.com, Headphone.com, and en.GoldenEars.net. While there is consistency within each site's measurements, there is also inconsistency between them, due to different measurement conditions and compensation methods. So, I researched and took those into account.<br/><br/>One may say we can use EQ to remedy irregular frequency responses. But EQ has its own limitations. Some minor EQ'ing can help, but headphones that need too extensive correction should be avoided. The foremost reason is the loss of dynamic range. Theoretically, with EQ you can only limit, not increase, dynamic range in a certain frequency band. On the source side, you lose digital bit depth, and on the headphone side, you suppress the driver's efficient response range.<br/><br/>Below is the list of headphones that I have auditioned (in the order of their street prices):<br/><br/>- Tascam TH-02 ($30; no data available)<br/>- Panasonic RP-HTF600-S ($32; semi-open headphones)<br/>- Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 ($35; no data available)<br/>- Tascam TH-2000 ($50; no data available)<br/>- AKG K518LE ($50)<br/>- Sennheiser HD429 ($65)<br/>- Creative Aurvana Live! ($70)<br/>- KRK KNS6400 ($85)<br/>- Shure SRH440 ($90)<br/><br/>My DIY speaker system (it measures very flat) served as a reference with respect to tonal balance. I also own some open headphones like Sony MDR-MA900 and Sennheiser PX100, which also provided a baseline when I evaluated tonal balance of the headphones under comparison. I used a desktop headphone amp that has flat FR and reasonably low output impedance.<br/><br/>I will give short, summarized impressions for one by one.<br/><br/>Tascam TH-02 (no measurement data available)<br/>This is a really nice surprise. There is a little hump in the bass and midbass regions, and some wide, shallow dip in upper mids and lower treble (i.e., slightly polite presentation). Otherwise, these are relatively accurate headphones at a fraction ($30) of cost of headphones of comparable quality. Construction is good for the price. The pad size is between over-ear and on-ear, but comfortable enough.<br/><br/>Panasonic RP-HTF600-S (semi-open headphones)<br/>Warm tone, deep bass. Treble is there, but upper mids and lower treble are lacking. Comfortable to wear. A good value, but not great for those looking for reasonably accurate sound.<br/><br/>Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 (no data available)<br/>Mid/upper bass ruins the sound which has otherwise good midrange-treble balance. Very uncomfortable to wear due to non-swivel cups.<br/><br/>Tascam TH-2000 (no data available)<br/>Simply inferior to its younger brother TH02. Very dull and muddy presentation. The model uses the same ear cups as TH02 but contains different drive units. The driver may have better components but execution must be bad. Not worth the asking price.<br/><br/>AKG K518LE<br/>You need to remove the thick foam pad at the driver's front (easily removable) to have better bass-to-mids balance. Even the pad removed, the phones still have bass-oriented sound, but not bad. Mids to treble balance is good. Somewhat similar sound signature to Tascam TH-02's. But the TH-02 sounds a little more natural. The headband can be too small for some people. The clamping force is a bit above a comfortable level.<br/><br/>Sennheiser HD429<br/>Anothter pair of headphones with bass emphasis. Not overly bassy, though. But a bigger problem is treble, which is a little too polite to be neutral. I would not consider these headphones a good value.<br/><br/>Creative Aurvana Live!<br/>Smooth and warm tone. Bass is somewhat loose at times. Treble has sparkles and at the same time sounds smooth. But relative to bass and treble, upper mids and lower treble are somewhat recessed, making the headphones' sound colored. Some people may feel them musical and full, but I prefer the Tascam TH02 at a lower price. The appearance is very good, though, with some feel of high quality. Very comfortable to wear with memory foam pads.<br/><br/>KRK KNS6400<br/>It has much more neutral sound than the headphones described above. Mid- and upper bass is somewhat lacking, and treble is a little overly presented. Good monitor-type sound. But there is one problem with these headphones. They are not very efficient, which means their usability is limited---you need a desktop headphone amp or a high-current capable portable amp to make them sound good. A little too bright treble is a weakness, too.<br/><br/>Shure SRH440<br/>Without doubt, these are the best of the bunch. In terms of clarity, they are in a different league---perhaps, the KNS6400 is close but also with weaknesses (see above). Treble is sometimes a little on the bright side, but not as bright as the KNS6400's. Some people may find them bright with bright recordings, but the headphones should not be blamed for that. These produce very neutral and accurate sound. Bass is sufficient and often pleasantly strong in the mid- and upper bass regions, but deeper bass is not covered by these cans. Most music recordings do not contain this deep bass, anyway.<br/><br/>I summarize my findings with the following top two picks:<br/><br/>1. Shure SRH440: These are the headphones you can safely choose under $100 if what you are looking for is accurate, neutral sound.<br/><br/>2. Tascam TH-02: This is a secret gem. At $30, you get really good closed cans. Its overall presentation is not as clear as the SRH440's, but with their price factored in, you cannot complain. They are definitely in the same league as the AKG K518LE (foam pads removed) and the Creative Aurvana Live. It may depend on personal preference, but among the three, my pick is the Tascam. The Creative has a better look and feel, but I'd choose the Tascam for its sound.<br/><br/>Another headphone model I wanted to include in my search was the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro ($90-$100), but after I listened to the Shure SRH440, I decided not to. According to HeadRoom's measurements and many people's common impressions, the HD 280 Pro has a little subdued treble compared to the SRH440 which has great mids to treble balance when compared to my reference speakers. The Sennheiser covers the lowest octave much better than the Shure, but that is not my priority.<br/><br/>I also considered the Koss ProDJ100 because of good reviews, but ruled them out because of their measurements. Their response might be flat in fundamental tones from most instruments but not with harmonics due to a large dip around 5-6kHz. Some people may think they sound good, but there is no way for them to sound accurate and natural by my standard.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>I think the following info may be useful for your purchase decision:<br/><br/>They do sound "like" $100 phones. But IMO they are not truly comparable to those headphones. You will notice slightly less clean bass/lower mids, slightly weak lower treble, and somewhat strong treble (which you already did). Note I used the word "slightly." They are kind of moderately well balanced. I can confidently say that they are comparable to any good, major-brand headphones retailing at $50 - $80 (e.g., AKG K518LE, Creative Aurvana Live, Senheiser HD 429, etc), basically telling that they can compete with things costing double their price.<br/><br/>By the way, if you can play with a good EQ software like Electi-Q or Rockbox built-in EQ, you will be able to obtain better tonal balance by slightly increasing the upper mids / lower treble (from 1.5 to 5 kHz) by about 4.0 dB and lowering the treble from 8 to 10 kHz by about 3 dB.<br/><br/>Here is the EQ setting I use:<br/><br/>Filter 1<br/>Center Freq: 3000 Hz<br/>Gain: 4.0 dB<br/>Bandwidth (BW): 2.5<br/><br/>Filter 2<br/>Center Freq: 9000 Hz<br/>Gain: -2.5 dB<br/>Bandwidth (BW): 1.0<br/><br/>You will hear much better tonal balance. If you feel the treble still a bit too much (it sounds fine to me), you may adjust the gain of Filter 2 (e.g., -3 to -5 dB).</span>

<span>I bought these for an oddly specific reason, I needed a headphone with a flat side so I could attach a head tracking unit to for gaming. I have a collection of headphones already, but none were suitable (or I was unwilling) to slap some velcro on them. I've heard good things about these in the past, and they were the right price.<br/><br/>Like most budget headphones (and even some more expensive ones), the pads are hot garbage. They're thin, have no real padding, they don't seal, and they're on-ears which can be remarkably painful if you have certain ear piercings, or just sensitive ears. Change the pads. I already have several aftermarket sets, so I found a velour pair that fit them. They're slightly too big, but they were my smallest set. I've ordered another set that should fit better.<br/><br/>They do clamp quite a bit. I'm a bigger guy, 6'4" and around 275, so I have a decent sized noggin. Since they're plastic, they should break in over time. If not, I'll put them around something to stretch them out. The clamping force is definitely noticeable, but so far, after wearing them for several hours at a time, it hasn't gotten to the point where I feel like I have to take them off.<br/><br/>Sound isolation is great. I've been using mostly open and semi open back headphones for a while now, and it caught me off guard how much these shut out. They're almost as good as putting ear plugs in.<br/><br/>The sound is good. Really good. I have a fairly sizeable collection of incredible budget headphones from brands like Koss, Superlux, Samson, Fostex, Monoprice, AKG, Philips and more. What really surprised me about these is how clear they are. They bring out things that I haven't heard out of my other headphones, and they make everything sound good. Some headphones are very clinical, if your source is bad, they sound bad. These are a headphone that make everything sound good. High quality FLAC? Sounds good. Old 128hz MP3s that you've had for 20 years? Sounds good. YouTube's crappy compression? Sounds good. It's odd to have a headphone that's as detailed as these, yet still makes everything sound good. Usually there's a compromise between the two.<br/><br/>I'm very sensitive to highs, and I was worried that these would be unusable for me, as most "flat", monitoring, or detailed headphones grate on my ears. I'm happy to say that the highs with these are pretty relaxed and easy to listen to. Sibilance is something I simply can't tolerate, it's the one thing that will make me rip off a set of headphones immediately. Songs like Marilyn Manson's If I was Your Vampire can be torture on some headphones. With these, it's fine.<br/><br/>Mid range is present and very full, though I've found vocals can be recessed sometimes. I don't know if it's due to the recording or maybe the pads I'm using, but I'll see if it changes when the new pads come in. I've only noticed it when listening to certain songs.<br/><br/>Bass is very present (not with the stock pads, no seal means no bass). I had to retrain my ears because I was using something pretty bassy the past few weeks, so at first these felt very thin in that area. But now that I've spent several hours with these, I can say that they do have a pleasing amount of bass, but it isn't going to make your ears wiggle or anything. These are meant to be monitors after all, but the mid bass is still fairly punchy. It does reach down farther than I expected. I don't recall what exactly it was I was listening to, but I was surprised at how far down the sub bass went.<br/><br/>These don't have a super wide soundstage, but that's to be expected with a closed back headphone. It does decently well though, when using these in gaming I don't find myself wanting to reach for one of my open back pair. They image pretty well, and separation is above average for a pair of sub $100 cans.<br/><br/>If I had to compare these to something, they almost sound like my Edifier R1280T speakers, just without the massive soundstage. To compare them to a headphone, think a closed back, warmer, fuller sounding AKG K240. Maybe not quite as detailed.<br/><br/>I can't speak for durability yet as I just got them, but they feel good, a lot more solid than expected.<br/><br/>I purchased these as "Like new - Used", for under $18. Other than the 6.5mm adapter being missing, I can't tell they've been used. (And I don't care about the adapter, I have tons of those things floating around.) They're brand new. Not a single hair, spot of skin oil, or spec of dust on them. So I won there.<br/><br/>These things are great! Very much recommend.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I think one of the strongest selling points for these phones are their comfort. You don't think you need it until you try it once and understand the difference - because it turns out being distracted by any discomfort will disrupt your listening experience in ways you really wish it didn't. These headphones feel incapable of discomfort even if you wore them all day long.<br/><br/>As for the sound quality, these phones (like any other headphones) are going to show 'colorization' at certain frequencies and this model has colorization behavior that concerned me and most likely others too.<br/><br/>These headphones are a just a bit too bright at louder volumes (particularly for music). It's very clear they are this way if you check out their frequency response graph (see photo) - especially at higher volumes. Another graph clearly shows it gets even more pronounced the louder it gets (see photo). If you don't suspect you will listen to these at louder volumes most of the time, then this isn't really an issue, and can actually be an advantage because brightness at lower volumes generally improves clarity.<br/><br/>That said, my impression is that these headphones were not quite intended to be used at higher volumes. From a numbers perspective, the graphs show this, and additionally, this particular model is rated up to 100 mW of power whereas other comparable phones can handle up to 1,000 mW (there's not a lot of room for loud volumes / higher power use). In fact, if you run these at louder volumes, you can tell they start to clip a bit sooner than you might expect.<br/><br/>Granted, a lot of people are not going to use these at higher volumes - but I also know there are people out there that really want to listen to music loudly (not ear bleeding!) and these headphones show concerns at the kind of loudness I am trying to describe.<br/><br/>If you think you will listen to these loudly - what you can do about it is use software (or hardware) to alter the EQ of whatever you are running these on. I use them on my laptop (behind a DAC/Amp) and for those of you who are using them on a computer, you may be very interested in a free software called Equalizer APO along with the Peace plugin. It will give you a 13 band EQ where you can set the changes wherever and however you want. The most useful feature of this software is you can overlay the picture of the frequency response graph on top of the graph of the changes you are making. When done this way, you can achieve a highly accurate and complete correction of the colorization (see photo). Do note that if you do this, to not apply as much correction as you get closer to the high end because of the way the headphones behave with volume changes - you will want to only correct about 2/3 to 1/2 as much to give some room for these changes.<br/><br/>If you bother to do this - it will drastically improve the sound profile of these headphones. It will feel like you added 100's of dollars of value to them because frankly - it's quite difficult to manufacture headphones to sound uncolored by themselves - the physics behind it will always introduce some colorized sound. There is some color you may want and others you don't - but if you don't bother to use something to correct for the colorization - you might find yourself wondering if some other pair of headphones will more closely produce your 'ideal' sound and begin a cycle of trying to find that 'perfect' pair and keep discovering they all have some bit of colorization.<br/><br/>If you spend about $150 here you can get top of the line comfort and very capable headphones, and for free, help correct it's sound profile to your needs.<br/><br/>Now, you can't improve certain things like sound stage or imaging this way - but if you were concerned about that there's a good chance this model wasn't your first choice because these are closed headphones and not the top of the line model offered by this company.<br/><br/>Beyond the brightness colorization, the mid and bass response are great. The mids stay pretty neutral at all volumes. As some people have noted, they can be bassy.<br/><br/>Yes - they are very capable of reproducing the low end in ways most headphones just can't. To be more specific, they have pretty good low end *range* - as in you can really hear the sub bass. But, there is a slight problem with their bass response at specifically around 210 Hz.<br/><br/>I highly suspect with non-electronic music you may not notice this because it's not the most represented frequency - but if you do listen to electronic music - there's a good chance you will feel the bass doesn't quite sound the way you remember. Well, it happens to be a prominent frequency for kicks and bass lines - so it's fairly present in the sound spectrum for electronic music. I would boost this area specifically to see the difference and leave it at that.<br/><br/>There will be some people who think that, overall, the bass is too present, and indeed it's true that there is significant bass response if you look at the frequency response graph. Just like with the brightness, it gets more pronounced the louder you go.  For those of you who listen to electronic music, there's a good chance you will really appreciate this - it can be amazing how these headphones respond. However, if you don't listen to electronic music - this is probably unwanted in a lot of cases. Again, I would apply EQ correction for this - but in this case I would just apply an overall bass reduction as the bass response is pretty even unlike the high end which has several peaks and valleys in that range and is more complex to correct.<br/><br/>That about wraps out my thoughts on the sound quality.<br/><br/>I will say that if you don't have an amp for the 80+ ohm models, you will most likely find these too quiet - they will sound about half as loud as you expect they can achieve. This is expected because of the higher resistance. Most likely, you will want an amp to drive these. That said, I don't recommend the 80+ ohm models for mobile users... those are more for stationary users.<br/><br/>If you don't already have an amp, and plan on getting one, do yourself a favor, and make sure that either your amp has a built-in DAC, or plan to get a separate DAC. The main reason for that is the DAC will ensure the amp is getting the kind of electrical signal it's expecting. In my case when I only had the amp and no DAC, the amp was prematurely clipping at lower volumes because of the output from the laptop - this was immediately fixed by the DAC I bought.<br/><br/>As for the build quality - pretty sure these will last a lifetime with care. There's nothing particular cheaply made that I noticed about these phones. I'm not concerned with the way they look. They aren't displeasing to me - but I'm also not thinking these are the coolest looking phones, but I don't care about that.</span>

<span>I bought these for recording and mixing rock and metal music. These are really nice headphones, very comfortable and excellent sound quality. The character of the sound however is not ideal for rock or metal music in my opinion. The soundscape is a little too separated sounding. I think these may be more geared towards electronic music. I ended up returning these and going with the Sony MDR-7506, which have a little more traditional soundscape, and match well with my presonus reference speakers.</span>

<span>In the past year, I have gone through a long list of headphones and headsets. I finally, got down to two. The first, was the infamous, most talked-about, reviewed and beloved, Philips SHP9500. I bought them because I heard so much about them. However, they were discontinued for the longest time. Then, I got the Sennheiser HD58X Jubilee, which is very similar to the HD660 S. Those are definitely keepers. Then, I was hearing about the other superb, but more expensive headphones, made by Philips, which is the Fidelio X2HR. At its current price, I had to get them. I loved the Fidelio X2HR, but they were heavy and I got headaches from the sound. So, I decided to add another set of headphones to my collection, but closed-back. I have been looking at the DT 770 Pro 80 ohm for a long time. Now, I decided to plunge.<br/><br/>DT 770 PRO LIMITED EDITION/DT 770 PRO: The limited-edition version has only two differences from the standard DT 770 PRO models. First, the velour earpads are black, rather than the standard, gray. Also, the logo on the side of the ear cups is a shiny metallic, rather than the standard, painted logo, which can disappear over time with use.<br/><br/>DESIGN/FEATURES: The DT 770 Pro is a closed-back design. However, they can leak, slightly. The drivers of the DT 770 Pro are 45mm, which is medium. The frequency response is an outstanding, 5-35,000 Hz. The impedance is 80 ohms. For PS4 gamers, who plan to game with a controller, 80 ohms is a little high. Therefore, the controller will not be able to drive these. So, an AMP or DAC will be needed for better performance. Overall, the design of the DT 770 Pro is basic, but kinda cool at the same time. It has a similar build to the HyperX Cloud gaming headsets. The headband is made of metal, which is covered with a thick-layered pad, which can be switched out. Just undo the buttons and voila! Also, two wires protruding from the bottom of each side of the pad and into the ear cups. The ear cups are made of hard plastic with a spatter design. The edges of the ear cups are shiny. The ear cushions are over-the-ear and made of a nice, comfortable and breathable velour. They can get a bit warm, but not to the point where a break is needed to cool down. There is a 1.6mm straight-cord, which is not detachable. Honestly, I do not care for this.<br/><br/>BASS/MID-BASS/SUB-BASS: This is the best feature of these headphones. The bass frequencies are deep, detailed, powerful, precise, punchy, thunderous and tight. No muddiness. At times, the performance of the bass comes out of nowhere. It is like the bass kicks in when it is cued to. If that makes sense. Not to mention, the bass is somewhat reserved, so it does not overpower the sounds and vocals. Out of curiosity, I tested the performance of the DT 770 Pro while playing various shooters on PS4 Pro. The first test was done while playing Call Of Duty WWIII played. The most impressive thing was hearing how loud and clear the explosions were nearby. Once, I used a Glide Bomb killstreak, which landed onto an enemy, not far from me. All I could hear was a clean and thunderous boom. Hearing multiple explosions is heavenly to the ears. For example, a teammate used an Artillery Barrage killstreak. I was in awe of how the explosions of several artillery rounds hitting the ground, gave a surprisingly, clean, loud, and punchy, sound. Great mid-bass, as well. Overall, I would say, the clarity of the sound and the bass is similar to watching tv while listening to a soundbar with a subwoofer. Very smooth.<br/><br/>HIGHS: The sound is somewhat bright. Everything is crystal clear and clean, overall. The treble highs are nice, as well. No grain or distortion. However, there can be sibilance, depending on what is being listened to. Results and ears vary. For example, Call Of Duty Black Ops 4 is a prime example, which has lots of sharp sounds. Gunshots are loud but clear. Each time bullets hit, there a loud, thumping sound, which follows with a loud, “squish”, when a kill is achieved. I found having the volume high while hearing this sound can be harsh of the ears. However, on Call Of Duty WWII, not so much. In fact, I had the dial of my Astro Mixamp turned three-quarters high and the highs were not bad. The high end of female voices sounds great. Hearing the female voices from characters in WWII was one thing. Hearing them on Call Of Duty Black Ops 4 is another. Hearing my female character, Battery’s voice lines sound great. “Cluster grenade, enjoy!” “Splash!” “Dropped!” “All right, boom time.” “All talk!” “Doggone!” Those are some of my favorite voice lines of hers. Once, Battery ran inside of an open-ended bay of the Summit map. Battery said a voice line, while outside of the bay. Then, her voice became magnified, as she entered the bay. Plus, there was an echo of Battery's voice. The authenticity of the echo was unbelievable and nearly, scary. This was a good example of a transition between mid to high sounds.<br/><br/>IMAGING/SOUNDSTAGE: The DT 770 Pro has good imaging. They handle directional sounds, exceptionally, well. With that said, I tested the performance of the DT 770 Pro while playing Call Of Duty Black Ops 4. The best map, which showcases the performance of the best is the “Occupation”  map, which is a close-quarters. I could hear what was going on and direction, where the action was taking place on the map, whether it was dialogue, gunshots or explosions. Of course, footsteps could be heard, as well. It seems the sound magnifies toward closer sounds coming from a different direction. For example, each time my character looks in one direction, the sound increasingly amplifies in the direction and less in the opposite direction, where lesser actions were taking place. Considering, these are closed-back headphones, they have a decent soundstage. Possibly, the best of most closed-back headphones or headsets. Of course, the result is not comparable to open-back headphones, which has a greater, more open soundstage by default. Of course, I am sure, some are wondering about footsteps. Well, the DT 770 Pro, picks up footsteps in games VERY well.<br/><br/>LOWS/MIDS: The lows and mids are great, as they pick up subtle sounds with no effort, thanks to the headphones lows. I am hearing sounds, which I could barely hear with other headphones, such as the breaking of glass from afar, breakage of pottery, or bullet casings hitting the floor. Then, there are detailed sounds, such as the unbelievable sound of crunching, as my character was trampling through the deep snow, cracking of the ice or sounds of moving water, while swimming on the Icebreaker map. Hearing explosions from afar sounds good, too.<br/><br/>NOISE CANCELLATION: These are closed-back, so no sound should leak out, nor coming in. However, sound can leak in from the outside a bit because the pads are made of valour, not leather, which can seal a better. Still, not enough to where outside noise can be distracting.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Overall, the DT 770 Pro is a great headset. Good sound. Great bass. Great soundstage for a closed-back design. A nice and sleek design. Plus, it is manufactured by a company that has a good reputation. Considering all of that, these are worth trying out.</span>

<span>The first headphones (or speakers) that I don't have to equalize (30 ohm)!  I have pitch perfect hearing and live/die on music in my life.  But never invested in good quality headphones before these (I generally like to feel my music though big speakers).  For the price these seem like a terrific value to me... the sound is SO good.  For listening to "Fine Music", I can't imagine anything better.  The sound is crisp, full, rich, bass is very solid, and every little nuance of sound comes through (shocked to hear sounds on my vinyl that I've never heard before!).  However, be aware these are STUDIO headphones; they are not designed to emphasize anything; they're flat spectrum.  So, if you want that razor-ripping sound from a heavy metal guitar as I do sometimes, these don't do that without some unusual EQ tweaking.  They don't distort... that's the great thing on most music, but that also means they don't sound like a rock concert or a Marshall amplifier in your living room.  But, I have gotten closer to that with some 20 band EQ.  Direct from my laptop they (30 ohm) are not loud enough for me, but might be sufficient for some people/purposes.  Using my Harman Kardon amp they are louder than I can handle.  I listen to all types of music and my favs like Enigma or Alan Parsons or Aretha (yea, old school, lol) is just dreamy with these headphones!  Oh... and the earcups are so soft and totally seal out room noise; very comfortable for up to 2-3 hours continuously for me.</span>

<span>I am using this with Tidal music service to listen to the master quality audio, bought a THX Onyx with it , have an apple phone had to buy a camera to lighting port dongle which it suggests.  So far so good I haven’t had the time to listen to everything.  What I have listened to is on par with the price.  Of course there are better ones out there but 400.00 is too much for me.  I prefer the noise canceling without hearing outside noises.  The comfort is good.  I really want to hear on a recording something I haven’t heard normally the little things that I never have heard before on a favorite song,  that what gets me excited.</span>

<span>The price was fair, and I like the closed back along with good reports on its sound signature much like the more expensive Sennheiser's.

<span>For the price these are impressive!  The sleek design is light yet sturdy, the ear pads are very comfortable, and the sound is quite acceptable to very good.  They have a nice midrange with decent bass, I fine tune all my headphones with a preamp and these zero in nicely.  I’ve been using a set of Beyerdynamic DT 770s for a while and after they were stolen I bought a new set to replace them.  The quality of the DT 770s has declined since I purchased the 1st set and I was no longer happy with them.  Going with the Sennheiser HD 560s as a lateral move I was very pleased.  The sound is nicer, they are easier to drive, and they are just as comfortable as the Beyerdynamics and fit nicer on my head.<br/>The only draw back is the cord, it seems like  headphone manufacturers are skimping on the cords these days to cut cost or something.  The cord with the HD 569s is too wobbly and has somewhat of a tacky feel and it tangles easily, other than that, these would have been 5 star headphones.<br/>These are very well designed, and In the $100.00 to $150.00 price range, I haven’t come across anything nicer.  This is the first purchase I’ve made from Amazon in quite a while that seem to be worth what I payed for it (not their usual Asian junk, although made in China).<br/>Recommend!  Worth ordering just to try them out even if they are returned.</span>

<span>I'm comparing these to my Sennheiser HD600 headphones.<br/><br/>Being closed back they do a pretty good job at muffling noise, even without active noise cancellation.<br/><br/>The sound is not bad and would be fine for most people (including me).<br/><br/>You will need to purchase a longer 3.5mm cable or a 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapter. The included 1.2m 3.5mm cable is way too short for anything, except maybe a phone in your pocket.<br/><br/>The way the head piece attaches to the ear cups is weird. When putting the headphones on and taking them off the asymmetrical attachment is strange and makes me thing I'm going to drop them or something is broken. While wearing them I do not notice this and they are comfortable, though not as much as my HD600. Mostly, I think, due to the extra weight.<br/><br/>The cable coming from the left ear cup is also (to me) weird. All the headphones I've owned have had the cable either come out of both or just the right ear cup.<br/><br/>The price of $110 isn't bad.</span>

<span>I do EDM genre mixing and mastering, and these are the end-game when it comes to clarity, dynamic range, and response. I read some of the reviews on here before ordering and paid close attention to others who indicated they do mastering, and I'm glad I did. These are it. Period. The sound stage is absolutely mind blowing. Very wide, very deep, and there's zero latency and absolute clarity to sounds. (No "mushiness", which is critical to precise editing)<br/><br/>The frequency response is outstanding. Whether it's subs at the far bottom end rattling your brain (which my last expensive headphones couldn't even render at all) or the absolute high end of the audio spectrum, it's got it. I wouldn't say it's perfectly "flat" across the entire audio spectrum, no headphones are, but it's the closest you are going to get without calibrated, matched studio monitors. For guys like me stuck home during a pandemic doing mastering, with kids and other noise, the sound isolation these provide, and the sound stage and clarity, makes these headphones worth their weight in gold.<br/><br/>So stop second guessing yourself and just pull the trigger on them. They are THAT good, from an audio perspective. Be aware that they may not be the most comfortable headphones - I have big ears and wear glasses, they're a tight fit - but they are absolutely solid for the job they need to do for me and I'm willing to put up with a bit of a tight fit for this astonishing level of audio quality. If you are looking for something ultra-comfortable for casual listening, maybe look elsewhere; if you are looking for professional grade precision and clarity and have a job to do... well, these are it.</span>

<span>Unbelievably accurate, neither warm or dark. What's recorded on the source material is what you get! That being said, decent source material (I have a particular fondness for electric blues of all sub-genres, jazz, classical and of course rock!)…is the key {and the FIRST in the chain} to exceptional sound with all headphones and speakers. The reason I state this is because the great thing about these "Monitors," (if you will; though I would NOT just put them in that category as many have,) is that they are, amazingly enough, fold-up portable and can be used on the run, on the plane, in the subway (though a tad heavy and perhaps a bit OSTENTATIOUS for the NYC subway) or MORE IMPORTANTLY, at HOME for long term, relaxed or serious listening sessions or in the studio whilst recording, mixing, et. al.! I've a very expensive set of Massdrop/Mr. Speakers Ether-Cx's at almost twice the price and the Neumann's quite frankly, put them to shame in EVERY category!<br/>The NDH-20's are somewhat heavy being machined from aluminum but not enough to make them uncomfortable! For the life of me, I cannot seem to find an aftermarket cable for them (though the proprietary cables are OK- one straight rubberized and the other coiled both at 10 foot length.) I guess it ist "naturlich" das Neumann wants these to be used in the studio "or else!" Pardon my poor attempt at humour however, it would be great to have a 4 foot option for the plane or a nice, cloth-covered, thicker 10-12 foot option maybe made out of OFC to plug into the HP tube amp. Mine sound delicious out of my Cavalli Liquid Platinum and I can imagine a nice aftermarket Periapt cable or some such goodie might make them sound!<br/>I have a large collec tion of headphones that I use (due to the fact that I live in a 3 family Brooklyn Brownstone rowhouse  and my "full throated stereo rig SOUND of pre-marriage and pre-RENT PAYING tenant days") are no longer a practical or "peaceful" option!<br/>But, as is oft the case, I digress. The NDH-20's come with a nice, heavy, printed cardboard presentation box with the phones, wires and carrying bag all neatly laid out in the appropriate, precise, Teutonic order und discipline!<br/>BTW,...the old adage about "burn-in" for these is true! Take it from one who has been forced to pursue peace and tranquility within the "homestead," by the acquisition of quite a few high-end examples of the headphone arts and sciences that, the more burn-in,...the BETTER! I KNOW MANY BELIEVE THIS TO BE HORSE-PUCKY (and on lesser sets of cans, quite possibly so) however, there is NOT a set of high-end cans that I have owned or used that I have not found this to be the case. If you wish to rush the process a bit, just use an old receiver (odds are, if you are reading this, you or someone you know, already own one of these and MOST, if not all had a headphone jack. Just plug any source (even an AM channel IF you have to)  on medium volume (if you have less than stellar reception like me, just tune to the best possible AM or FM channel and right as it starts to distort (gets fuzzy) and annoying sounding back off the volume knob,) and put under and/or in between a pillow/s for a couple of days! Trust me, NOT the most scientific method but it works and cuts down on monitoring your burn-in period.....sort of like "set it and forget it!"  Don't buy into all the pink/white noise pyschobable B.S.! Just put some electric current through those voice coils or planar magnets and it will dramatically reduce the time needed to do serious listening.<br/>I highly recommend these headphones! I find them delightfully enjoyable (about as musically enjoyable a "flat response curve" as you're ever going to hear! Not one spectrum is favored. All are represented with as much accuracy as is possible! Quite frankly with decently recorded music, these put the Mr. Speakers Aeon Flow, and C flow closed backs to shame! Being of closed back design the soundstage is somewhat limited in width and depth however, accuracy is fantastic and again, very musical for what this set of headphones was originally designed to do. Then again, maybe that's what Neumann (studio microphone builders extraordinaire since 1927) set out to do in the first place; give a tool  to studio engineers to monitor their mixes and recordings w/o boring them to death with dry and lifeless sound.<br/>I personally love them for electric blues of every color and stripe!<br/>Hey folks,..I spend a small fortune in time, energy, and moola on all things stereo here on amazon so, if this review was HELPFUL,...well you know what to do! Many thanks fellow consumer!</span>

<span>Okay, I was looking for a good high end closed back set of cans. Was shopping around and ordered this, the fostex 610 and Audeze LCD2 closed. I didn't even consider the beyer 1990 because I do not like bright/sharp cans, and the beyer sound is all about that bright V shape, and the 1990s are no exception. Ultimate I chose the ndh 20 over the other 2, and since there is not a lot of information about these headphones, let me give a little insight. So I am an audiophile from a musician background (elec guitar, sax, clarinet ~ 18 years) and I was looking for a nice set of closed backs with a warm/neutral sound (if that makes sense to you) with good bass extension. Now all 3 headphones are very amazing headphones. Clearly the LCD2 sounded the best to my ears, but I really did not think it was worth double the ndh 20s. I would have gotten them if they were $700 (and I personally don't like to buy used speakers or headphones). So it was between the fostex and the neumanns. Let me be upfront with you, the neumanns are very good at reproducing natural sound of instruments, for instrumental tracks. But when I started listening to electro or dubstep music, the neumanns are VERY critical of poorly recorded/mastered tracks. These cans made me stop listening to Californication by the chilli peppers.<br/><br/>That being said, these are amazing cans. Words alone cannot describe the full extent of the presence these cans have. Depth is bottomless with even decent amp/dac setups (I also tested with the more budget-friendly fiio K5 pro vs thx 789) and clarity is exceptional...perhaps too exceptional that it reveals the incompetency of the recording artists and audio engineers of the songs when they are present. Why did I choose these over the fostex? It really just boiled down to the looks. The silver machined finish is just beautiful.<br/><br/>FYI these are definitely NOT for studio use if you are pursuing neutrality at its highest. They are ever so slightly colored, but imo are less colored than other studio powerhouses like mdr7506 or ath m50x.<br/><br/>Finally the comfort. Minus 1 star for comfort. I definitely have a larger than average head size going by my hat and helmet sizes. But my head is not very wide, sort of like a reverse football-head arnold, and my ears are on the smaller side. My ears do NOT reach the drivers, and I have no comfort issues. I can still consciously feel the weight of the cans on my head, but it's not too bad especially if you get additional headband or padding. As for the earpads, again my ears are more round than oval, and are on the smaller side. The cans are not uncomfortable, but are not as comfortable as say hd6xx or he4xx. But the isolation that the pads provide really, (and I stress this part) REALLY adds to the sound.</span>

<span>These are by far the best headphones I own now. I upgraded from the rode nth-100 and these definitely sound like a big brother. Bass actually reverberates through my head, mids are crystal clear, and highs are f***ing spectacular. These things are really good with noise isolation as well, making them perfect for when you are trying to listen in a noisy environment. One thing I will note is that you are rewarded for well recorded music and punished when it is not as well recorded, which makes them perfect for their purpose of monitoring in a professional environment. Comfort is also not the greatest. Pads are stiff and my left ear constantly hurts, but I am okay with that for this sound and isolation. 100% worth the $550 price tag.</span>

<span>These are super comfortable. They fit around my ears perfectly without pressing on anything despite the fact I wear glasses and have a helix piercing; and the sound quality is pretty decent for the price. If I hadn't had a pair of Avantree and Meze headphones to compare them to I probably would have kept them ...but. In comparison they are rather tinny and have severe sound leakage. I didn't buy them for noise canceling but if that's what you're looking for definitely don't get these, there's literally no difference between having them on or not. The only way I could drown out the cartoons in the background was by playing music and turning up the volume. But like I said these are still good for the price of $45. Avantree Audition were the same price and have the choice of wired or Bluetooth with a better sound though the ear cushions are narrower and don't have a self adjusting head band. The other headphone I bought was the Meze 99 Neo which sounds pretty similar to the Avantree, though slightly better but with the  price tag of $199.</span>

The K72 Bundle from AKG is a closed-back and over-the-ear studio headphone that features professional-grade 40mm drivers and a self-adjusting headband that is light and comfortable. It can be used with a broad range of playback devices in applications for rehearsals, recording studios, live stages, and more. The K72 headphones are built with a single-sided non-detachable 1/8" TRS 9.8' cable and include a 1/4" screw-on adapter. The frequency response is 16 Hz to 20 kHz and provides an accurate monitoring solution, which delivers extended low-frequency that gives definition to kick drums and bass guitars. Furthermore, since earpads are usually the first components to show wear, these are replaceable to protect your investment over time. Finally, whether you're tracking the hook or mixing background harmonies, the K72 is designed to provide hours of comfort. The 40mm drivers deliver high sensitivity for a powerful output, plus an extended frequency response that reveals every detail. The K72s also feature a low-impedance design for compatibility with a broad range of playback devices, from professional studio gear to portable music players. The K72 headphones' closed-back design eliminates audio leakage and delivers sound to your ears only. It comes with a Headphone Holder with Padded Cradle and Adjustable Angle attaches to either a horizontal or vertical surface in order to support one full-sized pair of headphones. The holder has three settings for attaching to surfaces up to 1.3" / 3.3cm in thickness as well as a threaded securing clamp to ensure a precise fit.

<span class="cr-original-review-content">CONCLUSIÓN: Luego puedes leer todo si gustas pero asi de rápido yo te diría no los compres, por el precio al que estan, gástate 500 pesos mas y vas a conseguir los shure 440 que son MUY superiores, no son tan comodos como estos, lo admito, pero vas a conseguir una calidad de construcción 3 veces mas robusta, y una calidad de audio EXTREMADAMENTE superior solo por 500 pesos mas. Si en el futuro le cambias las almohadillas por las de los shrue 840, la calidad de tus 440 va a subir aun mas sobre todo en los bajos.<br/><br/>Si mas bien te quieres ahorrar dinero, y quieres algo para disfrutar la música, va a sonar ridiculo pero de verdad no subestimes los jbl t110, son super budget de 300 pesos y tienen una firma de sonido extremadamente agradable, no son bluetooth y son earphones en lugar de audifonos over ear como estos, pero su sonido, definición y separación de frecuencias es superior.<br/><br/>Si quieres algo en el mismo precio, y puedes vivir con que no sean over ear, vete por los m6 pro, la definición de estos audífonos es bestial, aunque pierdes la comodidad de unos over ear para sesiones largas esos si.<br/><br/>Pero en definitiva alejate de estos :(<br/><br/>AHORA SI, TODO EL ANÁLISIS.<br/><br/>Me sorprende que estos audífonos tengan tan buenas recomendaciones, creo que el marketing es muy efectivo pero son simplemente malos, el principal problema quiza sea el precio pues estos audifonos deberian venderse en un rango de $500 pesos, a continuación te explico por que.<br/><br/>Vamos a dejar primero de lado la comodidad y todo eso, si son comodos, se sienten de plastico pero creo que pueden durar si los cuidas, los auriculares abarcaran por completo cualquier oreja sin importar lo grandes que esten, eso si, no son muy profundos asi que si tus orejas apuntan un poco hacia afuera puede ser que vayas a sentir el fondo de los auriculares, sin embargo la cuestion de la comodidad, aunque es importante no es lo que va a hacer que te decidas por unos audifonos, sino la calidad del audio y aqui es donde todo se viene abajo.<br/><br/>Yo se que la cuestión del audio es muy subjetiva, asi que por si te sirve, mis audifonos favoritos para disfrutar y trabajar son los krk 8400, los de respaldo son unos shure 440 y los que uso dle diario para uso rudo en el celular son los jbl t110 y los que uso para disfrutar y mamasear en el celular son los m6 pro. Espero que esto pueda servirles a algunos de referencia de las firmas de sonido a las que estoy acostumbrado.<br/><br/>Ok, para no alargarme tanto en el análisis de estos akg, su sonido es simplemente malo, suena como si estuvieras escuchando todo a traves de una olla, creo que tienes que estar pasando de una calidad muy pero muy inferior como para que puedas pensar que estos audifonos son una mejoria, en especial por el precio y es que la calidad de construcción es muy sencilla y la del audio simplemente es mala.<br/><br/>Como es el sonido de una olla? Bueno, los bajos son lo "menos peor" y ya son bastante malos, busca el soundtrack de balde runner 2049, la cancion 2049 empieza justamente con un bajo muy poderoso (si la viste en el cine lo sabrás aún mejor) son unos bajos profundos, con mucho punch, graves y gruesos, en los k72 suenan como una charola, secos y sin textura.<br/><br/>Los altos... pues no hay altos y los medios son lo que mas le dan la sensación a olla.<br/><br/>Estuve escuchando de todo para ver si habia algún genero que pudiera ayudarle, escuche albumes como "is this the life we really want?" de Roger Waters para revisar la mezcla o "The omni american book club" para distintos instrumentos (ambos ganadores de grammy) rob zombie, childish gambino, varias canciones de metal, rock, pop, y la verdad es que en todos suenan como olla, curiosamente el disco de 10, 000 days de tool sonaba decente pero aun asi era una decepción.<br/><br/>Lo peor de todo es que los shure 440, en un celular (SI EN EL CELULAR!!!) sonaban mejor que los akg.<br/><br/>No los compres.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>This is a good upgrade from the dt 770 pro. I have the 250 ohm dt 770’s and these 700 pro x’s are slightly clearer in the midrange, the low end and all that bassy goodness is a huge improvement, it’s no razer levels of bass, but it’s clear and present and has no muddiness to it. The high end is also a huge improvement while it maintains the clarity from the 770, but without the treble harshness that the 770 is known for. These 700 pro x’s are also quite a bit heavier than the 770 and the ear pads are cushier meaning they are slightly less comfortable in my opinion but still very good and this makes the headphones seal on your head better and improves the passive noise isolation. The headphones also have a surprising amount of adjustability so even if you have a large or really small head they should fit you. Overall the dt770 pro is a better value if you have neither of them, but these700pro x’s rock. 10/10 would buy again</span>

<span>I was blown away at how much detail I could hear in game.  Sounds that I didn't know were there before are now clear.  A wet footstep vs a hardwood floors vs dirt are all crisp and distinct.  Nothing gets muddled together even when a lot is going on.  These headphones are a huge upgrade from the DT 770 for gaming.  The sound stage is way better and directional audio cues are more accurate for games like Valorant, CSGO, and Hunt Showdown.  I'd still recommend the DT 900 Pro X instead of these for slightly better sound clarity when gaming.  They are the same headphones, just open back.<br/><br/>I'm still giving this a 5/5, even with the one issue that many other people noted.  The cushioned head strap has a defect.  It still works (for now) but it peels back a little more each day and will eventually come off.  This started happening after about four or five months of daily use.<br/><br/>All the parts on these headphones are replaceable, including the driver, which is part of the reason I bought them.<br/><br/>I still recommend buying these for the price.  The Stellar 95 driver performs nearly as well as the next tier of $500+ model headphones at half the price.  Obviously Beyerdynamic is aware of the headband issue and will revise the design.  That's part of the joy of every part being replaceable in a way.  This is my fourth pair of Beyerdynamic headphones.  I've owned headphones and earbuds from Sennheiser, Bose, Jaybird, Razer, and a few others.  I switched from a headset to headphones plus a desk mic years ago and I am never going back.  These are by far my favorite cans for music and the more immersive games like Ori and the Blind Forest, Subnautica and the like.  They also work much better than the DT 770 for FPS..<br/><br/>Last thoughts after reading another review.  These are not head clamps in any way.  The metal band that determines the resistance can be removed and bent (gently) to provide more or less pressure as desired.  I have a big head and had problems in the past with other head phones giving me head aches and causing me to sweat.  This is a nonissue with the 770 and my DT 700/900 Pro X.</span>

<span>I recently went on a mission to find a great set of headphones for editing videos, monitoring my voice on occasion, and listening to music when I want to work late while everyone's sleeping. I don't want to buy multiple headphones for different applications. I'm no audiophile, but I do invest in quality audio components because I appreciate and enjoy great sound. I know what I like, but I can't necessarily tell you why. Kind of like wine.<br/><br/>My journey took me through three models, ending with the DT 700 Pro X. If you're interested in what I tried first and how they stack up to the DT 700, I'll include some brief thoughts.<br/><br/>First Up: DT 770 Pro<br/>Being new to studio monitor over ear headphones, I did a ton of research. That took me to the DT 770 Pro. I appreciate the detail, you can hear all the nuance. They would have worked great for my professional application, but listening to music just didn't "do it" for me. They are sure comfy though. Oh, and while it shouldn't matter, I really don't like how they look. And that permanently attached cable is so long...<br/><br/>Next Up: Focal Listen Professional<br/>Some more research led me to try the Focal Listen Professionals... They look and feel great! And I actually enjoyed listening to music through them a bit more than the DT 770s. Probably due to the better bass response and lack of that harsh high end on the 770s... Yet I didn't love them, especially for the price. And man, those were so uncomfortable! I don't have big ears, but they contorted my ears in a way that I just couldn't stand for more than a few minutes.<br/><br/>And Finally: DT 700 Pro X<br/>They feel great in the hand, are just as comfortable on me as the DT 770, and I love that they have a detachable cable. Although, I thought one of the cables would be coiled but they were both straight. I bought a coiled one immediately because I enjoyed that aspect of the Focals. The sound! They have all the detailed goodness of the DT 770 but with deeper and stronger low end and a more pleasing high end. The first track I listened to made me smile. That's how you know you got it right. And most importantly, they look great. ;)<br/><br/>I have no idea how suitable these are for true audio professionals beyond what I've read (supposedly they are). But if you're a bit like me and want a great set of headphones that will bring out all the detail of your music or video recordings while also providing a very enjoyable listening experience when you're not working, these win. Totally worth the price of admission.</span>

<span>I got these in June 2021. Was surprised that they sounded so bright given that they have a reputation for being dark sounding but I didn't mind. I listen to mostly metal and rock, stuff with instruments and these were fantastic. Unfortunately the pads fell apart in about 8 months. I replaced them with Shure HPAEC1540 pads (a bit pricey but worth it. They don't change the sound much and are more comfy than stock pads). I was happy with this setup until the right side driver just up and died on me at the end of July 2022. I used them heavily (6 hours daily on average) but am very careful and took care of them as best as I could. I didn't get any shorting or anything before it happened. Just unplugged for the night, tried in the morning and nothing. Even opened it up to check for issues with the cabling and everything seemed normal. The driver was dead. I was very disappointed. Loved these things up to that point. So yea, great sound but they may die on you.<br/><br/>I've since replaced them with Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pros and am happy again as the sound signature is similar but with improvements in the bass regions. The build quality on these and Beyer's reputation also inspire confidence in their durability.</span>

<span>I was never a fan of headphones until I bought this one. Because I needed to meditate using binaural beat audio files, I bought another so called "professional" headphone 3 years ago for $50. Although its bass is good enough for the low frequency in my audio files, I was never satisfied with its other respects of the sound quality. Then my old headphone broke so I needed to buy a replacement. I made the decision to buy AKG 371 based on its range of frequency response and its price.<br/><br/>I never used any other headphones with sound quality better than audiophile class speakers until this one. I have a stereo speaker/amplifier system worth $600. Now if I make the speaker volume low, I should say the sound quality from my 371 headphone is better than sound from my speaker system. The speaker sound quality is better than the sound from 371 headphone only if I make the speaker system volume loud.<br/><br/>The sound from the headphone is clear and rich, with all the frequency components from music. The bass is rich but not heavy and the treble is full of clarity. I am very satisfied with this headphone! Although the build quality for this headphone is not the top class, I cannot expect much for a headphone at a price lower than $200.<br/><br/>Something to note for beginner audiophile listeners:<br/><br/>1. You need a good quality DAC (digital analog converter) to fully realize the headphone's potential. Both my computer and my cellphone have HD DACs so they are good enough for me. You don't need to buy this headphone if you only have a very low end cellphone.<br/><br/>2. Also you need at least high data rate MP3 files to really enjoy the rich details of the music. Probably you need at least 192kbps MP3 files. You don't need this headphone for 128kbps MP3 files.</span>

<span>The headphone is, of course, nearly ideal to the Harmon Curve... and does seem to be fairly balanced sound profile/tonality bass to treble. There does seem to be some elevation of response around 20 Hz from flat, but I wouldn't say they are really heavy bass.  Honestly given the price, sounds great.  After 3 weeks of wear, found them very comfortable for prolonged wear for me, with one minor gripe:  The headphone cable comes out of the left ear and points directly down. If I am sitting up and doing something else, I have no problem with it, but if I am relaxed and slouched back in my chair just enjoying, I find the strain relief of the the cable pushing against my shoulder.  But all-in-all good.</span>

<span>Got this sustain pedal to replace the flimsy one that came with my keyboard and never stayed in place.  This one doesn't move around on the carpet and was a good price.  I would recommend.</span>

<span>I like this, but when I first plugged it in, the sustain was on without stepping on the pedal. I was like, "WTH?" and when I looked on the bottom, there was a recessed area with a switch, so I slid it to the other side. Easy peasy. I don't think I would reverse it again, but I guess some people like doing that for whatever reason. A good product.</span>

<span>A great pedal. Solid components. Solid weight &amp; balance. Stays put. Works as advertised. I purchased it after a musician-friend loaned me a Korg keyboard (I will buy it from him ultimately I suppose). I use it as a dedicated sustain-pedal. It’s sweet. Nothing more, nothing less. Would purchase again if needed. Thanks.</span>

<span>My Yamaha P71 (P45) 88 Key Keyboard came with a sustain pedal but the included one is very light and doesn't have the feel nor the half pedal ability of the M-Audio SP-2 or the weight which helps to keep it from moving around.  I bought it at the same time I purchased the keyboard and it's reasonably priced and a "required" accessory for an intermediate player and possibly a beginner.</span>
