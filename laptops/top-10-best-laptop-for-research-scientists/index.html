                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I was shocked at how snappy and decent this little Chromebook is. For the price you really can't beat it. My Father's Acer R-13 stopped working so I ordered this one for him. It setup immediately and even recognized his USB dock which allowed him to connect wireless mouse, keyboard and speakers. This is a great deal. I'll update if he runs into any issues with it in the future, but so far it's a 5 star winner.</span>

<span>I have a iMac desktop which I absolutely love but I can’t take it with me when I leave the house, so I bought this little guy so I could grab and go. I was anticipating a little more from it to be honest. There are a few big problems I have with it. First, it runs Windows 11 S. I don’t know what the S stands for but I’m guessing it means slow because it is painfully slow. Downloading the software updates took over a hour and a half. Secondly, the 64GB hard drive space is half way full just from the operating system and software applications it comes with.  I used 2GB loading photos alone. I decided not to put my music on it just to save disk space. Lastly, as I said  before, it runs Windows 11 S. I attempted to download some files from the internet but the Windows wouldn’t allow me to do it. It forces you to use Microsoft Store which is terrible if your looking for a good selection of apps. If you’re okay with those problems I experienced then go ahead and buy yourself one. I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere. Unfortunately I’m going to have to send it back because it’s not what I wanted or what they said was.</span>

<span>Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!<br/><br/>Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!<br/><br/>The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.<br/><br/>Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.<br/><br/>Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.<br/><br/>I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!<br/>Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.</span>

<span>Overall, I would say the laptop is great. It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good,<br/>overall good chromebook.<br/>I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff.<br/><br/>I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient.<br/><br/>I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this.<br/><br/>There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more. Best laptop I could find and really pleasantly surprised overall in many areas.</span>

<span>I love my Chromebook, especially since I got it for a huge discounted price. It runs seamlessly with my phone yet the browser works more like on a laptop vs. a phone. The battery life is surprisingly long and it's so lightweight that I use it for all my writing over my laptop. I wasn't sure how I'd like a Chromebook but I absolutely love it! It's both a laptop and a tablet since you can fold the keyboard completely back to use the touchscreen. I highly recommend one, you'll use it more often than you think.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

Como aun no es mi computadora principal, no la uso mucho a diario, por lo que me ha durado la batería, después de cargarla al 100 %, casi una semana llegando al 15 % al quinto día sin apagarla de un día para el otro, solo la cierro y la uso al día siguiente; hago esto porque he leído que así funciona mejor Mac OS.<br/><br/>En unos meses pienso realizar una actualización de esta opinión de usuario.<br/><br/>Ahhhhh!!!, de ley consigan un USB-C hub, yo compré uno con 3 USB-A y una entrada para ethernet.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.<br/><br/>Good:<br/><br/>- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.<br/><br/>- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.<br/><br/>- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.<br/><br/>- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.<br/><br/>- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.<br/><br/>- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27" (top end) with Intel chips.<br/><br/>- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.<br/><br/>- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.<br/><br/>- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.<br/><br/>NOT GOOD:<br/><br/>- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).<br/><br/>- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.<br/><br/>- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.<br/><br/>- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!</span>

<span>I had and used this computer for almost a week.  It does works great and very nice to type on as I am a touch typist (meaning I don’t need to look at the keys as I use the keyboard).  The keys are nicely spaced apart even if it is just a 14 inches screen sized computer.  I did not miss the other larger sized models as this is just fine for the type of activities I like to indulge in with a personal computer or other electronic devices.<br/><br/>The track pad is very sensitive (although I personally prefer to use a “old fashioned” wired USB Mouse and the newest  Touchscreen option over the track pad).  I like the SSD storage over the old fashion magnetic one.  I been using the tiny USB flash drives for ages and prefer to store my resulting computer files locally on these than stuffing up my internal storage full for long term storage.  Flash drives are still far more cheaper and portable even today.  I like lots of options.<br/><br/> Which brings me to the cons of my new purchase.  The instructions which came with this computer is the worst that I ever used.  The print is way too tiny for even someone with good eyesight to read!  I am not sure where the HMDI Port is (although I do think it’s there-somewhere!)  I studied all the keys and there no place to put your finger to be read.  So I have to completely rely on my PIN to physicially in real time protect my computer and files from unauthorized users.  I prefer to have at least 2 levels of protection like the fingerprint reader AND the PIN.  Even my under 200 dollar smartphone has these options built right in!<br/><br/>Look at this list below copy/pasted from Amazon own webpage of this computer:<br/><br/>1x Headphone-out &amp; Audio-in Combo Jack; 1x Built-in HD webcam with microphone; 1x Built-in fingerprint reader; 1x Built-in media reader for simple photo transfer; 1x RJ45 LAN Jack for LAN insert; 1x HDMI 1.4b 4K Output; 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C; 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type A. 12.75 x 8.89 x 0.78 in (323.85 x 225.81 x 19.81 mm), 3.25 lbs. (1.47 kg)…....”<br/><br/>I could not find the HMDI Output port  Where is it? Worst of all there could never be a LAN (Ethernet) port built in these more modern ultra skinny laptops. Why was something so obviously inaccurate stated as such on Amazon?  I had to go online somewhere else to find this out!  I paid good money for features that could not or would not ever be on this product?  Or pay extra for adaptors?  And the color was not the same pictured on the webpage.  I was sent a completely silver one, rather than a blackish one.  What’s up with this?<br/><br/> I decided to simply cut my losses and move on.  From what I read on some of these reviews, I luckily gotten away with a product that works at least for now.  The features that are extremely vital to me at least are present on the product so I can live with this purchase, though still a bit disappointed, and  feel a bit, well, cheated.  As you can see below also from their own Amazon webpage:<br/><br/> AMD Ryzen 3 3200U Processor (2.60 GHz base clock, up to 3.50 GHz max boost clock, 4 MB Cache, 2 Cores) Smart dual-core, four-way processing performance for HD-quality computing<br/><br/>14" Touchscreen, typical 1366 x 768 HD resolution. Natural finger-touch navigation makes the most of Windows 10. Energy-efficient LED backlight screen<br/><br/>DDR4 2400 MHz RAM Memory with Solid State Drive (SSD) combo brings the muscle for gaming, creating, and advanced multitasking, so you can do it all, anywhere. To smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once<br/><br/>So it’s not a complete let down, or worse, a huge disaster.</span>

<span>I've been using the laptop for some time, and overall I pretty like it except for one issue that is sure to be a deal breaker for some people.<br/>I'll start with the good things first. This laptop is ridiculously light. Even after some time of using, I would still be shocked by how light the laptop is everytime I picked it up. If you will be on the go for most of the time, this machine is perfect.<br/>Next up, the keyboard and touchpad. I dont really know how to describe the keyboard feel, but you sure will not be disappointed. as for the touchpad, its ok, nothing spectacular. But the size of the trackpad is very big, allowing for a more comfortable use. I'll give it a pass.<br/>One of the best features of this laptop is the screen, but ironically is also what most people would be complaining. The colors of the amoled screen is ridiculous, and it is great for watching movies and other stuff. However, the screen is only a full hd. Although i was hoping for at least a 2k, you know I'm not complaining simply for how good it looks.<br/>Ports: I never thought that i would need to label this as an advantage, but it indeed is. This machine packs a HDMI and full size USB-A into the slim body. Not something you see very often today.<br/><br/>And now the bad things, and it would say it is not necessarily a design fault, but rather a compromise for having a laptop at this weight. The chassis of the laptop is simply just too soft and thin. Here are some real world problems i face when using the GBP.<br/>when i pick up the laptop in a closed orientation, sometimes i could click the trackpad. Yes, from the bottom of the chassis. You also cannot comfortably use it while it is on your lap, cause if you apply to much force on the side the trackpad will also click. Also, when typing, if you press the keys down too hard, you will bend the chassis.<br/><br/>So overall would I recommend the Galaxy book Pro? I would say yes, but only if:<br/>you are willing to sacrafice some build quality for weight and portablity<br/>if you want to stay in the samsung ecosystem and don't find the flexible chassis a big issue.<br/>You want a powerful windows ultrabook and portability is absolute top priority.<br/>You really like vibrant colors and will be consuming a lot of media on the device.</span>

<span>It is great value for money but it has one huge flow and that is chassi flex. You can not simply operate it while laying back and having laptop on lap because it flex back and presses touchpad from bottom and makes click on it ... While operating on table there is no issue but having it on lap is huge problem. My wife has LG Gram and that has much better chassis ....</span>

<span>Laptop is super lightweight to the point where it seems like one of those prop laptops you see in Ikea room set ups haha Other things I like are that it runs pretty fast with an SSD, it charges very quickly and battery lasts a SUPER long time, and the number pad is very useful.<br/><br/>Otherwise some of the gripes I have with the laptop is that the touchpad is finicky and keeps on doing other functions when I'm just trying to scroll with two fingers and you have to hold down the Fn key in order to use setting buttons like screen brightness or volume (normally its the other way around where the settings are primary function on F1-12, on this laptop its secondary). Additionally, the webcam isn't very high definition and a bit grainy.</span>

<span>Compared to many other laptops in the current crop of "lightweights" the Samsung Galaxy 15" (Non-touch screen version) is a very nice machine.  Like others have stated, the plastic bottom shell is kind of flexible when used on your lap or a soft support, not a big deal on a desk.  If it was done to save weight I don't think it makes sense as there are other metals that would be a good alternative.  And I will agree, the blue color, while stunning, is a finger print magnet.  The other limitation is only one USB 3.0 port.  For these two reasons I gave it a four star rating.  The system boots quickly, has a good suite of Samsung software, the driver and platform software update being a very nice add in, similar to the Lenovo Vantage update software.  Windows is quick, video is great and it plays nicely with most apps including streaming of video.  I would not throw a high-end game at it though, not a big enough pool of video RAM for that.</span>

<span> This product lives up to its name! All the features mentioned are true. Took a little long to start up and get everything up but it’s because it’s brand new and it had to process and upload all my old stuff from previous laptop onto this one. I used my old email and password and everything automatically came onto my new laptop.  Great product, not too large and it’s light weight . Only thing the SD card does not fit the regular SD  cards but hey guess we are phasing that out , I just used a SD card reader inserted it into the USB port and I was able to edit my videos as normal! Recommend! I’m writing this comment because I do read other ppls comment and it helps . Definitely worth purchasing 💕 I love my laptop</span>

<span>Overall, this is a pretty decent and simple laptop and serves the purpose for which we bought them. Despite the lower end system specs, the hardware does perform nicely. Not blazing fast but not slow, either. The screen quality is what you'd expect in this price range. The full keyboard layout is great and the weight and design of it is pretty solid. It comes in Windows S mode which only allows you to install apps from the microsoft store which makes it secure for less than tech savy users who just want to mess around on the web safely. You need to take it out of S mode and convert it to Windows 10 Home to install any apps not available in the store. That said, the bloatware is unforgivable. It comes preinstalled with McAfee. If you know anything about McAfee, they are essentially a virus posing as an anti-virus program. Once preinstalled, you're never getting rid of it. Not with the Windows Apps &amp; Programs uninstaller or the "Removal Tool" from McAfee themselves. You run either, it just keeps coming back. If you try to delete the registry keys, you can't because they have running process that protects it from deletion. And if you are wise enough to figure out how to delete it from safe mode (like you would with a virus), it hijacks the Windows shutdown process to add it back in (like a virus). The only way to really get rid of it is to completely format and reinstall Windows. The problem there is you need ASUS's drivers afterward for the proprietary keyboard and touch pad. Which of course ASUS does not offer on the product support page. ASUS also has their own bloatware called MyASUS which, also, you will not be able to fully remove. If you can live with the preinstalled apps and McAfee, then this laptop may suit your purposes. If you're using it for work or business, you'll be able to get it functioning enough to use but be warned, it takes some extra work to get McAfee into a state where it's just there lurking while your real security software is in place.</span>
