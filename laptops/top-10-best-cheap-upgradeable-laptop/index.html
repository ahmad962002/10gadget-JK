The ASUS Laptop L210MA is designed to help you be productive all day — even when you’re on the move. This compact and lightweight 11.6 inch laptop is powered by the latest Intel processor and provides long lasting battery life. With eMMC storage and pre-loaded Windows 10 in S mode, it offers full compatibility with a wide range of software and peripherals. It’s the best laptop for people on the go. *The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 (Gen 1 and 2), and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to  system configuration and your operating environment.
                   
                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got this to log my collectibles and maybe make some PowerPoint presentations about them. For those uses, it’s acceptable. If you’re looking for a hard working computer keep looking. Obviously it’s not a high powered gaming rig so don’t expect speed or anything, but for basic tasks like running office programs and maybe organizing files it’s sufficient, if a little slow. It’s also small, which was what I was specifically looking for without having chrome os, so it doesn’t have great visuals. But it is clear enough to work with. For what it is, it is great, I took a star off though because it doesn’t hold a charge, even when powered off. I mainly work with it plugged in and always let it get to 100% before I shut it down and unplug it. But it dies after a day or two of being shut off, which makes it forget the Wi-Fi and it takes a few restarts to get it fixed. I don’t use it daily so I usually leave it powered down, I just wish it would have power when I need it again. So, if you’re looking for a small portable netbook that can run Microsoft office programs and do basic things, this isn’t a bad choice for the price, just be ready to work near an outlet.</span>

<span>I've recently taken up 3D printing and saving files to an SD card on my 8 yr old laptop with a broken screen was a pain. I like this lil laptop. It's been pretty easy to use. I did take it back to the windows 10 because thats what I'm used to using and so much easier to use and navigate. I use this Asus laptop for my 3D model searching, slicing 3D model's in several apps, I was able to connect it to 1 of my 3D printers and successfully printed model's, I've used it for my Cricut machine with design space. I've used it to watch Amazon prime, Netflix, and YouTube videos (I do have to connect a Bluetooth speaker). I've done file transfers from my phone to the laptop. I would not say this is a gaming laptop, but my son did try it out for a couple of games and liked it. It does not have a touch screen, which is a disappointment. It charges fairly quickly and holds a charge for a long time. 1 issue with the built in number pad in the mouse pad, it keeps turning on and then can't get it to turn off for a while. It's pretty touchy. It is very lightweight and portable. Something a college student could fit into a backpack.</span>

<span>Note: This review is for those thinking about run a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.<br/><br/>Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri doesnt detect the Realtek wifi adapter that comes with this laptop which is an extremely common problem in the Linux world (in fact, I already know because there were reviews here that said they had to rely on a USB wifi adapter). I tried using a USB Ethernet adapter to connect to the internet and running [apt update/upgrade] hoping that it will install the correct drivers but no luck. However, even [lspci] doesnt event detect the wifi adapter so I just gave up. I bought a generic wifi adapter carrying the latest Intel AX210 for about $40. This new model allows for WiFi 6e and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and I tested this on a Windows 10 Pro laptop prior to bringing it over to this Linux machine so I know that the adapter I bought actually delivered these specs. So then I swapped the Realtek with the new Intel wifi adapter and reinstalled the same Ubuntu version. I had wifi even during setup when I was booting the installer from USB. But after installation, only bluetooth was detected. The solution was to [apt update/upgrade] and restart. Then boom now I have wifi and also Bluetooth 5.2 (I didnt include pics but when I ran [hciconfig -a] the version is 5.2) thanks to Intel AX210. I didnt need to manually install other drivers - it just worked after a system update.<br/><br/>Note that you have to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS/UEFI settings for the new wifi adapter hardware to be recognized by the OS. This means that the Secure Boot status should be "Inactive" (or something like that). Delete those stored keys if you need to.<br/><br/>So far, i dont have any issues with it running Ubuntu. The camera, usb ports, and m.2 ssd slots all work fine. I havent used the Bluetooth 5.2 though since no need for it. Also, doing basic computer stuff like web browsing and word processing is not lightning fast but also not slow. It takes a few seconds to open Firefox but watching 1080p videos is no problem. I tried running 1 Lububtu virtual machine and I didnt have any problems, but it is kinda slow - though tolerable.</span>

<span>This is the second LG Gram-17 laptop that I've purchased and both are extremely good! The LG-Gram 17 is so lightweight that I can pick it up with one hand from where it leans up against my couch. Because of that I often use it without a lap table. I will note, however, that the upgraded Gram-17 is a bit warmer sitting on my lap than the previous model because the 2021 version was redesigned with a heat release at the bottom rear of the unit.<br/><br/>Everything about the 2021 model is better than the previous one. The backlit keyboard and touchpad have both been redesigned and improved. The SSD is much faster — I bought mine with a 1TB drive, but a 2TB drive is available for around $100 more. The laptop's hinge has been improved, as well.<br/><br/>The LG Gram-17 is now equipped with an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 chip that is AWESOME! On top of that, it is now EVO-rated, which means an improvement over the laptop's already impressive battery life! Note that the Gram-17 doesn't come with a touchscreen and I have read in multiple reviews that it is not the laptop you want to buy if you're a gamer.<br/><br/>The screen is beautiful but extremely glossy, so if you're working in a room or office with bright lights, you might consider purchasing a matte screen protector.<br/><br/>I'm a newspaper editor and this laptop works great for everything from web browsing and photo editing to working with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. I'm testing the Windows 11 beta and the Gram-17 runs the updated OS flawlessly.<br/><br/>I've been a Mac user since the mid-80s and currently own an M1 Mac mini and Macbook Air, along with an Intel 16-inch MacBook Pro. Despite my affection for Macs, I often find myself grabbing the Gram-17 simply because it's such a delight to use. The laptop has never let me down in terms of performance and because of its light weight, it's also my laptop of choice when going on trips. I have no complaints whatsoever. The LG Gram-17 is simply a GREAT laptop!</span>

<span>First of all I am still shocked (to my delight) every time I pick this thing up, or carry it to my office upstairs. It is light as a feather compared to all other laptops I've owned, despite the large screen. It has only been a couple of weeks since purchase, but so far it is performing well as expected (I use it for "lightweight" personal use - i.e. browsing, streaming, slack, etc.).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Incredibly lightweight. Just wow.<br/>- I like the backlit keyboard and the fact that unlike my previous laptop I can configure it to stay on instead of turning off after a predetermined amount of time.<br/>- Excellent display, although the screen is a bit "reflective", so I may purchase a screen glare reducer of some flavor.<br/>- The keyboard - for someone with large fingers it is very ergonomic for me personally.<br/>- Slender form (not sure what the thickness is closed but thinner than most of my previous laptops)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Battery life is mediocre. Presumably a design sacrifice to be expected for such a lightweight device.<br/>- The speakers. Personally, this is really not an issue for me since I don't care about having high fidelity sound output from a laptop, but the sound is pretty basic and the speakers being located on the bottom of the case results in a somewhat muted audio output. But they work just fine for my purposes.<br/><br/>To be determined how durable this laptop is / will be if it gets banged up. Purely speculative, but it is so lightweight I can't help but wonder about this - although I tend to handle with care and have a very nice case I always use for travel so not to worried. The specs say it is magnesium allow, which is, from what I've read a solid choice for lightweight laptop bodies (probably part of the reason for a somewhat higher price point). So maybe there is no real reason for concern.</span>

<span>I loved that it was lightening fast and lightweight.  However only seven months after purchasing I got the blue screen of death.  Tried to get it repaired at Best Buy but they wouldn't touch it because it was still under the one-year warranty.  Contacted LG - long story short - From the time it left my hands to the time it was sent back to me was 31 days!!!  After setting up and updating my windows from 10 to 11 - Blue Screen of Death AGAIN!  Sent it back and am now without my computer again.  Have requested a replacement but LG's tech support and customer service is WAYYYYY below acceptable; I was told they have to repair it and only if the repair technician deems it irreparable then I will get a refund/replacement laptop.  I will never buy this brand again.  BUYER BEWARE!</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.<br/>PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.</span>

<span>As my first gaming laptop I couldn’t be happier. I bought this on sale for just under $600. 8gb ram, I added a 4gb stick I had in a damaged laptop and now have 12gb ram (which has worked just fine and I have noticed the increase in speed). 500gb SSD that I just upgraded with another 512gb SSD for $43. I have played halo infinite and it looks great. Looks as good as it did when using the Xbox series S. This laptop upgrades easily. I put the ram in and then the SSD in under 5 minutes. Seems solid, not flimsy. Haven’t noticed screen brightness issues. Have used for job interviews using Microsoft teams and the camera and speakers and mic work great. Overall very happy.

<span>For clarity, this review is for the 15.6" GTX 1650 version, not the 17.3" GTX 1650Ti version.<br/><br/>Positives!<br/><br/>This laptop is perfect for me and what I need right now. I am currently in between homes, over the road a lot for work and have all of my stuff in storage, including my main PC, so I bought a laptop so I could continue doing work and gaming while on the go.<br/>This laptop is not top of the line by any means, it's no $2,000 laptop with an RTX 3080 or anything like that, but if you want a good mid-range laptop that can get 60FPS on some everyday gaming, this is as good as mid-range laptops get in my opinion.<br/>Even on my main, much beefier PC, I've never been one to crank up the settings and enable raytracing, 4k etc. I'm more of a framerate type of person and this laptop does a great job getting high frame rates if you're willing to adjust the settings accordingly. The screen is a clean 1920x1080, lovely quality (though the brightness isn't that great), comes with an NVME 512GB hard drive which is not a bad start if you're not trying to install a Call of Duty game with 100gb patches, but that leads into another glowing positive - this thing is upgradeable and I love it! One of the hardest things about picking a laptop for me is the eventual obsolescence, so in the few times I've bought a laptop in my life, I prefer ones you can upgrade which will allow you to skirt by the expected lifespan for a bit longer.<br/>Overall, my complaints a few, but I will point them out.<br/><br/>Negatives!<br/>Honestly, 8GB of RAM is... well, it's not enough for any modern PC that you want to do more than browse the internet, but this negative hardly counts against it because once again, it is upgradeable! I added 32GB to mine and it runs like a dream now. The fact it ships with such low RAM is forgivable because that's probably why the price of entry is as low as it is.<br/>I also had a few problems with the Wi-Fi antenna at first, which I know is not unique to my laptop, but after a few online searches, troubleshooting and settings adjustments, it hasn't dropped the connection for a couple of days, so I think I'm over that hump.<br/>My last complaint and honestly maybe the only one that could be considered "major" is the screen brightness. To be clear, I'm talking about BRIGHTNESS, not QUALITY. The resolution is wonderful and the screen is a clear HD experience, but keep this thing away from the sunlight if you want to see it easily... I took it to the park one day and while I could see the screen, I felt like I was squinting, and I had to change my preferred dark mode to light mode just to see the Windows UI better. Once again, I consider this a minor gripe and won't take a star off, because if you're using this thing indoors or in appropriate shade, the screen is beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for an affordable, upgradeable, laptop suited for everyday gaming (as long as you're not trying to push max settings, 4k or raytracing), you won't be disappointed!</span>

I ended up buying a HP Omen desktop for a just a few hundred dollars more, and the difference is night and day, i can play games at max settings and get 240 frames.<br/><br/>This is my first gaming PC, and overall its good.<br/>For the price, i think its a great snag, BUT if you plan on using this PC as your main gaming station, or plan on playing every game out there, id buy something else.<br/><br/>This PC has run every game ive thrown at it, but it runs noticeably worse when running newer games, or higher demanding games.<br/>You wont be getting 144 frames on majority of games without dropping every graphics setting to low, and even after that you most likely will not get 144 frames.<br/>Max i was able to get for Insurgency Sandstorm was 80ish, Ready or not 80ish,  Death Stranding 60, Madden 23 60, Apex Legends 120s, GTA 4 60s. I had to run these games on low settings to get these frames, and it wasn't steady. I was dropping down to the 20-30 ALOT when playing Insurgency and Ready or Not. Even GTA4 was pretty janky while driving and shooting.<br/>I got max Frames in Valorant, Counter Strike GO, and all older games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, Left4Dead 2 i was able to play on ultra graphics.<br/><br/>Graphics card is meh. I can easily notice the graphics dropoff when playing Apex and Madden on here, then hopping on Series X and playing them, its a steep drop off. The issue is you cant play a majority of games on medium or high settings, which also hurts the graphics big time.<br/><br/>The screen is excellent. Its anti glare, and very clear. I ended up buying a second monitor to game on, just because 15inches is too small after years of gaming on a 50inch TV, BUT i could have gotten away with gaming on this screen.<br/><br/>Battery is pretty bad, but i usually always have it plugged in. Just web browsing at 50% brightness youre getting 2 hours battery life.<br/><br/>I see some reviews claiming that the Wifi adapter is bad, i havent experienced this. I game upstairs on wifi, my router is downstairs, and i usually get 25 ping in online games, which is pretty great. I also got 150ish download on steam. Ive never gotten buffering when watching a video, or live stream(I watched the Bills vs Rams game last night on this without any buffering).<br/><br/>I highly recommend upgrading the ram if you do end up buying, the max this PC can use is 24 RAM, so i installed the Crucial RAM 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22, very easy install.<br/><br/>Speeds for the PC are very fast. From web browsing, to gaming, to tab switching, everything is very fast, even faster than my Macbook 2020.<br/><br/>Overall its a solid gaming laptop, just go in knowing the limitations going in. Id recommend for casual /light gamers.</span>

<span>I'm not a fan of Windows at all, however I decided to leave it as dual boot with Linux. As is usually the case with laptops, battery life is much better in Windows than it is in Linux. That is an inherent issue with Linux and not a detriment to the laptop itself.<br/><br/>Running Arch Linux, all of the hardware was found automatically. The only issue is not being able to cycle through the different modes of keyboard lighting. It's fine because I usually leave that turned off anyway. I could probably find a way to get it to work, but I don't really care to.<br/><br/>The fans are quiet, the keyboard feels positive and comfortable, the display is very good. I have no complaints.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>I have a iMac desktop which I absolutely love but I can’t take it with me when I leave the house, so I bought this little guy so I could grab and go. I was anticipating a little more from it to be honest. There are a few big problems I have with it. First, it runs Windows 11 S. I don’t know what the S stands for but I’m guessing it means slow because it is painfully slow. Downloading the software updates took over a hour and a half. Secondly, the 64GB hard drive space is half way full just from the operating system and software applications it comes with.  I used 2GB loading photos alone. I decided not to put my music on it just to save disk space. Lastly, as I said  before, it runs Windows 11 S. I attempted to download some files from the internet but the Windows wouldn’t allow me to do it. It forces you to use Microsoft Store which is terrible if your looking for a good selection of apps. If you’re okay with those problems I experienced then go ahead and buy yourself one. I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere. Unfortunately I’m going to have to send it back because it’s not what I wanted or what they said was.</span>

<span>OK, this is my second Stream.  The original was a 32GB that is still operating and is obviously limited by the couple GB remaining after the operating system space.  However, was useful for web browsing.  This one is 64GB and that leaves about 30GB space for programs plus one year of MS Office free.  I got rid of the Windows 10 S mode and the speed for web browsing and program operation is fine.  And I'm used to an Intel 11th generation i5 on a desktop and have no complaints. That is an absolutely amazing unit for $200.  Of course, in both cases, I've added extra room using a USB 128GB flash drive so really, it's a fantastic deal.  The only con that I've found so far is that the sound is rather puny but connecting a cheap bluetooth speaker solves that issue.  Update:  I hooked this up to an external monitor and it gave me an option to go from the native internal screen resolution of 1366x768 to 1920 x 1080 and it shows up great on the external monitor.  I'm shocked.  I cannot believe this computer was $200.  Well, we'll see how long it lasts.</span>

<span>I love how fast and light this computer is. The screen has great resolution. And the keyboard has a nice pop to the keys that remind of using a typewriter. But its light weight comes at a price. It has a very flimsy lid that actually bends towards the backside of the screen when pressed even lightly. Overall, I am worried about how well this laptop is going to hold up physically. Time will tell.</span>

<span>I love everything about this laptop.  I'm replacing my 5 year old HP Envy 17.3", need a numeric keypad, want a big screen so I can compare multiple spreadsheets at one time, etc.  My HP is 6.9 pounds, so this Gram of course is incredible in comparison.  Also, my HP fans get loud enough at times it sounds like the laptop could hover off my desk and fly away.  Even on the loudest "performance" fan settings on the Gram, you can barely here it.  The screen resolution is excellent, although my comparison is an HD screen and I've never had a 4k.  I'm not a gamer nor streamer.  I use this for work and it's excellent in that capacity.<br/>The problem(s) - the computer froze 3 times in the first 2 hours of use, requiring a hard power off and back on.  Ctl+Alt+Del would not even work.  Then, it would power off on its own after 10 minutes.  I tried resetting all my power settings, eventually going with Never on Sleep, Screen and Hibernate.  It seemed to stop it from powering off on it's own, but it's not a solution, it's a bandaid.  After a few more hours of use, it continued to freeze randomly and started powering off on it's own again.  Telling it to Sleep would power it off, not actually put it to sleep.<br/>I was in the process of returning it to Amazon on my old laptop, and I saw a blue screen pop up out of the corner of my eye (first time) and it displayed a CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error.  Now that I had an error code to work with, I thought I'd select the "contact Amazon for assistance" option during the return process.  I was hopeful I would hear, "Yes, this is a known issue and what we have to do is reset your BIOS, or something to that effect."  However, after about 15 minutes with Amazon I was conferenced in with an LG Electronics technician who said they recommended a factory reset and if the issues continued, they would repair it under warranty.  I said I was hopeful it would be an easy fix over the phone, but sounds like it's not.  So why go through the hassle of a factory reset, I will return and try again.  I liked this laptop so much, I'm willing to give it another try.  Wish me luck!</span>

<span>This laptop is well made and light weight.  The Blue Tooth is however not useful.  The LG software to download drivers is pretty frustrating.  The drivers can be found to enable all devices within a Microsoft Windows Enterprise 2019 LTSC but they will take some patience and research.  You cannot get them from LG and their download tool does NOT work in anything other that 20H1 or better.  If the drivers were not such a pain I would have given 5 stars even with the blue tooth issue.</span>

<span> This is by far the best ultralight notebook with a large screen I've ever had. I was hesitating to get a Dell XPS 17, but I did make the right choice with LG Gram. It's sturdy, really well made, elegant, with a really good silent keyboard and a beautiful, crisp and sharp 17 inch screen. And it's so lightweight! I had a15.6 inch Acer Swift 5 before, which is the lightest notebook ever, but this thing is not much heavier with a much bigger and brighter screen. It seems extremely well made and robust as well. I love the mate magnesium color, it gives it a better look. The i7 tigerlake processor works really fast for any app, I ran on it and 2gb of SSDof internal storage in such a lightweight notebook is just amazing. The only thing I don't like about it is the quality of sound speakers, which are quite mediocre, but still do a decent job. It would be nice to have a touchscreen and better sound for such an amazing computer to make it perfect. These details are not a problem for me and the overall quality of this computer compensates it all. Will see how much time it lasts. Well done LG!</span>

<span>Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!<br/><br/>This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs.<br/><br/>I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it.<br/><br/>The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this.<br/><br/>GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!</span>

<span>I bought this laptop just to have something "mobile" when I want to get online or do some "light work" out of the house (I normally use my desktop computer which is a BEAST!)<br/><br/>I will be using this to watch movies/videos, surf the net, check emails, go on social media and a couple other programs such a OBDII reader that I will use with my OBDII device via wifi or usb to work on my cars.<br/><br/>4GB of ram is good enough for what I will be doing. If I ever feel that it needs a little more power/speed I will add another 4 or 8 but so far it is perfect.<br/><br/>The 128GB SSD is more than enough for what I need and this was one of the key factors that made me buy this computer. Cheaper ones come with eMMC storage which is slower and normally only 32GB or 64GB<br/><br/>It does not have backlit keyboard, I wish it did but it is not a deal breaker and I already knew it didn't have it before placing my order.<br/><br/>It takes about 45 seconds to boot (a little bit on the slow side) but once its loaded it runs pretty smoothly<br/><br/>It came with Windows 11 S More which won't allow you to install anything except from the Microsoft store (I think that's what's called), but getting out of S mode is SUPER EASY, takes less than 1 minute. There are plenty of YouTube videos on how to do that. But, be aware, seems like if you get out of S mode there is no turning back!<br/><br/>In a few words, this is a very good machine for the price. I am not intending to use it for gaming, editing videos or designing. It is strictly for light use (browse the net, documents, watching videos/movies, and a couple of programs that I like that don't require much to run).<br/><br/>It is pretty lightweight, the casing looks nice, the screen is matte and bright enough, the speakers are OK, seems a little bit fragile if you were to drop it or step on it (I am always careful, so this is not a concern). I also like the fact that is a name brand and is not a chrome book!<br/><br/>I don't give it 5 stars because it would've been nice to get it with 8GB and a backlit keyboard. Other than that is perfect for what I need!</span>

Oddly enough, Shift+Home works if you do LShift+RShift+Home, while LShift+RShift+End does not work and is just treated as End.<br/><br/>Probably the most baffling spec about this laptop is its 4 GB of memory. I highly advise to spend an extra $15 on a SODIMM DDR4 chip (preferably 2667 MHz), because 4 GB is nothing nowadays, especially with the increased minimum requirements of Windows 11. Everything was loading pretty slow and programs like JetBrains Rider could barely function because they're constantly fighting for the physical space. Once I popped off the bottom cover and doubled the RAM, everything started going pretty fast afterward. Probably increased its impressive battery life even further.</span>

<span>I needed a laptop with a decent battery life, and room for upgrade. Mostly for office work and media consumption. Web surfing needed, strong wifi, I wanted S mode for security. I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things. I recommend this laptop for the things I've mentioned and the low price. The laptop I bought has the following specs.<br/>Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop was delivered in two days. Core I3, 4gb ram, 128gb NV Me SSD, empty bay for hard drive upgrade. 15.6 display full HD IPS. With Windows 11 S mode. Cost was $308. Delivered by Amazon Driver. I didn't give a rating for touchscreen or gaming, because they do not apply.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Es un buen equipo para estudiantes ,tiene buena calidad de imagen y su diseño es bueno, la descripción del producto es tal como se indicaba en la publicación.<br/>Lo malo es que me llegó con un problema ya que al momento de la configuración del equipo me percate que después de 2 min. de conectar el equipo ya no le llegaba energía al equipo, lo solucioné realizando una actualización de BIOS del equipo.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>
