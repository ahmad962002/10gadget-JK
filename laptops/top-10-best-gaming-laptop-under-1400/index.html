                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I got this product on sale for $599, and it is more than worth the price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Battery life is fairly decent. The only time the battery would burn itself was when I was using additional monitors and graphic intense activities at the same time. Even when the battery may be low, the charge speed is very powerful, and you should have full charge in an hour even if your using the laptop.<br/>-Processor is a beast. i5 10300H has the firepower to run some games that normally require high specs. Dark Souls III runs very smoothly on normal settings, haven't been able to test Elden Ring yet. (This may require more ram.) I'm also able to hook up a monitor, among other peripherals, as well as have other things open, like Discord, without a problem.<br/>-Screen. With 144hz (or 144 visible frames per sec.), you don't need additional monitors to see just how good your games are running.<br/>-RGB Keyboard. Can change how the lights appears, as well as their intensity, or turn them off if you don't need them.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-RAM. With only 8gbs of RAM, you may yourself upgrading to something more using the extra empty RAM slot. Luckily, this laptop is designed to be easily upgraded with a poppable bottom. All you need are screwdrivers that fit and a RAM cartridge of your choice.<br/>-Storage. Again, with only 512gb of space, you may find yourself upgrading using the empty extra M.2 SSD spot. One thing to keep in mind is that this laptop will only support up to Gen 3, so make sure to save some money and not but a Gen 4 SSD, as you will not get the full power out of it.<br/>-Graphics Card. The GTX 1650 isn't exactly the best graphics card out there, but it gets by for meeting recommended settings on older games, while meeting minimum requirements for newer more graphic intense games.</span>

<span>Bought this PC for my 18 year old daughter as a beginner gaming laptop and the laptop handles World's of Warcraft, Sims, Seven Days to Die and many other large games flawlessly! Now we did upgrade the amount of R.A.M from 8Gb to 32Gb. But it's a great laptop.</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop to replaced my old ASUS laptop,I needed something faster and runs smoother however I do have to add more ram because it does slows down and sometimes freeze. I wasn’t intended to use it for gaming I just wanted it for normal internet browsing,and also using it when I’m live streaming for twitch that’s about it. It’s a beautiful laptop I definitely like it very convenient for me.</span>

<span>--Note, after 3 weeks of owning i decided to return this. I stand by my review, i feel the laptop is good for casual gaming, but i ended up wanting to PC game full time, and this wasn't going to cut the mustard.<br/><br/>This is my first gaming PC, and overall its good.<br/>For the price, i think its a great snag, BUT if you plan on using this PC as your main gaming station, or plan on playing every game out there, id buy something else.<br/><br/>This PC has run every game ive thrown at it, but it runs noticeably worse when running newer games, or higher demanding games.<br/>You wont be getting 144 frames on majority of games without dropping every graphics setting to low, and even after that you most likely will not get 144 frames.<br/>Max i was able to get for Insurgency Sandstorm was 80ish, Ready or not 80ish,  Death Stranding 60, Madden 23 60, Apex Legends 120s, GTA 4 60s. I had to run these games on low settings to get these frames, and it wasn't steady. I was dropping down to the 20-30 ALOT when playing Insurgency and Ready or Not. Even GTA4 was pretty janky while driving and shooting.<br/>I got max Frames in Valorant, Counter Strike GO, and all older games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, Left4Dead 2 i was able to play on ultra graphics.<br/><br/>Graphics card is meh. I can easily notice the graphics dropoff when playing Apex and Madden on here, then hopping on Series X and playing them, its a steep drop off. The issue is you cant play a majority of games on medium or high settings, which also hurts the graphics big time.<br/><br/>The screen is excellent. Its anti glare, and very clear. I ended up buying a second monitor to game on, just because 15inches is too small after years of gaming on a 50inch TV, BUT i could have gotten away with gaming on this screen.<br/><br/>Battery is pretty bad, but i usually always have it plugged in. Just web browsing at 50% brightness youre getting 2 hours battery life.<br/><br/>I see some reviews claiming that the Wifi adapter is bad, i havent experienced this. I game upstairs on wifi, my router is downstairs, and i usually get 25 ping in online games, which is pretty great. I also got 150ish download on steam. Ive never gotten buffering when watching a video, or live stream(I watched the Bills vs Rams game last night on this without any buffering).<br/><br/>I highly recommend upgrading the ram if you do end up buying, the max this PC can use is 24 RAM, so i installed the Crucial RAM 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22, very easy install.<br/><br/>Speeds for the PC are very fast. From web browsing, to gaming, to tab switching, everything is very fast, even faster than my Macbook 2020.<br/><br/>Overall its a solid gaming laptop, just go in knowing the limitations going in. Id recommend for casual /light gamers.</span>

<span>Lenovo laptops are usually very reliable. I’ve used them for work and used a friend’s for gaming on one occasion. The things to love about this specific Lenovo Laptop are the size, the ventilation, and the speed. First of all, the screen is an optimum size for gaming. I have been needing to cast games onto my larger monitor for better visuals but I find that this screen is often too big for a more specific focus (especially in shooter games) and this screen is truly the perfect size—not too small, not too big. This also features quad vent ventilation which helps it keep cool even with long-term usage. Usually, these computers need an extra strong fan which can be a bit noisy, but this fan is nice and quiet and goes on with more of a lulling noise than a mechanical one. It can actually be quite calming! I’ve used this for over 3 hours at a time and didn’t notice any extreme heat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this computer is a bit heavier than the others I’ve used before. If you want this to be stationary for a desk, then that is fine, but laptops are meant for travel and this one is a lug to bring anywhere. It charges quickly but the battery is extremely large and is the majority of the weight here. I haven’t had any issues with battery life so far (it is about 6-8 hour battery life, and more like 4 when used consistently for gaming).<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a great computer for gaming. The matte screen helps with eye fatigue, the battery life is excellent for long-term use, and the fan is nice and quiet for white noise. I recommend it!</span>

<span>Lenovo - 2022 - IdeaPad Gaming notebook<br/><br/>(Photo included with a widescreen monitor -- the notebook is that black shadow at the bottom)<br/><br/>Imagine you could buy a muscle car with all the parts which would be prohibitive to upgrade, like the engine block, but missing some optional parts needed to squeeze the last horsepower out of it, but wouldn't be too hard to add aftermarket. The price reflects this, and happens to match what you can spend right then.<br/><br/>There's a good chance you would go with this deal, wouldn't you? You would still have an awesome car, and you could beef it up more later with added parts. It's like money in the bank. This notebook is like that car: it has the right motors, but is a little scanty on RAM and storage--the parts than can be upgraded.<br/><br/>Out of the box you get 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD... minimalist by today's standards, but capacity to upgrade the memory to 64GB and the disks to 2TB later. I can tell you I paired this with an Alienware 38 inch ultra wide monitor, and as soon as I switched to external display only, the graphics processor knew exactly what to do with that bad boy. Other than that, I'm not a big fan of keyboards which leave your firearms resting on a large flat spot but there are many options for external keyboards. It's there if you need it.<br/><br/>On another less than perfect note, it's been a while since I activated a new Windows machine (11 Home), and I thought, this time I'm going to go with the program, Microsoft account and all, and see what MS can do for me today! I started down that path but soon they were trying to sell me an Office 365 subscription: just be a good fellow and give us your credit card now, would you? And maybe some games? The more I played along the more depressingly familiar it all seemed. Sorry, not today, MS, not today. Nothing has changed here and they might want to market to the new user like an adult.<br/><br/>This is still a solid notebook with potential, and pursuing the car metaphor the blue fins in back are a clear nod to BMW, the last automaker to embrace a full line of ICE standard shifts. I hope to own one while there is still fuel left, but perhaps there is a convincing simulation.<br/><br/>  *UPDATE*<br/><br/>On July 12 Lenovo released Security Advisory: LEN-91369 concerning a vulnerability in UEFI, which allows the insertion of malware with all the cunning and inextricability of viral DNA hiding in the mitochondria.<br/><br/>I checked the best candidate I could find for the model number against their list of affected machines: no match though many of their high-end laptops were vulnerable. I guess that's a good thing.</span>

<span>THE GOOD:<br/>--------------<br/>* Aesthetically, a very cool looking laptop. Looks menacing, looks high tech. Makes me think of Alienware.<br/>* Ram is not soldered, and is upgradeable.<br/>* SSD drives are upgradeable too.<br/>* Windows 11 Home out the box.<br/>* Comes with 3 months of Ultimate Game Pass from Xbox/Microsoft. Doesn't say this anywhere in the listing, so it was a pleasant surprise for my kid. You find this out during the process of setting up the laptop.<br/>* Advertised for gaming, but hardcore gamers will find it a little light. But for a child using it as a school laptop, this is perfect. Much better than the Chromebooks, and for Roblox and Minecraft, which is all my kid does, this is more than enough.<br/>* Nevertheless, if you want to boost the ram and ssd, you'll need to know how to remove the bottom cover. Search YT for, "Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3i (15", 2022) - disassembly and upgrade options." Click on the very top search result. The video is by LaptopMedia. They disassemble several similar models, but this is the term you want to search to get to the exact model. However, keep in mind that he's disassembling the intel version which uses DDR4 ram, you'll be using DDR5 for this Ryzen model.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>------------<br/>* Screen is only 1080P.<br/>* Ram is only 8GB, but again, you can upgrade this.<br/>* If truly using for gaming, you'll need more than 256GB. My son will mainly use it for school, so this won't be an issue.<br/>* No touchscreen.<br/>* Regarding power supply... Not necessarily a bad, but a tip. If you have children, then you know when they take their tablets and notebooks to relatives or friend's house, the power supply goes too. Instead of constantly unplugging the one that is supposed to be stationary at their table, I always buy a second power supply. For this model, it's a 170W with the Lenovo rectangle usb head. You can buy any 3rd party, just make sure it's 170W with the rectangle head.<br/><br/>Despite listing some items in the bad list, I understand it's par for the course in terms of the price you're paying. If you want all of those features included, your price would go up. My kid loves it, we'll go 4-Stars overall for now.</span>

<span>I am very pleased with this very upgradable entry level laptop from Lenovo. I have found gaming laptops are also very good for video and photo editing because of the enhanced graphic support. I’m also comfortable with things like taking apart laptops and doing upgrades. That’s where I’m coming from in the review of this laptop.<br/><br/>The first things that I like to look at are the screen, keyboard and touch pad. These are THE points of interaction with computers. The visual and tactile experience can make a computer a joy when well done and a horror when not. I’m very happy with this aspect of this laptop. The screen is non-touch which is fine with me (fewer fingerprints!) and has a HD resolution of 1920X1080. On this size screen that good in my opinion.  The keyboard feelis nicer than the average laptop I’ve been using; much better than the too common chiclet key abominations. The back lighting is well done and a plus for me. The touchpad was fine when I adjusted the settings to my preferences.<br/><br/>It comes with 8GB of RAM and only a 256GB NVMe SSD drive. Both what I would consider about half of desirable in a *gaming* laptop. The good news is this laptop is blessed with 2 NVMe slots for drives so you can either add a second and hopefully much larger NVMe drive and/or replace the existing one with a bigger one. Oddly Lenovo says the max size drive for these is 1TB?!?!? I didn’t have a 2TB drive to try. Sorry! RAM is easily upgradeable too and you can add-in a second 8GB stick or go crazy with up to two 32GB sticks the DDR5 RAM. I love these components are so easily upgraded and just a little disappointed they were a bit undersized to start with.<br/><br/>Connectivity is a bit less than I would hope with only a single USB-C port and just 2 USB-A ports, no SD card reader (really?) and a single HDMI port though the USB-C supports DisplayPort.<br/><br/>The Ryzen CPU works well and I’m pretty pleased with Its performance. I’d been using Intel CPU’s and if it didn’t have the AMD brand on the laptop I’d not know or care which brand. I just does what I need quickly and that’s enough for me.<br/><br/>It comes loaded with Windows 11 *HOME* which I upgraded to PRO which I prefer. This may not matter for  many but it does matter to me. There is bloatware but it was easy for me to remove.<br/><br/>Things I find interesting are:<br/>- No SD card reader included – surprise!<br/>- The screen’s camera is only 720p but has a built-in Privacy Shutter<br/>+ The built-in sound/speakers are better than I expected. Nice!<br/>+ The claimed battery life is 5.7h based on “mobilemark”, but just playing local video almost 10h I’m not sure how realistic this may be as I use mine connect to AC most of the time<br/>- The power adapter is a 170W unit with a proprietary Slim Tip plug. Why not USB-C power adapter?<br/>+ At 5.1lbs this is an average weight for a “gamed-up” laptop and I expect 1lb is from the 45Wh battery<br/>+ It has a well-placed (on the rear) gigabit Ethernet jack<br/>+ The Wi-Fi 6 11ax, 2x2 + BT5.2 is welcome with full support of current standards<br/>- There is NO fingerprint reader. I used to poo-poo them but now love them. A USB one is an easy add-on at the price of dedicating a USB port<br/>- It only comes with a 1 year depot-drop/ship warranty<br/><br/>Here are the ports on this laptop:<br/>+ 2x USB 3.2 Gen 1<br/>+ 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (support data transfer, Power Delivery 3.0, and DisplayPort 1.4)<br/>+ 1x HDMI 2.0<br/>+ 1x Ethernet (RJ-45)<br/>+ 1x Headphone / microphone combo jack (3.5mm)<br/>+  1x Power connector<br/><br/>Overall I’m very pleased with this laptop for my use which is mainly around video and photo editing rather than gaming. I’ve upgraded the drive and RAM which Lenovo has made easy. There are some disappointment but at this price point I don’t expect to get a laptop that ticks 100% of my checklist perfectly. I’d consider this Lenovo 15in gaming laptop a good value. That why I’m giving it 5 stars.</span>

<span>No issues with the laptop at all, everything works perfectly. I am just used to using heavily cpu and gpu intensive applications, this computer gets very warm on the keyboard, the fans keep it reasonable, but doing anything is going to mean the fans are going and a lot of heat will get created. Love how small and light it is comparatively. I love the RGB keyboard, I can set it to a faint blueish purple, wasn't expecting that from all of the advertising images. The ergonomics for typing are a bit strange too, the keyboard is fine, but with how far back they are set, it almost makes you want to have a desk with an inset and lots of ventilation in the inset for ergonomic purposes. Oh, also I have no idea how much of the sRGB colorspace the monitor can display, and I can't calibrate it, but everything feels very yellow and washed out compared to my previous monitor, which I think was miniled.</span>

<span>I got this laptop almost a month ago now, and it does everything I wanted and then some; however, there are a few downsides I've discovered since owning it, but I think a couple of them is just Windows 11 being buggy.<br/>First, it gets really, really hot. Absurdly hot. I installed Core Temp to keep an eye on the CPU temperatures, and it gets up to 90C+! The normal safety shutoff for motherboards is 80C, and even at 80C that's cooking the CPU. With the temperatures going above 80C, I hope it will still last a while. I didn't want a laptop that would only last as long as the warranty.<br/>Second, and I think this one is Windows 11, the screen has weird artifacts if you don't shut down for a few days. I'm a user that only puts my computers to sleep instead of shutting down; it doesn't hurt it, but it does use a small amount of electricity to keep it running. With this laptop, the screen flickers after a few days of this if anything moved/updated, and I've even had an issue where part of the screen was being duplicated.<br/>Third, I would say is more of a me issue than a laptop issue. You have to open the lid to press the power button. I keep the laptop shut when I am at my desk to use my monitors, and I got a dock for when I'm at my desk. There is no power button on the dock I got nor any I looked at, and the only way to turn on the laptop is to open the lid, press the power button, and close the lid back.<br/>Fourth, it gets REALLY slow when it's not plugged in. Absurdly slow. I understand that when it's not plugged in, it's using the CPU as the GPU as well, but there's a HUGE difference in performance when it's plugged in vs on battery. It's usually not that noticable.<br/>Fifth, is the battery. If you're searching the web (not streaming anything), you won't have issues with the battery life, and it'll probably last you around 3 hours on one full charge; however, if you're like me and using the laptop for working or streaming, it will barely last an hour to hour and a half. Maybe I can find an extended battery or something down the road, but for now, the battery life isn't so great.<br/>I know I've only mentioned the negatives I've found, but I did give it a 5 star review. These can be overlooked with the positives I've experienced vs my tower PC.</span>

<span>I now am a major fan of Asus. The last laptop I had was an Asus Vivobook and it did its job but was a few gens behind. This laptop is so fast almost as much as my PC build which has an i7-10700K and 3060ti. If your looking for an affordable deal and good investment that performs well for most games plus browsing, look no further. Upgraded from 8 to 24 gb of ram and added an nvme ssd card which took about an hour. Be sure to setup windows first before installing any storage or memory. This laptop is it!</span>

<span>I spent a while deciding on a lower end gaming machine to get after growing weary of PSN offerings over the last few years. Have been a console player on PSN for 27 years and wanted a good machine to start my PC adventures again. For PC Gaming you have to have good gear. And man can this machine deliver! It boots up and shuts down in about 5-7 seconds and flys through games and apps. I'm running Xbox live, Steam, Epic games with no issues.<br/><br/>The keyboard is nice, one of the reasons I picked this machine, very comfortable to use hours on end. Fans are loud, as most of these gaming machines are, but really not too bad...I don't ever really notice them while I'm playing. I run my HDMI out to a 4K gaming monitor and it runs great. Some people complain about the touch pad, but I never use it....using the Nitro gaming mouse and love it. I like the thin bezel screen design, keeping those red LED's on my keyboard. Some gaming laptops do not have a good keyboard layout...this one is nice.<br/><br/>I also can confirm this works with Meta Quest 2 with a link cable (to a decent degree). Some low end gaming laptops do not even have a USB 3.0 port, this one does. Don't expect this machine to work great on all VR games and it takes a bit of tweaking to get your system running smooth, I did have some issues with a couple Steam VR games. But I can confirm it works reasonably well with VR Pokerstars and PopOne is playable (I still prefer wireless for that as there is not a real advantage in using link cable, but it was a great test on framerate and playability). I will be trying more VR games eventually. You do have to optimize this laptop a bit but not too much to do , trim down the fat. But it is fun exploring what this machine can do with VR games.<br/><br/>Some tips:<br/>I HIGHLY recommend getting another Ram stick, 16Gig min. (I'm running 16 Gig and always have 4-8 Gigs free) . At 8 Gigs it's just not enough.  I also highly recommend getting a larger SSD card (just add on) as these games do take up space quickly. I dropped in a 1 TB card so I am at 1.2 TB now. Taking the back cover off was not really too hard, once you take the screws off and pop off the first latch, just be careful as this case is plastic.<br/><br/>I use an adjustable metal laptop stand and have the back raised 3 or 4 inches to keep the air flow underneath good (lowered down a bit) , after a couple months of use it seems to work well and gives me a comfortable angle to use the keyboard.</span>

<span>This was the first gaming computer I ever bought, so I had no idea that the plugs were different from regular computers. When I first plugged it in and tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I thought I got a bum computer! I called the number on the package and was told that gaming computers have different plugs than standard computers, and that I had to push the plug into the back of the computer all the way until I heard a click. I thought I had, but when I pushed on it again I heard the click and it started right up.<br/><br/>Onto the computer itself... the graphics are great, the speed has worked well for all the games used so far (Minecraft, Bloons TD6, etc.), the picture is vivid, and I have no complaints so far!</span>

<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>The laptop seems to work okay but I would hesitate to buy one again.  From my perspective:<br/>Cons.<br/>1.  Slow to boot up.  My previous laptop was less expensive, had a slower processer, and booted up in half the time.  It was an Acer.  The Acer did fail hard though.<br/>2.  Hot.  When holding on my lap it gets warmer than I like.  It needs a better cooling solution.  I buy a laptop for use on my lap, not a desk.<br/>3.  Hard to upgrade.  I like to add a second hard drive for backing up data.  This laptop has a spot but you must break the warranty seal and it isn't very easy to split the case.  Be careful to not crack any of the plastic case.<br/>4.  On the pricy side.  Given my experience so far I think this laptop is over priced.<br/>5.  Keyboard is minimal, I like a few of the numeric keys that are missing on this keyboard.  My old Acer was the same size and had the keys so they could fit.<br/>Pros.<br/>1. The display seems nice and clear, though similar to my older Acer which I also liked.<br/><br/>Overall right now I would not purchase this laptop again.  However if it is significantly more durable than my old Acer I will be happy with my purchase.  If Acer's were more durable I would have bought another one over the MSI.</span>

<span>With a GTX 1650, i5 11400 processor, 144hz refresh rate, 8gb RAM, and windows 11 OS for $545 you can't go wrong. Using the site howmanyfps you can compare this laptop to other laptops of similar value. This outperforms every single one of the laptops in the similar price range (actually outperforms quite a few higher priced laptops). It can run every game I play in high or medium settings at 120fps at 1440p. This thing is a beast for the price. It does run pretty hot, so if you plan on doing extensive gaming then a cooling stand would be a good purchase.</span>

<span>Hello to anyone who is actually reading this. So I bought this budget gaming latop and kept it for like 5 days and I was a little disappointed in it. It can do work/business things very well but for gaming....not so much. When played minecraft, raid shadow legends, forager, borderlands 2, and other fun games, the fan got really loud. Or the top of the keyboard got really hot since it was made of some type of metal. Of course I used the msi app thing to mess with the fan speed; having the fan lowered made the keyboard really hot. But to have the keyboard cooled, the fan has to be loud...but overall, it's a really good work/business laptop.</span>

<span>Son really into gaming. This is a really good entry level gaming rig. We have it set up to display on a monitor, but when he's using it out and about the screen is good. The only upgrade he made was another hard drive. It is quite loud when he's playing, but he wears head phones, so it doesn't bother him.</span>

<span>This 2022 Nitro 5 refresh has improved cooling so they can crank up power limits on the 3060 at 140w. They've also added a MUX. The thermal is not as well tuned as a lenovo legion 5, but it is not substantial enough of a difference to matter. Can run the processor at near max boost for quite a bit.<br/><br/>The GPU is imo the sweetspot choice on a laptop. 3060 is around 80% of the performance of a 3070 Ti but with a lot less heat generated, and the performance is high enough to be future proof for quite a while on 1080p.<br/><br/>Note: purchase price was 1199, so with raised price maybe not as good of a deal.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I tend to prattle exhaustively so I tried to divvy up my numerous opinions into sections you might find relevant.<br/><br/>Now/Future = I've been very pleased with this laptop, and I do consider it a great deal for the six hundy spent (on the 9th Gen Intel Core i5-9300H). Not only does it perform splendidly as it comes "right out the box", but it's also upgradeable in the near future as tech advances and my finances allow. I've been using it for hours on end everyday for almost one month.<br/><br/>Multitasking = I can run WoW (weeeeee!!) while simultaneously streaming music on Spotify in my web browser. Beyond that, I can also minimize my game and music to do a quick Google on whatever boss I'm trying to squelch as I solo dungeons with my Night Elf Demon Hunter. No lag or stuttering while multitasking whatsoever. Nice. B-)<br/><br/>Graphics quality = It comes with 2 graphics cards, so be sure to check your in-game settings to make sure the best card is selected. Streaming Netflix and running WoW are lovely in a way I wasn't able to appreciate on my previous HP laptop. My only concern is that once in a while I've seen a rolling screen dim from top to bottom for a split second before it returns to normal. It has only happened a couple of times in the past month I've owned this, so?<br/><br/>Pre-installed software = I had to find workarounds to disable Bing and Microsoft Edge, but in the end I can now use the search box on the start bar and it opens Google results in Chrome. Those being my preferred search engine and web browser. It wasn't terribly difficult as an amateur tinkerer.<br/><br/>Heat = Sometimes I use the laptop on my actual lap (go figure), and when I've been immersed in my addiction for 4-5 hours, it gets rather warm. Almost hot. The pre-installed Nitrosense app allows you to manage the fan settings in order to allay this. Also of note is that the heat escape is on the right side, which means south paws keep their leading hand cool and us orthodox boxers get a warm periodic reminder to move our hand away from the keyboard. In plain words: the heat from the fans blows directly where one would naturally rest one's hand on a mouse (if you use one, however, a mouse is not included).<br/><br/>Keyboard = The keys are comfortably spaced, appropriately sensitive to touch, and all are in working condition. The value of the number pad on a laptop cannot be understated!! The red backlight on the keyboard by default times out after 30 seconds. Finding the right key to strike first on an all-black keyboard after the backlight turns off was obnoxious to me. After some searching, I found that this too is changeable in the Nitrosense app. Weird place to put it, but ok. Hit the "(N)" key in the top left of the number pad, then click the Settings gear inside Nitrosense, and click to toggle off the "backlight off after 30 seconds" option. This might not be available on every model, but take a gander.<br/><br/>Battery life = The battery lasts for a decent amount of time when simply browsing and streaming music: several hours, give or take. But I prefer/recommend plugging in the power cord when I know I'm about to sit down for a long session of questing. ("Just one more quest!!")<br/><br/>Port/Cable management = Speaking of the power cable... It must have been a desperate decision to seat it on the righthand side of the laptop in the middle. The configuration of the internal hardware almost certainly has to be to blame for this. It seems like they tried to offset this inconvenience by making the power cable with a immediate 90 degree bend so you can swivel it (hopelessly) out of the way.<br/><br/>Final summation = I listed things things that I believe could be improved which were mostly cosmetic in nature and were either adjustable or could be lived with. But on the whole, this laptop has been a game-changer for my usual activities and has truly been a "best bang for your buck" experience. I recommend it for anyone who is maybe moderately into gaming but mostly wants a very reliable and delightful experience.</span>

<span>Great laptop for the price, I don't think you can find a laptop this great at this price point. Appearance looks great, great build quality, keyboard does not at all feel cheap at all and the keyboard backlight is a great touch. Very lightweight. Touch pad is large and responsive. I have not tried the fingerprint scanner yet. Decently fast boot up times given it has an SSD. Battery life is actually pretty great, too. I am happy with the ports, it even has a USB C port. Screen gets very bright.<br/><br/>It also took about 5 minutes to put in an 8GB ram stick in the easily accessible and open ram slot.<br/><br/>Some cons of course since this is a budget laptop (these cons can be considered "normal" at this price point):<br/> - Full HD display with 1080P screen, however the color quality, especially blacks and other colors is not great. It feels like white is overwhelming compared to other colors. But otherwise at this price point it is OK in my opinion, just that there is a very noticeable difference compared to my 700 dollar laptop.<br/>- CPU kind of sucks. I added 8 GB of ram which did make the computer faster, but downloading things or loading times can be slow with the CPU being the issue. However it is tolerable and I am overall happy with the speed for this price point and do not feel I have to crutch on my other high end laptops.<br/>- The acer 5 series is usually marketed as "slim", but this laptop is definitely not slim. It isn't bulky though, I think it is very average or more in thickness compared to actual slim laptops on the market.<br/><br/>If you have 330 dollars only to spend and are on a tight budget, don't hesitate to get this laptop. If you do purchase this laptop, I would DEFINITELY recommend adding additional ram (I got 8GB ram for 25 bucks at microcenter) since it is super easy to upgrade the ram in this computer, and it made a noticeable difference in browsing, loading, scroll speeds. If you have an additional 100 dollars more to spend, I would go ahead and purchase a more expensive laptop for a better screen, and the next price-tier laptops usually have additional ram.</span>

<span>I bought this for my wife, who does e-Bay, Skype calls to family, normal business stuff and no gaming. I was very surprised that it have better performance than I expect for an entry level machine. The screen and keyboard are magnificent.<br/><br/>The only problem I have is that there is no removeable battery. That means that if you are installing a second hard drive there is no way to know if your machine is truly off. If you do that, ignore the instructions and add the additional step of disconnecting the battery cable before you plug in the cable. Welding is not something you want to do in the innards of a new laptop. The laptop is fine, so the design is resilient. We just don't have the use of a second disk drive or the USB connector on the left side.</span>
