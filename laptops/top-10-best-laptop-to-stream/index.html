<span>For the money I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I've had the machine for about 3 weeks now and it only took 3 days to arrive, just in time for me to prepare documents, etc for my troop meeting. My only complaint is trying to use M364 tools (Word) was VERY slow so I reverted back to Google docs. I'm downloading all our wedding photos to it so it will probably take up most of the 64 GB of space but I'm ok with that as well.</span>

<span>I bought this HP Stream because my 2012 Mac is dead and I really don't use a computer anymore. My iPhone 12 Pro works just fine for everyday use, and I just can't afford to buy a new Mac right now. So, I just needed an inexpensive little computer to connect to the internet to do personal business and take online classes. I do not intend to store anything on this computer, but rather continue to use my iCloud for storage and Google Apps if necessary.<br/><br/>You can download the necessary cloud apps such as iCloud, Google Drive, and shortcuts to Google Docs, Sheets, or whatever you like. Once I got the computer set up, I went in and uninstalled Microsoft Office. I don't care that it's free for a year. Google Suite works just fine.<br/><br/>I've used this computer quite a bit, and this is what I think about it...<br/><br/>Contrary to the negative reviews, this computer doesn't suck. You just can't have high expectations of a $350 laptop. You will be setting yourself up for a bitter disappointment. With that said....<br/><br/>The mouse and keyboard are horrible and uncomfortable to use for my taste. Granted I don't intend to use it away from home very often, but I did a couple of times and it really doesn't function like I'm used to. Also, I can't really say for certain that the wi-fi connections were all that great. It could've been the networks I was connected to. For some reason it wouldn't let me connect to my iPhone hotspot. I don't know if there is a setting that I have to adjust, but it shouldn't have been that difficult to connect.<br/><br/>However, it works FANTASTIC when I switch out my work laptop and connect it to my desk set up where it's hardwired to the internet and connected to a USB keyboard and mouse.  I am able to do personal business that requires me to use a computer rather than my iPhone. This computer IS NOT built to have sophisticated software installed such as Office, FilemakerPro, Quickbooks, Photoshop etc. It is also, not meant to store large files or photos. It is PERFECT to use cloud based software and storage.<br/><br/>I recommend this laptop as an internet terminal and NOTHING MORE! I cannot express this enough....do not expect it to perform in any other way. It's a perfect light use laptop to connect to social media (if that's your thing) or even school,  or access websites that you really can't on your smartphone. It's an affordable option as a transitional workstation.<br/><br/>Some people complained about not being able to update Windows due to lack of disk space. I suggest that you make sure you purge temporary files, internet cache, and downloads often. Also uninstall applications that you do not use or are unnecessary. This will free up a bunch of disk space. If you are using Office360, this will take up a ridiculous amount of disk space. I know it's free for the first year...but is that really worth your low disk space frustration? While you could get a Chromebook, I'm not keen to them. In a Windows OS you can set up Google Suite. It's cloud based, free, and doesn't have a trial period. You won't have to pay a subscription to keep and all your documents, photos, etc. They will be gone if you don't move them out of OneDrive and to another cloud storage at the end of the trial period. Why bother? Just set up Google account, which comes with free storage, use their version of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc and you don't have to install it on your computer. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop with the sole purpose of installing Linux. I didn't want to mess with my better computers Secure Boot to try to dual boot it. I  had read on one website that this particular model, and this processor worked well with Linux.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that Manjaro XFCE Linux installed and booted flawlessly. The only thing I had to do was change the display resolution - very easy to do with the graphical tools included. The only problem was a setting the proper time. I had to do that through the terminal, but was extremely simple and has maintained the proper time ever since.<br/><br/>The display quality doesn't match my more expensive laptop, but is more than  acceptable for normal use, including watching videos. The computer is fairly responsive for normal use, including watching videos.  All in all,  I am happy with this computer for running a Linux distribution.</span>

<span>Everything about this laptop is slow. Watching videos is super slow and struggles to load, everything is super bad! And the sound! God the awful sound! Its so horrible! It has a loud screech and cuts through your ears, it sounds horrible. Like it's being played through a tin can that got thrown into a blender! If you even wanted to play a small game on it, good luck! This can't even handle 2d games like Stardew Valley or the original Binding of Isaac. Something an old phone could handle! But alas, I guess is should have spent an extra $100 on a better laptop. I'm tempted to send this right to the trash and get a new one. Unfortunately i couldn't afford that, save yourself the trouble, spend more on a better laptop, cause if you buy this crap, you'll have to buy another one anyways.</span>

<span>Great laptop &amp; value for the price. Got mine for $223 plus tax it came out to $245 plus change. Not bad considering other sellers on amazon had it starting at $250 without tax. It also stated that it wasn't going to be in stock until Jan 12th 2020 , that might of been why it was cheaper since i was ordering before it was in stock. But it ended up coming way before that i purchased it on the 4th &amp; it was shipped &amp; i received it on the 6th. Awesome laptop nice &amp; lightweight. &amp; best of all it's NOT A CHROMEBOOK. You can actually download stuff &amp; it's a real computer w/a real OS. Glad i purchased this instead of another chromebook. Big thumbs up !!!</span>

<span>I'm a Mac user. I'm a Mac user because I hate fixing computers. I hate "setup wizards" and I hate viruses. I bought this HP Stream because I needed a Windows 10 machine for programming an Anytone 878UV Plus (Ham radio)<br/>This thing is a great value for the money. Small, light, and works great. Slapped a couple other programs on it and they run great.<br/>I'm not using it to run anything heavy, so keep that in mind. Not the fastest, but works perfectly for my needs.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop a few weeks ago (with warranty). So far it's great. College hasn't started yet so I don't know how well it will work with classes yet. But it works well with streaming Netflix, Hulu, etc and also works very well if you need to stream your PlayStation 4 or XBox One. (Note that when you download the PS4 Remote app, start it up with your PS4 remote, it will take a few try's to connect to your PS4 via Wi-Fi unless its in your own home and make sure your PS4 is already on. Im still working on remotely playing my XBox One and setting that up.) The screen is amazing, computer is fast, very lightweight for on the go. Yes, it is a small screen, but it is not ridiculously small that you can't complete tasks, etc or won't make viewing your games/movies that difficult. This is not a gaming laptop, by the way, but great to stream and the lagging isn't that terrible either. Streaming Netflix, Hulu, etc has no lagging. Great Laptop!</span>
