<span>Got for a steam gamer kid's birthday. He was really happy with the hardware and design. So far it's handled everything he can throw at it, performance wise. Setup and upgrades were very easy. It's heavy, but it's huge and a great machine. The cooling system is kinda loud, but it works well to offset the heat produced. Definitely not a very portable laptop due to weight, but very sturdy and absolutely gorgeous. Really happy with the purchase.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>REASON FOR PURCHASE - I purchased this laptop because my Dell XPS 8100 desktop kept freezing/restarting several times a day.  A fresh clean re-install of Windows 10 was not remedying the situation, and I had no desire to troubleshoot every component to see what was the underlying problem.  Overall, this issue was seriously affecting my productivity, as well as sanity.<br/><br/>POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES - I was mainly looking for a desktop replacement - not a laptop.  I checked Dell, Amazon, BestBuy, as well as other 'PC build' websites such as 'ibuypower', but found prices too high overall.  Basically, the price was the driving factor for me in purchasing this laptop.  The final price was slightly under $1,300 w/ taxes, and I found that to be a fair price for performance ratio.<br/><br/>MUST HAVES - Since this was my first PC replacement in nearly 10-years, I wanted to make sure I got a 11th Gen i7 Intel processor, as well as an RTX 3000 series graphics card.  I was looking for a RTX 3060ti minimum, but I could not find a match within my budget.<br/><br/>PREVIOUS HARDWARE - My Dell XPS 8100 was still using the 1st Gen i5 650 processor, with a PNY GTX 970 updated graphics card.  I honestly would have gone another year or two before changing my PC, if these freezing problems were not there.<br/><br/>FIRST IMPRESSIONS - Seems well built - I also liked the keyboard lighting.  Chassis seems solid, and I liked all the available ports on the sides.  The design was appealing, being perfectly rectangle with the lid closed - no protruding sections to put the shape out of balance.<br/><br/>HOW IT IS USED - I use this laptop as a desktop replacement - I only open the screen lid to power it on.  Otherwise, I use an external monitor and keyboard.<br/><br/>HOW OFTEN USED - I keep this laptop on for at least 8-hours a day.  It was purchased roughly a month ago, so it's been used rather frequently.<br/><br/>GAMING (@ 1080p only) - It is a notable upgrade from my Dell.  Previously in games like WoW or FFXIV, I was getting under 60 FPS frequently in crowded areas.  Now, I get dizzy by how quickly the screen rotates in-game, forcing me to lower the mouse-sensitivity.  In WoW, I am constantly at 100 FPS with the occasional dips to 90 FPS.  I'm also currently playing Ubisoft's 'The Division', but the max I can get is 60 FPS with regular dips to 47 FPS @ medium settings.  Not killer performance, but a huge upgrade nevertheless.<br/><br/>FAN NOISE - For everyday non-gaming use (i.e., web browsing), it is a low hum you can only hear if you're within 20-inches to the laptop.  When gaming, it can ramp up to a constant loud whirl.<br/><br/>HEAT - Similarly to fan noise, heat is negligible for non-gaming use.  For gaming, it can get warm over time, but I use this product: 'Zimilar Monitor Stand Riser', to keep it propped up for heat dissipation.  It seems to work well in keeping this laptop cool.<br/><br/>STORAGE - It only comes with one 512GB M.2 device, so storage for my gaming needs is very limited.  I looked at YouTube videos to see if it can be upgraded, but it honestly looked like a PITA to do so.  So, I have invested in external SSD solutions for space.<br/><br/>WIFI – My router is roughly 25-feet away (through walls), but I get consistent download/upload speeds with the occasional dip.  No major connection loss or issues otherwise.<br/><br/>BLOATWARE - It comes with a lot of MSi propriety software, as well as Norton Security Suite.  Also, a trial version of Microsoft Office 365.  I spent a good amount of time sorting through, and uninstalling a lot of them.<br/><br/>BATTERY - I've only tested it off the plug once.  Even without gaming, it was eating through the battery pretty quickly.  I surmise it'd only go about 3-hours before draining out.  This laptop is definitely not recommended if longevity off the plug is a priority of yours.<br/><br/>PROBLEMS – The only ‘issue’ I’ve come across is if I’ve gamed for a long period of time, or I’ve been moving large files around.  The performance of the laptop may drop significantly.  I remedy this by a simple reboot, which clears up the issue.  Also to note, this laptop has not frozen on me once.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - When I purchased this laptop, I considered it an intermediary, until I gathered the necessary funds to invest in a desktop with a minimum of RTX 3070.  However, it has proven to be a mini-powerhouse.  I don't play above 1080p, and I can live with medium-settings if performance seems to dip.  It performs excellently on non-gaming tasks, and I now have a mobile gaming platform if I want to take it to a friend's house.  All-in-all, I am quite satisfied with my purchase, and may now wait until the RTX 4000 series come out before I consider a desktop.<br/><br/>Overall, highly recommended for purchase.<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>UPDATE 08/28/2022<br/><br/>CURRENT STATUS - Yes, it's still working fine.  Performance has not dipped, and I only re-installed Windows 11 once because I replaced the 512GB M.2 with a 'Samsung 970 EVO 2TB' several months ago.  Also, despite being on 8-hours a day or more, the keyboard LEDs are still functioning bright.  That's more than 2,900-hours that this laptop has been on since its purchase.<br/><br/>HARDWARE ISSUES - None.  Screen, ports, fans, WiFi, Bluetooth, and trackpad are all still working fine - of course given the caveat that I still strictly use an external keyboard/mouse/monitor setup.<br/><br/>NEW REVELATIONS - Only one.  Gaming off the AC Adaptor is a fool's errand.  Performance throttled severely after 10-minutes because the laptop was getting so hot, and the battery lasted no more than 35-minutes tops.  This was while playing 'Aliens: Fireteam' on Steam.<br/><br/>PRODUCT OVERVIEW - I am still happy with my purchase and see no need to change for several more years.  Of course, if I find myself with a lot of disposable income, I can see myself getting a new gaming desktop.  But beyond that scenario, I am perfectly content with its performance and durability.</span>

<span>I love MSI, I really do, but as many know, MSI isn't the best, but it works beautifully. At first I kept running into a blue screen, but after updating all the drives, it works great, just got to keep it up to date or you will get a blue screen and your computer will restart. The anti glare screen was the very first thing I notices. The main down fall with this computer is the battery. It is absolutely horrible. The fans are a little loud, but they work okay. I did notice that my computer likes to over heat, but with the boost cool on the MSI Drangon Application on the PC, it will cool your laptop quickly, just don't forget to turn it off lol. But over all, a great piece of equipment, and can't wait to see what else MSI has to offer</span>

<span>A fantastic laptop for the low price. The look and design of the laptop is very nice and sleek. The only odd thing about it is the fans on the side pushing all the ports to the middle of the sides. Everything worked out of the box and the MSI Dragon Center is one of the best control centers I've seen among all my previous computers. They keyboard is also very nice. I love the rgb control you have and the presets you can choose from are very satisfying. The laptop has also been very quiet so far. While it has gotten just a little warm, I feel like that's to be expected with literally any gaming laptop on the market so I don't think I can knock it for that, especially when its been minimal.</span>

<span>When I was in college, I was in need of another computer to help with notes and study. I had a nice and expensive computer that did much more than this computer, however, the Chromebook still did a lot of things that any other computer can do and all for a very inexpensive price. My biggest thing that I like about this computer is the price. My nicest laptop was about $2,000, and I love it. However, for families that may not be able to afford such a luxury laptop, this computer did everything I needed it for during college for regularly $279. I notice while I’m writing this review it has went down to $190. For the price, this is a great laptop to do basic work. By no means will this laptop run high quality games or other things that may run the computer too much, but it was great for college activities like writing, studying, and other basic needs. I’m writing this almost two years after purchasing this laptop and the laptop still works great!</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find.  This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought  as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.<br/>PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen  (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.</span>

<span>Ive always spent $1000+ on computers, be they desktop or laptop.  This time I decided I dont really need that much, browse the internet, stream movies and work on spreadsheets.<br/><br/>Ive only had this for 3 days but so far so good!<br/><br/>I think the screen/resolution/graphics are slightly wanting.  The screen is really big, but you cant see very clearly from the side.<br/><br/>I was worried about having only 4GB of RAM but so far everything works efficiently.<br/><br/>The battery is awesome, but again Ive only had it for 3 days so I cant say how it will hold up over time.<br/><br/>Ive always used Windows, and my last computer was a hand me down Macbook from my daughter.  This is my first experience with google/chromebook.  I use a Galaxy phone though, so this has worked nicely in syncing things, and Ive been able to figure it all out pretty quickly.  You might expect a learning curve however if youre not familiar.<br/><br/>Over all I bought this refurbished for $175 and I am completely satisfied!

<span>I'm not an acer fan, as acer was like the hyundai's of the pc tech world in my book, but I needed a laptop for my daughter and this one fit the bill.<br/><br/>So far so good, I'd say build quality is fairly decent, it's slimmer than I expected. Performance wise, obviously it's no beast, but it gets the job done. What's really great about this is the fact that the ram is upgradeable to 64GB, but I'll just purchase an 8GB stick to add to it.<br/><br/>There is room for a 2.5" SSD. The NVME is also removeable, so while there's no sd card slot, storage is fully expandable in a better way.<br/><br/>Having a backlit keyboard with #pad is excellent.<br/><br/>Webcam quality is ok, nothing to talk about there, 720p 30fps max, but as mentioned before, gets the job done.<br/><br/>Even with only 4Gb Ram, it still ran smoothly despite having several Chrome windows open with multiple tabs. Installed minecraft java edition for her, it was able to play set at 7 chunks render distance, and not very many settings dialed down and still get 60fps (not that she cared about fps), so I still think you may be able to play some titles at 720p maybe medium settings, but i haven't checked it yet.<br/><br/>Screen is not bad, viewing angles are quite good and bright enough.<br/><br/>The speaker are not loud but audio quality is fairly decent, especially given how slim the laptop is. Your phone may go louder, but it won't scrape your ear canal.<br/><br/>Battery life is average I'd say.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a laptop that is more expensive than it should be, AS ARE ALL THAT FALL IN THIS PRICE POINT, but definitely compared against all the others I've sifted through, it's the best. In summary, it is because:<br/><br/>1. Ability to upgrade internal nvme storage + add 2.5" ssd<br/><br/>2. As with internal storage, ram isn't soldered on like the other brand laptops and can be upgraded<br/><br/>3. Latest WiFi and Bluetooth technology<br/><br/>4. Backlit keyboard with number pad and fingerprint scanner on touchpad<br/><br/>5. Inclusion of an ethernet port. Especially helpful if you need a stable internet connection.<br/><br/>6. Windows 11 ready<br/><br/>7. Decent display with good viewing angles<br/><br/>8. Decent quad core apu<br/><br/>9. USB-C also available on chassis and overall, decent I/O<br/><br/>It's a solid buy if you're looking for a laptop within it's price range at the time of this review. It offers the most features and flexibility vs the competition.</span>

<span>As a college student, this is very useful and fast from my experience after having it for a month. And it was also a great budget price so for anyone who needs a cheap fast computer, I think this is a great place to start. Just a heads up: the fan will sound very loud when you are first setting it up but it is very very quiet. It’ll sound loud when there are setups or stuff like that. But overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I also have heard that people complain about the backlit keyboard because there’s a timer but you can actually change it to where it can stay on until you press the button again to turn it off. To change the timed keyboard to always on, go to your computer settings, type “Recovery” and click that and look for “Advanced startup” then you might have to wait for it to restart. After that, there should be a blue screen and click “Troubleshoot” and then “Advanced Options” and then “UEFI firmware settings” and you should look for “keyboard timeout” or something like that and click “disable” and then just confirm the settings and once it restarts again, then it should would. Keep in mind that the fan will be loud throughout the entire process. Of course there’s always YouTube videos. Hope this helped!!</span>

<span>First this seems to be a very good value for the money but you should know before buying, a few things.  I personally prefer AMD Ryzen based computing mainly because the computers based on AMD tend to be the best value for your money. Usually these are equal to or slightly lower performing than their Intel counterparts, save for the integrated AMD Vega video controller which is superior to Intel's in a number of important ways.  My biggest issue with this Notebook (distinction is such portable devices that breathe from the underside are NoteBooks whereas MacBooks, as example, are true laptops because of the solid underside which can be set on the lap, carpet, bedding etc) is that this model has, integrated into the motherboard 4GB of DDR4. To have more memory (wise) you will need to purchase a single DDR4 SODIMM of 4, 8 or 16GB thus making the memory bus un-matched which always results in a slight loss in overall performance since the system has to compromise a little to make the miss-matched memory work OR worse has to hobble the system to be on a Single Channel memory bus, resulting often in a 25% loss in total system wide performance. Secondly, while it VERY positive to have a NVMe M.2 SSD in ANY computer system, these come in many flavors. The SK Hynix M.2 SSD this system comes with is considered to be reliable but is also a bit slow at around 500MBps max transfer rate whereas a nice, not very expensive AData XPG NVMe M.2 SSD can peak in a model like this around 2600MBps!  Keep in mind, at this price and for basic use this still seems perfectly OK and still a decent value at around $350 - beyond that price it starts becoming a Not so great value however.  The 1080p IPS screen is not too bad either, considering the price. Finally, this is the first system I've seen that is entirely, irretrievably UEFI which means you will be VERY limited to ONLY those OS' that fully support this. Outside of the fact that Windows 10 "S" is barely usable, a late version of Windows 10 (there've been what, about 12 versions of Win10 up till this point?) or now Windows 11, also the late model Ubuntu family 20.04 LTS and newer as just one example. I tested Win10 Pro and Kubuntu 20.04 LTS on this model and both functioned well though Win10 really Needs a minimum of 16GB to really work well, Kubuntu, on the other hand seemed happy as could be with only 4GB! Nevermind that you can NOT run any Windows programs nearly at all though Linux versions of Firefox, Chrome &amp; Brave all work quite well as does LibreOffice and ONLYOffice... Bottomline here is that there is Nothing wrong with this Notebook, not really - sort of depends on your purpose, values and usage patterns as to whether it will work well for you or not, this is just my rating of this unit... FYI</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop to use as a spare machine in my consulting practice, and also for use with my ham radio hobby. When I saw the specs on this laptop, followed by the price, I couldn't help but order one. My key requirements were size, weight, and a decent screen. This little machine fits all of those requirements in spades.<br/><br/>I have been more than impressed with the L210's performance and features. While it's definitely not a gaming machine, it's more than adequate for anyone that needs to do web browsing, office apps, and other non CPU- or memory-intensive tasks.<br/><br/>I'll start with the cons:<br/>- 4GB RAM (non-expandable/soldered in, despite Asus page stating otherwise)<br/>- 64GB SSD (easily expandable; I added a 500GB SSD for about $50)<br/>- Just adequate screen resolution (1366x768) - fine for most tasks<br/>- Non-back lit keyboard (even though the product listing says that it is backlit)<br/>- Relatively slow, but adequate Intel Celeron CPU<br/>- Limited USB-C support; cannot charge the laptop via USB-C and it will not support an external USB-C monitor adapter.<br/>- Weird 10-key pad on the touch pad. Enabled via a small button on the touch pad; it's too easy to accidentally turn it on, wreaking havoc when you use the touchpad. No way to permanently disable via BIOS.<br/>- No touch screen, but not surprising given the price point<br/><br/>All of the above were clearly spelled out in the product description, so none of them were a surprise. And several of them were definitely design decisions, in order to keep the cost down and the battery life high.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Amazing battery life. I've been seeing 8-11 hours per charge in normal use<br/>- Super lightweight and small form factor; 2.3 pounds/1.05kg and very thin<br/>- Nice port options. Built-in HDMI, USB-C plus 2 "classic" USB ports<br/>- Expandable hard drive via "M2" SSD stick. Took me about 5 minutes and $50 to expand storage by 500GB<br/>- Very nice keyboard, rivaling much more expensive laptops<br/>- Comes with Windows 10 "S mode", easily upgraded to Windows 10 Home for no charge<br/>- Really great price. I had fully expected to have to buy an unknown branded laptop at this price point. Asus is a great brand with a history of providing good support and high-quality products.<br/><br/>In summary, I'm very pleased with this purchase. It fits the bill for my needs perfectly and has fantastic battery life. It weighs less than my iPad Pro with folio keyboard and runs full Windows 10, including all of the apps that I need it to run.<br/><br/>Of the cons listed above, only the 4GB RAM limitation and the lack of a backlit keyboard are major annoyances. That said, this machine supplies all of the functionality that I need as a backup / travel / ham radio laptop. Since I have other machines for video editing / gaming / etc, I don't need this machine for those tasks.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a nice little laptop for basic office tasks, this is a great choice!<br/><br/>(I forgot to mention that Asus is giving me a 90-day warranty extension in exchange for writing this review.)</span>

<span>Note: This review is for those thinking about run a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.<br/><br/>Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri doesnt detect the Realtek wifi adapter that comes with this laptop which is an extremely common problem in the Linux world (in fact, I already know because there were reviews here that said they had to rely on a USB wifi adapter). I tried using a USB Ethernet adapter to connect to the internet and running [apt update/upgrade] hoping that it will install the correct drivers but no luck. However, even [lspci] doesnt event detect the wifi adapter so I just gave up. I bought a generic wifi adapter carrying the latest Intel AX210 for about $40. This new model allows for WiFi 6e and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and I tested this on a Windows 10 Pro laptop prior to bringing it over to this Linux machine so I know that the adapter I bought actually delivered these specs. So then I swapped the Realtek with the new Intel wifi adapter and reinstalled the same Ubuntu version. I had wifi even during setup when I was booting the installer from USB. But after installation, only bluetooth was detected. The solution was to [apt update/upgrade] and restart. Then boom now I have wifi and also Bluetooth 5.2 (I didnt include pics but when I ran [hciconfig -a] the version is 5.2) thanks to Intel AX210. I didnt need to manually install other drivers - it just worked after a system update.<br/><br/>Note that you have to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS/UEFI settings for the new wifi adapter hardware to be recognized by the OS. This means that the Secure Boot status should be "Inactive" (or something like that). Delete those stored keys if you need to.<br/><br/>So far, i dont have any issues with it running Ubuntu. The camera, usb ports, and m.2 ssd slots all work fine. I havent used the Bluetooth 5.2 though since no need for it. Also, doing basic computer stuff like web browsing and word processing is not lightning fast but also not slow. It takes a few seconds to open Firefox but watching 1080p videos is no problem. I tried running 1 Lububtu virtual machine and I didnt have any problems, but it is kinda slow - though tolerable.</span>

<span>Overall, this is a great laptop for its intended purpose, but DO NOT ORDER 64GB!!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The OS takes around 20-30GB (I can't remember specifically how much), default programs (i.e. MS Office) easily eat up another 20GB, and after everything is accounted for you are left with10ish precious GBs remaining--and you'll learn very quickly that whatever you use this thing for will chew right through that space. The Windows updates alone will eat up your GBs, Windows' caching will passively eat up more GBs when you aren't looking, and in less than a year you will be wasting hours deactivating hidden folders, deleting everything you can find, Googling what you can/cannot delete, perpetually slow-loading from a USB stick, and budgeting the remaining GBs between 2-3 programs.<br/><br/>Soon, you won't be able to download Windows updates because you're literally juggling 200MB of HDD space and the system says you don't have enough room to download the next patch. At least you don't have to worry about it sneakily upgrading to Windows 11 one day, because there's literally no room left for it to do so.<br/><br/>And that was to save a trivial amount of money (&lt;$50) on a bigger HDD. I feel pretty stupid for being so stingy now, but at the same time I can't help but blame the manufacturer for not putting a disclaimer that the OS consumes HALF of the HDD, and Windows' default programs eat up *almost* the other half, and realistically you are left with 10GB of HDD space.<br/><br/>Perhaps the other INCREDIBLY annoying thing about Windows 10 is that it will eat up HALF of your RAM just by existing. I never really gave much thought into how much RAM the OS eats up until I found myself staring at Task Manager wondering why Windows 10 needs 4GB of RAM on a laptop that only has 8GB to spare. Absurd. If you can order one with more RAM, then do so, otherwise just know that you'll need to keep this thing running light.<br/><br/>Also, the awesome mousepad with the toggle number pad was super cool, until the poor thing stopped working after several months. It now requires a wireless mouse to function. Oh well. Still not nearly as aggravating as the HDD/RAM situation.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Aside from those issues, for $110 it was a fantastic deal, I would highly recommend it for developers and students who want a light, portable, and simplistic device for text editors and running basic programming projects on. It is preferred by techies who need to move and connect to company devices for troubleshooting, updates, etc., and I think it would be an excellent tool for that job. Obviously, this is not a gaming laptop, and I don't think anyone who buys it is under the impression they'll be running Unreal Engine 5 on it either, but it would totally work for freeware games and simple games that could work on dinosaur computers.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This laptop is a work and school laptop primarily, and it is a wonderful and nifty tool that excels at that role, just be prepared to deal with a broken touchpad potentially, and know that half of your RAM will be eaten up by the OS.<br/><br/>And please, for the love of your sanity, DO NOT ORDER 64GB HDD! Get the larger HDD, you'll severely regret cheaping out on less than a $50 price difference.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>The Acer Aspire 15 has been a super great laptop. It's probably one of the best tech purchases I have ever made and I'm an IT guy. I paid about $350 USD for this one and am very happy with the purchase. The last time I was searching for a Laptop I returned 5 laptops before I was satisfied so I'm pretty picky. This was for my wife but I use it at night when I'm not in my office sometimes.<br/><br/>Storage &amp; Upgrades: Although it only comes with 128gb SSD &amp; 4gb RAM it's no big deal for about $100 you can upgrade to 20gb RAM and 2tb HDD + 128gb SSD. I love that you can run dual drives. 1 SSD + 1 HDD. I added a 2TB HDD for Data Storage for $50, it came with the bracket in the box, and it didn't void the warranty, like on my LG Gram. The 128gb SSD is functioning as a Boot Drive. I also added a 16gb module for about $50 and now have 20gb RAM. The upgrades were pretty straightforward and you can use normal small screwdrivers.<br/><br/>Performance: It boots up super fast, maybe 10 seconds to reach the sign in screen and 2 seconds to log in. Web pages and programs load quickly. We use it for Web browsing, Word, PowerPoint &amp; Excel. I'm not doing video editing or high performance gaming on this but it runs almost as fast as my i5 LG Gram that cost $1500 with all SSD drives. It doesn't get too warm but we do have it on a fan stand, but I don't usually plug it in because for some reason the USB keeps powering the fan after it powers down, and I can't find a BIOS setting to turn this off. I notice that it gets a little warm when sitting directly on a table. I usually can't hear the fan at all. Sometimes you can hear it kick on when you open up 15 tabs and a bunch of apps.<br/><br/>Screen: The screen is really nice too. It's 1080 Full HD so you don't see the pixels like on a normal 15" Standard HD screen. I think it's average brightness but we use it indoors so it's plenty bright for our needs.<br/><br/>Keyboard: I love the Keyboard, it's much better than the keyboard on my LG Gram, and just as good as the best keyboards I have tested in BestBuy from Lenovo. It's wonderful to type on. It's backlit as well so that's nice plus. And I love the Number Pad, even though the number pad is a little skinner than the other keys.<br/><br/>Fingerprint ID: It's super fast and I didn't know how much I would love it!<br/><br/>Speakers: The speakers are fine. They are loud enough to watch YouTube videos and the news but it won't compete with a home stereo system.<br/><br/>Ports: It has plenty of full size ports: 3 USB, 1 USB C, 1 Full HDMI a headphone jack and even a RJ-45 Ethernet Port! I hate dongles so it's nice that you don't need one for this laptop. I would have liked to see a MicroSD reader but my wife doesn't SD Cards it so it's no big deal for her.<br/><br/>Window 11: It comes with Windows 11s but is very easy to switch to standard Windows 11. I was a little concerned about this and it almost made me not go for this laptop. But it's no big deal, as soon as you try to install something "non Microsoft" like Google Chrome it says something like, "If you want to install non-Microsoft software, you have to switch to full Windows 11 mode. Are you sure? You will loose all the exclusive Microsoft Security with Windows 11s Mode." But you just click, "Yes" and it switches, it may require a reboot but I can't remember.<br/><br/>Battery: The battery is average. We usually leave it plugged in on the desk but the few times that we have used it without a battery we used it for a few hours and it remained at 70% battery. Windows 11 doesn't estimate the time remaining so I really don't know for sure how long it would last. I'd guess it would go from 100% to 10% in about 5-6 hours for Netflix, YouTube or web browsing or MS Office apps.<br/><br/>Again, I really love this laptop. I keep telling my wife how impressed I am with the performance, storage upgrade options, keyboard, screen, etc. She doesn't really care that much as long as it works fast and does what she wants so I decided I had to tell all of you Amazon people that this is a great laptop for 95% of normal people who just want something that works well and is a good price. I highly recommend the acer aspire 15 and would buy it again, no regrets!</span>

<span>I think for 350-400 this laptop is probably one of the best you could find, especially considering it's size. I'm not sure how people are having trouble switching out of S mode, but I did it in literal seconds (for free, no clue how people are getting messages they have to pay) after I was able to access the desktop so that's a complete non-issue. It also looks a bit more expensive than it is which is cool I guess.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The audio is good but rather quiet, there's oddly no light indicator on the caps lock, and the buttons to raise/lower the brightness have their icons swapped?<br/>Hard drive is miniscule, I had 85 GB free in total. At least it is a SSD. You can find external hard drives of any size for cheap nowadays so this isn't an issue, also given that the computer has 3 USB ports, just be aware of it going in.</span>

<span>bought one for me a couple of years back, and was satisfied, so recently bought one for my wife after her Mac died...it's no Mac, but it cost 1/4 the price, so imo well worth it for basic computer tasks.</span>

<span>I'm far from a computer expert. I bought this computer for work because my job requires me to use a couple of different specific software programs. I needed a computer with a lot of storage, a fairly large screen, a numerical keypad, and most importantly, a cheap price tag. This computer has all of those things. I don't do any gaming or anything really sophisticated on it. Just work and some internet browsing. It boots up quickly and has been running smoothly so far. My biggest complaint is that it came with a lot of Microsoft bloatware that I hadn't experienced on my other laptops and by default it uses your Microsoft OneDrive for storage instead of the computer's SSD. The first time I logged onto the computer it asked me to either sign up for a Microsoft account or login to an existing one. My job requires me to take a lot of photos, so I was saving my photos to the computer without realizing it was uploading to my cloud storage account. That was an annoyance because I had to figure out how to switch that off. I unintentionally used up all of my cloud storage space because I didn't realize the system was set up that way. Once I figured out how to fix it, I was good to go. Also, the computer essentially comes in a "safe mode" which limits a lot of what you can do. It is designed for you to only use apps from the Microsoft app store and not download any software from any other source. It can be turned off, but it is another annoyance. I feel like they were trying to make it like their version of a Chromebook, but that makes it just as annoying as a Chromebook. Overall, it is a great computer once you get past all the Microsoft stuff.</span>
