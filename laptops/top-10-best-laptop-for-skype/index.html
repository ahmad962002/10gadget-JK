I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>I was curious about Chromebooks &amp; wanted to give one a shot. I looked this one over, and Alice helped me with questions I had. (She was great BTW).<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying this little Chromebook. It's lightweight, has crazy battery life (about 10 hrs). I'm still learning all that Chromebooks can do, but it was definitely worth the purchase. 2 Thumbs WAY UP! :)</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>I'm satisfied with my purchase. Doesn't seem nothing to be wrong with it . It's running smoother than i thought . However , the screen is kinda dim looking sometimes for people with glasses. There's more updating unless you upgrade to a newer version or device. The sound system is great ....muffled sometimes if the speaker is covered at the bottom . Overall , I made the right decision in purchasing ....Great for school !</span>

<span>This was purchased just about a year ago for my kids for school. As of today, the only issues I have had have been the charge cords. The cords come in two pieces (as most do) and the thicker cord that plugs into the outlet doesn’t last long. I have purchased a total of 6 of these computers and only 3 of the charge cords work now. It’s a bit inconvenient having to share charge cords, but the computers themselves work good. I have, however, had to replace a charge port in one of the computers, as it had fallen apart. The other computers have held together just fine tho (some of them being used by kids aged 5-9, which is really saying something), and have been dropped countless times, as well as being hijacked by a 2yo regularly, and still work fine. They are SOLID computers for sure!</span>

<span>I really didn’t expect much in ordering this computer. I only need it for writing and use my phone and tablet for anything else. It’s not gonna go super fast, and if you’re coming from looking at your iPhone you might be startled by the display quality in comparison *BUT* the battery life is excellent, for me, lasts a couple days without charge, but it doesn’t cause damage to leave it plugged in, just fyi. *Very* lightweight, I love that, and small in size… this is not a clunker of a laptop. If the keyboard was backlit I’d throw 5 stars on the board, but fortunately I have a little light I can use when writing in bed. You might be skeptical about a hundred dollar laptop but trust, if there’s just a couple simple tasks you need to do, you’re not out here editing movies and developing your photography portfolio, this computer will work great.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>When you buy this, just know that you won’t have a lot of internal storage to work with. I bought an sd card to handle my storage effectively. When you get close to having the internal storage met, expect performance issues. The computer will work slower and just seem to struggle with keeping up.<br/><br/>This is NOT a gaming laptop. Please consider buying a different laptop if you wanted to game. It really doesn’t have the frame rate to handle games that are large. I used this laptop to play Roblox with students of mine and 9/10 this laptop could not keep up.<br/><br/>As for a work laptop it’s lightweight and easy to use. I use this laptop for zoom meetings(with an external camera, not the internal one), homework, writing and casual browsing. It does this job well. I generally won’t watch anything on it because the audio quality isn’t great, but if I had to use this laptop I would play the audio with headphones or a speaker.<br/><br/>Overall for school, work, or causal browsing Id definitely recommend this laptop.<br/><br/>PS this is not a backlit keyboard.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>I used a Chromebook C330 for a few years, which I absolutely loved. I bought the S330 thinking it would basically be the same, just with a larger display and higher resolution. And much of it is the same. Like the C330, the S330 keyboard is excellent. The trackpad is good. It has the same MediaTek processor which, though by no means fast, is fine for general productivity use, and it gets amazing battery life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this otherwise great laptop is ruined by the worst display I have ever seen on a laptop. Unlike the C330, which has a nice, crisp, sharp display, the display on the S330 is so bad it is basically unusable.<br/><br/>To start with, colors are so washed out that some parts of the screen blend into each other. The top of the shelf, for example, is a blurry line instead of a crisp edge. The color reproduction is awful. All shades of gray have a light blue tint to them. At a normal viewing angle, a gray button on a white background at the bottom of the screen is basically invisible.<br/><br/>To get an idea of what this display looks like, imagine taking a screenshot of your desktop, loading it into Photoshop, adding a layer, flooding it with blue, and then reducing the opacity to make it semi-transparent. That’s what it’s like using this display. It’s like the entire screen has a filmy blue filter placed over the top of it that gives everything a slightly blue tint, and also makes the entire screen appear fuzzy. The effect is so pronounced that I’m pretty convinced the display on this particular one might be defective. I simply can’t believe anyone at Lenovo could have looked at this display and thought it was acceptable for any use. Then again, a lot of other reviewers have complained about the display too.<br/><br/>The display, at least on this one, is so bad that I literally can’t use it for more than a few minutes before I start getting a headache from eye strain.<br/><br/>I’m not sure what Lenovo was thinking when they took an otherwise great laptop and completely ruined it by putting such an awful display on it.<br/><br/>Overall, I can’t recommend this laptop to anybody. Even if all you do is basic productivity, you will find yourself getting a headache from eye strain in just a few minutes. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because everything else about it is great. But the horrible display really does make this otherwise great laptop unusable.</span>

<span>I don't understand all the negative reviews about the screen. It's not the BEST laptop screen I've ever used, but FAR from the worst. And for less than $250? Are you guys kidding me? Are you expecting an ipad pro level screen?<br/><br/>The laptop is solid even though it's plastic, I'm not worried about putting this thing in my backpack. While the keyboard is a little stiff for my taste, it works well. I'm just used to my mechanical keyboard on my desktop. I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:<br/><br/>Perfectly fine.<br/>Solid.<br/>Reliable.<br/>Lenovo-quality.<br/>I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.<br/><br/>The negatives?<br/><br/>The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade.</span>

<span>When I was in college, I was in need of another computer to help with notes and study. I had a nice and expensive computer that did much more than this computer, however, the Chromebook still did a lot of things that any other computer can do and all for a very inexpensive price. My biggest thing that I like about this computer is the price. My nicest laptop was about $2,000, and I love it. However, for families that may not be able to afford such a luxury laptop, this computer did everything I needed it for during college for regularly $279. I notice while I’m writing this review it has went down to $190. For the price, this is a great laptop to do basic work. By no means will this laptop run high quality games or other things that may run the computer too much, but it was great for college activities like writing, studying, and other basic needs. I’m writing this almost two years after purchasing this laptop and the laptop still works great!</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>17in display (diagonally) that is not touch screen...love that.<br/><br/>GPU and screen work together to crank out 144 frames per second. Played a bunch of Hades to confirm that.<br/><br/>Windows 11 out of the box. Got rid of most of the bloatware immediately.<br/><br/>For the price, I would've wanted full RGB back-lit keyboard. I like red, but this was a missed opportunity. There is a USB 3.1 or 3.2 port that doesn't work very well. Even connecting my phone for just charging would reset its connection randomly every 2-5 minutes.<br/><br/>I got this as a gaming rig on the go. It might be able to be your primary machine if you're into laptops.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: Power cord has 2 clicks before it is fully plugged in.

<span>I don't play alot of games with extremely high requirements. BUT this laptop is just what I was looking for. It plays the games I want to play. The one thing I will say is the battery life while playing a game is a little short but honestly that's to be expected in a gaming laptop sometimes. The fan does get a little loud and crazy while playing sometimes but that really doesn't bother me too much. It does a great job with most of the games I've tried it out on. So if you're a casual gamer who loves games like The Sims, this is perfect tbh.</span>

<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>If you don't mind looking at a small, iffy quality screen, then this Chromebook is fine for you. If you increase the letters on the screen too large, then it negatively effects your webpages and how many tabs you can have open.<br/><br/>It is fairly quick for it's price point and allowed me to get schoolwork done when needed. I wouldn't feel bad if I cracked the screen or broke it a few years from now since the price isn't bad.<br/><br/>If these types of screens bother your eyes, I highly recommend IPS displays. You can get this same exact laptop but with an IPS display for only a few bucks more.<br/><br/>All in all, I decided to return it after my eyes were hurting from squinting at the screen. I went with a Lenovo Chromebook C330 11.6 inch ($180).</span>

<span>Update Below...First I should say that it's not the Chromebook's fault.  It works fine as it was built.  It's not the machine's fault that its model was built without a touch screen.  I am a bit cranky with HP for making something of a big noise about their new 11a economy Chromebook with a touch screen... and then building a model of the 11a without one.  If you go to the HP site and enter all twelve characters of the model number and ask for specs the specifications displayed won't mention a touch screen because the 11a-na0010nr doesn't have one.  (The 11a-na0040nr does have a touch screen but the ...0010... does not.)<br/>None of this changes the fact that the product is misrepresented.  The listing describes the machine as<br/>"...The powerful MediaTek mobile processor, full-size keyboard, and 11.6-inch touchscreen can handle it all. ... With an anti-glare, high-definition, 11.6-inch touch display, you can stream..."<br/>So at two places in the "About This Item" text it promises a touch screen which the item does not have.  Initially I thought about returning the machine but, on reflection, the lack of a touch screen is not a deal breaker.  I decided that instead of returning  the machine I would leave a one-star review instead.<br/>UPDATE: Too many problems.  Sending the Chromebook back.  Problems that emerged since my previous review -- I can't make the SD card reader work.  I can activate the device in the device settings but most of the apps don't see it.  The settings for the individual apps don't show the card in the External Storage Preferences.  Notably, Netflix can't see the card.  You can't download much video to watch offline if you can't get to the SD card.  Also, although the item was sold as new with a one year warranty, when I presented the serial number to the HP support page it informed me that the warranty was started in April of 2021 and expired this April just passes.  So there is no warranty.  Googling the support communities found only one thread discussing a similar problem (last month) but the only participant who resolved the problem did so by returning the machine.  Starting to sound like the machine needs to go back.</span>

<span>I got a Chromebook to replace my Macbook because I wanted a decent laptop without having to spend hundreds of dollars.  So far, this fits the bill pretty well, with a few minor differences from the Macbook.  It was really easy to set up and import my passwords, bookmarks, etc. which was really convenient.  Charges quickly and pretty much does what I need it to.  I miss not having AirPlay to mirror stuff to my Roku tv and have sound included.  I also miss having iTunes (now Apple Music), but I switched to Spotify.  There are a few little things that are different that I've had to get used to, but nothing too major. I prefer laptops to tablets or having to do everything on my phone, because I like having an actual keyboard and a decent sized screen, not a touchscreen (tablet) or a little tiny screen (phone)  All in all, it's a great little laptop for the price.</span>

<span>I got this on Prime Day as a backup/secondary laptop. When I received it, I wanted to give it a good, solid test run, so I used only this laptop for everything I did for about three weeks. I found it to be surprisingly fast and I had no problems at all running my usual stuff--many tabs open in Chrome, Word, streaming video, email, music, etc.  The screen is average/above-average. The keyboard is quite nice to type on! The trackpad is okay, but I did have some irritating moments where it wasn't always as responsive as I needed it to be. The battery life, sadly, was sub par for me. Even keeping the screen brightness turned down to no more than middle of the road, I couldn't really get much more than 3 or maaaaaybe 4 hours. I tinkered with settings to try to help the issue, but in this day and age, I feel like I shouldn't have to reduce everything to the bare, bare minimum to squeeze out 4 hours of battery life. Not when I can get a full day of use on my other laptops without charging.<br/><br/>I did have some Windows 11 glitches with it (several times it wouldn't let me log-in with fingerprint but it also wouldn't let me log in with my pin either and I'd have to reboot), but that's par for the course and hopefully as updates come out, those will be corrected. And that's operating system stuff, not a hardware issue. I'm only pointing it out for people who might be buying this laptop for someone who would find issues like that particularly frustrating.<br/><br/>If you need a solid laptop for light use, you're not going to be too mobile with it, and it'll be mainly plugged in, this is a decent everyday budget laptop. If you need something with more robust battery life, however, this may not be the best choice for you.</span>

<span>It has a comfortable keyboard, respectable I/O (USB 2 on the right side is questionable but I just use it for a mouse anyways), fantastic chipset, and is pretty easy to DIY upgrade, I upgraded mine from 8 to 20gb of RAM. Runs Linux Mint like a charm although the fingerprint reader doesn’t work with either Mint or Fedora out of the box. It’s great for the price and an excellent choice for a back to school laptop for college, especially if you get it on sale, the AMD APU is a total workhorse for most office tasks and light gaming/media editing.</span>

<span>Laptop is great, but the preinstalled Realtek 8822CE wifi card drops signal on occasion. This laptop (Lenovo Ideapad 3 14ALC6) does not have a whitelist, so I installed an Intel AX210NGW card and I no longer have any issues. Hopefully this helps someone with this model.<br/><br/>Also, get rid of the incredibly bloated pre-installed McAfee antivirus software. Thank me later</span>

<span>This computer was bought by my parents as a gift for me, as my school required us to have a laptop, but then suddenly at the open house they said that our computers would most likely not work w the wifi and that the school was gonna provide us w laptops. I thought this was really stupid, but bcs of this I got to use the laptop for personal use, like games etc.. And it works wonders, it loads genshin impact perfectly as well as Roblox, league and final fantasy 14, my only problem now is that for some reason it will start to suddenly disconnect from the internet, but other than that its perfect.</span>
