<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>For the price it is a good bedroom computer. I can watch Amazon Video or catch up on other things.<br/>The screen is great, my eyes feel comfortable looking at it.<br/><br/>The only thing that is a minor grip is the spacebar.  It is really stiff. It works and you have to tap the top of it if you want to ensure that it does work. Maybe with more use it will adjust itself. If you are doing a lot of typing on it this could be an issue.  But I'm usually doing other things so for me it is a keeper.</span>

<span>Anyone looking at Chromebooks these days, and trying to choose one, is in for quite the ride.  So many to choose from, and at so many price points and feature sets.<br/><br/>This is my first adventure into a Chromebook, and I did so because it looks like the OS is pretty mature now days, and manufacturers are putting together designs with great feature sets at very aggressive prices.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is the initial Chromebook I chose to start my adventure with, precisely because it offered the correct blend of features and pricing.  I was tempted to go straight into a Pixel-Go.. but heard repeated reports of weak chassis and breaking hinges.  So I thought.. hey.. go with a lower end unit initially because that will give you  true view of the adaptability and power of Chrome OS.<br/><br/>This unit fired up right out of the box, with no issues, and did all it's configuration and automatic updates within 10 minutes of power on.  Very simple, very smooth.<br/><br/>One thing that led me to this model and brand of Chromebook was Acers has put a great set of I/O connections in the design.  You get two USB-C, two USB A 3.1s, the typical audio jack, and frankly that is about all I ever expect to need on a Chromebook.<br/><br/>It was important for me to find a Chromebook design that was truly fanless (ie: self cooled), and the N4000 processor makes this easy and efficient.  I plant to use this machine in a variety of locations where dust, lint, etc is troublesome for most laptops with fans<br/><br/>Keyboard response is smooth and comfortable.<br/><br/>Unit is light weight, and for a 14 inch display, very respectable physical dimensions.  Chassis feels strong and rugged.<br/><br/>Display is fabulous, being a full 1080P display, with plenty of brightness and contrast.<br/><br/>The unit comes with ~ 15gb of the 64 used for the OS and other files right out of the box.<br/>It is fast, and responsive, and of course it runs the Chrome browser extremely well so that little Celeron N4000 series processor is working nicely. Given that in the laptop space these days.. the processor is likely the most expensive component... going with the N4000 instead of a i3 variant processor helps notably reduce cost/price.<br/><br/>Battery life is superb.  I ran a test last night.. leaving it on with the display active and Chrome open on an active web page and after 8.5 hours, it still reported 6 more hours of battery left.  Of course with more activity, more current and less battery life, but this test overnight gives me a great initial baseline.<br/><br/>There are still things about Chrome OS that can and will be improved, but this is true regardless of which machine you may choose.<br/><br/>Time will tell how many years it will last, but at this price point it really is a disposable recyclable unit when the time comes.  But right out of the box, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</span>

<span>I purchased the Acer 314 as a replacement for my Acer model CB3-431 Chromebook, which had just reached its AUE date. So far the new model has delivered solid performance and crisp graphics, all that I could ask for. The fact that the Acer 314 was sold by Amazon, and delivered from their warehouse, was important to me, as I had a recent unpleasant experience with one of Amazon's selling partners. I'd previously ordered a different brand laptop, as new, from an independent seller through Amazon. What I received was the wrong model number laptop in a plain unbranded box without a manual or any literature, just the laptop and power cord; nothing to indicate I had actually received a new item, and never mind that it was the wrong model number to begin with. Big red flags! Naturally I returned the laptop, and many thanks to Amazon for seeing to a prompt refund. Lesson learned was always to check the reviews of any independent Amazon partner or reseller, just as one would check reviews for an item being considered. Ordering the Acer 314 sold by Amazon and shipped from their warehouse ensured that I would receive the correct model number, new, in an Acer-branded box, and complete with all the attendant manuals and literature I had expected. Moreover, it arrived within 48 hours, a plus. Under Settings &gt; About ChromeOS &gt; Additional details, the Acer 314 is scheduled to receive automatic updates until June 2027, which is okay with me as I should probably be ready for a new laptop by then anyway. Altogether I'm quite happy with the Acer 314 and would recommend it for anyone looking for a quality budget Chromebook.</span>

<span>*first look*<br/>Received it a day earlier than expected. The packaging was VERY nice and everything was organized. The first couple boots were slow and the device had some “bloat” apps because of windows 10. I deleted few useless “bloat” apps and now the laptop starts within 4-5 seconds. What I don’t like is how easy it is to get finger/grease prints on the touchpad and on the surface of the laptop. The only tricky issue I faced was that the camera wasn’t functioning until I figured out that it had to be turned on using fn+f6 (typical MSI newby) the camera and mic quality is 5/10. Sound was pretty decent and loud. Brightness and screen colors are very good. I will be testing it’s gaming abilities shortly and give an update on that!<br/><br/>*******A YEAR LATER********<br/><br/>I still love this thing! I've started my Twitch streaming career on it and we're still going strong. I have not upgraded anything mainly because I have no experience in doing so but what I've heard is that upgrading can turn this thing into a beast.<br/><br/>Ok now quick pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- I can run most games with no problems<br/>- Super lightweight<br/>- Has a good enough webcam for streaming/recording gameplays etc. (make sure you got a good lighting)<br/>- Is overall more than enough for gaming on the move<br/>- 3 USB ports<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- 60 hz screen<br/>- Screen colors are too dark in my opinion<br/>- Speakers are not that great (but I never use them anyways)<br/>- Fans can be loud in performance mode</span>

<span>It’s a pretty nice laptop and it’s been running everything I play. However the laptop heats up really badly to the point where it burns my hand if I leave it on the keyboard for too long. I had to set up a fan right next to me to cool off the laptop so I could actually play without burning my hands. My room is 73° so it’s not overheating because of where I have it set up. Also comes with a very small amount of memory barely able to hold a game or two with little to no room spare for anything else.</span>

<span>This laptop is perfect for anyone looking for a low budget gaming system. It plays games like Need for Speed pretty easily on high settings.<br/><br/>I would recommend adding another 8gb stick of RAM for even better performance.<br/><br/>What I don’t like about this laptop is the battery life. Even when not using it for gaming the battery doesn’t last very long. I sometimes use the laptop for work, so I’m using a lot excel and web browsing and I will usually have to plug it in at least twice to get me through the day.</span>

<span>Quality feel, responsive and easy to upgrade. I don't play a lot of demanding titles, but this pc preforms well in games like WOW, Minecraft Dungeons, ESO and Genshin. It works nicely for office work and other media consumption as well.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Keyboard has a nice tactile response, and the typing experience is enjoyable even if a little truncated. That is to say that the 10 key (numbers pad) is a bit on the smaller side. It feels natural after a few hours of typing. It is backlit which is also nice.<br/><br/>The screen, to me, is more than bright enough and the colors are vibrant. Not as good as my desktop monitor but way better than any of my budget media/office laptops.<br/><br/>It was very easy to upgrade as well. Included the bracket, connector, and screws to mount a 2.5 inch drive.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>There is a lack of ports, which I knew when I bought it and is not a deal breaker but is worth mentioning. Two usb a (3rd gen), one usb c (data only), an hdmi, a combo audio jack and a proprietary power port. A third usb a (even if only 2.0) would have been nice, on the opposing/lefthand side as would a car reader. I also don't understand the lack of usb c charging in this day and age but that seems to be a common issue with gaming laptops (at many price points) so I would hold that against it.<br/><br/>It did not include a standoff of adding a second M.2 NVME even though there is a slot for it. Not the end of the world but odd, nonetheless.<br/><br/>Battery life is nonexistent. 2-3 hours of mixed use and less than an hour when gaming.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>I must say that I am happy so far. As I said, it was easy to upgrade and is quite responsive both in office work and at gaming. If what you are looking for is portable gaming setup, this might be for you. Or you want to do some light media editing. It also does office/schoolwork and media consumption well, as it should. Makes a great alternative to trying to buy a graphics card for your desktop at the moment too.<br/><br/>Quality seems to be there; it is your use case that will decide if this pc is for you. Want a portable gaming setup that can do office/schoolwork, some light editing and media consumption? Then this might be for you. On the other hand, if you want a work/school pc that can game on the side I might look for something with good integrated graphics that is lighter and has better battery life. That call is going to be on you.<br/><br/>As long as you understand what you are buying, I think you will be happy with this laptop. I know I am.</span>

<span>I was shopping for a low priced laptop, and a tech expert on local TV recommended this model as a good budget laptop. I found that refurbished ones were available here at a low price, and decided to try one. Unfortunately, the one I got didn't work properly. The trackpad and cursor frequently froze for several seconds at a time, and when they unfroze, the cursor reappeared in a different place. Multiple tabs would open randomly, and the laptop would rapidly switch among them. It was impossible to accomplish anything with these things happening. As much as I hoped this Samsung laptop would work for me, I couldn't get along with its problems and had to return it. Too bad really; if it didn't malfunction, this might be a decent laptop.</span>
