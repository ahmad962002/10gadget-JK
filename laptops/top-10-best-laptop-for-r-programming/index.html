Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

<span>I needed a laptop to double as my home office machine and this fit the bill nicely. I have long bought from other places besides Amazon, but the reality of their dominance has made other retailer have to resort to selling whatever they can to eke it out. After several laptops that failed, I tried here. This machine has been running strong for about 6 months now of daily use, and I am hoping it stays that way. If there is a sudden failure, I will update this review, but at this point, it is 6 months and this little thing is still going gangbusters without a failure problem that wasn't solved with an update and a reboot or two. Very standard stuff, and a good sign of a good machine.<br/>I recommend this to someone looking for similar specs as I was: not necessarily the best there is, but something that offered a great value and "good enough" performance across a variety of tasks, a little bit of upgradeability (it can still double its memory) and innate compatibility with most office and work software out of the box. good performance, heat management, battery management, and performance that is able to do everything I need. I do light video work, don't play games (the video work is a stand-in for playing games with this discrete video processor), tons of document, spreadsheet and other software as well as SaS applications. it has the performance for all of that and some to spare. Upgrading the memory would put it right about where I would need to be if I started doing more graphics work, but for now, with this setup, I can do what I need to, and upgrade enough to last for a reasonable amount of time.<br/>I can recommend this for anyone looking for the same qualities I was. If you are looking for bleeding-edge performance, this ain't it. Also, I bought this in the beginning of 2022, so take Moore's law into account whenever you are reading this. Within 18 months this will NOT apply.</span>

<span>I wanted 16 GB of RAM and SSD hard drive but didn't need a ton of space.  Some of the complaints I have read are valid.  The USB-C port does not support video.  Hard to find anywhere in the description but if that's a deal breaker for you look for USB-C Thunderbolt.  There is an actual Thunderbolt beside the USB-C port.  I almost returned the unit because of the keyboard.  Although I didn't care if it was back lit (it's not), the contrast between the letters and key is not good.  I could not see the symbols in low light.  I bought a silicon keyboard cover for about 8 bucks from the Big A and now can easily see and I am more protected from spills.  For casual users this is a great unit.  It's light and I like the screen size and the 10 digit pad built in.  You want 3 screens and a ton of ports, better dig deeper into your wallet.</span>

<span>I was using this product for working on digital art, writing and all around a media computer.  It had the right amount of RAM and CPU processing I was looking for.  6 months after I bought it, the computer wouldn't boot up.  So, I sent it in to HP to get fixed.  They sent me a message saying the RAM was the issue, that this model came only with 4gigs of memory, and the one I sent in had 16gigs.  I advised I bought it off the HPStore on Amazon, and they still viewed it as something I had to pay for.  Thus they asked me to pay over $467 to get the proper memory, reminder 4 gigs, put back in and that would fix the issue.  When I told them, I bought it off their store, on Amazon, and hadn't made any changes since receiving, it didn't change anything.  Because this computer came changed from the default, even if it was modified by someone selling it on HPStore, this was something I was responsible for.<br/>In short, a great computer when it works.  I loved how quick it booted, how well it performed.  That is until it died and they asked me to pay 89.50% of the original price, to put in less memory.  All in all, only get this computer if you are willing to repair it yourself, and have the skills.  Had I known this, I would never had sent the computer in to HP, and just fixed the blasted thing myself.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.<br/><br/>Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.<br/><br/>The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.<br/><br/>The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.<br/><br/>This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.<br/><br/>Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.<br/><br/>Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.<br/><br/>Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.<br/><br/>The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.<br/><br/>I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.<br/><br/>The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.<br/><br/>This boots in about 15 seconds.<br/><br/>It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.<br/><br/>This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.<br/><br/>I can't sing the praises of this enough.<br/><br/>Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.<br/><br/>Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.<br/><br/>This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.</span>

<span>Biggest case of buyers remorse in my life. Always bought HP with Intel hardware but figured with the reviews for this Acer Aspire 5 with AMD Ryzen 5 and Radeon graphics why not explore unfamiliar territory and see what the hype was about in the reviews. This Acer Aspire 5 for $489 Brand New shipped to the door I was astonished the laptop didn't come with an actual user manual. Was even more pissed that you can not setup and use this without first connecting to a WiFi network.<br/>For those who don't care about WiFi connections and just want a localized laptop with out brand manufacturers spying on you and gathering data your SOL. Wanted to read the user manual to see there if there was a way around this but for $489 you have to have the internet and download it. After I connected to the internet against my will the computer restarted and entered an error message that an error was encountered and it needed to restart. It did this twice with no luck just blue screens. It then went to diagnose repair screen attempting to diagnose the failure to start up with no luck only option was to shut down. After shutdown it actually loaded back up the and the very next screen was demanding to log in with a Microsoft account or sign up for one. Now there are ways around this with HP laptops. All you have to do is say no internet connection at 1st use and then you can sign in with a local account instead of logging in with a Microsoft account. For those who may not understand why this is an issue for some is when you login with a Microsoft account no matter what settings on privacy you think you can control you have zero privacy. Microsoft can see anything any everything you do on your laptop down to the keyboard typing and all activity. Oh well I know how to fix that later and I sign on with a Microsoft account. Finally get to windows and do what I always do download Firefox and Uninstall Microsoft edge. I restart the laptop to the same cycle of error loading operating system and attempt to diagnose that fails. Shut down the laptop and it loads again. Finally found out that anytime you restart the laptop whatsoever it cycles back to the same blue screens of error loading windows and diagnosing. Performed a factory restore back to complete factory settings so it was like the first time I opened the laptop up no difference. Still doing this cycle of device ran into problem gathering info, then diagnosing PC, PC cant be repaired, shut down, loads till the next time it restarts. Being upset is putting it mildly. I'm 38 and have been using computers and fixing them since I was 12, this is not a foreign language to me. This Acer Aspire 5 with AMD processor and graphics is total garbage. Brand new and it don't even work properly right out of the freakin box. I factory restored this thing 3 times and supposedly this wipes the hard drive completely and saves nothing but yet every time it re-installs it still has my name has the device owner. I started growing aggravated with HP but Acer is a complete joke. The display sucks also. Everything looks fine till you open a windows system or program property window then it's so blurry you think u have something in your eye, played with resolution and display settings and everything is clear and fine until you open a windows properties window and you can barely make out the letters. Same windows on my 3, 5 and 7 year old HP laptops zero issues but this brand new $500 Acer laptops display stops wanting to work properly over a properties window??? Who ever designed this model and it components and said yeah let's ship that out to the unexpected consumer needs banished from working in the information technology field. I wanted to get product support from Acer to address this issue but I couldn't even register this product through the preinstalled Acer Care Center software or their website, everytime I tried it gave me an error message and to try again later. So if you know a little about computers and want to fix a Brand New laptop yourself to get it to work properly I think you will be very pleased with the performance of this machine with the AMD components.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Found the fix for above issues. Don't use the operating system or ghost recovery drive programmed into the laptop. Download windows media creation tool and perform a full wipe and installation using the USB flash drive on startup.  The install will only load windows 10 but after 2-3 days windows update will automatically install windows 11.  I used Driver Booster 9 to update all the drivers for the hardware which always works flawlessly, best part its free and fast and has 1 click upgrades for all drivers. After a bunch of headache and wasted time I'm pretty impressed and happy with the hardware components. I bench-marked and stress tested this PC to some remarkable results. Too bad it couldn't work properly right out of the box, someone at Acer really dropped the ball. What I like about this Acer Aspire A515 45 is that it has 2 memory slots and comes with 8GB preinstalled and is up-gradable to 32 GB. The Graphics card takes half of the preinstalled 8GB and dedicates it to graphics processing which is nice in a way but its a give and take. I had a 4GB card of DDR4 with a 2666MHz clock frequency and threw that in the unused memory slot.  I was unsure how the PC would benchmark after this because the memory preinstalled was 3200MHz and that basically bottle necks the original memory card from 3200MHz down to 2666MHz but it still performed better than without it. Ideally you want to match the memory frequency with what is preinstalled to avoid this but like I said I had this 2666Mhz card already. In the near future I will match the preinstalled memory card with an after market 8GB DDR4 card with a 3200MHz frequency as well as matching the rank of the card (single rank/double rank) and all other specs. Ideally you want both slots to match down to the last detail including the memory capacity to prevent bottle necks between the processor and the motherboards ability to communicate with the memory. When I had the back off this the 2nd memory card slot was right there and accessibility but the original wasn’t visible so If you want to replace the original memory card it appears you have to remove the mother board and flip it over to get to the original used memory slot. While I was installing the added memory I scene that it has a space for an extra additional hard drive which is really great! I have a 500 GB Samsung 870 EVO SSD hard drive in one of my older HP laptops that will be going in this next. I thought I was gonna have to buy different brackets and sata cable to install the Samsung Evo SSD but they were included in the box with all the screws as well! If you buy a model with Intel products that stuff will be inside the laptop taped where the second hard drive goes. After setting up the additional Samsung hard drive so it was recognized by the laptop I used Samsung's "Magician" software to benchmark both drives and was astonished that the western digital SSD was 3 times faster than my Samsung EVO 870. My Samsung was doing almost 600MB a second read/speed and the WD was almost 2GB per second! My fastest laptop before this Acer was a HP Notebook 15 with an dual core Intel i3 processor. That HP ran me the same price as this Acer 2 years ago. It worked great but its a night and day difference between this Acer for multi tasking and for video and graphics capabilities. That HP didn’t have the extra bay for an additional hard drive either. I’m very pleased with this Acer after I removed the pre-installed operating system and software.</span>

<span>Aspire 5 with 4gb RAM 128gb PCIe NVMe SSD drive notes (long, so you may want to skip this review):<br/><br/>Aluminum cover, plastic housing.<br/><br/>Left side ports - Ethernet cable, HDMI, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Headphone jack.<br/>Right side ports - Kensington computer lock port, USB 2.0.<br/><br/>Notably missing - no port for SD cards at all.<br/><br/>Not a touch screen, but nice in color and clarity. (Opinions on screens and keyboards tend to vary widely - what suits me perfectly may seem to be junk to you, so YMMV).<br/><br/>The speakers on the front underside - the sound is O.K. (for an inexpensive laptop) but volume is lacking.<br/><br/>Power supplied through a proprietary Acer plug, not through a USB-C port.  Cord can only attach to the laptop on the left side (as seen by the user at the keyboard).<br/><br/>Windows "S" is installed; it is limited to running apps available only in the Microsoft Store.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - move up to Windows 10 Home.  It's a free upgrade - with the caveat that you cannot return to "S" version.<br/><br/>To upgrade to Home version (instructions as of the date of this review; I assume/accept no responsibility if things go awry.  You may want to Google instructions to verify):<br/><br/>Go to Settings.<br/>Then select Update &amp; Security.<br/>In the left sidebar, click Activation.<br/>Then click “Go to the Store.”<br/>Press the “Get” button under the “Switch out of S Mode” section and in a very short time you'll be assigned the Windows Home version.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - if you want to encrypt your laptop you may want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.  These upgrades are not free, check Microsoft for current pricing.<br/><br/>The Aspire 5 has a TPM chip so encryption will not require a boot password (not your Windows password).<br/><br/>If you want to set a boot password for the computer (not your Windows password) you can set that in BIOS.  Don't forget it - resetting a boot password on a laptop can be a pain and a half (or impossible) to rectify.  See below on how to get into BIOS.<br/><br/>The included 128GB PCIe NVMe SSD drive is (for me) large enough to hold Windows 10 Enterprise and the applications I use and is quick enough to run them. I'm in I.T. support (although semi-retired) and don't use the Aspire 5 for computer games. YMMV.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add an additional SSD to the computer (screws are in the box, housing and cable required are inside the Aspire 5).  You can Google videos on how to perform the upgrade.  A second internal drive allows you to separate your data from your operating system and applications; if Windows ever has to be completely re-installed your data won't be affected.  If you keep your data in the Cloud you can set the second drive as the sync drive and not fill up “C:” drive.<br/><br/>The chip, an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, does pretty well for my purposes.  Again, gamers may have a different opinion so YMMV. I've had no issues when viewing training or YouTube videos.<br/><br/>The battery life won't get me through a typical support day without at least some recharge time - Acer claims up to 7 1/2 hours but, of course, that depends on what you're doing.  Watching videos will eat more power than writing a project proposal in Word.  YMMV, but I bought a second power cord to take with me to client offices while leaving the cord  at my home office plugged in. I seem to be getting 5 hours, maybe a bit better, with the screen set to maximum brightness.<br/><br/>The machine doesn't get overly warm in use (again, I'm not a gamer), but I use a laptop board most of the time when the laptop isn't on a hard surface, so there is nearly always some airflow under the machine.<br/><br/>The included 4gb of included RAM is really the absolute minimum to think about with Windows 10.<br/><br/>Suggested upgrade - add a single 4gb RAM chip in the empty slot (Google for videos on that) to bring the total to 8gb RAM. After installing the additional 4gb the computer will report 8gb installed with "5.94gb usable".  The 'missing' RAM is being commandeered by the Radeon software for the display.  If you need/want more the machine can support up to 32gb (1 16gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed).  16gb would require 1 8gb chip in each slot, discarding the 4gb already installed.  For business purposes (Office, Chrome and You Tube videos) I'm finding the 8gb (5.94 available) to be acceptable.  YMMV.<br/><br/>How 'easy' the RAM and hard drive upgrades are depends on how comfortable you are working with computers.  I found them quite simple.  Be careful not to crack the plastic housing when removing the bottom cover.  Using the correct plastic spudge is helpful, you can search Amazon for a selection of tools. (spudge = type of plastic or rubber pry bar).  Google the ‘how-to’ videos first.<br/><br/>"Bloatware" included with the computer isn't completely over-the-top, but it does take a few minutes to delete all of the junk.  The "Microsoft Office" included with the Aspire 5 is a 30-day trial version, not a full license.<br/><br/>After uninstalling the bloatware I installed Microsoft Office365 with Access, Adobe Photoshop Elements, DIA (a program for diagramming), AllwaySync (a backup program), Google Chrome, Splashtop Business and Personal (remote access software), VLC Media Player and a couple of network utility applications.  I have 78gb of free space left on "C" drive.<br/><br/>The three small stickers showing Ryzen chip, Aspire 5 inclusions, and Radeon graphic chip that are stuck onto the hand rest part of the computer can be easily peeled off and leave no residue (I was able to rub the remaining adhesive off easily with my thumb).  I don't know why the stickers are there - presumably if you've bought the machine you know what the details are without seeing sticky notes on the keyboard surface.  If they're for advertising purposes in the store it might be more cost effective to print advertising to be placed by the machine rather than label every machine on the production line.  I also found the "Full 1080 HD" sticker on the screen bezel easy to take off.  So I did.  If Acer is interested in putting relevant data on stickers, how about putting the Make, Exact Model Number, Serial Number, and Date of Manufacture on a sticker?  THAT one I would leave in place.  As it is you need to flip the machine upside down to see the manufacturer's information.  (Sorry - this is a pet peeve of mine).<br/><br/>A couple of quick notes for those who are new to Windows laptops - if the keyboard fails to light up, check the F8 key - it can toggle the light on/off.  If you suddenly lose your WiFi connection check the F2 key - that toggles "Airplane Mode" on/off.  Note that the "function" keys are set to use the little icons (F1 is sleep, F9 is mute, etc.).  To use them as traditional function keys you need to hold down the "Fn" key simultaneously.  Fn+F9, for instance, will cause the Outlook application to re-sync when you've got that desktop app open.  If you prefer the traditional function key usage (not having to hold down the Fn key to use the keys within applications) you can toggle that in BIOS.  To get into BIOS, reboot the computer and immediately start tapping the F2 key (no Fn key required).<br/><br/>For me the 'sweet spot' of laptops is in the 14" range (11" for road trips).  That being acknowledged I don't find the extra width or weight of the Aspire 5 to be onerous - the thin screen bezel allows the claim to the 15.6" screen while not unduly expanding the overall size of the laptop.  At nearly 4 pounds it's a bit heavier than the under-three-pounds-sweetness that I prefer but it's not too bad.  Especially after removing the weight of those ridiculous stickers.  YMMV.<br/><br/>If you need more power than this machine has, Acer does offer a similar package with upgrades to the Ryzen 5 chip, 8gb of RAM, and 250gb of hard drive space as well as some other goodies:<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/Acer-A515-44-R41B-Hexa-Core-Processor-Graphics-dp-B087N4ZRXV/dp/B087N4ZRXV/ref=dp_ob_title_ce<br/><br/>HTH<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Jim</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Okay, so full disclosure.  I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.<br/><br/>First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:<br/><br/>[EditionID]<br/>Home<br/>[Channel]<br/>Retail<br/><br/>Once you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.<br/><br/>Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.<br/><br/>Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called "Vari-Bright."  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off "Vari-Bright" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.<br/><br/>The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.<br/><br/>The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.<br/><br/>I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a "nice" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.<br/><br/>The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno.<br/><br/>I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.</span>

<span>As many others have shared, the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop. The display is gorgeous. The keyboard is accurate and smooth. Apple has the best trackpads! Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the day.<br/><br/>The setup experience is so good with Apple products. All I had to do was choose my language and connect to wi-fi and then moments later the laptop was ready for me to login.<br/><br/>The laptop integrates so well with the other Apple devices. Although I wonder why it wanted my iPhone's lock screen passcode. I am not sure how secure I feel that my iPhone's lock screen password is shared over the air with the laptop... Otherwise the MacBook Air is a great device for consuming content and for light-creative work.</span>

<span>I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.<br/><br/>The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.<br/><br/>I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.<br/><br/>The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.<br/><br/>One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.<br/><br/>I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!</span>

<span>This laptop was a disgrace! It last only a year we take it to Best Buy they told my son to bring it to Apple but they said it will cost almost the same amount of money to buy a new one. I dindon trust Apple anymore I suggested him to buy a dell laptop instead. This was a gift to my son that graduated from high school with honor going to college I felt so honored for the grade that he graduated with. Sadly it was a waste of money. It’s so sad now a day people spending more money and get poor quality of thing</span>

<span>OK, this is my second Stream.  The original was a 32GB that is still operating and is obviously limited by the couple GB remaining after the operating system space.  However, was useful for web browsing.  This one is 64GB and that leaves about 30GB space for programs plus one year of MS Office free.  I got rid of the Windows 10 S mode and the speed for web browsing and program operation is fine.  And I'm used to an Intel 11th generation i5 on a desktop and have no complaints. That is an absolutely amazing unit for $200.  Of course, in both cases, I've added extra room using a USB 128GB flash drive so really, it's a fantastic deal.  The only con that I've found so far is that the sound is rather puny but connecting a cheap bluetooth speaker solves that issue.  Update:  I hooked this up to an external monitor and it gave me an option to go from the native internal screen resolution of 1366x768 to 1920 x 1080 and it shows up great on the external monitor.  I'm shocked.  I cannot believe this computer was $200.  Well, we'll see how long it lasts.</span>

<span>Is a really thin and light laptop, the build materials and the style are clean and settle that add some points on being a powerful gaming laptop without screaming it. Having a Thunderbolt 4 port expands a lot of posibilities to eGPU if you want to add a more powerfull graphic card.<br/><br/>But some things to have in mind are i.e:<br/>- RGB is just one zone in the keyboard, it doesn't have indivitual lights for each letter<br/>- The 3060 is the 65W version so is not as powerfull at first glence if you are planning to game at really high setting or get the same performance from those benchmarks videos. Also to squeez the max from the GPU you have to set the profile to "Max perfomance" in the MSI Dragon Center if not it will limited to 40W and really you can see the diference.<br/>- The fan noise at max power can be a bit to loud but you can get use to and better a cold loud laptop that an quiet oven.<br/>- Minimun upgrability, you can upgrade the RAM but is a headache and the storage you have to remove the current M.2 to add a bigger one.<br/><br/>So far I'm happy with it and you will if accept these "buts"</span>

<span>Needed a new laptop. Old one was outdated. Friend recommended this one. It has everything I need for both school and gaming. The 3060 handles every game I played so far. Haven’t played any crazy big games but for csgo and  league of legends it handled completely fine. Another side I really like is the fact that it’s super light. Definitely not like the old Bulky gaming laptops. Performance can always be better but in the convenience aspect it’s perfect</span>

<span>So far this laptop has been great, quick up boot up, plays my simple games very smoothly, haven't tried any too demanding yet but it does get quite warm, not concerning but should be noted.  I saw many reviews stating that the screen didn't do colors well but i haven't noticed that to be the case at all.  A bigger hard drive then the 512gb would be nice but i just added an external hard drive.  Would have also liked to see it come with the thunderbolt hub they show with it but it's not included.  Maybe add another usb 3.x port. I like the light up keyboard.</span>

<span>A fantastic laptop for the low price. The look and design of the laptop is very nice and sleek. The only odd thing about it is the fans on the side pushing all the ports to the middle of the sides. Everything worked out of the box and the MSI Dragon Center is one of the best control centers I've seen among all my previous computers. They keyboard is also very nice. I love the rgb control you have and the presets you can choose from are very satisfying. The laptop has also been very quiet so far. While it has gotten just a little warm, I feel like that's to be expected with literally any gaming laptop on the market so I don't think I can knock it for that, especially when its been minimal.</span>

<span>So far this laptop seems decent. Manage you’re expectations. You can’t buy a mid-range gaming laptop and expect all the best. I’ve yet to try some of the more demanding games. But for the games I play these days, like Fortnite, Apex, Rust, R6 Siege, Subnautica, and No Man’s Sky, it’s performing pretty well.<br/><br/>I will say one thing negative: in the pictures, the USB-C port shows the Thunderbolt icon. When I received my laptop, the Thunderbolt icon was missing and only showed the normal USB icon. I was excited for the thunderbolt port but alas the port is not Thunderbolt. This cost them a star on my review simply because having it in the pictures is misleading and they should be updated to reflect the correct icon.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span class="cr-original-review-content">Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un año y estas son mis impresiones:<br/><br/>1. Lo que más me gustó es la capacidad de expansión: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.<br/>2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuración. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.<br/>3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan cómoda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representación de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendaría para edición de video o fotografía, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.<br/>4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atrás, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualización.<br/>5. La batería dura máximo 3 horas y media.<br/>6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Sería ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.<br/>7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).<br/>8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad después del primer mes empezó a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera años de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.<br/>9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los plásticos no es la mejor. Más pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.<br/>10. La cámara y el micrófono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferirán conectar mejores dispositivos.<br/><br/>Conclusión: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12° generación o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, sería mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o está unos 200 dólares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.</span><span class="cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden"></span>

<span>My son sent me the page for this, knowing what my desired specs and budget were.  Then I read the reviews and was almost scared away.  He talked me into at least trying it and I am so so glad I did!!<br/><br/>I love everything about it.  I am not a gamer, the games I play generally do not require high specs.  However, I do photo and video editing, and a lot of multi-tasking.  This laptop works well for everything I do.<br/><br/>I have not experienced any problems with the display, you do have to make sure the cord clicks into the back, and the keyboard has a nice feel to it (I type a lot).  My only cons are the battery life (3-4 hours), and I do wish I could adjust the light on keyboard.  I don't mind the red, but do find it annoying that it doesn't light up until the first keystroke.  I often use the computer in a dim or dark room, so finding that first key is annoying,  There should be a light up key.Like hitting space to light up and it doeant make a space if used before typing anything else.  That is a minor thing tho.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I am very pleased with this laptop and hope it lasts me as many years as my previous one did.</span>
