The ASUS Laptop L210MA is designed to help you be productive all day — even when you’re on the move. This compact and lightweight 11.6 inch laptop is powered by the latest Intel processor and provides long lasting battery life. With eMMC storage and pre-loaded Windows 10 in S mode, it offers full compatibility with a wide range of software and peripherals. It’s the best laptop for people on the go. *The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 (Gen 1 and 2), and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to  system configuration and your operating environment.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>Note: This review is for those thinking about run a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.<br/><br/>Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri doesnt detect the Realtek wifi adapter that comes with this laptop which is an extremely common problem in the Linux world (in fact, I already know because there were reviews here that said they had to rely on a USB wifi adapter). I tried using a USB Ethernet adapter to connect to the internet and running [apt update/upgrade] hoping that it will install the correct drivers but no luck. However, even [lspci] doesnt event detect the wifi adapter so I just gave up. I bought a generic wifi adapter carrying the latest Intel AX210 for about $40. This new model allows for WiFi 6e and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and I tested this on a Windows 10 Pro laptop prior to bringing it over to this Linux machine so I know that the adapter I bought actually delivered these specs. So then I swapped the Realtek with the new Intel wifi adapter and reinstalled the same Ubuntu version. I had wifi even during setup when I was booting the installer from USB. But after installation, only bluetooth was detected. The solution was to [apt update/upgrade] and restart. Then boom now I have wifi and also Bluetooth 5.2 (I didnt include pics but when I ran [hciconfig -a] the version is 5.2) thanks to Intel AX210. I didnt need to manually install other drivers - it just worked after a system update.<br/><br/>Note that you have to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS/UEFI settings for the new wifi adapter hardware to be recognized by the OS. This means that the Secure Boot status should be "Inactive" (or something like that). Delete those stored keys if you need to.<br/><br/>So far, i dont have any issues with it running Ubuntu. The camera, usb ports, and m.2 ssd slots all work fine. I havent used the Bluetooth 5.2 though since no need for it. Also, doing basic computer stuff like web browsing and word processing is not lightning fast but also not slow. It takes a few seconds to open Firefox but watching 1080p videos is no problem. I tried running 1 Lububtu virtual machine and I didnt have any problems, but it is kinda slow - though tolerable.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

The non-touch version has no SD card reader and no extra camera above the keyboard. The RAM memory is onboard, you cannot replace or add more. Also the volume/brightness keys are not in the arrows, what makes it counter-intuitive if you want to switch volume at night since the keyboard has no backlit.<br/><br/>Good news is that it comes with an empty M.2 SSD slot that let you add an extra space.

<span>I bought this for my 8yr old to do his class projects and so that he doesn't put his sticky food fingers all over my Laptop. He loves to show off this laptop to others as his "Mac". This laptop is simple to use - just switch on login your gmail id and your are good to go. The flip book option is the best when hes doing work that doesnt require typing but just touching and selecting. It has a webcam and a mic to speak to google. We do not use that. All work he does is always on google doc hence Microsoft office is not missed. This may probably last a couple of years until he goes to middle school. It is also very very light for a child to carry around. Only con is it is of no use if you dont have wifi. It works only on wifi and a gmail account.</span>

<span>I researched chromebooks for months before making my purchase and am so glad I did.  Others may have differing criteria and parameters than mine, but here's the breakdown of my research and why I chose this HP X360 12" model:<br/>it was a 2-in-1 laptop/tablet with a chrome OS (I had no need for full functionality of laptops with Microsoft OS, so why pay more for it?  Plus for me, chrome is much easier to use.)<br/><br/>It was small and lightweight, making it more manageable when in tablet mode.<br/><br/>The aspect ratio of 3:2 vs the more standard 16:9 is OUTSTANDING for my purposes, being web browsing, email, documents, etc.  I rarely stream videos, which is the only drawback of the 3:2, since videos are in 16:9, but even when I do, I don't at all mind the upper and lower bordering.  Plus the 3:2 allows for a larger screen in a smaller overall sized device, which to me is much more practical.  DEFINITE a plus in my book!!<br/><br/>By process of elimination, I chose an HP product for the following reasons:<br/>My research revealed a lot of disgruntled customers of Lenova products in regard to warranty issues and customer service.<br/>The smaller model chromebooks, of which I was researching were not equipt with C-type USB ports in the Acer models and ONLY equipt with C-type USB ports with Asus models.  I wanted at least one of each type, C and A.<br/>And Dell had little to offer in the small chromebook market.<br/>That left HP, of which my family has owned many different devices over the years and with which has had no issues, so I was happy to own another HP product.<br/><br/>In regard to performance, it was extremely easy to set up and get going.  Chrome OS stepped me through all the settings, and personalization.  It took no time at all.  I've been using it daily for weeks, and have had no issues with speed or any other performance criteria.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say the main selling feature for me with this model, beyond being an HP, was the 3:2 aspect ratio.  I LOVE it!  I highly recommend this HP X360 12" chromebook!!</span>

<span>I purchased the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 to use as a bedside entertainment center, so I wanted something that could stream and have quality screen resolution.  I liked the idea of a device that I could position with the screen set back (open like a laptop) or set forward (flip it and go triangular, baby!); I also needed a reliable blue tooth as I wear comfy headphones that I can sleep in.  I have an extensive music collection that I keep on an external SSD and I absolutely love MediaMonkey because of it's customizable interface on it's Window's app (I assumed the ChromeOS version would be very similar - my first major stumble).<br/><br/>First, the positive:  The device itself is fantastic.  Everything about it feels sturdy, the touchscreen is responsive (though, I will say there are times when I feel I have to hit an app 2 or 3 times to activate).  The screen resolution and sound quality are lovely for a device of this size and price - don't go expecting studio quality here, but the streaming was beautiful.  The visuals are not pixelated; it's as good as watching on a television (only smaller).  Oh, and I will say I love the fact that the USB-C port is on both sides, which makes it easier to plug in on any side (it's the little things).<br/><br/>Performance is great, I get no lag and I've had no issues streaming Netflix, Hulu or Disney+.  I just realized I haven't tried watching Twitch or Youtube on this.  I'll download those apps and if I have any problems with them, I'll update this review and let you know.<br/><br/>I have one grouse, and it's kind of a biggie:  The apps are terrible.  It was so dismaying at first, I did actually contemplate sending the device back.  I slept on it and decided I was going to stick it out.  In truth, part of my disappointment is that the ChromeOS version of MediaMonkey is disappointing.  When it came down to it, I tried a whole slew of music apps and I wound up settling on the music app that annoyed me the least (VLC).  Most of the apps have ads that are intrusive, and even the ones I thought about paying for just don't seem worth the value.<br/><br/>Even simple apps like an alarm clock or a blue tooth manager:  I downloaded several different ones, and I'm continually settling on the app that annoys me the least or seems to be able to handle some of what I would like.  I even tried to find a power button app because I just wanted to turn off the computer with a single, on screen button push - despite over a dozen apps that claimed to do this, all of them performed poorly and one you had to close out an ad before it would turn off (really?!?).<br/><br/>In choosing whether or not to keep it, I had to weigh the solid build and reliable performance against an operating system that was under par for Windows or Mac.<br/><br/>That said, I'm very glad I kept this little guy.  In the end, it's a reliable little entertainment unit and it's wonderful where it counts: It's a great streamer (with a beautiful picture) and it plays music that I love and I can leave it in place and listen on my blue tooth headphones while I wander all over the house.  The apps are a shame, but honestly, given the price point here, it's a good deal and I can live with it.</span>

<span>For being such an inexpensive laptop this Acer Chromebook Spin 311 Convertible Laptop is a great choice for a child! I got this for my 9 year old and he has had it for about 9 months now, and he genuinely uses this just as much as his iPad and our desktop computer.<br/><br/>The fact that this is touchscreen and can be folded to make it a tablet is really cool. It really is amazing that you can get a touchscreen 2-in-1 laptop for $200-$300 is just amazing, it’s crazy how much bang for your buck you can get these days!<br/><br/>The touchscreen on this is very responsive, I was worried that at such a low price point it would not be, but we have had no issues at all thus far with it. And the screen is actually surprisingly good as well. Compared to my sons school laptop/chrome book that is not touch screen the display on this is actually pretty darn amazing. Half the time I can hardly see his school chrome books screen, and what’s crazy is that both this and the school one are in the same price range. In fact the school one is slightly higher!<br/><br/>Obviously this laptop isn’t going to be for everyone. But if you are looking for something for your child for either schoolwork or play, or both, then I would highly highly recommend this!</span>

<span>Running a small family business you want to buy the best of the best but still be careful with where you spend your dollars. Generally we would have just gone the Apple or hp route, everything we have is Apple for personal and currently hp for business but honestly when we compared apple v hp v msi v asus v Lenovo I forgot what other, we decided to lean into MSI.<br/><br/>We got 2 different MSI Creator units because they were both on promotion and looking at spec for the price we think we got a good deal. We're familiar with their gaming line which is all about high performance so we assumed they'd be bringing that level of performance to their Creator line. It's also why we chose MSI over the other guys because they know what they're doing when it comes to high performance.<br/><br/>Out the box they powered on easily, only one of the two needed an update but took less than five minutes. We're going to have to get used to the windows platform but other than that pretty satisfied with our purchases. And to be honest, I like the Creator look over Apple. It has a touch more of class. Gasp I know.<br/><br/>The only thing I have to note is that the battery life could be better BUT with the kind of GPU it has you can't really complain. And when I am on editing or running design softwares I am usually plugged in anyway soooo honestly not a kill for our little business.<br/><br/>so far so good, if it works out long term, don't think I'll have to buy another apple/hp laptop for our business again.</span>

<span>Had this laptop for a little over a week. I've been running Adobe photoshop, Premier Pro, and After effects. It has enough RAM to run photoshop at the same time as Premier, although I did run into some trouble with not enough RAM during After Effects previews. If a 64GB option was available, I would have gone for that instead since I'm using AE a lot but this is still decent. Laptop body is nice. Metal, not plastic. Heavy, but that's to be expected given that it had a 17" screen. Battery life isn't that great. It's about 2 hours. Again, understandable considering this thing is a beast comparable to a desktop PC. I don't travel with it though so plugging in is a non-issue for me. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. It's an excellent choice.</span>

<span>The computer is great. Runs fast, only issue I have is the low quality of the display. Major white bleed all over. I even had amazon send me a replacement and the one they sent had more white bleed than the one they sent initially, so I just had to keep the original because it’s still worthwhile. I just wish for the money I paid I could’ve gotten a display with no bleeding.</span>
