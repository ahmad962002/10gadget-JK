The ASUS Laptop L210MA is designed to help you be productive all day — even when you’re on the move. This compact and lightweight 11.6 inch laptop is powered by the latest Intel processor and provides long lasting battery life. With eMMC storage and pre-loaded Windows 10 in S mode, it offers full compatibility with a wide range of software and peripherals. It’s the best laptop for people on the go. *The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 (Gen 1 and 2), and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to  system configuration and your operating environment.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>When you buy this, just know that you won’t have a lot of internal storage to work with. I bought an sd card to handle my storage effectively. When you get close to having the internal storage met, expect performance issues. The computer will work slower and just seem to struggle with keeping up.<br/><br/>This is NOT a gaming laptop. Please consider buying a different laptop if you wanted to game. It really doesn’t have the frame rate to handle games that are large. I used this laptop to play Roblox with students of mine and 9/10 this laptop could not keep up.<br/><br/>As for a work laptop it’s lightweight and easy to use. I use this laptop for zoom meetings(with an external camera, not the internal one), homework, writing and casual browsing. It does this job well. I generally won’t watch anything on it because the audio quality isn’t great, but if I had to use this laptop I would play the audio with headphones or a speaker.<br/><br/>Overall for school, work, or causal browsing Id definitely recommend this laptop.<br/><br/>PS this is not a backlit keyboard.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I'll do my best to update this review as time goes on.<br/><br/>23 Aug 2022 -- Day 0 -- I just received the laptop. So far it's impressive for the price point. First thing I did was charge it up, start-up (don't connect to the internet if you want to bypass Microsofts mandatory account login) and immediately went to disable S mode.  If you don't already know, S-Mode means you can ONLY install Microsoft apps from their app store. Nope. Gone. That's when I noticed the first issue.<br/><br/>The title of the laptop I purchased was "ASUS L410 MA-DB02 Ultra Thin Laptop, 14” FHD Display, Intel Celeron N4020 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, NumberPad, Windows 10 Home in S Mode, Star Black"<br/><br/>The laptop I received has Windows 11 S-mode installed. Thankfully my applications installed correctly. I'll do my best to not turn this into a Microsoft/Windows rant - but yes, things are different from 10.<br/><br/>Another thing to note. The description on the Amazon website (and even the photos) say this laptop comes with a backlit keyboard, which was a huge selling point for me given the use I had planned for it. Taken right from the description "L410 comes with a backlit keyboard." This laptop does NOT have a backlit keyboard. The key F7 is blank. Pressing it does nothing, even w/ the Function Key + F7.  Bummer.<br/><br/>Otherwise, seems like a legit laptop so far. I'll update if anything changes.</span>

<span>So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)<br/>Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:<br/><br/>- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).<br/><br/>- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.<br/><br/>- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.<br/><br/>- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)<br/><br/>- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.<br/><br/>- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.<br/><br/>Some of the cons:<br/>- The power adapter is a very small "pin" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.<br/>- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.<br/>- No Thunderbolt Port<br/>- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)<br/><br/>So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.<br/><br/>So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.</span>

<span>Ive inly been really using this laptop for like a month and a half but Its a good laptop. For rreference though My last laptop I had was used when I recieved it and "on its last legs" and started having noticible issues once it turned 11 years old...I enjoy doing video editing and that over a decade old laptop was no longer covering it so I decided to inest in this laptop. With its core I7 processer of 16gb of ram its doing really well amd seems to not struggle at all for what I do and or need. Its a good computer cabale of doing lots of work and the battery life is superb. I ran a couple of stress tests on it and it preformed well. The one downside is that because its windows 11 alot of stuff that was free and or included on windows 10 or lower is not included , most of the software thats available on this laptop is consistent of free trials or trying to get you to make a yearly purchase to use the programs such as the microsoft suite ( which will run 99$ a year or the price of like 9.99 a month). And the free trials are short lived or require you to put in credit card info...so I would suggest anyone who gets this laptop to be ready to either pay for what use to be free or start doing research on free open source software that is comparable to whatever programs you may want to use that are no longer free on the windows platform. Windows 11 isnt really bad its just different. As for the hardware I suggest doing your research before buying this laptop, and make sure you get the correct processer type for what you do, core I3 or below will not cut it in most cases try core i5 or higher and get atleast 16gb of ram aka memory to be on the safe side for anything other then really light light computer use. Also since this is a thinner laptop it has no cd rom and can in some cases overheat a little as it needs some ventalation when in use if doing heavy duty work which is to be expected for its thinness, and my very slight complaint is that while doing heavy duty work it can get to humming a bit too loudly for my taste but nothing that is too terribly concerning. I reccomend this laptop and I love it thus far.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love.

The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I personally love this laptop, in fact, I'm writing this review on this laptop, but that's only because it's the right laptop for my needs. This laptop is not for everyone, because I don't believe it's all that practical to be used for multimedia purposes, AKA, gaming and streaming, etc. There are specific reasons why I say this, and one of the reasons for that, is yes, just like the other reviewers say, the screen is a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to say that the screen isn't bad, it's just not great. It is a full HD display, but you do pretty much have to look straight at it to get a clear picture. You can see it okay from certain angles, but nothing too fancy. That's why I don't think it's good for multimedia, for example, if you want a laptop to stream movies and watch shows with friends and family, I would not recommend this laptop. It'll stream it just fine, because this computer is very fast, but the picture won't give a clear picture to a group of people watching it. However, if it was you, then I'd say go for it.<br/><br/>The other reason why I don't think this laptop is good for multimedia use, is because of the audio. I am going to be brutally honest when I say that the audio on this laptop is absolutely horrible. I put max volume on my Spotify, and it the volume was so unimpressive, that I could comfortably hold a conversation with someone next to it. So, not only will the screen give a person issues, but unless you have a good speaker connected, you're not going to hear any music, shows, or movies very well with this one.<br/><br/>I also don't recommend gaming on this laptop, not just for the reasons already stated above, but because of performance. This computer can perform very well at several multimedia tasks in terms of processor and memory, and you could play some simple games. But the moment you talk about WoW, or Overwatch... well, let's just say I don't believe this laptop was designed to be a gaming laptop.<br/><br/>That all being said, I love this computer because I don't need a laptop for gaming, or for multimedia purposes. I am a writer, and I also love doing research, and doing basic stuff like checking email, or Reddit. For those basic tasks, this computer is actually quite phenomenal. Because of the SSD (Solid State Drive for those that don't know), it boots up very fast. It could be completely off, and from the time I push the button to turn it on, to the time the computer is ready for whatever task I want to do, barely 4 or 5 seconds have passed. That is not an exaggeration!<br/><br/>The battery lasts for several hours, as long as you're smart about it. Like making sure the light on the keyboard is either off or low, when using the battery, and turning the screen brightness down. You can google tricks like that to extend battery life on all kinds of electronics, but as long as you do those basic things, the battery should last at least 6-7 hours.<br/><br/>The processor is super fast, and I never have to wait more than seconds, if that, for the computer to act on anything I do. The moment I click on Google Chrome, the browser and my personal front page is up in less than 2 seconds. This computer is very fast, and despite what I've said before about the screen and audio, it actually does stream Netflix and all the other streaming apps pretty well.<br/><br/>To anyone wanting to play games, watch movies with friends/family, or listen to loud music, I would not recommend this laptop. However, if you want a laptop to do everything else, I would not only recommend this laptop, but I would even go so far as to say that it's the best one on the market, for its price.</span>

<span>Like many of the reviews said, the volume is not very loud, but sound is not something I use my computer for a lot. I have a bluetooth speaker that can give me all the volume I want when I do want it. I think the screen is nicer than what some had described, especially at the price point this computer came in at. Also like many reviews said, the keyboard is not backlit as it is described, unless I'm missing something to turn it on. This was not really a big deal to me, but wish it wouldn't be in the description if it don't have it. Otherwise, I've had it for a few days and am enjoying it very much. For what I paid it seems very fast for my use and a great value.</span>

<span>First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!<br/><br/>This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.<br/>2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.<br/>3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.<br/>4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.<br/>5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.<br/>6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.<br/>7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been less<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.<br/>2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.</span>

<span>I decided to pick up this laptop (Acer Aspire 5 A515-46-R3CZ) during the early access prime day sale. I had been looking for a new one for a while and this had been on my radar for a while. Upgradeable memory and storage with a decent CPU running Radeon Vega 10, that's a solid deal. I get it delivered and get it all set up and I set up to run to a local computer parts store to get the upgrades. I am really glad I decided to crack it open before heading out or I would have wasted some money.<br/><br/>There is only one slot for ram, not two as many of the picture in reviews had shown. The 8gb of ram that is already there is integrated which means you are limited to 16gb total. Not the 32gb that looking up the Aspire 5 515-46 online will show.<br/><br/>It's still a decent laptop from the price, the upgradeable SSD and (limited) upgradeable ram are nice, but some more clarity in product descriptions and only showing relevant reviews would be great. So far this has been great, it boots almost instantly, everything runs quick (once you get the bloatware off), and it has handled some light gaming. At the end of the day it is stillworth the purchase, even not on sale, just know what you are buying.</span>

<span>I bought this with the intention of running Zorin OS and never booting into Windows. So far this laptop has been great. The screen is very nice, the keyboard is decent, touch pad works well, I have never heard the fans, external GPU does work, and the battery is great; which is the main reason I purchased this laptop.<br/><br/>In case anyone is interested in also installing Zorin, the camera login isn't working for me even after trying some workaround, webcam works but the hello windows alternative does not. I'll report back after some time, I think its just a driver issue. The finger print driver also does not work. There are some claims that some users were able to get this working but I have not been successful. I'm not really all that interested in those options but it would be nice to get the finger print device to work. For graphics, the Xe driver doesn't seem to work that well but I'm guessing that with some time, this will change.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm super impressed and very happy with this purchase. I can't speak for Windows as I never let it boot before wiping out of the box, due to the systems specifications the bloat in Windows likely causes some resource issues. I imagine that this is what causes most of the bad reviews on this system, outside of hardware issues, hot tip, avoid manufacturer warranties, complain to amazon and get a new one shipped...<br/><br/>I did end up buying another for a family member (50+) and installed Zorin on theirs as well, after a week they say its their favorite laptop ever so take that as you will.</span>

<span>While it has a USB-C port, it did NOT come with a USB -C charger--just the big bulky plugin barrel charger. You will need to buy a separate 65W UBC-C charger if you don't want to lug around the traditional brick charger.<br/><br/>Laptop is thin and light, yet feels sturdy. I haven't experienced the fan noise. Can confirm the speakers are very weak--just don't get loud enough. Screen is big (minimum bevel) bright, and crisp. There was some bloatware installed but easily removed. It's almost a blue-grey color. Fingerprint logon is super convenient.<br/><br/>So far so good!  I've only had this a few days but it's been working great for me.</span>

<span>This computer seems nice enough out of the box. Easy to set up, runs Windows, etc. I'm sitting there playing a game six days later, and all the sudden a puff of smoke comes out the back. Now I'm sitting here staring at Acer's chat support app. If an agent ever joins the chat, I'll update this review. As of now, it looks like I paid $1,100 for a brick.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It took almost six weeks, but I got the laptop factory-repaired for free, and I have it back. It's a nice laptop for what it costs. By way of illustrating that point, the first thing the Acer support people said to me was "this'll be easier if you just send it back to Amazon. They'll give you a replacement immediately, and we'll repair the unit on the back end." Only problem was, a week after I bought it, the laptop was completely backordered.<br/><br/>From where I sit, this product seems like the kind of thing where you can get a deal for being willing to put in a little elbow grease. The Acer factory maybe needs better QC, but their Tier-2 tech support handled the problem about as well as could have been expected.<br/><br/>If it breaks again I'll update.</span>

<span>Great overall laptop, powerful chip,nice screen, but not that bright (will be enough for indoor usage) battery is ok` will be enough for 2-3 movies pretty good build quality, great keyboard. I bought this for 379$ on prime day , for that amount of money this is a steal. The one and only major downside of this laptop are the speakers , they sound ok but not loud and no bass. But overall for the amount I paid for this `it is a beast. For working , casual use don't even think ` get this laptop. And the Ryzen 5500u with radeon vega graphics allows to play even triple A titles (of course on lowest possible  settings) and for Cs , Valorant ,Minecraft and for many other low end games this thing rocks.</span>

<span>I bought this while convalescing from open-heart surgery away from home, mainly to handle the large quantity of e-mail newsletters I receive daily.  It's ideal for that, and for most web-surfing.  Long battery life, with relatively fast recharge, decent (for a laptop) keyboard, very good non-touch display.  Processor is more powerful than most users will need, but I like having extra processing power.  Only 3.5 pounds, it's easy to move from room to room.<br/><br/>Biggest downside is the somewhat small 250GB SSD, but even that is more than most people who consider this laptop would ever need.  I plan on outfitting it with an external HDD or SSD if/when such becomes necessary.  This is an *additional* laptop (I have another, more powerful one that I use at home), and will use this one mostly while traveling; at barely 3.5 pounds, it's ideal for that purpose.</span>

<span>It has a comfortable keyboard, respectable I/O (USB 2 on the right side is questionable but I just use it for a mouse anyways), fantastic chipset, and is pretty easy to DIY upgrade, I upgraded mine from 8 to 20gb of RAM. Runs Linux Mint like a charm although the fingerprint reader doesn’t work with either Mint or Fedora out of the box. It’s great for the price and an excellent choice for a back to school laptop for college, especially if you get it on sale, the AMD APU is a total workhorse for most office tasks and light gaming/media editing.</span>

<span>The i7 just gets way too hot. So hot that it quickly throttles CPU performance to less than the i5 model. The screen is decent quality and I love the form-factor but I ended up returning and purchasing an i5 model that stays snappy and much cooler than the i7 counterpart.</span>

<span>I so badly wanted this to be a good light weight replacement for my heavier MacBook. And even though they improved the keyboard and trackpad over the last generation gram, it still does not compare to that of a Mac. I don’t like the off centered keys with the numeric keypad on the right. It feels weird to type on. And why can’t a windows machine have a good haptic touch trackpad like the MacBook ? They’ve been doing it for years.<br/><br/>I’m just gonna stick with my slightly heavier MacBook. The extra pound or two is worth the weight over using something that feels like cheap plastic.</span>
