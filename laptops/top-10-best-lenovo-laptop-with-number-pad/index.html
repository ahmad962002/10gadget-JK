<span>Despite all battery saving attempts, this thing leaves me worried to go anywhere that I cant plug in. And, this day and age, needing to carry the stupid cord around is Ludacris. ZERO complaints otherwise; great little device. I also own a Lenovo thinkpad, which has USB-C charging; meaning i can take a power bank or other to charge on the go... This.. nope. I should have went for another chromebook, i think.</span>

<span>Just bought this for my mom! She loves it!  She is an awesome childbirth educator and has created a self paced online All-in-One prenatal course for pregnant and new moms. She will be using the Lenovo to: make more online courses, for posting videos on her You Tube channel - Humsa Prenatals, for social media, promotion and marketing of her courses, and for her website Humsa Prenatals dot com. She says that the screen is clear and wide, loves the key board, she was able to connect it to an external LG monitor with a HDMI cable. She just wishes there were more ports. She is using one port for a Logitech unifying receiver, that leaves only one port for her USB drive. She would have to buy a Multi port hub. She loves the sleek appearance. The grey silver color is pleasing to the eye. The keys are visible. The base got heated up hence she has put it up on plastic lids so that it is elevated. That helped. The webcam can be hidden by just moving a slider, what a relief! All in all, a good buy. She hopes it will last her for years to come.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>Chromebooks have a life cycle of 8 years - this one was made in 2020, so it has about 6 or so years of support left. I didn't care and all I wanted was something small and light so I could write on my bed. I don't mind that it's a chromebook - in fact, this is my first chromebook and I'm in love. I'm planning to get another one for Black Friday if the price is good enough, because I love this one so much (I[m planning to have an indoor chromebook and an outdoor chromebook). The screen is a bit iffy, but it's good enough. I use this one more than I do my $700 tablet. I don't do anything heavy with it, so this is perfect for my needs.</span>

<span>We ordered 4 of these for the company and each one came with a backlit keyboard. Other reviews here state theirs didn't. It's clear that this is just a 'luck of the draw' and some in the batch have it; some dont. IMO, Lenovo should stipulate which ones do and don't as this is an importnat feature for many. (eg. Lenovo E15i or something).<br/>This is an excellent laptop. The Intel processor plays better than the AMD one, we have found, since AMD tries to install display drivers which aren't compatible with external displays hooked up to this laptop. No issues with the Intel one so far.<br/>Have have ordered several dozen of the AMD variant (no backlights on any of those) from another seller. Will likely go with this seller and the Intel variant from here on out.</span>

<span>While the descrition does not say either way the pictures show the backlight button on the space bar and when looking at this laptop pretty much anywhere it seems this is a pretty standard option.  The particular model I received is not equiped with it.  If this is a feature you are looking forward to as I was perhaps look for this same computer under a different model number.  Outside of this it is a perfect computer for what I need and touchpad is great, keyboard is great, nice to have the separate buttons for mouse clicks in some situiations is helpfull.  I have always been a Lenovo fan because they are built very well and durable. Overall the computer is great but I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard.  Not a huge dealbreaker but would have been great to have.  If this is important to you I highly recomend this computer just maybe shop around for it under a differnt model number.</span>

<span>Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.<br/><br/>Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.<br/><br/>Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.<br/><br/>Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.</span>

<span>I wish I didn't gift this to my 11 yo, lol!! It is such an awesome little machine. Great screen quality for picture and clarity, even side viewing. She plays Roblox on it and Toca Boca World - it runs all other apps perfectly and way better than my IdeaPad 3 (2022) - that's the difference in price points. We use this for homeschooling, gaming (as mentioned above) and general viewing apps such as Netflix, Disney+ and of course Amazon browsing. The touchscreen is worth the price point. Still has a few more years of Chrome OS updates.</span>

<span>Overall, I would say the laptop is great. It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good,<br/>overall good chromebook.<br/>I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff.<br/><br/>I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient.<br/><br/>I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this.<br/><br/>There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more. Best laptop I could find and really pleasantly surprised overall in many areas.</span>

<span>This laptop has many nice features most basic ones don't have like the Dolby speakers, the security screen, the long life battery and the side ports like HDMI, SD card port, A port and C port. It also has a solid state drive and good storage too.  These are just part of why it is a light fast laptop above the basic ones out there for the same money or less.  As others say it is not for a gamer but gamers will know that right away. This is best for a personal computer when you usually have only a work one or it would also be above the average student type one because of some of the hardware that makes if fast and light and slim for a 14 inch. It is fast and easy to connect in every way and that is a very good thing.</span>

<span>This laptop is great I have been using it for almost a month. I use it for many things. Some of the great things about it are it has a great battery life of 5-6 hours and it charges fast. I am a stay-at-home mom and I use it to check my kid's school work and watch a movie on Netflix Social media and for shopping. The quality is clear it is user-friendly I am not too savvy in computers so this works great for me. other features are great volume fingerprint scan to log in and easy to hold.</span>

<span> Overall this is a lovely laptop. I like the fact that it is exceptionally lightweight. Also, the battery charge time was lightning fast; add that as a plus. Finally, the keyboard is easy to type, especially at a lower-level desk. Some drawbacks are that it is not a touchscreen and has no side numeric keys, but overall, I like this little laptop. It will be my new on-the-road unit.</span>

<span>The quality-price is good, if you need only basic funtions? it's the best!</span>

<span>I don't understand all the negative reviews about the screen. It's not the BEST laptop screen I've ever used, but FAR from the worst. And for less than $250? Are you guys kidding me? Are you expecting an ipad pro level screen?<br/><br/>The laptop is solid even though it's plastic, I'm not worried about putting this thing in my backpack. While the keyboard is a little stiff for my taste, it works well. I'm just used to my mechanical keyboard on my desktop. I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:<br/><br/>Perfectly fine.<br/>Solid.<br/>Reliable.<br/>Lenovo-quality.<br/>I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.<br/><br/>The negatives?<br/><br/>The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.<br/><br/>Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade.</span>

<span>I am a Business Administration student and it was a great purchase. I have always preferred Google to Windows so it helps a lot.<br/>I must say if you use Microsoft it becomes a little slower than usual but it is not a big speed difference.<br/>Overall this is an awesome and a great purchase.</span>
