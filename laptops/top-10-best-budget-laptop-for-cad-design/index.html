<span>Acer Swift X SFX14-42G-R607 Creator Laptop |<br/><br/>14" Full HD 100% sRGB: The biggest downside if you are a gamer. The 60hz display. While it looks beautiful, brightens really well, and looks stunning.... games will be sluggish. I guess if you are a content creator or using the laptop for productivity, the screen would be great.<br/><br/>AMD Ryzen 7 5825U - Not a bad processor at all. Again, pretty powerful if you are just creating content or using for standard productivity.<br/><br/>NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU: impressive graphic card for a 14-in laptop that is not considered a gaming laptop. For a hardcore gamer, this graphics card would not be enough. For a mid-range gamer (overwatch, for example), it would suffice. But again, the drawback here is the 60 hz screen.<br/><br/>16GB LPDDR4X: The ram is soldered on, so you won't be able to improve on this. 16 GB, although becoming outdated, is not too bad.<br/><br/>512GB SSD:Plenty of space being that most of what we do is on the cloud, and especially cuz you won't be playing any AAA titles that need a large amount of space.<br/><br/>Wi-Fi 6: well not bad, you could always upgrade it to the Wi-Fi 6e card by opening it up.<br/><br/>Overall, it really depends what you're going to get this laptop for.<br/><br/>If you are getting it to edit videos, create content, word processing, use for school, use for medium to light work, used for middle of the road gaming... the portability is fantastic. Super light, super thin, and nice gray finish.<br/><br/>If you are getting this laptop to be able to play AAA titles on the go, it won't happen. You're better off with a Razer Blade 14 or a Rog. Substantial price difference.<br/><br/>I personally have a desktop gaming PC and I thought it would be a Good laptop to play overwatch and some lighter games while traveling, but the 60 hz screen ruined it for me.</span>

<span>I've had very hit or miss luck with laptops, regardless of the hardware specs. I can finally confidently replace the old desktop with this one. Performing great and a great price. I'm not a hardcore gamer or anything, but it's probably good for a casual gamer like myself, and I've done video editing with no problem as well.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop with the intention of using it for school and for some light gaming. I wanted something thin, small, light, with good battery life.  I didn't expect to pay such a low price for an item matching my requirements. This is a great laptop but it's got things that one should know about before buying.<br/><br/>Speakers: They are bad, not decent, outright bad. There is little sound clarity and they are very quiet. If the sound is important, I recommend looking somewhere else.<br/><br/>Bloatware: Too much, it's difficult to get rid of and it will try to sneak its way back in. At least it stays hidden and doesn't pop up. Be warned, this laptop comes with one of those annoying anti-viruses. It took little effort to get rid of it and it never came back.<br/><br/>Screen: Looks nice, a lot better than a budget laptop. But, this isn't a Surface, Macbook, or XPS. Do not expect an amazing screen. Expect a good screen, it's pretty bright as well.<br/><br/>Battery: This is where she starts to shine. This laptop is rocking some serious specs, yet the battery lasts a good bit. No, we're not talking all day, but 6 hours with a balanced preset and great specifications is a serious contender.<br/><br/>Specifications: **This is the highlight of this computer**. If you don't know much about specs I'll give you an easy summary of this computer. This computer will run smoothly with just about anything you can throw at it, its limits start to show when you start throwing PC games at it. This baby packs a Ryzen 5800U, 16GB of Ram, an RTX 3050ti and a 512ssd. What does this mean? It means this laptop can run Fortnite, Adobe premiere, Vs code, basically, anything that isn't MW Warzone(technically it can run I just wouldn't recommend it) with basically no issues. This laptop also has some options for upgrading, including an extra SSD slot!<br/><br/>Keyboard: Ok, keys feel a little wide but you will get used to them in no time. This laptop has backlit keys, although they can be difficult to see under certain conditions.<br/><br/>Trackpad: Also good, like I said a lot of this laptop is mediocre but it makes up for it in the spec department. When playing games you may want to disable it (if you're using a mouse) as the palm rejection isn't very good.<br/><br/>Charger: If anxiety was a charger this would be it, the charger is very small and looks like I could break it if I pulled it out the wrong way honestly. Not to worry though! You can charge this computer from the USB type C port!<br/><br/>I/O:1 HDMI, 1 Type C port, Charging port, 2 USB 3 ports, and a headphone jack. No SD card slot folks :( .<br/><br/>Build Quality: Mostly metal, with black plastic on the screen bezels. Sturdy, yet the metal feels a bit cheap, I feel that this is because of the texture. Still very good overall. The laptop looks super nice in person, it's no Surface laptop or Macbook but it's a close second or third.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: A fast machine with a lot of "good enough" components and some minor downsides. The good really outweighs the bad. I'm taking a star off for the speakers as they are the only part of the computer that are outright bad. I highly recommend this computer for the college student that doesn't want to end up with a dud computer or an ugly gaming laptop.</span>

<span>I did not receive a unit with Win10 on it, despite it stating Win10 in the specs. Ignoring that, it has a solid build and solid performance. I do hate the nuisances of Win11, it's like a reskinned Win10, but with extra steps. I'm keeping it for now as I need the laptop, but will remain slightly disappointed. I was hoping to skip this OS until the next one (Win12?), but I'll give it a shot a little longer.<br/><br/>I am using this for mainly photography, so 90% of the time, it's just lightroom. The Ryzen 7 cpu is snappy, 16GB of ram is perfect, and the M.2 Drive really helps load up photos faster. Monitor is gorgeous, it compliments my Asus proart desktop, and is nonreflective; perfect for outdoors. Battery life is acceptable. It stays quiet and cool. Overall satisfied. 4/5</span>

I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things.

<span>Overall, this is a great laptop for its intended purpose, but DO NOT ORDER 64GB!!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The OS takes around 20-30GB (I can't remember specifically how much), default programs (i.e. MS Office) easily eat up another 20GB, and after everything is accounted for you are left with10ish precious GBs remaining--and you'll learn very quickly that whatever you use this thing for will chew right through that space. The Windows updates alone will eat up your GBs, Windows' caching will passively eat up more GBs when you aren't looking, and in less than a year you will be wasting hours deactivating hidden folders, deleting everything you can find, Googling what you can/cannot delete, perpetually slow-loading from a USB stick, and budgeting the remaining GBs between 2-3 programs.<br/><br/>Soon, you won't be able to download Windows updates because you're literally juggling 200MB of HDD space and the system says you don't have enough room to download the next patch. At least you don't have to worry about it sneakily upgrading to Windows 11 one day, because there's literally no room left for it to do so.<br/><br/>And that was to save a trivial amount of money (&lt;$50) on a bigger HDD. I feel pretty stupid for being so stingy now, but at the same time I can't help but blame the manufacturer for not putting a disclaimer that the OS consumes HALF of the HDD, and Windows' default programs eat up *almost* the other half, and realistically you are left with 10GB of HDD space.<br/><br/>Perhaps the other INCREDIBLY annoying thing about Windows 10 is that it will eat up HALF of your RAM just by existing. I never really gave much thought into how much RAM the OS eats up until I found myself staring at Task Manager wondering why Windows 10 needs 4GB of RAM on a laptop that only has 8GB to spare. Absurd. If you can order one with more RAM, then do so, otherwise just know that you'll need to keep this thing running light.<br/><br/>Also, the awesome mousepad with the toggle number pad was super cool, until the poor thing stopped working after several months. It now requires a wireless mouse to function. Oh well. Still not nearly as aggravating as the HDD/RAM situation.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Aside from those issues, for $110 it was a fantastic deal, I would highly recommend it for developers and students who want a light, portable, and simplistic device for text editors and running basic programming projects on. It is preferred by techies who need to move and connect to company devices for troubleshooting, updates, etc., and I think it would be an excellent tool for that job. Obviously, this is not a gaming laptop, and I don't think anyone who buys it is under the impression they'll be running Unreal Engine 5 on it either, but it would totally work for freeware games and simple games that could work on dinosaur computers.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This laptop is a work and school laptop primarily, and it is a wonderful and nifty tool that excels at that role, just be prepared to deal with a broken touchpad potentially, and know that half of your RAM will be eaten up by the OS.<br/><br/>And please, for the love of your sanity, DO NOT ORDER 64GB HDD! Get the larger HDD, you'll severely regret cheaping out on less than a $50 price difference.</span>

<span>Note: This review is for those thinking about run a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.<br/><br/>Ubuntu 21.10 Impish Indri doesnt detect the Realtek wifi adapter that comes with this laptop which is an extremely common problem in the Linux world (in fact, I already know because there were reviews here that said they had to rely on a USB wifi adapter). I tried using a USB Ethernet adapter to connect to the internet and running [apt update/upgrade] hoping that it will install the correct drivers but no luck. However, even [lspci] doesnt event detect the wifi adapter so I just gave up. I bought a generic wifi adapter carrying the latest Intel AX210 for about $40. This new model allows for WiFi 6e and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and I tested this on a Windows 10 Pro laptop prior to bringing it over to this Linux machine so I know that the adapter I bought actually delivered these specs. So then I swapped the Realtek with the new Intel wifi adapter and reinstalled the same Ubuntu version. I had wifi even during setup when I was booting the installer from USB. But after installation, only bluetooth was detected. The solution was to [apt update/upgrade] and restart. Then boom now I have wifi and also Bluetooth 5.2 (I didnt include pics but when I ran [hciconfig -a] the version is 5.2) thanks to Intel AX210. I didnt need to manually install other drivers - it just worked after a system update.<br/><br/>Note that you have to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS/UEFI settings for the new wifi adapter hardware to be recognized by the OS. This means that the Secure Boot status should be "Inactive" (or something like that). Delete those stored keys if you need to.<br/><br/>So far, i dont have any issues with it running Ubuntu. The camera, usb ports, and m.2 ssd slots all work fine. I havent used the Bluetooth 5.2 though since no need for it. Also, doing basic computer stuff like web browsing and word processing is not lightning fast but also not slow. It takes a few seconds to open Firefox but watching 1080p videos is no problem. I tried running 1 Lububtu virtual machine and I didnt have any problems, but it is kinda slow - though tolerable.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>I personally love this laptop, in fact, I'm writing this review on this laptop, but that's only because it's the right laptop for my needs. This laptop is not for everyone, because I don't believe it's all that practical to be used for multimedia purposes, AKA, gaming and streaming, etc. There are specific reasons why I say this, and one of the reasons for that, is yes, just like the other reviewers say, the screen is a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to say that the screen isn't bad, it's just not great. It is a full HD display, but you do pretty much have to look straight at it to get a clear picture. You can see it okay from certain angles, but nothing too fancy. That's why I don't think it's good for multimedia, for example, if you want a laptop to stream movies and watch shows with friends and family, I would not recommend this laptop. It'll stream it just fine, because this computer is very fast, but the picture won't give a clear picture to a group of people watching it. However, if it was you, then I'd say go for it.<br/><br/>The other reason why I don't think this laptop is good for multimedia use, is because of the audio. I am going to be brutally honest when I say that the audio on this laptop is absolutely horrible. I put max volume on my Spotify, and it the volume was so unimpressive, that I could comfortably hold a conversation with someone next to it. So, not only will the screen give a person issues, but unless you have a good speaker connected, you're not going to hear any music, shows, or movies very well with this one.<br/><br/>I also don't recommend gaming on this laptop, not just for the reasons already stated above, but because of performance. This computer can perform very well at several multimedia tasks in terms of processor and memory, and you could play some simple games. But the moment you talk about WoW, or Overwatch... well, let's just say I don't believe this laptop was designed to be a gaming laptop.<br/><br/>That all being said, I love this computer because I don't need a laptop for gaming, or for multimedia purposes. I am a writer, and I also love doing research, and doing basic stuff like checking email, or Reddit. For those basic tasks, this computer is actually quite phenomenal. Because of the SSD (Solid State Drive for those that don't know), it boots up very fast. It could be completely off, and from the time I push the button to turn it on, to the time the computer is ready for whatever task I want to do, barely 4 or 5 seconds have passed. That is not an exaggeration!<br/><br/>The battery lasts for several hours, as long as you're smart about it. Like making sure the light on the keyboard is either off or low, when using the battery, and turning the screen brightness down. You can google tricks like that to extend battery life on all kinds of electronics, but as long as you do those basic things, the battery should last at least 6-7 hours.<br/><br/>The processor is super fast, and I never have to wait more than seconds, if that, for the computer to act on anything I do. The moment I click on Google Chrome, the browser and my personal front page is up in less than 2 seconds. This computer is very fast, and despite what I've said before about the screen and audio, it actually does stream Netflix and all the other streaming apps pretty well.<br/><br/>To anyone wanting to play games, watch movies with friends/family, or listen to loud music, I would not recommend this laptop. However, if you want a laptop to do everything else, I would not only recommend this laptop, but I would even go so far as to say that it's the best one on the market, for its price.</span>

<span>Bought this on a deal.  It has been a nice entry level gaming laptop for my husband.  I like that this can be upgraded with the extra RAM slot and an extra SSD slot and 2.5 bay.  Something to keep in mind, this does not accept anything made by crucial. I don’t know why, but I had a crucial nvme m2 internal ssd (4x4 gaming ssd) and a crucial 2.5 ssd and both caused the laptop to stay on a black screen upon boot up.  After a lot of research, there were many forums from others saying they also ran into this problem and crucial storage is not compatible with the bios.  Would I have bought this at full price at around $1000.  No.  For the deal I got it at, yes.  If you can get this during a deal and looking for a great starter gaming laptop, this is a good choice to go with.</span>

<span>So, at first I thought it was dead on arrival.. I tried different outlets and all.. I was even requesting to a refund.. but I know this sounds like a simple fix.. step 1. Relax, Step 2. Put back the power cable and use a bit more force till you hear a click.. trust me.. I thought I was using enough force at first.. it should show the indicator light.. then switch it on.. good luck 🤞🏾</span>

<span>I needed a new gaming laptop for a bit and this one is perfect. Runs fast, has space to had an extra hard-drive. Resolution is good for most games.<br/>(Ran Minecraft and Apex like a dream.

But I HIGHLY recommend getting a cooling pad or something to keep it elevated for the fans on the bottom.<br/><br/>Overall really happy with what I got for the price.</span>

<span>I needed to replace my previous laptop after 5+ years, but I didn't want to break the bank. After researching different gaming laptops, the Acer Nitro 5 stood out as the best balance between price and performance.<br/><br/>I was nervous about upgrading to Windows 11 (I'd avoided upgrading from Windows 7 to 8 because of the terrible UI), but it's actually very clean and minimalist.<br/><br/>The Nitro 5's performance has blown my expectations out of the water. My previous laptop could barely scrape by the FFXIV benchmark on "normal laptop" settings, but the Nitro 5 scored very high on the "high desktop" settings. I've signed up for PC Game Pass to take advantage of my new hardware power, and it's been amazing playing Microsoft Flight Simulator on high settings.<br/><br/>I did end up buying an extra 8GB Crucial RAM, and installing that was a breeze.<br/><br/>Fantastic value for the price!</span>

<span>My Asus Chromebook was out of support and died.  I did not want to spend $$ for another chromebook, but wanted a cheaper computer with full operating system.  This comes with Windows 11 S, with free upgrade to Windows 11.  And that is sufficient but slow.  It was my intention intention to run a very efficient lightweight operating system like Linux Ubuntu Mate on it anyway.  It works great, just remember that the key F2 is the bios change when  you boot.  System does not have backlit keyboard nor 1920X1080 resolution so misleading, but for money not an issue.  Very satisfied with purchase, upgrade from chromebook.</span>

<span>Overall, this is a pretty decent and simple laptop and serves the purpose for which we bought them. Despite the lower end system specs, the hardware does perform nicely. Not blazing fast but not slow, either. The screen quality is what you'd expect in this price range. The full keyboard layout is great and the weight and design of it is pretty solid. It comes in Windows S mode which only allows you to install apps from the microsoft store which makes it secure for less than tech savy users who just want to mess around on the web safely. You need to take it out of S mode and convert it to Windows 10 Home to install any apps not available in the store. That said, the bloatware is unforgivable. It comes preinstalled with McAfee. If you know anything about McAfee, they are essentially a virus posing as an anti-virus program. Once preinstalled, you're never getting rid of it. Not with the Windows Apps &amp; Programs uninstaller or the "Removal Tool" from McAfee themselves. You run either, it just keeps coming back. If you try to delete the registry keys, you can't because they have running process that protects it from deletion. And if you are wise enough to figure out how to delete it from safe mode (like you would with a virus), it hijacks the Windows shutdown process to add it back in (like a virus). The only way to really get rid of it is to completely format and reinstall Windows. The problem there is you need ASUS's drivers afterward for the proprietary keyboard and touch pad. Which of course ASUS does not offer on the product support page. ASUS also has their own bloatware called MyASUS which, also, you will not be able to fully remove. If you can live with the preinstalled apps and McAfee, then this laptop may suit your purposes. If you're using it for work or business, you'll be able to get it functioning enough to use but be warned, it takes some extra work to get McAfee into a state where it's just there lurking while your real security software is in place.</span>
