<span>I don't do a lot of heavy gaming, so I wanted to buy a low-level gaming laptop because I knew it would do everything I needed to do. For context, the main games I play on my laptop are The Sims (with a ton of cc and a few mods), Stardew Valley (with a fair amount of mods), Terraria, and then basic in-browser games like tetris and whatever else when I'm truly bored. For the most part, this computer has handled running them all super well. Surprisingly, it has the most difficulty with the in-browser games, which tend to lag or drop frames. To be fair, I don't really know why Mahjongg 3D needs to be rendered in such intense detail anyway, but whatever.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot of complaints about this computer. It does what I needed it to do. A couple of times I've had to reset my settings because my built-in microphone will randomly turn itself completely off. Also, sometimes, when I'm switching tabs or something, my screen will just go black for a second or two. That's the biggest complaint. If I needed to use this machine to play Valorant or Fortnite or whatever, a few seconds of a black screen could cost me the game. However, I'm still satisfied with all that I'm able to do using this computer, especially considering the price. I've been using the same old computer for ages because every subsequent computer has just been too slow for me. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with this computer, and as long as it runs decently and lets me play The Sims and watch Netflix, I probably will stay pretty happy.</span>

<span>I don't play alot of games with extremely high requirements. BUT this laptop is just what I was looking for. It plays the games I want to play. The one thing I will say is the battery life while playing a game is a little short but honestly that's to be expected in a gaming laptop sometimes. The fan does get a little loud and crazy while playing sometimes but that really doesn't bother me too much. It does a great job with most of the games I've tried it out on. So if you're a casual gamer who loves games like The Sims, this is perfect tbh.</span>

<span>I knew it was not touchscreen when I bought it, so I am not sure why it asked me to rate the touchscreen. Picture is great, I added more ram and brought the total up to 64 GB and have had no issues as of yet. I have been gaming for over 30 years and am not ashamed to pull this out at our conventions.<br/><br/>Update: It has been a few weeks since my initial review.<br/><br/>The battery life is about an hour when heavy gaming, the max volume is lacking and I am not at all happy where the port is in the back of the laptop in order to charge it. I still recommend this laptop but if battery life is important to you, stay clear of this one.</span>

<span>I may be biased or underqualified.... as my laptop I am upgrading from is 8 years old and was not a gaming laptop. This thing rocks! Definitely a massive upgrade from my Dell Vostro 3558 with a Intell 5500 UHD graphics card (a pretend graphics card).<br/><br/>I don't play super graphically intense games. I really only play Lague of Legends, and do a lot of computer work for school and hospital work. This was such an upgrade!<br/><br/>League was getting pretty glitchy, slow and annoying on my old laptop... even on the lowest settings. However, I can run LOL on this thing on the highest video settings LIKE A CHAMP! This laptop has performed amazingly in the past week. I hope it holds up well like my Dell did. That thing served me so well, and I hope its good work rubs off onto this laptop, too.<br/><br/>That said... LOL does make the fans on this run at around (my guess) 60-70% speed compared to the max that I have heard them run at during my own testing, but I believe that more graphically intense games would be fine.... for the non-pro-elite-super-ridiculously meticulous-must catch em all-gamer<br/><br/>**** note**** I weighed my values and needs.... I was fine having only the RTX 3050 and not the 3050 Ti.... because the difference was so minimal that I would have never used or appreciated the difference. The difference in CPU's between the Intel i5 5200H and the i7-107200H or whatever it was, was not something I would ever notice or appreciate. I don't need any additional storage because I keep everything on cloud servers. I bought an extra 8GB RAM card for $24 and installed it in 5 minutes in this baby. Can't beat it.<br/><br/>The Acer Nitro's are known for being easily upgradeable.... I gotta agree... it was easy to open it up and plug in new stuff. This thing has lots of connections for more SSD storage if you need it.<br/><br/>I AM HAPPY. Enough said. I will buy another laptop in another 4-5 years and I hope this one continues to serve someone even after that. Good stuff... good stuff man.</span>

<span>It’s a great computer with a totally stupid keyboard.<br/><br/>The major issue is the “.” And the “0” are flipped on the number pad side of the keyboard.  As someone that enters a lot of number data it’s a major PITA.  Since every other keyboard I have ever used have had the same layout this is just stupid.  Also , the “r” and the “e” is printed on the keys reversed.  It’s some marketing thing because ACER likes to recycle.

<span>I thought it was a great laptop for its price but I got it for streaming obs and I didn’t realize that obs is not compatible with chromebook so I am returning sadly. I definitely didn’t know how to right click on this kind of pad, so if anyone is wondering, you tap the right side of the pad one single time with your index fingers in case I’m not the only one and I hope I’m not lol overall if I could have used this for what I bought it for I feel like it’d be a steal. It’s not a slow computer, the screen quality is honestly better than I thought it’d be for it being as cheap as it is but it’s not like it’s top notch quality of course just better than I personally expected, battery life is great and it’s definitely lightweight.

This time I decided I dont really need that much, browse the internet, stream movies and work on spreadsheets.<br/><br/>Ive only had this for 3 days but so far so good!<br/><br/>I think the screen/resolution/graphics are slightly wanting.  The screen is really big, but you cant see very clearly from the side.<br/><br/>I was worried about having only 4GB of RAM but so far everything works efficiently.<br/><br/>The battery is awesome, but again Ive only had it for 3 days so I cant say how it will hold up over time.<br/><br/>Ive always used Windows, and my last computer was a hand me down Macbook from my daughter.  This is my first experience with google/chromebook.  I use a Galaxy phone though, so this has worked nicely in syncing things, and Ive been able to figure it all out pretty quickly.  You might expect a learning curve however if youre not familiar.<br/><br/>Over all I bought this refurbished for $175 and I am completely satisfied!  I highly recommend it as a budget (practically free!) laptop option!!<br/><br/>Hope that helps!</span>

<span>While it has a USB-C port, it did NOT come with a USB -C charger--just the big bulky plugin barrel charger. You will need to buy a separate 65W UBC-C charger if you don't want to lug around the traditional brick charger.<br/><br/>Laptop is thin and light, yet feels sturdy. I haven't experienced the fan noise. Can confirm the speakers are very weak--just don't get loud enough. Screen is big (minimum bevel) bright, and crisp. There was some bloatware installed but easily removed. It's almost a blue-grey color. Fingerprint logon is super convenient.<br/><br/>So far so good!  I've only had this a few days but it's been working great for me.</span>

<span>I bought this with the intention of running Zorin OS and never booting into Windows. So far this laptop has been great. The screen is very nice, the keyboard is decent, touch pad works well, I have never heard the fans, external GPU does work, and the battery is great; which is the main reason I purchased this laptop.<br/><br/>In case anyone is interested in also installing Zorin, the camera login isn't working for me even after trying some workaround, webcam works but the hello windows alternative does not. I'll report back after some time, I think its just a driver issue. The finger print driver also does not work. There are some claims that some users were able to get this working but I have not been successful. I'm not really all that interested in those options but it would be nice to get the finger print device to work. For graphics, the Xe driver doesn't seem to work that well but I'm guessing that with some time, this will change.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm super impressed and very happy with this purchase. I can't speak for Windows as I never let it boot before wiping out of the box, due to the systems specifications the bloat in Windows likely causes some resource issues. I imagine that this is what causes most of the bad reviews on this system, outside of hardware issues, hot tip, avoid manufacturer warranties, complain to amazon and get a new one shipped...<br/><br/>I did end up buying another for a family member (50+) and installed Zorin on theirs as well, after a week they say its their favorite laptop ever so take that as you will.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

We purchased with confidence and assurance from the Amazon description. I read the Q/A section and felt reassured this was a good buy. Unfortunately I did not do a deep dive into the reviews (esp the 2/4 star ratings) as I should have. Now that it has arrived and I have completed the unboxing, I realize that this product is slightly different than I expected.<br/><br/>Shipping and Packaging:<br/>Because of our location, shipping was quick and painless. We ordered on a Friday evening and received the product the very next day.<br/><br/>Packaging was spectacular. No excess packaging, zero damage.<br/><br/>Shortfalls:<br/>This is built different than other HP Pavilions of the same model number. The first clue that let me know something was off from what I saw on the Amazon page is the color is different. The case is silver, but the keyboard on the inside is black.<br/>- NO fingerprint scanner<br/>- NO backlit keyboard<br/><br/>Audio and Screen<br/>Audio is as good as to be expected for such a compact, lightweight item<br/>Screen resolution is remarkable for a touchscreen device<br/><br/>I will update this review as we dig deeper into using the device over the coming day.<br/><br/>UPDATE: several days have passed.

<span>I need Lockdown Browser for my Canvas courses, and it was constantly making my old laptop glitch out and disconnect from the WiFi when I needed to study or take exams. Most people recommended that I get an HP, and I'm so glad that I did! This new laptop is incredibly fast and smooth to use. The anxiety of wondering if I can complete my exams and assignments is totally gone. There is no back-lit keyboard, and no cover for the camera, but these were not features I was concerned about. I'm not tech-y, but I absolutely love this laptop because of how easy it makes taking my online classes. The camera is very high quality for Zoom and recording audio and video. The minimal keyboard is also welcome since it lightens the overall dimensions and weight of the laptop. I also appreciate the top notch quality of the visuals of the screen. I highly recommend this if you just need something to get you through papers and assignments for school. It has really been indispensable to me since I got it.</span>

The laptop itself is not lightweight, and the plug that comes with it is quite clunky and heavy. The battery gets crazy hot from regular use, so you hear the fan turning on every 10 min or so, which is quite annoying. The computer was also slow and kept on buffering, it didn't feel like it has 8 RAM. The only thing I liked in this laptop is the fact that it comes with 3 usb ports. If you're looking for something in this price range, I would recommend the Microsoft surface Go. Although it's smaller than the HP (its like 12.4) and only has 2 ports (and also lacks a SD card slot, which is a huge downside), its better than the HP in every way. Its sleeker, nicer, lighter, better performance, I'm not sure about battery life yet, but so far it has been 10 steps ahead than the HP in every way. I do not recommend this laptop at all. look somewhere else!</span>

<span>Key Points:<br/>- A cheap deal for a competitive performance laptop<br/>- Thin &amp; Lightweight (Easy to carry)<br/>- Large storage space for basically any consumer need<br/>- Comes with HP Customer Service application on set-up (1-year warranty)<br/><br/>Experience:<br/>If you're like me, you hate to buy something without the full confidence in the product first. Believe me, it's difficult sometimes to buy things online due to the limitation of only being able to rely on other customer's reviews before the product is purchased and arrives at your doorstep. However, I have a pretty positive outlook on this laptop for its price. I attached a few photos to showcase its exterior mechanisms, as well as showcase a general size of what laptop to expect in real-world size (as opposed to reading numbers and expecting to visualize that in your head). The laptop is about 23cm length by 35-36cm width with a thickness of 1.5 cm. The weight is as advertised, it's comfortable to carry around and will fit in thin spaces; it won't occupy too much room in a backpack or luggage. For its technical aspects, I used a free CPU test online called UserBenchmark to compare its performance to other users who also documented their computers/laptops. (This provides a bias as it only takes into account for users who test their computers on that specific software, but it's still a good comparison to get a general idea of the performance the laptop provides.) Attached also is the report containing simplified and relevant data to its specifications. Its computing power is where this computer shines the most, as it performs in the top 75%+ percentile, which is what most consumers will desire, as GPU is of less importance in that they don't intend to purchase a cheaper laptop with the intentions to play heavier &amp; more demanding video games on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised to hear of a lower pricing laptop that came with 16GB of RAM, which is almost unheard of for this price range, and although I didn't document how much free space was available upon receiving and setting it up, there is still ~400+ GB available after transferring the bulk of my applications and user data from my old laptop. For the price it's set at, I personally think it's a great deal since its competitors will often price the same specifications for almost twice the price. As a side note, HP doesn't load the computer with so many useless applications as Lenovo does that the consumer will more than likely never use... (occupying memory). Overall, very happy &amp; satisfied with my purchase, I would thoroughly recommend it, and I look forward to programming code with this laptop.</span>

<span>It has 2 USB ports and I wish it had a few more. Also, no CD/DVD drive. The standard firewall is constantly making it more difficult to access federal websites than my previous laptop.</span>

<span>I usually don't write reviews but I think this one is warranted.  This has to be the best "bang for the buck" machine that I have ever purchased.  The 10th gen 1035G1 i5 is obscenely fast when mixed with the 16gb ddr4 and the 1/2 TB NVMe sdd.  This is elegant as anything as well.  A beautiful chassis.  I was surprised by how light it is.  I guess that is to be expected since I think everything except for the cpu fan is solid state.  The onboard camera is very clear and a driver license text is legible for secure websites.  The CPU includes neural net instructions from the Xeon line for the first time for consumer in the 10th gen chips.  If you are doing data science with development suites like Anaconda using Jupyter notebooks or working with Netbeans or using a MySQL instance for learning this is blazing fast for a great price.<br/>In a nutshell, this offers Windows workstation performance with Chromebook simplicity/pricing.<br/><br/>*update* (2/2/21)<br/><br/>Well I bought this on Dec 16th 19', so I figured an update was in order.  Power on hours read as 2970 according to HWinfo64 and it is still running strong and I have certainly  put it through its paces  Some might say that the UHD G1 graphics are a bit anemic but I think that it's fine for the 1366x768p screen.  Triple A games most likely will be very slow but classic titles like Portal 2 can be played "maxed out"<br/>The Intel 660p QLC drive is also really good i think for the price. Through installing and deleting I have about 13TB worth of mileage on the drive, still very fast, device health of 98% S.M.A.R.T.<br/>I have not had any issues with the wi-fi on my unit.  I know it is not the fastest solution out there but on my Asus AC1300 router I get 325mbps from a different floor of the house the hypotenuse length being about 20-25 through a floor and a wall.  I can game on Google Stadia and download a series of torrents and keep my Comcast 100mbps service relatively transmitting a lot of data for hours with no drop-offs on the Wi-Fi.  Now granted I am stationary, I'm not jumping from tabletop to tabletop confusing the beam-forming of the router.<br/>So, it a solid performer that can handle some pretty heavy stuff thrown at it.<br/>*end of update*</span>

<span>We purchased this laptop as a backup for our photo booth business and as I was familiarizing myself with it I realized that this is now going to be our main laptop. It boots up incredibly fast and seems to be faster and more responsive than the i7 we were using. It may be due to the SS drive vs. traditional hard drive, but it makes a big difference! The screen quality is excellent and the I/O has everything that we need to connect the camera, monitor and printer. After a lot of research I am SO glad that I found and purchased this one.</span>

<span>Had this since January! Absolutely incredible upgrade from my crappy 8 year old Lenovo. Turbo fan speed is an absolute plus. I play League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Stardew, etc. I play with everything set high. LEDs are my fave. Got a fan lapdesk that also has LEDs and it helps a lot with keeping the laptop cool. Great product. Love it.</span>

<span>The most recent reviews are kind of mixed so I decided to add one. Many years ago I was a pc gamer, I’m talking AMD phenom 2 black edition and dual ati 4850 days, overclocking- I considered myself a power user… I wanted to get something that I could game with but mostly use for work and college. I’m not naive to the fact that battery life would be terrible, so plugging it in and battery isn’t an issue for me<br/><br/>This laptop is great, I haven’t had any issues with it. It’s fast I play mostly COD but I’ve also tried flight sim, horizon, really any game I could that I thought would stress the CPU and GPU. It runs everything, really great.<br/><br/>Typing on the keyboard is fine, trackpad is fine, everything you open pretty much opens instantly, price is great, etc..<br/><br/>I wish I would’ve got one with a 2k or even 4k screen, but it isn’t really a deal breaker as the screen is really good.<br/><br/>The one thing I’ll agree with everyone is that it gets very hot, but I think a lot of the expectations are that it should be cool. When you’re using word, PowerPoint, etc, heat isn’t an issue but gaming it gets hot, like very hot to the touch toward the top of the laptop, which is to be expected. I do have a cooling pad and it helps some but again it’s to be expected.<br/><br/>If you’re on the fence this is a great pick, I was torn between a laptop with the 3070 vs this one with the 3060. This has the higher TGP of 105w vs a lot of the 3070s with the lower TGP, from the research I did this one with the higher TGP results in the 3060 being faster than the 3070s around the same price range.</span>

<span>So far this computer has been good. I''ve played Doom Eternal and I am now playing Cyberpunk 2077 on it. The games look great and run well. It's a decently solid machine. I added 2 additional hard drives to it. I did not like how the casing comes apart to add the hard drives. It felt like very delicate procedure designed to break the casing. I got it done without breaking anything, but definitely watch videos on how to do it before you try. The bios is odd, I want to figure out how to set one of the added hard drives as bootable, but the bios doesn't seem to want me to do that...says something about window boot manager?.  I would prefer the old c, d, f, g or whatever it used to be. Sometimes a guy just wants to set the boot order to 1st a non-bootable drive, then another non-bootable drive and then the bootable drive....actually I wanted to figure out if I could load win 10 on another drive and boot to it so I could run some older firewire audio hardware that doesnt support win 11. Guess that I may be too old or not motivated enough to figure it out. Speakers are tinney but ok. Good ports. Keyboard is ok. Sometimes computer is a bit wonky, locks up on weird stuff or won't boot a game, but I just restart it and everything is fine. The price was good. I am not sure why amazon thinks this thing has a touch screen. It doesn't. I just touched it and it didn't do anything.</span>
