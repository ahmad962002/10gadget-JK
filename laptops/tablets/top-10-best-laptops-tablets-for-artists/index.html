<span>I bought this 2-in-1 to design kitchens and present to perspective clients.  I am able to flip the screen or have it facing up for both the client and I to view as well as just using it as a tablet to edit and make notes.  It is very versatile!  The hinge that the monitor is attached to is very nice.  The gorilla glass is genius!  The pen is okay.  I did not buy this machine for its pen capabilities, but it seems it could be a bit more rigid and it does lag a little while drawing or writing with it.  Overall this is an amazing laptop so far!</span>

<span>As a newer graphic designer who was stuck doing everything on my phone I knew I needed a new computer. Did I need this exact one meant for creatives? Probably not, but for days I looked for a cheaper option and couldn't get my mind off of this laptop. I'm so glad I took the chance! This is an amazing laptop. Typing on it is a dream with the perfect size keyboard and spring action. The touch screen is responsive. And the screen makes things SO much easier!! And to top it off it's beautiful!<br/><br/>As other reviewers have said the battery life isn't great, but I'll be doing most of my work near an electrical outlet.</span>

<span>I got it because I wanted a laptop that I can use as my main workstation(development) for at least a few years, that can handle gaming decently, and with a touch screen that would make it more usable on the go and test out touch features.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The hinge system is an engineering masterpiece. It's incredibly sturdy(I can even rest my palm on it when it's not touching the keyboard part, and as long as it's not near the edges it doesn't make it rotate). Switching from tablet to regular mode or any other is really convenient, the other mods are pretty useful(for example when it's on my lap I can have the screen at an angle but closer to me than regular laptop mode), and the way it's bottom side is always the same is a big advantage. I feel it's well worth the compromise(the extra width for the hinge) over the standard 2 in ones, with the 360 rotation.<br/>Also, while most 2 in 1s are too big to be actually used as a tablet, with this form factor I can have the laptop's body on my lap, and the screen above it, where I would naturally hold a tablet anyway.<br/><br/>The screen is amazing. It's not just the accuracy and the brightness, the matte finish looks great and I really wish all touch screen devices were like this. It looks less impressive when turned off, but you don't get any distracting reflections which is great, and surprisingly it doesn't make the touch experience any less pleasant(touch it does add some minimal friction which is mostly noticeable with the pen, and provides some feedback when drawing).<br/>I think hd rather than 4k for a 14'' device is a positive, since I couldn't tell the difference but the battery consumption should be much better.<br/><br/>Performance - I expected it to be good, but I was a little surprised with how good it was considering it's the weakest GPU of the previous gen, and especially with the stability. I played Red Dead Redemption 2, Just Cause 4, Outer Worlds, and Fifa 20 - all in 1080P and medium-high settings, they all looked great, ran perfectly smoothly, and no frame drops even after very long periods of playing. I use an external fan-stand which usually helps dropping the temperature by 1-3 degrees, but either way neither the gpu never got to 65 degrees, and the cpu is usually at 70-80 degrees, with short peaks at 90.<br/>There are a lot of venting holes and it seems like they put a lot of thought into the thermal performence.<br/>Otherwise it was perform really good, as I'd expect with this hardware.<br/><br/>Had no issues with virtualization - setting up docker and WSL2 was as straight forward as it gets.<br/><br/>Touchpad - really big, and really accurate. never had it miss my gesture, and using it was the first time I enjoyed using a touchpad and could understand mac fans.<br/><br/>Keyboard - very comfortable to me, I think this layout is the best that we can have with a 14'' laptop(besides the numpad and fn issues mentioned in the cons, that can be turned off), but I really wish the power button was at a separate location, and for dedicated volume buttons.<br/><br/>Neutral:<br/>The pen - for me it works pretty well. when turning off the smoothing and drawing diagonal lines the jitter everyone complain about was definitely there, and the off pressure is less sensitive than the on(so you don't get the really thin line as you lift the pressure). As I mostly using it for sketching diagrams and with pretty harsh smoothing anyway, and it does the job well for me, and I think would be the same for most people that don't look for a device to replace their wacom tablet.<br/>It's location in the bottom is pretty annoying, especially when using it on an angled stand or on the lap, and I really wish it was spring loaded.<br/><br/>Fans - you can get some work done in power mode and the fans being completely silent, but they make noticeable noise when you push the hardware. It's what you'd expect, but acer's advertisement seems inaccurate in this aspect.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The keyboard has 2 very annoying features: the f keys by default activate their multimedia functionality, and you need to hold fn to get the original f1-f12 functionality; and there's a "numpad" on the "7890-uiop-jkl;" buttons, which activates whenever numlock is on(so when you click o you get 6 instead), which I found useless, and annoying since I like to always have numlock turned on for external keyboards.<br/>Both can be turned off in the bios, but from what I understand the bios is locked by default(I sent it to a lab to replace the SSD with a bigger one before realizing those issues existed, and they told me they had some trouble unlocking the bios).<br/><br/>Power cable - When you plug it in, it feels like you pushed it all the way(and on any other laptop it is), but then there is a bit more to push with a click sound. If you don't do the extra push, it doesn't charge, and After 1.5 months I still get it wrong sometimes.<br/><br/>The backlighting - I wouldn't mind the orange-ish backlight on a black laptop(and regardless, I really wish I could get it in black), but on a white keyboard it's really weird, because it makes the key text almost invisible when you are not in the dark, since you get white-ish text on white background. I hardly use backlight anyway, but this decision is just weird.<br/><br/>No charging through the type c port - which means there is no option to connect everything through a single cable with a charging dock. I haven't tried connecting it to a screen through that output yet.<br/><br/>The fingerprint sensor seems to be to small and too deep inside, which makes it's recognition pretty poor. when I manage to put the finger right it connects instantly, but way to often I end up forced to use the pin.<br/><br/>The speakers can get to a decent volume, but it's not an enjoyable experience to listen to them.<br/>The camera is usable for zoom calls, but that's the best I can say about it. At least the microphones seem to be decent. There's no physical cover to the lens, which is a little disappointing.<br/><br/>I think that when the lid is not open the ventilation suffers, the temperature can get higher and fans get much more active.<br/><br/>There's no ethernet connection, which is understandable but still a bit annoying, especially because the docking options on this aren't as good as they could be.<br/><br/>I really wish there was a black option, it would look so much nicer.</span>

<span>The device has a nice vibrant screen, at least the one I got, and it held up to my 2 yr old abusing it a few times.<br/>For this class of device, chrome OS works fine for the most part and battery life is decent. I can get a couple days from a charge if browsing around 5hrs a day.<br/><br/>I wish is that the device was more fluid, every now and then it max's out and stutters. The covers could also adhere with stronger magnets, but it's not too bad. the other aspects, such as keyboard cam, sound, pen, etc. are just ok, again for this class of device.</span>

<span>Okay so let me just start off by saying that I have never used a Chromebook or a detachable tablet with a keyboard before. This was my first one in both cases.<br/><br/>Let's start with the Chromebook side of it. Before buying this product, I had done some research on how Chromebooks work and I thought I would be able to adapt to them. Boy, was I wrong! The GUI is too MacOS-like and as someone who is a long time Windows user, I was hoping for something more familiar. One thing I realized right away was that I had to be logged into my Google account at all times and that gave me an uneasiness of feeling like a data-mine. I also tried playing games on it but it just didn't work out. The feeling of gaming on it is super awkward and sometimes the games would lag.<br/><br/>Alright now let's move on to the tablet/keyboard side of it. The keyboard is a lot flimsier than I expected. The tablet itself is very bulky compared to mainstream tablets like iPads. The back cover is completely magnetic and can come off entirely which happened a few times when I was trying to set it upright. One important thing this device made me realize was that I'm just not into tablets.<br/><br/>I thought this product would help substitute my laptops but instead I learned a very important lesson from all this. Be happy with what you've got. Some things are just not worth it. If you've used Chromebooks or tablets with detachable keyboards before, then maybe this device won't be a problem for you. But if you've never used either one, then let this be a cautionary tale.</span>

<span>I scored this tablet about a month and 1/2 ago… Its a good drawing tablet with five assignable buttons and a handy storage strap for the nice included pen! A very comfortable drawing tablet with a fairly large working area… way better than a Bamboo or smaller tablet… a smooth, vaguely “paper-like” feel to the drawing surface. Captures my lines and pressure very well! Front row stuff!<br/><br/>You get a few extras, a couple of new tips, a little cleaning rag, a basic USB “mini” to USB “A” charge cable… a fussy set up but I got it to pair with a little (grumpy) effort.<br/><br/>However… its an older “new product” and I had to send it in for full (!) replacement—quite easy, actually—to get THE INTERNAL BATTERY UP TO STOP DRAINING! It was annoying to have 1/2 the power disappear in just one night of non-use (off, no Bluetooth)<br/><br/>The tablet had been sitting in a hot warehouse for four years—what with all the less expensive brands, I guess this one just sat and sat there… waiting. Melting.<br/><br/>Anyway, the newer tablet was shipped inside a week AND it can sit unused for weeks holding its charge! (Of course, once you start using it you power will run out after 15 hours of drawing on it) all-in-all a very nice drawing tablet for its somewhat “high” price… all the amenities of a true wireless pad.<br/><br/>Very fond of my Wacom now!</span>

<span>I have a huion 22inch display tablet for my desktop and I got this guy for my Mac laptop. It was exactly what I needed, I started off on a small ancient Wacom (3x3) so this was easy to adjust to. The express keys at the top save a lot of time and are easy to set up. I also love how light and easy it is to carry but doesn't feel flimsy. I got the Blutooth version and the charge holds for a very long time even with heavy use. Surprise bonus was the free software! Plus, I love the cute teal color I got it in.<br/><br/>The price is fair but might be steep for a beginner artist, I recommend to wait for a sale or consider other brands— I personally recommend Huion, as XP Pen has a reputation of taking advantage of artists through 'contests' and conventions.

<span>I purchased this on PRIME day and got a really great deal. :)<br/><br/>I've only ever used Apple products.... and the last laptop I purchased in 2010 was a Macbook Air. Needlesstoday, it's now super outdated and, given that my email, photos and browsing is always on Google, it made sense to move to a Chromebook. Sorry Apple. But I'm still loyal to your iPhone.<br/><br/>WHAT I LIKE about my NEW CHROMEBOOK!<br/>&gt;&gt; I like the keyboard! Unlike a mac where I felt like I could barely feel the keys, I can 'feel 'the keys on this pc and typing seems easier.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Ease of use: Charge and GO!  Upon receipt, just charge your Chromebook right away. Then, open 'er up, put in your google credentials and you're on your way.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Screen: well lit, colors are great.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Sound: EXCELLENT.  Clear, sharp, great stereo sound. (ha, stereo! I needed to call that out? I'm a 70s girl so, yeah.)<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Consider getting yourself a wireless mouse with a beanbag wrist rest, and, pick up a microSD card to give your little machine more storage.

And I haven't even tried the stylus or other cool features yet!<br/><br/>WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:<br/>&gt;&gt; so far - there's nothing that I don't like about this Chromebook. Happy customer right here! And this was after (seriously people) agonizing over 3+ hours over WHICH brand to buy.  I'm glad I went with Samsung!<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; Oh, there is this one thing. AMAZON: why would you package this sleek, cool Samsung Chromebook in a GIGANTIC, over-sized box that looked like it could have held about 8 Chromebooks?  The machine (which was packed in its own box) was 100% jostling around in transit. There's no doubt. There was the thought of a small, crumpled amount of brown paper packing material that was in there for... show? Because you would have needed about 25 pieces of crumpled brown packing material to have secured the Chromebook.</span>

<span>Upgraded to this from a V2. I like the more pronounced keys and the extra USB-C slots.  Only issue with mine so far is the &gt; key sticks. Im afraid it might pop off but Im using for work/school right now and probably won't bother sending it back to be exchanged.<br/><br/>It's also a little thicker than the V1, but not a big issue.</span>

<span>I bought this to use with GIMP and Blender on my Linux machine and had an awesome experience with it. Wacom doesn't advertise as being penguin-friendly but the Linux kernel has the drivers for it. For both me and a friend of mine, this brand is truly plug and play (Mint and PopOS).<br/><br/>For actual use: You don't need the glove, it won't register input from your skin, you can put your hand right on it but the glove does make it feel smoother dragging your hand around which is nice. If you hover the tip over the pad it moves the cursor, touch down to click, button one is middle mouse, button two is right click. Perfect for controlling the viewport.<br/><br/>Also a super useful feature is being able to set the tablet's rotation/orientation and the ability to switch between relative and absolute cursor position. So in other words the tablet can represent the whole screen or it can work like a laptop trackpad in how it moves the cursor around.<br/><br/>If you're worried about not having shortcut buttons then remember you still have a keyboard for that so that makes this, in my opinion, the best value for a graphics tablet since it's the cheapest medium sized one I could find [for brands I know are Linux compatible].</span>

<span>Great basic tablet from Wacom, if you do not need all the bells and whistles.  I have used Wacom products for well over 15 years in the design industry.  I have gone through about 3 tablets on the higher end models over that period, but didn't really want to spend hundreds on replacing my last tablet.  I tried another brand out there and it just wasn't the same.  If you don't need the extra buttons and the wheel, this model is the best option for something simple for drawing and navigating around your screen like a mouse.  I highly recommend it if you are starting out with a tablet or just need something simple and reliable from Wacom.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Let me just start by saying I love this laptop! The build quality is great. They use plastic, but it is good quality plastic on the body. The one I have is in a mate grey finish- Graphite Grey. I like how it does not attract so many fingerprint smudges. The hinges are aluminum, and very sturdy and stiff. Overall, I find the device to be aesthetically pleasing, compact and high quality. The keyboard has backlit tactile keys with spaces in- between. They are clicky and are quite satisfying to press. I also appreciate the great looking screen, which I have been consuming a lot of content on; think movies, You Tube videos, books... The speakers also sound good. They are top firing and get pretty loud for all my video and music consumption. Even in tablet mode they sound good.<br/><br/>The bezels on either side of the device are slim, but there is a thick one on top and an ever thicker one on the bottom, which eats into the screen real estate.<br/><br/>The battery life on this thing I find to be really impressive, lasting me 6-7 hours in normal use, surfing the web, watching a movie, writing on the screen, etc... And also impressive is the fast 65 W charger which comes in the box, which charges the battery from flat to full in just over an hour.<br/><br/>On the software front, the laptop ships with Windows 10 Home, and I quite enjoy this software. Although by the time it reaches you, this machine will be ready to update to Windows 11.<br/>The Lenovo Flex 5 14 (AMD Ryzen 5 4500U) ships with the Lenovo Base Pen II bundled in at no extra cost. I applaud Lenovo for this decision. Base Pen II has two barrel buttons. It has no top Bluetooth button. It also does not support tilt. Out of the box, the bottom barrel button works as an eraser, while the top one is programmed to right click, pretty much as a mouse would do. You can always change this in the Lenovo Pen Settings app, but I kept them as is.<br/><br/>The pen looks and works amazing. I am not sure what levels of pressure sensitivity it has, but it is plenty sensitive for what I use it for, which is taking handwritten notes in OneNote and Journal, selecting, annotating PDF's and so forth. I haven't tried drawing with it, but if you are interested in its drawing capabilities, Shogmaster has a detailed video of that on You Tube.<br/><br/>The pen is made of aluminum. It takes one AAAA battery, which is included. There is no pairing necessary. As soon as you insert the battery, it is ready to use. The battery lasts quite a while; mine has been going now for five months. The top screw on part of the pen is not completely cylindrical like the rest of the body. It juts out ever so slightly, with some subtle Lenovo branding which is only visible if it catches the light.  This slight protrusion on the pen is handy in making sure that it does not roll around on a flat surface, potentially falling from a height.<br/><br/>While I love this pen, I wish Lenovo had put some sort of coating around the austere metal finish to make it more comfortable in hand like Dell did with their pens, such as the PN350M Dell Active Pen which has a rubbery coating. As it is, the Lenovo pen is quite slippery in the hand.<br/>The writing experience is good, once you get used to it. At first, it felt really slippery writing on glass, but the feeling of control came back in measure once I embraced the slippery. Just know that using this pen is never going to feel like pen and paper, because glass is slippery, always will be. But overall, a great accessory to a great device. Good on Lenovo for including this pen with the purchase. Saved me the hassle of finding a compatible pen, and a few bucks to boot. I  later saw the pen listed here on Amazon as 'Active Pen for Lenovo GX80U45010' . It  has 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity and was retailing for $43.<br/><br/>AMD's Ryzen 5 4500U processor is quite impressive. It feels quick and snappy. I have not experienced much (if any) lag at all. Although it does get warm on the underside of the keyboard, especially when using the pen to take notes. I imagine there is quite a fair bit of processing going on when you write on the screen in OneNote or something like that.<br/><br/>The Flex 5 form factor is phenomenal. I will never go back to a traditional clam shell design ever again. The 2- in - 1 design just allows me to do more with my laptop. No more multiple notebooks or lost notes; all of my ideas in one place. I tend to go for apps which are touch optimised such as ACG Media Player, Xodo PDF Reader and Microsoft Journal to take advantage of the touch interface. It really is very useful to execute commands with your fingers, or digital pen, instead of always having to jump on the track pad or mouse.<br/><br/>The placement of the power button is one caveat I have to point out. Its placement is awkward, at best. It is located on the right side of the keyboard, as opposed to its traditional placement on the top right part of the keyboard, which in my opinion, makes better sense. In its actual location, it is fairly easy to turn off the computer screen while performing a multiplicity of routine actions such as lifting the laptop, or switching to tablet \ tent mode. But that aside, this really is stunning value (16GB/ 256GB SSD) for the asking price ( I got this from Amazon for just over $ 600).  And Amazon also has great service, just great. A really pleasant company to deal with.</span>

<span>TL;DR Overall a very nice laptop, would recommend &lt;$700<br/>I've had this laptop for about 6 months, and I wanted to share my thoughts on it.<br/><br/>CPU: The CPU in this laptop is excellent. For daily web browsing honestly this CPU is a bit overkill. Unlike on some laptops, this laptop has built in power profiles that let you increase the processor's TDP in order to get better performance, which allows it to overtake some of the cheaper 4700U based laptops (albeit with more power usage). Using the "Extreme Performance" power profile, the CPU will use about 30-35W continuously and has a max burst power usage of 45W. Max temps in Extreme Performance mode are generally around 95C, and in "Intelligent Cooling" mode (basically Balanced Power:Performance) they are around 75C.<br/><br/>GPU: The iGPU does fine. It's enough to let you play some older games at decent framerates, and maybe some new titles with some convincing. Performance is pretty standard for a 4500U based laptop.<br/><br/>RAM: This laptop features dual channel 3200MHz DDR4 RAM, which the Ryzen CPU is quite happy with. However, the RAM is soldered and there is no way to expand it.<br/><br/>SSD: Mine came with a 256GB NVMe SSD (Union Memory 8SSSS0W761B1Z1CH05X0XH0). While this isn't going to win any awards, its decently fast and gets the job done. If you want to, the SSD in this laptop is replaceable with a 2280 or shorter, but unless you want to either buy or 3D print a SSD extension, this laptop will take 2280 and 2242 drives out of the box.<br/><br/>WiFi/BT: The internet wasn't very helpful in identifying what WiFi/BT card this comes with, but it is either a RTL8822BE or RTL8822CE, the only noticeable difference between these 2 cards is one supports BT 4.2, while the other supports BT 5. Based off of the description on this Amazon listing, its probably the RTL8822BE. While I kinda wish this laptop came with a WiFi 6 card, it is swappable and an AX210 only costs about $20. I do not believe there is a WiFi adapter whitelist in the BIOS either so any wireless adapter should work fine as long as it is an M.2 E key card.<br/><br/>Screen: It's okay. With only 250 nits of brightness, I wouldn't recommend it if you plan on using this outside often. The hinges are just about stiff enough to not have the screen violently shake while typing, but also soft enough to be able to open with just a single hand.<br/><br/>Touch: The touchscreen is probably my favorite part of this laptop. Although it only has 4096 pressure levels, it is plenty to write on and is probably enough to sketch. The touchscreen feels decent to use and this laptop comes with a pen that takes 1 AAAA battery (1 is included), which also feels decent to use. The laptop also feels quite nice to use in tablet mode.<br/><br/>Battery: I usually end up getting around 8 hours or so under typical usage. There probably is some room for improvement but 8 hours is already enough for me and I don't want to sacrifice features.<br/><br/>Keyboard: The keyboard feels okay. As far as I know it uses the standard scissor mechanism with rubber domes. The keyboard also has a backlight with multiple brightness levels.<br/><br/>Touchpad: The touchpad is decent. It supports gestures, and has a left, middle and right click. The middle click is something I quite enjoy.<br/><br/>Chassis: The chassis feels very nice for ABS plastic. It has a nice finish to it that makes it feel surprisingly premium.<br/><br/>IO: This laptop has a DC barrel jack, type C PD, HDMI port, 3.5mm combo jack, 2 USB 3 ports and a half length SD card slot. This laptop comes with a USB Type C charger (very nice). The type C port can act both to charge and as a standard USB 3 port with an adapter. I am not sure if this port supports video out, as I don't have anything to test it with and Google gives me mixed results. The laptop seems to be able to charge off of basically any PD capable adapter, however lower power adapters will make the CPU throttle down to 400MHz.<br/><br/>Audio Out: The speakers are upwards firing and sound okay for laptop speakers. The built in DAC definitely won't replace an external DAC, but for a laptop its pretty good. It sounds decent and provides up to 32 bit audio at 48khz sampling rate. It's output power is a little weak, but it can still drive 50 ohm headphones without a problem. The HDMI audio out supports 32 bit 192 khz audio.<br/><br/>Audio In: The internal microphone sounds okay but picks up a lot of noise, both in the electrical sense and in the background sense. Typing and clicking on the trackpad are about 2/3 as loud as my voice is.<br/><br/>Serviceability: Pop the back panel off and you have access to basically everything. A screen replacement seems to be pretty standard in terms of difficulty.<br/><br/>Included OS: My memory isn't too great for this part since uninstalling the included OS was the 2nd thing I did. However from what I remember it was Windows 10 Home, and the bloatware was okay. It mostly came with Lenovo stuff for the laptop.<br/><br/>Other OS Support: Linux support on this laptop is amazing, as long as you are running kernel 5.9 or newer. The laptop does not work properly at all in kernels 5.6 or older. Distros that I know include a new enough kernel and are for normal desktop usage are Ubuntu 21.04 (no stable release as of this review), Debian Bullseye (also not released yet), and basically all Arch Linux derivatives (Manjaro Linux is highly recommended by me, especially for this laptop). If you are going to boot Linux, make sure you are on the newest BIOS as older BIOSs have issues suspending. I highly recommend checking out this page if you want to tinker with this laptop on Linux (I did not have any of the mentioned issues that are on this page). https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_14are05#Tips_and_tricks<br/>FreeBSD based OSs boot, however are currently missing drivers in 12.x such as for the touchscreen, touchpad and WiFi/BT.<br/><br/>Other Notes: The AMD PSP is disableable on this laptop, which is a bit nice. There also exists a patch that you can apply to the BIOS for this laptop to unlock a bunch of stuff, including some base clock overclocking (this of course voids your warranty). Check out CodeHusky's video for more information on that. This BIOS mod does require a SOIC8 clip as the stock firmware flashing utility does not accept the modded BIOS file.</span>

<span>First off, this computer is pretty great. It's fast, has good storage, I like the trackpad, it's got decent sound, and decent brightness for indoor use only.<br/><br/>However like most laptops, it seems like finding the perfect one can be tricky. I went through three. It's not a "Lenovo" problem or this particular model problem, so much as a laptop problem. I've had the same issues with multiple brands.<br/><br/>The first one had screen separation at the top left corner. It popped out of the case. It seems like this isn't the sturdiest design in that regard, but we'll see. Returned.<br/><br/>The second one had funky colors and did not get bright enough. I tried calibrating the colors for hours. Nothing worked. Everything was just off and the screen didn't get as bright as my first one did. Returned.<br/><br/>The third one I bought used. At this point I was done with paying the full price, but I liked the computer if I could just find a good one. This one isn't perfect either, it has the right side of the screen slightly darker than the left side. I'm sensitive to these things and I can notice. Some people won't or can't. Probably a bulb out. But I bought this at a great price used so I'll live with it. This one also had a sound issue. It just wasn't loud enough. But, it turns out this was a result of a bad reset and not the PC itself. A proper reset restored the sound.<br/><br/>FOR THOSE HAVING LOW SOUND:<br/><br/>Click on the windows button at the bottom left of your screen. Scroll and make sure "DOLBY" is an option to click on. It wasn't for mine. I had to reset my computer fully and then the drivers I needed were installed and the sound is much better. If it is there, then sorry can't help you.<br/><br/>I know I'm sounding really negative, but I feel it's important to know possible defects when you are paying this much money. I'm happy with my laptop, I think it's pretty amazing and I have no other complaints.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>The sound is good for a laptop. It's not great, but it does the job. Make sure Dolby drivers are installed.<br/><br/>The brightness is good for a laptop. It's not great. You won't be able to use it outdoors very well but indoors it has good brightness.<br/><br/>It's fast. It loads up in mere seconds. It takes having several browser tabs and programs open to see a slowdown. But my use is not very typical, I really put it to the limits. Resetting the browser fixes any slowdown.<br/><br/>Battery is good. I can get a few hours out of it. But I don't use it off battery very much.<br/><br/>Back lit key board is great. Nice large keys. No 10 key though.<br/><br/>Trackpad is fine. I recommend disabling everything except two finger scrolling. Settings. Devices. Trackpad. Turn off everything else.<br/><br/>No Graphics card so this is no gaming PC but it will play your non next gen games well enough on low settings.<br/><br/>Solid build for the most part, but be on the look out for screen separation.<br/><br/>Comes with a neat pen. These sell for at least $30 bucks individually. But I won't personally use it, but I could always sell it if I wanted.<br/><br/>Not too heavy, but too heavy to use this as a tablet where you have to hold it in your hands. It has a massive battery and batteries have a lot of weight. But, flipping it and sitting it up to use it as a tablet works.<br/><br/>For the price the specs and features are great. Just be aware that this sells on Amazon occasionally new for $599. Just keep an eye on it and you might get lucky, Amazon lists a few for that price now and again. They also sell used units for even less than that if you are patient.<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>It's important to make sure your PC has no defects.<br/><br/>Could be louder, could be brighter, like most laptops.<br/><br/>Comes only with a USB C charger and not a separate charger, which means you can't use the USB C port other than to charge the computer unless you buy another charger.<br/><br/>Check for screen separation.<br/><br/>Colors and brightness seem hit and miss.<br/><br/>No new wifi 6. Just the standard wifi 5. The wifi card just isn't that great. If you are a decent distance from the router, do yourself a favor and buy a wifi 6 card for less than $20 on Amazon (You also need a wifi 6 router). It's pretty easy to install, just youtube the directions. You can do it in 10 minutes.</span>

<span>This is a major upgrade for me from my 5 year old surface tablet. Handles productivity tasks with blazing fast speed, doesn't get overwhelmed by the sea of browser tabs I need to do my job. Finger print reader works great, touch screen and pen is responsive, the hinge is sturdy without being stiff, trackpad is sensitive, keyboard is comfortable, speakers are great, average battery life, getting around 7 hours of work off a full charge, but could definitely go longer with lower screen brightness and less intense usage.<br/><br/>Some flaws:<br/>- my built in webcam routinely blinks out: I thought this was a software thing and checked everything from privacy settings, to device manager and drivers, to lenovo's software settings. Eventually, it started working again but then would randomly blink off, and disappear from device manager when it did so. I figured out that rotating the laptop or changing the angle of the screen could sometimes get it back on, which makes me think it's a hardware issue and the webcame is not securely attached. even when it is working, it's pretty low res.<br/>- integrated microphone doesn't record any sound: i guess this isn't the biggest deal since i always deal with calls over headphone, but annoying. registers in device manager, but does not record any sound. all software settings, including privacy, was explored.<br/>- laptop gets very hot when entering sleep mode, unusable: the fan and heat ramp up when the laptop goes into sleep mode, much more warm than when I'm using it normally, making it dangerous to leave the laptop inside a case when in sleep mode. i had to disable sleep mode when not plugged in to prevent overheating and battery drain. i have it set that lid closing puts the laptop into hibernation, which isn't the worse thing, just takes an extra 2-3 seconds to wake the computer up.<br/>- usb ports kinda stiff: had to really push to get accessories seated into the ports, was mildly worried of damaging it. I think maybe it's starting to loosen up slightly.<br/><br/>All in all, the things that don't work are huge concerns, and I can work around it, but they are annoying with this being a new laptop. Getting service with Lenovo is a pain in the ass. They respond irregularly to forum posts about technical issues, don't send you a confirmation about your service ticket, call you randomly without leaving a message for call back, tell you to schedule a call back time when your produce is marked as being ineligible for scheduled call backs, and to top it off, when I did call and started speaking to a rep, the call got dropped, and I saw no attempt at calling back. Might update this if they ever get back to me.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>Amazon agreed to send me a replacement, and all the previous issues I mentioned, the camera, the mic, the overheating issue, are all resolved in the replacement unit. BUT, it has different issues.<br/><br/> The first is one that just baffles me (and is vaguely concerning) which is it weighs approximately 0.5 ounces less than the first one I got. It's supposed to be the same model so I can't imagine what would account for the weight difference. I mean, I prefer the lighter weight but...what???<br/><br/>Also, the keyboard build quality appears to be different, although this issue is a slight improvement in that the keys feel a bit springier, although it's also audibly more clacky too. Another build difference, the hinge on the first unit felt much smoother and sturdier, while the replacement unit has certain parts of its range where it feels looser or stiffer. Lastly, the colors/brightness will randomly get washed out with the replacement unit, especially when waking from sleep. It doesn't render the display unusable at all, it's just quite noticeable, and annoys me. The colors on the first unit appear richer and with better contrast. And most significantly, the battery at full charge seems to only last 4-5 hours as opposed to the 8-9 hours I was getting with the first one I received.<br/><br/>Again for $600, I'm not expecting anything too remarkable, and the new unit is fine and performs just as well as the first one from a processing and productivity standpoint. It's fast, and can handle a slew of browser tabs, and even runs games fine, albeit older ones, and with some graphics settings turned down. With a pen and touchscreen, a 360 hinge, 16gb of ram, and really good built-in speakers, it offers a killer deal and is everything I could want in an affordable laptop for work. I'll just deal with the quirks with this replacement model and keep a close watch on it while it's covered under warranty.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: I sent the last one back due to its suspected refurbished status and the new one I received has all the build quality issues resolved. The keyboard is as quiet as the first one, and the hinge feels far more secure. However, I'm still finding the battery is lasting only around 5 hours, so I'm not sure what's going on, if they perhaps changed the battery to lighten the weight of the machine. It is the same weight as the 2nd unit I received.</span>

<span>My job is entirely Google based.  I bought this as a second work computer because my company laptop is a Thinkpad and it's heavy.  I just wanted to leave that at home and have a nice sleek backup for any work tasks I'd need to do in a pinch out of the house.  I couldn't be more pleased with this.  It's light, fast, and the battery life is fantastic.  Lenovos are known for having great keyboards and this is the best one I've used on a small laptop.  It also doesn't look or feel cheap.  The only thing that shows 'budget' is the screen, as it won't blow you away.  But it's still very solid and surprisingly good from the side, where most screens in this price range are garbage viewed from an angle.  If you are in the market for a laptop, and you are in the probably 95% of the public that absolutely doesn't really need an $800 laptop for what they use it for, rush out and buy this one while the price is still insane.</span>

<span>I have two teenagers in online school. These laptops were perfect for what we needed! Set them both up in minutes and had both boys doing homework.

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>As someone who has now had this for over two years, I feel like I can give it a somewhat proper review despite only having a couple of small experiences with other (drawing) tablets.<br/>For starters, this tablet overall is fine, but there are a lot of cons surrounding it that have soured my opinion on it within even the first week of this product.  I'll, however, start with the pros:<br/>1.  Cheap, but decent in quality.<br/>To bring up some experiences I've had with other drawing tablets, I've on a couple of occasions used my friend's iPad that was compatible with the Apple Pencil, to which I can say that the screen on the Wacom One is rougher and matte (kind of like paper, but much smoother feeling), which is ideal for less glaring on the screen (unlike the iPad).  It's simple, it has a decent stylus that is both wireless and doesn't need to charge, the corners are smooth, the built-in stand is about 2-3 inches high and holds the screen decently at a downwards incline toward you (unless you use it backwards like the chaotic person you aim to be).<br/>2.  Comes with some free test-trial products<br/>I never used them and have long forgotten about 'em, but a free bonus is a free bonus— and my Asian heart eats that up and requires me to list it.<br/>3.  Comes with Wacom Benefits<br/>I'm sure other tablets will come with a certain program to install that allows adjustments to be made for both the screen and the stylus, but it's still worth listing as the program Wacom uses is simple enough to use, but I do still get confused about options relating to the stylus and pressure (because the program gives you an option to have automatically varied pressures 'n whatnot to be set for different programs on your computer (i.e. Clip Studio vs just on your Browser)).<br/><br/>Now, the reasons as to why I really regret this purchase:<br/>1.  Lack of Research (on my end)<br/>I am at fault for this, but I do strongly implore others to thoroughly research the best tablet for YOU.  There are much cheaper options from 'lesser' brands that are often recommended for good reason;  they're cheaper, and a lot of that is because it just ain't from Wacom.  I now look back at such great deals for tablets with larger screens, the same benefits as this one, buttons on the side of the tablet, and a more robust stylus (that does likely require charging, but I'm just clumsy and lazy).  PLEASE do your lengthy research!<br/>2.  The Quality<br/>I did somewhat command the quality, but that's because it isn't a flimsy product and has lasted me this long with no needed replacements so far.  But, and a BIG but, is that I hate the execution of it all.  For one, the wires;  they make my laptop setup messier that it already was because of how inconsiderate everything was made.  The HDMI is on the left, the USB on the right whilst branching off to the outlet.  Did I also mention that these wires— while still being two wires as they acknowledge the fact that not everyone owns a PC with a comfortable layout for plugs— is connected by a bulky square in order for it to be one plug only (despite the plug taking up the space of two outlets anyways).  It's bulky, but that doesn't mean that it's sturdy, as— guess what?  It's stiff and hard to bend while also being put in a situation where most laptops will require the wires to bend around (unless you used an adapter (which I tried for multiple varying adapters, but the wires are so picky that the tablet either won't detect the laptop and therefore won't turn on OR the tablet is a blank screen).  The wires have also opposed a BIG problem within the first week that has lasted to this day:  It glitches out the screen.  Due to whatever factors I just listed, within the first week did I already encounter issues with the screen quickly flashing black to then come back.  I evaluated a bit, and not only is the wire just bad quality for what it is supposed to do, the PORT connecting the tablet to the computer isn't secure for the plug, and it feels flimsy and therefore often disconnects from simple movement of the wire or screen or even just pressure on the screen (like from drawing.  On a DRAWING tablet.  Made by a brand known for DRAWING TABLETS).  On top of that, over time, sometimes the screen would reconnect and be shown with RGB colors as if all glitched out, so I then have to wiggle the wire into the port again multiple times to get my actual screen and its colors back to normal.<br/>3.  HDMI issues<br/>If you wanted to try using the tablet with your phone, it's possible, and I can attest to that;  however, the wires and everything are just so finicky that it took me 3 different adapters to get it to work, and not for the reasons you may assume.  The tablet always properly connected (indicated by the tablet being able to be turned on at all), but the screen would either never turn on or just show the error of not being able to read the device.  For starters, I believe that you unfortunately need to access the driver prior to any phone usage (which I didn't know until researching about it a lot after getting the tablet since there was no actual information prior at the time of my purchase).  Secondly, I forget how, but I did find a workaround since I didn't have a laptop or any computer at the time, and the problems with the screen persisted with EVERY DEVICE until I did some inconsistently varied means (amongst trying different adapters, slots, etc.).<br/><br/>So, yeah, I kind of hate this thing, so thanks past me for being dumb and buying this for me on sale for my own birthday.<br/><br/>EDIT:  Wow, I think I jinxed myself since— despite my initial thoughts of its durability— my screen now has small glitch-like marks on the top right somehow.  They're very small and barely noticeable, mind you, but I notice it and it's a downer.</span>

<span>The screen is responsive. The pen is accurate. The color is good. I don't use this for note taking or anything but image editing and retouching, so I am basing everything on that.<br/>I do use a Spyder X Pro to color calibrate my monitors, including this Wacom. The default color settings were good, but not great. After calibrating, the color is much better.<br/>I can't give this a 5 star rating though I wish I could.<br/>First, the pen, while adequate, is not nearly as customizable as other pens. And there is no way to use another (Wacom) pen. I would love to have the ability to use other more feature-filled pens. I realize this is not a Cintique, but the pen seems no better than the screen-less Intuos I moved up from.<br/>Second, this takes an HDMI port at the computer. I don't have a problem with that by itself but it forces me to remove one of my monitors.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I'm split on this device. On one hand it doesn't have a great screen, it's memory and storage limited, the processor isn't very powerful, and it only has a single standard USB port. On the other hand it is compact, has decent battery life, an alright build quality for a cheap device, has an SD card slot, and does an passable job when it comes to writing, spreadsheets, surfing the web, watching videos, and even light gaming.<br/><br/>Chrome OS, on the other hand, seems to struggle with most things. It lacks some of the basic functionality you expect of a modern OS and can be anti-intuitive to use.  It has stability issues with apps, especially ones that compete with Google's own (such as Firefox).<br/><br/>Thankfully you can install a basic Linux build for things like Libre Office, but many programs installed that way also seem to have stability issues (like VLC Media Player).<br/><br/>The built in media player works but has a terrible interface and limited control, and only the terrible mobile versions of other media players seem to work right. The device has speakers, but they aren't very loud and seem crackly -- thankfully a headphone jack is included.<br/><br/>It has no touchscreen and the trackpad is possibly the worst I've ever used, to the point of being frustrating and/or not working the way I want it to -- partly because of the OS, itself, and partly because it doesn't have any buttons or anything available to assist its functionality. A mouse is necessary for comfortable use.<br/><br/>The keyboard is alright, comfortable to type on.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, if I had the choice to go back and purchase something else I probably would. I'm not sure Google's operating system is for me -- you can't even use the desktop to place shortcuts or folders! I would just get a regular laptop and install Linux Mint on it. Doing so would result in an experience that is far more intuitive, stable, and with the benefit of having access to the functionality of a full fledged OS (and all the programs available for it).<br/><br/>At the same time, this will do for most the things I bought it for, just less than expected in some respects.<br/><br/>Buy if you want something super basic to write on, look stuff up on, and to keep records. Anything more than that and you should definitely go for something else.</span>
