<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it. It's very different from a normal computer and only good for light browsing and writing, I also got a large micro sd card for storage since it's barely got any, but I love it!<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/>The laptop itself is adorable, I love the look and feel of it, but I was either sent a broken computer or it was broken by the postal service handling it too roughly. It booted quickly, at least, so my disappointment was immediate. :(<br/><br/>I've put in for a replacement, so I'll be updating my review once that one arrives in two days.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>I got the bluetooth version and its wicked fun.  Stylus is accurate and the hot buttons are programmable to any app/keystroke.<br/><br/>I could have saved $10 and got a Chinese knock off, but for the $60 price it was a no-brainer to stick with an original WACOM tablet.</span>

<span>I am just starting out getting into digital painting and drawing (I have almost 40 years of music, video, and photo editing experience by comparison), so for an absolute beginner like me this tablet is probably just right.<br/><br/>The tablet is super simple to use.  Setting it up and loading the driver software was completely painless.  It's probably user error on my part, but getting the 4 buttons to work with the program is a little sketchy (heh) and I've disabled them completely via the settings as a result.<br/><br/>The pen reacts very well onscreen with Affinity Designer, but it does take a lot of getting used to.  I also find that applying pressure to make the lines thicker/darker is not an exact science also and I find it requires more time to adjust the brush settings in the program.  As at least one other reviewer here recommended, I would agree that you should probably get a screen protector for a regular tablet and apply it to this one as it will make the pen movement smoother and not so scratchy.<br/><br/>More expensive tablets are probably more accurate in many ways, but overall it does what I need it to and is a nice alternative to doing everything with a mouse.  If my skills really improve over time, I would definitely get a better pen tablet.</span>

<span>I've used many Wacom products for the past 20 years<br/>from the graphite (price similar to this one) to Intuos XL and M touch (=today's Intuos pros),<br/>Cintiq 13HD, and these day I use Cintiq 24 PRO for work.<br/><br/>I am planning to travel around while working since my work is currently remote<br/>and can be done anywhere as long as I have a pc and a tablet to draw.<br/><br/>I initially thought of using my new ipad but I could not get used to the apps<br/>and the apple pen cause I was so used to the precision of a Wacom pen.<br/>Next thing was to bring a laptop + my old Intuos 5 M touch around<br/>but I realized I don't even need the M size and it won't fit my tote bag.<br/>Plus, it's pretty heavy to carry around with a laptop.<br/><br/>So, I decided to look into cheaper and smaller Wacom tablets that I can use<br/>without worrying about damaging or losing, and this one was perfect!<br/>It's also wirelessly connectable via Bluetooth which I liked.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1. Really small and light-weight to carry around<br/>2. Great pricing<br/>3. This is great for beginners - intermediate artists<br/>4. Wired and wireless<br/>5. Easy setup<br/>6. Precise Pen just like any other Wacom pens<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. The surface is a little too rough and it makes my hand clench my pen a bit harder<br/>since I need to use more force to draw something with a darker opacity compared to other pro-line-up tablets I have (cintiqs, Intuos Pros all have smoother surface that's just good enough and not too slippery like ipads)<br/><br/>2. Because the bezel around the active area is really thin (which is a pro for it's small size and lightweight), your palm might feel a bit awkward at times because there's no edge for your hand to rest on.<br/><br/>3. The build quality of the pen that comes does feel a bit cheap but it still draws without any issue and no battery's needed.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/>-I would recommend this to beginners who just wanted to get into digital art without overspending.<br/><br/>-I pasted on a paper-like screen protector made for a screen tablet so it's smoother than the original Intuos's rough surface. This will allow my hand to be more relaxed and the pen nib will probably last longer.<br/><br/>-For those who already own more advanced Wacom tablets, don't expect this to be on the same level of comfort as the pro lines but it's a nice tablet for traveling. I highly recommend you attach some kind of smoother texture screen protector on the tablet as I did because, without it, I find it harder to draw big curved lines (due to too much friction). My hand gets really tired quickly.<br/><br/>-Overall, I'm happy with it as it's wireless and easy to carry around. I would recommend it for any artists beginners - intermediate.</span>

I do wish there was a slot somewhere for the pen or an elastic to hold onto it but that's not enough of a deterrent to not recommend the product.

<span>Renewed Lenovo C330 arrived in a huge box clearly marked HEAVY LOAD....someone had a sense of humor being that the whole thing weighed only 4 pounds and you could have put ten of these in boxes inside their big box!<br/><br/>Opening the box the description had said it had cosmetic damage on the sides and gouges on the case, close inspection revealed no damage, it was MINT condition plus the moment I cracked the lid open it was already setting itself up and after a couple of minutes it was ready to go, (try that WINDOWS!) it had syncd itself from my other Chromebook!<br/><br/>The main reason I bought the Lenovo Chromebook was to see first hand how it compared to the two Acer Chromebooks I have, the Acer Spin 713 and the Acer R13, both having a lot of aggrivating issues relating to OS integration.<br/><br/>Acer both 713 and R13 had serious issues with poor sound loudness and quality, image quality is poor even though they were running over 2000 resolution, poor internet speed as both 713 and R13 kept switching to lower speed settings, while virtual keyboard settings in both Acer's suffered from serious lag, and screen fragmentation, Bluetooth pairing was poor with continual drops and no restart if computer woke from sleep and slower overall performance on and offline if used as a tablet.<br/><br/>Lenovo: Suffers from none of the above and excel's in many areas starting with Sound which is LOUD, image quality even with a low 1366 resolution is tight, sharp, and vivid, internet speed stayed where you put it and is quick, virtual keyboard no issues, Bluetooth pairs easily and is ready after sleep with no drops, tablet performance no different, quick and precise.<br/><br/>I agree with some other comments that this is a really handsome computer, the eggshell white with dark grey keys is a real eye catcher, that backed up by a great overall experience and I just noticed the price for these as renewed from the Amazon Warehouse has dropped, you will NOT be dissapointed!<br/>Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.</span>

<span>Lenovo has much better build quality then some of the other cheaper devices in this class.  This is my first chromebook. I have to say I am impressed with the amount of actual work you can do with this thing.  It is VERY versatile.  The performance is above average.  Being able to run Linux with ChromeOS is a huge bonus. If your a former sysadmin you might want to consider this for a utility. The battery life is fantastic.  The performance is good.  Switching between table and laptop mode  is a breeze.  Very happy with this product.</span>

<span>Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.<br/><br/>Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.<br/><br/>Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.<br/><br/>Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.</span>

<span>I grew tired of using my windows laptop and my Ipad. All my school notes were on my ipad but now everything is in my laptop. For windows I really like the Drawboard app to annotate PDFs. I barely use my Ipad anymore. I ran out of space on it so it was a hassle to keep moving my old documents back and forth and then the cloud would fill up. Now I just take all of my notes with my laptop and pen tablet. I can have multiple displays and write all together. I do miss the feeling of Ipad pencil to screen but if you need a cheaper alternative I don't think it's much of a loss. The transition has been pretty smooth. I recommend using the Ipad with the OneNote app and adding to your notes back and forth but for the most part I use Adobe and Drawboard for PDFs and OneNote for practice problems.</span>

<span>Recommended by many, this tablet is amazing for osu!. The pen has some grip and can be held comfortably. The tablet has some extra friction which can help you aim with less shaking. Because of the lack of hardware smoothing, you may need to download tablet drivers and add an antichatter plugin (inside the drivers). This doesn't mean that it's bad, on the contrary, this is actually a good thing! Less hardware smoothing means you have more control over your aim and you won't have to worry about the software messing up your aim. Overall, I recommend this tablet 10/10.</span>

<span>I like the touch screen, and the 2-in-1 capability. However, the screen brightness is not great (maybe 300 to 350 nits). Also the super-glossy screen creates lots of specular glare, further reducing contrast. Had they used an anti-reflective coating, most of the problem would be gone. As it is, it works fine in a dark room with minimal reflections. In a vehicle in the daylight, forget it. This is a particular problem for me since I bought this device for vehicle navigation. Forget about it in the daytime. I might as well be staring into a mirror. At night I can turn the screen intensity down and set the theme to dark mode.<br/>The i7 processor seems fast, until it heats up. That takes about 2 seconds. Then it seems to throttle back. Keep it under 10% processor load, though, and it is great.<br/>In laptop mode I do appreciate the largish touchpad. I do not appreciate the lack of buttons below the trackpad. The tilt corner trackpad BS doas not work in the dark! They could help this by adding a lighted trail around the trackpad when the keyboard is lit. At least I could figure out where the corners are at. Otherwise I have to fumble around, then re-position the cursor, then fumble some more to find the correct spot to press, then put on a headlamp so that I can see what the hFll I am doing. Maybe they should include a headlamp to compensate for design oversights. The down side is that the headlamp will reflect off the display and blind the user at the wrong angles. Maybe just don't try to use it in the dark.<br/>I do like the keyboard. It is noisy, but users of mechanical keyboards will dig it.<br/>The pen seems to work. I tried it once, honest. However, since I have a keyboard that I can fold out, I really haven't found much use for it. That is saying a lot, because I am a hard core handwriting input type from way back. For now, I am not sure where the pen is actually at.<br/>Finally, mine came with windows 11 home. For me that means a few things: 1 - Windows 10 in a horifying clown suit, 2 - Loss of some important tactical features, 3 - No drive encryption using bitlocker. The last one is a "Pro" feature only. If I decide to ante up for Pro, I will install Windows 10.<br/>Oh, one last thing: the laptop will take a second NVMe drive, but installing it is not for the faint of heart. I do not know what the helz they were thinking on this, but adding and swapping hard drives are a given on ANY computer. Personally I would have designed it so that both drives could be ejected/swapped with a button. This little bit tells me that the manufacturer considers this a throw-away device in a couple of years. Maybe they are right.</span>

<span>For the price and the specs, you would expect LG to properly check that all of the components work as expected. Well I can tell you from first hand experience that it seems like they don't. The laptop is light, and when the battery has charge, it does work as expected, but unfortunately the battery does not keep a charge, and after the battery ran out, that was it for the laptop. Shame on LG for not doing their work right. I guess I won't be buying LG ever again.</span>

One thing you'll possibly need to look out for.  When I registered device on Lenovo site my device was listed as being out of warranty since 2020.

<span>I really love this chromebook and am considering buying another one. I've had it almost 2 years. One of the hinges broke (on my left side when its open in front of me) months ago and that seems to be a common problem. I think this is what led to a screen crack in that corner. But I tell you what, even with that it still works phenomenally well and I am still using it daily. The picture is amazing even at low brightness, I love the backlit keyboard and it types well, the trackpad is one of the best I've used on a chromebook (I've had many) and the sound is really, really good! (speakers face up which is important) The touchscreen still works perfectly even with the hinge and screen crack. It is zippy fast, still. I use it primarily for streaming and for web browsing or schoolwork. Never, ever lags and never fails to boot on opening. The battery life is not as good as my old Asus, I probably get 8-9 hours but I just keep it plugged in. It doesn't get hot which is *really* nice. Overall it's probably the best chromebook I've ever had I just wish they could make the design better for the hinge issue. I'll either get it repaired or purchase another one. I do recommend it just be very careful with the hinges. Worth the price for sure.</span>

<span>I purchased this to be a "commuter" device for university. My Windows laptop is a bit too expensive and fragile for me to want to stuff it in a backpack and carry it around all day. When I purchased this, I was looking for something that could be used for video conference lectures, that I could do schoolwork on, and that I could use for light internet browsing during study breaks. I used it during the fall 2020 semester, and this met those expectations and more. Here's the "Good, Okay, Bad" breakdown.<br/><br/>Good:<br/><br/>The convertible screen ended up being incredibly valuable, once I finally got my hands on a USI stylus. I used it to take notes directly on PDFs of my lecture materials using Squid, and it really upped my study game.<br/><br/>If you're already deep in the Google ecosystem, this is a really handy device to have. My Pixel paired easily and now I can see my text messages on my computer. That's really cool.<br/><br/>Startup takes no time at all.<br/><br/>The battery life is impressive. I can consistently get at least 8 hours of heavy use, even with my brightness turned all the way up. It charges really fast, too.<br/><br/>The screen is clear, bright, and vibrant. I'm used to a much larger screen on my Windows laptop, and the transition to this smaller screen was easy, because the quality is so nice.<br/><br/>It's a durable little sucker. I'm kind of hard on my electronics. Four months of daily use, and it still looks the same as it did the day I unboxed it.<br/><br/>The keyboard is excellent and I love that it's backlit. I wish it had a 10-key numpad, but it definitely wouldn't fit one.<br/><br/>The touchpad is also excellent and I love that it supports multi-touch.<br/><br/>I'm just a big fan of Chrome OS. It's simple and easy to use. There's almost no learning curve. It has a lot of fun little tricks that make it really simple and efficient to use.<br/><br/>Okay:<br/><br/>The RAM is sufficient for my needs. It gets a little laggy when I have a lot of tabs open and apps running simultaneously. By "a lot," I mean like 20+. I currently have 12 tabs, one of which is a youtube video, and Google Hangouts open and it's running fine. It sometimes struggles to handle having multiple youtube videos open, or having a youtube video paused in the background while I do a video call. It has crashed on me a few times, almost always when I have multiple youtube tabs or streaming services running simultaneously. But as long as I'm careful about how much I have open at one time, it's fine.<br/><br/>The touchscreen is just okay, even with the USI stylus. It's not bad exactly, but sometimes it takes a while to recognize my USI stylus. I'm not sure if that's a problem with the stylus or the Chromebook. Palm rejection, latency, and smoothness vary a lot depending on the app you're using. (I tried every handwriting app in the play store.) I've never used it to draw. I wouldn't use this as a tablet replacement. It's a little bit too big and the layout is a little bit too unwieldy.<br/><br/>The app selection is okay. You can run most Android apps on a Chromebook. Usually they work fine. Sometimes they're a little clunky.<br/><br/>The webcam is alright. It's nothing fancy, but it's fine for video calls. I like the privacy cover.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>The speakers aren't great. They're loud enough, but they're tinny with no bass. The speakers on my Pixel 3a are objectively better. I almost always use headphones, so this isn't a huge problem for me - I didn't even notice until I'd already owned this Chromebook for a few months. But if listening to music without headphones or an external speaker is important to you, this might not be the device for you.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy with the Flex 5. I would recommend it if...<br/><br/>You already have a more powerful Windows or Mac device and want something lightweight, cheap, and sturdy to carry around.<br/><br/>You're caught between buying a tablet and a laptop, because you want a bigger screen/better keyboard/more traditional computer-like interface than you can get with a tablet, but you don't want to spend a ton of money on a laptop or sacrifice features and durability for a low-tier laptop. (This is the perfect compromise for that, especially if you're already a Google/Android user.)<br/><br/>You're a light computer user who basically just wants an internet machine, but you want a nice internet machine. I would highly recommend this for an older adult or a kid who doesn't need any fancy software.<br/><br/>You already own Android or Google devices and want something that will complement them.</span>

<span>UPDATE Jan 2022:<br/>After two years of using it gently, a bit of plastic broke from the lower right section of the screen. Apparently that tiny piece of plastic supports the screen, because when I opened the laptop later, part of the screen (which is glass) shattered!<br/>I didn't force it and didn't drop the laptop. Not even once. TERRIBLE design.<br/>---------------------------------------<br/>This is my first Chromebook and I bought it to replace a 2014 Macbook Air. I read tons of reviews before making the purchase and watched every single Youtube video reviewing it. After a couple of days of usage, this are the things I like and dislike the most about this device.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>- You can get that premium feel right out of the box. Given the price tag, one wouldn't expect this, but it feels amazing. The chassis is metal on top (maybe aluminium?) and plastic on the bottom part. All fells solid, even the hinge. I absolutely agree with other reviews.<br/>- Comfortable keyboard. It's easy to write on it, the keys have a long travel and feel solid enough. Many reviews spend some time explaining this, and the laptop didn't let me down.<br/>- Crisp screen with relatively small bezels (less than 1/2¨).<br/>- Great performance. I was worried about the 4 GB ram and not a possibility to expand it. However, I've had no issues, even with 8-10 tabs open in chrome and two Youtube videos in parallel. That i3 together with chrome OS does an amazing job.<br/>- USB-C charging port on either side.<br/><br/>What I dislike:<br/>- The touchpad is okay. Is not a bad touchpad and its quite big, but compared with any Macbook you feel the difference. I'm getting used to it but it doesn't feel as responsive as I want it to be.<br/>- The camera is average. Compared with the 2014 MBA's camera, its crappy.<br/>- The screen is very shiny. Watching videos with a light in the background will definitely bother you. Using it outside will make it even worse.<br/>- Its heavy to be used in tablet mode. So, in my opinion, the touch screen is not necessary at all.<br/>- I can hear a high pitched, very faint noise on the back of the laptop. I don't know if this is the processor or the fan or what, but in a quiet room I find it annoying. Some other reviews also mentioned this issue.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't regret my purchase. Everything feels snappy, and I'm pleased with the looks of this laptop every time I use it.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>UPDATE July 20:<br/>- I'm taking out 10+ hours out of the battery when using it lightly (docs, surfing the web, etc).<br/>- I'm confirming that you can charge the device from the USB-C port on either side.<br/>- Feels snappy always: takes less than 10 seconds to boot, chrome opens instantly (literally, less than half a second).<br/>- The biggest flaw I found is the reflection of external light on the screen. It bothers me every time I'm watching a dark scene in Netflix. I can perfectly see my face, similar to the reflection on my phone's black screen.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>UPDATE Jan 2022:<br/>Everything I mentioned previously still holds.<br/>Just one BIG design flaw: The right hinge is slowly and silently destroying itself. Aparently it's a very common problem among many users, where the plastic around the hinge starts coming apart and everything gets loose.<br/>I don't use my chromebook that much and I take great care of it, but I still got this issue. Lenovo please listen to the community!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have only had this laptop for about a month.  Overall, I really like it so far and have had no trouble transitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 11, although I don't give this machine a lot of tasks; it's my travel computer and my bedside companion.<br/><br/>I did have a concern about the battery charging, though, and I want to alert people to the issue. If you don't want to read this review any further, just please remember to keep the Lenovo Vantage software on your computer in case you need it.<br/><br/>First, the laptop ships with a charger that is a small brick with a cable that has a three-prong wall plug and another cable that connects to the USB-C port on  the laptop.  I used the charger and the battery charged up to 100% with no problems.  I had my battery set to "Battery Saver" in the Windows 11 system settings.<br/><br/>The laptop does have the older type of round charging port, but you have to buy a separate charger to use it.  So that's what I did; I went to the Lenovo site and bought that charger---which by the way, is not too lightweight itself, but at least it's more manageable for use on trains and such, and it has the two-prong wall plug.<br/><br/>So last night, I decided I had better make sure the additional (travel) charger worked okay.  I noticed, though, that my battery was only charging up to 60% of capacity.  The charger was powering the machine, but the battery wasn't filling up.  I thought maybe the charger was defective.  At that point I switched to the charger that came with the laptop, but with that charger, also, the battery wasn't charging beyond 60%!  Oh, no!  At that point, I thought my laptop must be a lemon.  I downloaded an additional software from the Lenovo site, Lenovo Diagnostic Tool, and ran a test on the battery.  The battery test failed!<br/><br/>I remembered that another Amazon customer who had reviewed this laptop had complained that he couldn't charge his battery beyond 60%.  A Lenovo representative responded something about a setting that prevented full loading of the battery to extend battery life if the laptop is kept plugged in.  I looked for that setting in the Windows battery settings, and changed my Power Mode setting to Best Performance, but that didn't help.  I could find nowhere in the Windows Settings to get the battery to charge more fully.<br/><br/>Eventually, I looked in the Lenovo Vantage software, under More Settings, and found that my machine had been set (not be me, I swear) to Conservation Mode.  This setting is only in the Lenovo Vantage software, and is NOT the same as Battery Saver in the Windows settings.  Once I changed my laptop from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charger in Lenovo Vantage, my battery started charging again.<br/><br/>The purpose of Conservation Mode is to conserve the life of the battery if the laptop is continually kept plugged in.  Because that's how I use the laptop, I will continue to use Conservation Mode, but will try to remember to switch to Rapid Charge mode if I want to take the laptop to another location without taking along a charger.<br/><br/>I suspected that the travel charger I purchased separately had somehow triggered the computer to convert from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charge, but that is not the case.  If the computer is in Rapid Charge mode, either charger will charge the battery to 100%.  If the battery has a charge of less than 60%, and the computer is in Conservation Mode, either charger will charge it to 60%.  If the battery has a charge of between 60% and 100%, the computer is then put into Conservation Mode and plugged into either charger, the computer will be powered by the charger but the battery will not be further charged.<br/><br/>I hope this review is helpful.</span>

<span>I purchased the Ryzen 5 16gb/256gb variant.<br/><br/>I wish I had gotten the variant with more storage (1tb instead of 256gb)... although if I choose to upgrade, I can do it myself since theoretically the M.2 NVMe SSD is able to be replaced.<br/><br/>Came with laptop, 65w PD charger, and stylus with AAAA battery. I purchased two accessories (listed at end of review)<br/><br/>One USB C port: Supports PD charging up to 65w (charger included but you can use your own if it supports PD) and data transfer at 2.0 speeds.<br/><br/>Two USB A ports: both support 3.2 speed, one of them has constant power (intended for charging other devices when laptop is off).<br/><br/>One audio jack: headphones out and microphone in use the same port. Plugging in regular headphones is just as normal, no adapters needed.<br/><br/>The side mounted power button is hard to hit but you will rarely use it. Even after being shut down, it will turn back on when you open it.<br/><br/>Fingerprint reader is quick to recognize your fingerprint. Unlocking the computer after startup is extremely quick.<br/><br/>Touchpad is very responsive and features the same tricks we use on our phones (i.e. double tap, scrolling, ect.) For examples on the gestures you can use, search "touchpad gestures".<br/><br/>The screen is bright. Using it in a classroom, office, or outside in the shade is great. Direct sunlight is where it becomes hard to read.<br/><br/>The screen folds all the way back. You can use it in any position. Once folded, it will orient itself to the way you're holding it. Think of how your phone automatically changes it's orientation if you rotate it.<br/><br/>Webcam is decent. I love the privacy slide cover it has. With this I always know that the camera is covered.<br/><br/>Keyboard is normal. It's a laptop keyboard. Clicky but spongy.<br/><br/>Battery life is normal for a laptop of this size. Whatever the advertisement says is probably true. I've never tested it because I always have it plugged in.<br/><br/>GAMING: It can game. I have successfully played Valorant, Fortnite, and Minecraft. It can do it, but don't expect 1080p at 60fps unless you turn down the games performance.<br/><br/>Notes: I purchased these accessories:<br/><br/>1. A screen protector called: "Spigen Tempered Glass ... (81X20005US)"<br/><br/>2. A case called: "mCover case ... /5-14ALC05/"<br/><br/>3. And put clear tape over the palm rests.</span>

<span>Right off the bat I have purchase two of these so far from the Amazon Warehouse NOT Third Party Sellers because when purchased directly from Amazon you get manufacture support where third party you cannot.<br/>One was purchased as Acceptable the other Very Good yet both were like brand new and work great.<br/>Performance on and offline is very good, sound loudness is also very good but screen quality even at such a low resolution is excellent, tight, sharp with deep vivid true colors, videos run to 4K  with no issues, while the keyboard and touchpad are also very good.<br/>The IPS screen for me is a must have and this one plus touch capability is just icing one the cake.<br/>Now for the real twist:  I have bought 9 different Chromebooks over the past couple of months to see if they had that something special that makes them indespensible and I must honestly say that my Fire Tablets 7 through 10 and ONLY the Fire Tablets are much more useful, easy to use, take a ton less space, have much broader uses, easier to take with, typically much higher video, image and sound quality and much faster on the internet and cost waaaay less but give you so much more, so the grand experiment is done and I will be finding some good homes for the Chromebooks.</span>

<span>First off, the touchscreen works fine.  I'm on version 100.0.4896.133 and had absolutely no issues.  So whatever plagued this model previously has been resolved.  Now then, lets focus on the laptop.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed was the screen.  In an age of almost no bezels....  Holy bezel Batman!  Is this a bad thing?  Eh, maybe to some.  For me I'm OK with it.  Realize the laptop itself is about the size of a 13.3" laptop.  I haven't looked into it but I suspect there's a laptop in this chassis with a 12" or 13" screen.  But in day-to-day use, it's fine for me.  The smaller screen gives a good pixel density and colors look fine.  Very good viewing angles too.  So all in all, I like it.  Touchscreen seems very responsive as well.  No issues at all there.  Oh, and in the bezel there's a webcam.  720p, does OK in low light, no physical shutter so get your stickers ready :P<br/><br/>Going down the laptop we have the hinge.  While I'm not a fan of tablet modes that leave the keyboard exposed, it does what it sets out to do just fine.  The pivoting action feels very smooth with a fair bit of resistance.  Folding over into tablet mode, everything works as expected with good orientation control.  So while something I won't use much, it's a nice feature.<br/><br/>Down further, we get to the keyboard.  Keys have a nice feel to them though travel is a bit short.  Not Lenovo's best but certain better than other keyboard I've used.  I'm a little disappointed it doesn't include the usual "F" keys given I use Linux on here but so far it's not caused any issues...<br/><br/>Finally we come to the touchpad.  I must be honest, I despise most any touchpad without physical buttons.  However, I must confess this one is actually very good.  It's proven to be very responsive with almost no hiccups.  At times I will have a small lag if I try and use two fingers (resting one finger on the "button" and moving with the other) but it handles this better than other cheap machines I've dealt with.  The physical action is rather mushy but taps work just as well.<br/><br/>Finally, we come to the speakers.  This is probably the weakest part of the whole machine.  I find underside speakers become obstructed way too often.  Of course this depends on how it's used, but I'd much prefer top-mounted speakers.  But judging what we have, they actually works pretty well.  If you're on a hard surface, they have decent sound.  Nothing phenomenal, but about what you'd expect from a machine at this price point.  And then if they are covered, you can still get OK sound from them.<br/><br/>I guess the last point will be I/O.  Charging is via USB-C, and yes, this port can be used for other USB devices too.  You also have full-sized HDMI, a USB 3.0 and full-sized SD card slot.  SD cards aren't flush when inserted so that's a bit disappointing, but I'm glad Lenovo at least opted for full sized ports and such.  Now on the adjacent side we have power, volume and a headphone jack...not much to say there.<br/><br/>Finally the guts of the beast.  At the heart of this machine is an ARM based processor.  I was very curious how performance would be using ChromeOS and more importantly the Linux dev environment.  Results have been mixed but generally very good.  As a Chromebook for surfing the web and watching videos, it works fine.  Pages load quickly, videos play without issue, etc.  The only hiccup I've found is playing a video in the background.  The video remains frozen for a bit when returning to it, but this is only a minor quibble.  I've not had many issues with Android apps either.  My library is really only productivity software, but it's all worked as expected.  Over on the Linux side, the processor is a bit labored.  Chromium under Linux is obviously slower than the baked in Chrome, but I'm sure Linux running as a VM doesn't help.<br/><br/>Lets end on usage, or more specifically heat and battery life.  I've not done any specific testing, but I'd say 10 hours out of this machine wouldn't be difficult at all.  And then even while under a load and charging, there's almost no noticeable heat generated by this laptop.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good all around Chromebook and can overlook the oddly sized screen, I highly recomend this machine!</span>
