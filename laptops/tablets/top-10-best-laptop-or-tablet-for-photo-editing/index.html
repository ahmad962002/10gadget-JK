<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days.  The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.<br/><br/>It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.<br/>I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function.  I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.<br/>My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select "view in<br/>browser". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.<br/>I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it.  Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.<br/>Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>I love my Chromebook, especially since I got it for a huge discounted price. It runs seamlessly with my phone yet the browser works more like on a laptop vs. a phone. The battery life is surprisingly long and it's so lightweight that I use it for all my writing over my laptop. I wasn't sure how I'd like a Chromebook but I absolutely love it! It's both a laptop and a tablet since you can fold the keyboard completely back to use the touchscreen. I highly recommend one, you'll use it more often than you think.</span>

<span>I like the fact that it's a touchscreen and that you can place in all kinds of different positions to use it as a laptop and tablet without needing anything else. I've had it for close to a year and haven't had any issues at all.<br/> All Chromebooks come with only 8 years of software updates that start at time of manufacture. Mine was brand new but only had 4 left. For me the price made it a no brainier. In 4 years I'll just buy another one.</span>

<span>Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.<br/><br/>This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.<br/><br/>Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.<br/><br/>Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.<br/><br/>Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have.</span>

<span>This works pretty well if you are just going to be web browsing or watching some videos. It's a bit slow in terms of installing/running apps. But I find it's small size, lightweight and good battery life make it very convenient to use when you don't really want to haul around a full size laptop. I might in the future consider spending a little bit more for a faster processor. But that's about the only criticism I have for this.</span>

<span>I got this Chromebook to replace my last Samsung 11"  Chromebook which I had for about 3.5 years.<br/>The Acer spin 11 was pretty good and I liked it alot. The keyboard worked much better than my Samsung.<br/>That thing has a mind of it's own, I think. You type one word and the Chromebook types up something else..<br/>Expect for this one small problem and it started just after a month or so after I had purchased this.<br/>Once awhile it wouldn't turn back on after I had idling for whatever time it took to be in power saving mode but<br/>It wouldn't turn back on, everytime when this happens I have to press the side power button for about ten seconds to turn it off first then, I'd give it a minute before hitting the same power button again. I hold it just long enough to see the blue light goes on next to power button you just pressed. Oh just out of curiosity, what does the power button do located right top corner? Cause it won't shut the computer off or on. No matter how long you hold the button down. Anyway back to main issue, just awhile I left the Chromebook to visit UPS store and came back, tried to reboot my Chromebook as usual but this time it won't turn on. I tried unplug &amp; replug all the cables like power, HDMI. Man I only had this for about 4-5 months and this happens. My warranty expired as well.... I'm very disappointed.</span>

<span>I purchased the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 to use as a bedside entertainment center, so I wanted something that could stream and have quality screen resolution.  I liked the idea of a device that I could position with the screen set back (open like a laptop) or set forward (flip it and go triangular, baby!); I also needed a reliable blue tooth as I wear comfy headphones that I can sleep in.  I have an extensive music collection that I keep on an external SSD and I absolutely love MediaMonkey because of it's customizable interface on it's Window's app (I assumed the ChromeOS version would be very similar - my first major stumble).<br/><br/>First, the positive:  The device itself is fantastic.  Everything about it feels sturdy, the touchscreen is responsive (though, I will say there are times when I feel I have to hit an app 2 or 3 times to activate).  The screen resolution and sound quality are lovely for a device of this size and price - don't go expecting studio quality here, but the streaming was beautiful.  The visuals are not pixelated; it's as good as watching on a television (only smaller).  Oh, and I will say I love the fact that the USB-C port is on both sides, which makes it easier to plug in on any side (it's the little things).<br/><br/>Performance is great, I get no lag and I've had no issues streaming Netflix, Hulu or Disney+.  I just realized I haven't tried watching Twitch or Youtube on this.  I'll download those apps and if I have any problems with them, I'll update this review and let you know.<br/><br/>I have one grouse, and it's kind of a biggie:  The apps are terrible.  It was so dismaying at first, I did actually contemplate sending the device back.  I slept on it and decided I was going to stick it out.  In truth, part of my disappointment is that the ChromeOS version of MediaMonkey is disappointing.  When it came down to it, I tried a whole slew of music apps and I wound up settling on the music app that annoyed me the least (VLC).  Most of the apps have ads that are intrusive, and even the ones I thought about paying for just don't seem worth the value.<br/><br/>Even simple apps like an alarm clock or a blue tooth manager:  I downloaded several different ones, and I'm continually settling on the app that annoys me the least or seems to be able to handle some of what I would like.  I even tried to find a power button app because I just wanted to turn off the computer with a single, on screen button push - despite over a dozen apps that claimed to do this, all of them performed poorly and one you had to close out an ad before it would turn off (really?!?).<br/><br/>In choosing whether or not to keep it, I had to weigh the solid build and reliable performance against an operating system that was under par for Windows or Mac.<br/><br/>That said, I'm very glad I kept this little guy.  In the end, it's a reliable little entertainment unit and it's wonderful where it counts: It's a great streamer (with a beautiful picture) and it plays music that I love and I can leave it in place and listen on my blue tooth headphones while I wander all over the house.  The apps are a shame, but honestly, given the price point here, it's a good deal and I can live with it.</span>

<span>this is my second chromebook (still like my 5 year-old 11.6 inch Asus C202SA 4GB/16GB which is still going strong, but it has reached the end of its automatic OS updates). this one is MUCH faster, has a lot more memory 8GB and storage 128GB, but is also quite a lot heavier (and cost twice as much). i like the tablet mode, too, although i don't have much need for android apps and haven't installed linux. nice screen (though 250 nits is a little low), terrific backlit keyboard. but the battery does not last me more than 5 hours, which is a shame, considering i am only using it for browsing and google docs. turned off bluetooth, which helped a bit. i'm envious of those getting 10-hour battery life. but i'll have to keep the unit because i'm in india and there is no easy way to return it to amazon in the US though i have had it for only one week.</span>

I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things. I recommend this laptop for the things I've mentioned and the low price. The laptop I bought has the following specs.<br/>Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop was delivered in two days.

<span>I use the computer for basic things like social media, email, and online board games.  It generally serves that function well.  The battery life is solid.  It was my first time getting a touch screen LED rather than an LCD and I was somewhat disappointed in the image clarity vs an LED, but if you value a touchscreen, it could be worth that tradeoff.  My main frustration is with the hardware.  About 1-2 months after getting the computer, one of the two rubber traction strips at the bottom peeled half off.  Its attached by adhesive, so there is no way to reattach it.  I eventually had to peel it off entirely or else there would just be an 8 inch long piece of rubber hanging off the computer.  Now 2.5 months after getting it the second strip is having the same problem and is falling off.  The computer gets very hot and I think this may have caused this problem. But it feels like they should have designed it so that the friction strips don't come off in the first 1-3 months.</span>

<span>I've had several technology fails this year, including my gaming laptop and my Linux laptop breaking down. My budget is not what it was when I bought the gaming laptop, and the other one was a hand-me-down from a relative. So, I needed a cheap laptop to do basic typing and web browsing on until I can afford something to game on. Finding a non-Chromebook under $300 is tough these days, so I took a chance on this model.<br/><br/>This laptop is good for very basic functionality. It's small, lightweight, and runs quickly enough (granted you buy a separate hard drive and don't overload its very small memory). I have the feeling that it would run better with an older OS: Windows 11 is not only awful on its own, it's terribly bloated for a small-memory machine like this one. I won't go into all the reasons why I hate W11 here, that would be a whole other review. I would recommend installing another OS on it if you have the know-how to do so. I may eventually install a Linux OS on it if performance ever decreases. So far, it's quick enough for me. Don't expect lightning-fast loading, though. Another tip: look up ways to unload extra programs to free up space and don't have any programs run on start/continuously in the background if you can help it (OneDrive really bogs the system down).<br/><br/>The screen quality is middling but it displays videos crisply enough. I wish it would dim a little more, since I often type in low-lighting. This leads me to my biggest complaint: NO KEYBOARD BACKLIGHT. I suspected it wouldn't have one since it wasn't mentioned in the product description, but since it's such an important feature, I'm mentioning it in all-caps here. I use a low-wattage lamp to type by and I can see the keys (the white keyboard helps with this), not to mention I can type without looking at the keyboard often, but be warned about this! I know a keyboard backlight is a must-have for anyone that may need to type in extremely low/no-lighting situations.<br/><br/>I'll also mention that this is not a touchscreen laptop. I never use touchscreen laptops, but I know some buyers may expect this feature. The touchpad mouse has no buttons and can be a bit wonky; I highly recommend buying a separate mouse.<br/><br/>I tried to run Steam and some games on this machine out of curiosity. Don't do that. Even pixel art games with low-demand graphics will skip, sometimes freeze, and put too much demand on the system. I haven't tried streaming video from this machine to my TV yet. This is not a media or gaming laptop, though. You can stream any service on its native screen (YouTube, etc) easily, play music streaming or old school mp3s (you'll need a separate drive for CDs/DVDs), but I wouldn't push it beyond that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's what I expected for the price. I wish it had an older version of Windows and a keyboard backlight, but neither is necessary for my needs. I use it for listening to music while typing and sometimes streaming YouTube, it works fine for those things. I've un-bloated the system as much as possible and done some tweaks to get it to run as fast as it can, but not every buyer may know how to do this and especially running OneDrive all the time can bog the system down considerably. It definitely needs a separate flash or hard drive to extend its memory. I will update this review in the future if any issues arise.</span>

<span>There’s nothing fancy about this thing. I bought it to supplement my Mac products for work compatibility when needed. I don’t really use it to run apps or thirsty programming. It does Microsoft office, saves files, talks to the cloud, and connects to the web with wifi. It does everything I need and nothing I don’t. For the price, I’m happy, and if it’s stolen or breaks, I won’t lose sleep.</span>

<span>After spending alot of time researching many different chromebooks, tablets and laptops in the $200-500 that would best suit my needs I found myself getting frustrated and overwhelmed by the process and was about 30 seconds from giving up and settling on one that was not ideal just to get the process over with. That is when this beauty miraculously appeared! Not only did it check 9 out of 10 of the boxes I needed it to, it was also 1/2 the price compared to others I researched in this category.  I love the design and versatility of having a laptop and tablet in one option.  I also like that unlike some of the other 2 in 1 chromebooks it is not flimsy and they clearly took into consideration the lifestyle needs of a 2 in 1 chromebook keeping it lightweight yet very sturdy. The battery life is wonderful, it charges quickly and a full charged has lasted me over a full day at work as I used it continuously for a total of 10.45hrs before it got down to the red at 15%. And that was without turning on the battery saver option! The display is clean, crisp &amp; vivid. Whether it's used for streaming a movie or creating a new document, you will be satisfied with the visuals for sure. Set up was a breeze as was learning the ins and outs of all this chromebook offers. The only "complaint" I have in regards to this specific model is the lack of protective cases designed to fit it. I understand this is not a issue about the product itself but I did want to make people aware of it as there is only 1 brand of hard cover cases that fit it and do not have to be removed for use(mCover hard shell case for 12.2in Samsung v2 chromebook).<br/>I highly recommend also using a padded waterproof shock absorbent carry case as well for travel, as the hard case is mainly to protect from scratches and dings and WILL NOT protect it in the event it is dropped, banged or similar.  The other recommendation is a 9H screen protector, especially if you plan to use the touch screen and stylist pen options. If I could give it 10stars I would.  Hands down this is the best purchase I have made this year, I only wish I found it sooner!</span>
