<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>For background - I was looking for a work monitor I can take with me on the go. After doing about 3 weeks of research and getting ready to spend $400 on a big name brand I came across this absolute gem. The cocopar monitor is easily the best bang for your buck.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Great picture quality<br/>-no dead pixels on arrival<br/>-comes with all cords needed<br/>- 1 usb-c takes care of power and display<br/>-works really well in portrait or landscape mode<br/>-comes with a screen protector<br/>-AMAZING customer service (definitely provides added value here)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-power button/menu rocker and usb c port are on opposite sides so you probably need a stand to properly use it in portrait mode<br/>-if you’re looking for a gaming monitor this is definitely a budget option as it’s only 1080p/60hz<br/><br/>Overall I was really impressed with this monitor and 100% recommend it if you’re looking for an on-the-go second monitor. Well done from the cocopar team!</span>

<span>I'm in constant need of an extra screen to pair with my laptop while on the go, and took a flier on this little unit based on previous reviews, its usb C to usb C connection capability, and its reasonable price tag. I'm only one day in to using it, but have to say that it hit my needs exactly and I couldn't be happier. I have a 13 inch Macbook Pro, and this 15" monitor provides a ton of extra real estate to work with. Granted, any external 15" monitor would do that - what makes this special is that it fits nicely into my work bag, and only requires a single cable for both power and video from my laptop. Added bonus is that this USB C to USB C cable is included in the box, along with several other cables. I haven't tried out the magnetic cover that doubles as a stand for the unit in landscape mode, as I much prefer the portrait mode and so also bought a little collapsible stand that also slips nicely into the backpack. The cover works just fine to protect the unit, however. Overall, the unit hit high marks for quality, portability, and just plain usefulness. Now, whether it is a coffee shop, hotel room, or my backyard, I have the screen space I need.</span>

<span>Pros:<br/>Double your screen real estate<br/>Can Power the monitor via USB-C without extra power source *May need power in certain circumstances*<br/>Magnetic screen protector/stand<br/>HD vibrant colors<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Speaker Volume weak<br/>No stand-alone volume button<br/><br/>Whether completing work documentation, various work-related tasks, researching topics, streaming, or gaming, I likely spend more than 14 hours a day in front of a computer/tablet.  With a growing need to multitask, one of the most considerable productivity upgrades was a second monitor.  The dual monitors allowed me to open more panels and decreased the need to move back-and-forth between frames.  Thus, it was an easy decision to upgrade my home setup by adding a portable monitor to my home computer.<br/><br/>UNBOXING:<br/>The USB-C Portable Monitor arrived in a 15 3/4 inches long by 10 9/16 inches wide by 2 11/16 inches thick clean white retail box. The cover displayed an attractive silvery-metallic “Portable Monitor,” while the top/front panels provide the same information in bold black font.  The left side panel was left unadorned, while the right-side panel provided a product SKU barcode. The bottom panel provided the Portable Monitor name along the top left of the panel and contact information along the bottom of the panel.  I appreciated the clean white background, the shimmery metallic font, and liked the contrasting black-on-white theme.<br/><br/>I lifted the top panel of the box, removed the thin white foam padding, the 13 3/4 inches wide by 7 3/4 inches tall (15 3/4 inches diagonal) screen protector, then the 2 pounds 6.7 oz portable monitor from the box.  With the main product removed from the packaging, I lifted the 3/4 inches thick foam spacer and found a secondary foam layer with three cutouts.  Along the top left of the panel, I found a  2 1/2 inches wide by 2 1/4 inches tall cutout, which contained the black-colored 1 7/8 inches tall by 1 5/8 inches wide by 1 inch thick Type A Wall adaptor with USB-A output.  Just beneath the cutout, I found a second cutout, which measured 5 5/8 inches wide by 4 inches tall.  The medium-sized cutout contained a black-colored, flat-style 39 3/4 inches long USB-A to USB-C power cable, and a matte-black 47 1/2 inches long rounded-plastic USB-C to USB-C cable. The final cutout was the largest of the three and measured 5 7/8 inches wide by 6 1/2 inches tall.  The cutout contained the product user manual, 3-year warranty card, an upgraded accessories panel (monitor stand, portable battery, dongle adapter, streaming stick), two packets of screen protector installation kits (2 15/16 inches wide by 1 15/16 inches tall cardboard presser/scraper, a dust absorber, three guide stickers, and a  3 7/8 inches square microfiber cloth), and a 48-inches long micro-HDMI to HDMI cable.<br/><br/>Installation:<br/>The 19-page instruction manual proved to be quite valuable.  The first two panels provided similar information to the included accessory panel and added a protective sleeve to the possible upgrades.  The third panel provided a list of the table of contents (About the Monitor, Using the Monitor, Troubleshooting, and Warranty and Support).  The first segment, “About Your Monitor” (pages 1-3), provided a list of packaging contents (as listed above), then provided a helpful paragraph about each of the items.  The second page provided a detailed product specifications panel (15.6inch screen size, IPS screen type, 1920×1080 resolution, 16:9 Aspect Ratio, 100% sRGB, 16.78 Million color depth, 9300K temperature, 300 cd/m2 brightness, 1000:1 contrast ratio, 178 degrees horizontal and vertical viewing angle, 60 Hz refresh rate, 1.6 pounds, 14.8 x 8.8 x 0.2-inch dimensions, HDR support, Free Sync Support, 6W power consumption, Mini HDMI/3.5mm Audio Jack/USB-C port x 2 connectivity, 1W x 2 built-in speakers).  The third panel provided a left and right side view of the monitor and the corresponding ports (3.5mm Audio Jack/Menu/Power/exit buttons on the right and mini HDMI, plus two USB-C output ports on the left).  Similar to the previous panels, the instruction manual did a great job at detailing the features in prose format.<br/><br/>The next panel provided utility information for the portable monitor and information about the ports (Mini-HDMI, USB-C (supports PD2.0 5-20V), USB-A (wall adapter).  The subsequent three panels labeled “Connecting your Monitor” provided various picture/prose connection options.  For a Laptop/PC with Type-C ports, use the included USB-C to USB-C cable and power adapter.  For a Laptop/PC with HDMI ports, use the HDMI cable for A/V and use either the USB-A to USB-C between computer/monitor, or use wall power if needed.  If the computer has a miniDP, you may need to purchase an adaptor.  You can connect the device to modern gaming systems via HDMI and wall power, or you can connect the current generation portable gaming system via USB-C cable and wall power.  You can connect the monitor to USB-C capable phones similar to the laptop example above, or you can purchase a separate adapter/dongle for phones that use proprietary charging ports.<br/><br/>The user manual instructions proved to be quite detailed regarding the on-screen display (OSD).  The panel provided a menu layout and reviewed the brightness/contrast, color settings, audio settings, other settings, and input source.  You can use the menu/+/- button on the right side of the monitor to enter the OSD menu, use the +/- toggle to move up/down within the list, and then press the button to activate your selection.  You can adjust each of the parameters, select between 4 image modes (Standard/Game/Movie(MY FAVORITE)/photo), adjust the screen tint ( 9300k, 6500k, sRGB, User), Hue, saturation, low blue light, and the color gamut (sRGB, Adobe RGB, DPI-P3, Native color).  The low blue light mode reduces the ambient blue light, which breaks down natural melatonin, the sleep hormone.  By reducing blue light, the monitor becomes less stimulating and may improve sleep.  If you navigate to “Audio Settings,” you can mute on/off, or increase/decrease the volume.  Under “Other Settings,” you can adjust the aspect ratio to full screen or 16:9, turn freeSync on/off, adjust the language,, adjust HDR to auto/off/2084, or reset to factory default.  Through this panel, you can also adjust between the input sources Type-C or HDMI. The last few panels provided a detailed overview of the duplicate/extend/second screen options and provided a few troubleshooting steps.<br/><br/>Testing:<br/>To test the monitor, I paired it with my 15 Laptop.  I removed the magnetic cover from the monitor screen and laid the monitor down face up.  I used screen cleaner/microfiber cloth to clean the surface, and I removed the thin layer from the top of the screen protector. I then laid the screen protector down onto the screen surface.  I found a few bubbles along the outer edges, I lifted the edge of the screen with tweezers, then used the dust-absorber to remove as many of the bubbles as possible.  Despite several attempts, I had about ten tiny bubbles along the periphery that would not go away.  I did not feel that this was a negative aspect of the product, rather a problem with my installation technique. I plugged the power adapter into a standard wall outlet, the USB-A to USB-C cable from the adapter into the lower USB-C port, and the USB-C to USB-C cable between the monitor and my computer.  I navigated to the System preferences on my laptop, then Displays. I moved the computer display and accessory monitor display from left to right, or I could hold the option key and drag it onto the computer monitor display to mirror the image.  I did not find that feature useful unless I wanted to specifically show someone else what I was doing on the computer.<br/><br/>When I moved files/folders to the second screen, I immediately realized the screen felt a little dark.  I pressed the menu option, changed the brightness from 30 to 100%, and immediately appreciated the improvement.  I liked the ability to control/adjust the settings, but I would have preferred a preset feature/memory and the ability to decrease the brightness. My Laptop provided sufficient power via USB-C to power the second monitor without a secondary power supply.  However, If I plugged a pair of headphones into the 3.5mm port, I found that the power was a bit lacking.  In that case, I needed to plug the monitor into the included USB-A/Adaptor to add the required power.  I loved the intuitive button combination, the mini HDMI out, the added USB-C, the cable’s length, the magnetic stand, and the quality of the display.  I did not miss that the screen was not a capacitive touch surface, but I had a similar issue with my computer. As I moved between my tablet and my laptop, I forgot that the screen was not touch-sensitive.<br/><br/>I watched several movies through popular streaming services and enjoyed the quality of the videos. The sound was a bit lackluster, and I found headphones improved that limitation quite easily. I changed the mode to gaming mode and plugged my handheld gaming console into the USB port via USB-C and enjoyed the larger/portable screen.  Similar to the video viewing experience, I enjoyed a lag-free gaming session. However, I did not like how the gaming mode changed the imagery to a more blueish hue. Instead, I turned it back to movie mode, and found the imagery more vibrant and warm.<br/><br/>If I had a few wishes for the screen, I would have liked a stand-alone volume toggle that was not linked to the single button and more powerful speakers. Despite the request, I believe that the company created an amazing device and the OSD button/menu tree was well laid out and easy to navigate. I was pleased that they included the screen protectors and found the small bubbles beneath the screen protector did not detract from my viewing/streaming. Whether you wish to add an extra screen to your desktop, to a laptop, for a standard home gaming system, or for a portable gaming session, this extra screen will not let you down.</span>

<span>I tried my best to do a lot of research before buying a portable monitor. I was debating on getting one of the dual ones that attach to your computer and swivel out on the sides, or a single monitor for a lower price and bigger screen. I saw a lot of positive reviews on this one and the company's customer service, so I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Right off the bat, it's lightweight and the feel and materials are of good quality. The magnetic cover which also folds out and functions as a stand is stable and not flimsy. The screen quality is just right for what I use it for (Portable non-office setup for work, and casual gaming). I can't comment much on the speakers of the monitor since I always use the sound from my laptops, or connect it to a portable speaker anyway, but when testing the sound from the monitor, it seemed fine to me. I was super glad that it not only works with my company laptop (2019 MBP with USB-C), but I also wanted the flexibility to be able to use it with my older personal laptop (2015 MBP that only has USB-A, Thunderbolt 2, and HDMI, yeah it's old but I love this laptop lol). I was afraid that it would not be compatible since my personal laptop doesn't have USB-C. But this monitor worked just fine with it's USB-A to USB-C cable and HDMI to Mini HDMI cable. So when traveling, I can easily take this with me without hassle and not have to worry about plugging it into an outlet regardless of whichever laptop I use. I can still plug it into the wall to free up a USB-A port, and I've even tried it with a USB hub connected to my laptop and it still gets power when connected to a hub (also connected was a mouse and keyboard when testing). Customer Service was super quick to reply when I inquired about a complimentary Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter that I saw offered, as well as a free accessory of choice out of a few different options they give you after you receive your order (travel case, portable folding monitor stand, lightning cable accessory, and I think a longer HDMI cable option). I chose the portable folding monitor stand, and it's a great accessory if I don't feel like using the foldable stand that already comes with it or if I want it a little higher. Thank you Cocopar for the great product and service!</span>

<span>I am greatly impressed by KYY's commitment to customer service. My experience with the original monitor's power-up issue occurred just after the 1 year warranty had expired, so I had not contacted KYY directly about a replacement. Upon seeing my review they reached out, and once it was clear that the monitor was having problems receiving power (NOT a cable issue), they offered to send me a new monitor! It came so quickly that I was not back yet from a vacation, so I was only able today to plug in the new monitor and it was a seamless plug and play. I love my HP Spectre laptop, but it is a more compact size, and when I work in my "outside office" in the summer I really need the extra screen real estate that the KYY monitor provides. Since the HP Spectre has thunder ports (Type C - full function ports) I am able to use that quickest and easiest method to both power and send signal to the KYY external monitor. I have attached pictures showing the KYY Type C full function port with connector (provided by KYY) and a picture of that cable plugged into my computer. As soon as the connection was complete the KYY logo came up and then immediately my main computer screen was mirrored. My final picture shows both simultaneously with the KYY Monitor as a second screen.<br/><br/>Based on the customer service follow-up I would definitely recommend this monitor, and the company that makes it.<br/>-------------------------------------<br/>First Review:  This was my first (and perhaps only!) portable monitor I've ever purchased and I was pleased by the plug-and-play set up and picture quality. After a few months however the HDMI connector into the monitor, which was a common USB socket, became loose and it was difficult to keep the connection. Any slight motion that moved the cord and the connection was lost. But later that year I bought a new computer with a thunder-port and this summer when I needed the external monitor I plugged it in that way and everything worked great! Unfortunately the next day when I plugged my computer in the exact same way the monitor was not showing the signal, and instead gave me a 'power saving' error message before it shut down. After extensive troubleshooting and referencing the manual and user questions on Amazon I concluded that it was a power issue - the monitor was not getting power through the thunderport. I tried various methods, from using the separate power cable plugged into my computer, to plugging into an outlet directly. When nothing worked, I used the tech support email listed in the manual (and here on Amazon) 'support@kyytech.com', and send a description of my problem, asking for any assistance they could offer on a solution. Over two weeks later and I haven't received any response. Not even a 'we're busy and will get back to you later' automatic email.<br/>So. Anybody want a nice looking doorstop in the original packaging? selling it cheap.</span>

<span>I love this unit. Have had it for about two months now and I'm always finding new uses for it. It works great to take on camping trips - just plug your phone in, and you can have a movie night. Need a second monitor for working at home? Just one cable plugs into my Macbook Pro for power and signal and I'm off to the races. I have raspberry pis all over the house, and now I don't have to move them to debug them - I can just plug in this monitor wherever they are, plug in a wireless mouse/keyboard combo and I'm fixing them. And then the main reason I bought this - I have a tablet holder and place this screen right above my Rane One (DJ controller) for when I'm DJing - so my laptop can live off to the right in case I need a mouse and keyboard to download a song real quick - but right in front of me is just a screen and my DJ controls.<br/><br/>The brightness leave a little to be desired, but the quality seems to be good. A good USB-C thunderbolt/displayport cable can set you back $50+ alone and this unit appears to have come with a good one. I can also use the HDMI and power ports for older electronics.<br/><br/>I know there are a lot of similar options on Amazon for a monitor like this. All I can say it that for a brand I've never heard of, this unit is really cool and I haven't had any issues as of yet.</span>

<span>I was looking for a portable screen to make travel easier and loved the idea of a screen in case. Moreover, I also wanted a screen that could do more than just be used for my laptop, while not breaking the bank.<br/>I have tried this on my laptop, tablet and phone (Samsung), and it worked perfectly. I then decided to try it on our old Wii, with an HDMI adapter...I think my children are the most excited about this working. I didn't need it to, was merely interested in whether it would work. Needless to say, they have plans, but I have already told them, "me first!" 😜<br/>I am happy with the quality of screen, I honestly don't require hi-def graphics, so it looks just fine to me. It is not touchscreen, but I wasn't trying to purchase one with a touchscreen. I have not yet tweaked any setting, but will look whether I even need to later. Read some negative reviews on viewing angle, to be honest, I don't know what the issue is. The angle options are perfect for me. Besides which, it is a second screen and not my main screen.<br/>I don't like the short cables though, but that is a common problem with most electronics. This is something I wish manufacturers in general would change, but they always default to what works out cheaper for them. In normal operation; sitting next to my laptop, they work, but in any other application, having longer cables would be nicer. Fortunately, I have longer cables for more options.<br/>As for the quality and build, looks good right now and I love that mine came with a screen protector. We'll see how it holds up over time and I will certainly update as time goes by. So far, I love it!</span>

<span>I got this for my to use with her laptop for school. She had never used a second screen before, but now can't live without it. It also easily fits in her North Face Crestone computer bag, along with all her school stuff, for working on the go while traveling. It does require a wall plug for power, but that's not a deal-breaker.<br/><br/>When she starts working again, it will be so useful, as she will be working on the go a lot.</span>

<span>Using as an external monitor for Macbook Pro 16. Very portable for on the go, screen is reasonably sharp and bright. Of course, cannot 100% match retina display quality but close enough to not be annoying if you are picky about screen quality. After trial and error with multiple type c cables, if you want to run the external monitor using a single cable to provide both power and video, purchase a Type C 3.1 Gen 2 cable.</span>

<span>I really love this set up. Functionally it being attached to my laptop itself is great - I had a standalone travel monitor and disliked the extra space needed to use it. This makes it a lot easier to travel with and the set up is extremely easy and the quality of image is perfect for daily working tasks. I want to love this so much! BUT it won't stay glued/stuck together. I've had to reinstall/attach two magnets because the stickiness didn't hold. And now the metal plate on the monitor that attaches has become detached and won't hold causing the monitor to be uneven but more so causing me worry it won't stay on. I've used the supplied extra sticky dots for the magnets as well as the metal plate it just doesn't seem to hold.... I'll probably have to superglue the metal plate back onto the monitor. I'm annoyed but going to try to make it work.</span>

<span> I was looking for a portable monitor, and I needed a device that provides various features. On the one hand, I need something lightweight enough for travel and can connect via USB. On the other hand, I want a monitor that provides a clear display, with colors that are just as true as my primary monitor.<br/>This balance can be hard to achieve.<br/><br/>So, I came up with this portable monitor.<br/>To begin with, it’s very well designed. Considering the mid-tier price point, the fact that the screen is constructed with IPS technology is awe-inspiring. It’s not every day that you see an affordable portable monitor with this wide angle of view.<br/>Another thing I appreciate is the USB-C connection. I understand why some people might be bummed out about that design choice, but the fact is that USB-C is the way of the future. Furthermore, USB-C is just plain faster than USB-A. In the absence of a second HDMI cable, it’s the best way of delivering high-quality video in real-time.<br/><br/>One thing I really didn’t like was the fact that the magnetic bracket is strong enough to support the screen. Essentially, you need to keep it on a desk or table. On the other hand, the magnetic adhesive pieces dry quickly, allowing me to use my monitor without waiting overnight.<br/>All in all, this monitor is a sharp, clear display that weighs next to nothing and is easy to install. It works with just about any computer and can be rotated for use in presentations. I consider it a great bargain, especially if I need good color clarity from any angle.<br/><br/>Here’s a quick look at how the Duex Pro stacks up from a technical perspective.<br/>* 12.5-inch screen<br/>* 1080p IPS LCD display<br/>* 270-degree rotation<br/>* Compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Chrome OS, and Android<br/>* Measures 14 x 9.5 x 0.5 inches<br/>* Weighs 2 pounds<br/><br/>Here’s an overview of what I liked – and didn’t like – about this portable monitor.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Compatible with all laptops<br/>* Wide viewing angle<br/>* Easy to mount<br/>* Rotates to face forward or backward<br/>* Lightweight and portable<br/>* Can be used with multiple laptops<br/>* Upgradable to 3 screen<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Needs to be supported by a desk or table<br/>* Works best with USB-C</span>

<span>It is great to have an extra monitor, but probably should have gone with the 12" monitor. I have a tendency to try and get the most bang for my buck, and so I went for this 14" monitor. Unfortunately, it seems that the weight of the monitor is too much for the magnets. When the monitor is extended as it is supposed to do, it is dragging the magnets down the back of the computer monitor where it is attached.<br/>Also, the hinges seem to be a bit flimsy for this weight. I'm trying to be careful with it, but I am waiting for the day this thing cracks and falls apart.</span>

<span>This review is my first impression and it’s a good one. I ordered this portable monitor for when I have to work out of a hotel room. I move and travel quite often and miss my extra monitors when doing so.<br/><br/>So when I saw extra discounts during Prime Day, I had to order. True to word the screen is a nice matte finish which is easy on my eyes. I had been thinking I might need to buy a new cable to use to connect my laptop but I actually did not. It came with two types of cables- usb-c and hdmi/mini. It also came with its own case/cover to protect the screen which doubles as a stand. The monitor itself is very thin and super portable.<br/><br/>I’m pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to set it up &amp; how quickly I was able to start using it. I definitely have a harder time setting up my normal monitors. It came with a host of instructions if needed but it was all pretty intuitive.<br/><br/>The packaging was good, as it was well cushioned.</span>

<span>Upddated!  I was at first slightly disappointed that I would have to plug my screen into an outlet to power it, but the amazing customer service people mentioned that I could simply plug the power cord into a USP port on my computer. Now I am portable again and thrilled with my purchase!  I edited photos using it a day ago and it was spectacular.  I like it better than the screen on my macbook pro!<br/><br/>My mid 2015 MacBook Pro's display started developing flickering horizontal lines and non-flickering vertical lines.  I know it won't be long until the screen is completely unusable.  I wasn't willing to replace the machine as I paid $800 for a new motherboard last year and I really like the older operating system as I can keep my Lightroom and Photoshop versions.  I decided to try adding an external monitor and this one really works beautifully.  II love having a matte screen again, too! I just stand this beautiful, thin monitor right on top of the laptop's screen and all is well!  The only disappointment is that the hdmi cord doesn't work to run the screen and I have to plug the new monitor into an outlet while using.  Maybe I missed that in the description, but I thought it would not need extra power.</span>

<span>I travel internationally often so I decided to purchase a second monitor for my laptop since my desktop setup at home has dual monitors.  This portable monitor does not disappoint!  Comes with the cables you need and the screen is bright and adjustable.  I mainly chose this monitor because it has the ability to connect to vesa-based stands but the flip cover that comes with the monitor that also doubles as stand is very helpful.  The design is light and slim - perfect for packing in the same computer bag/messenger bag you use for your laptop.  If you have a usb-c port on your laptop, that is all you will need!  For reference, one of the photos I uploaded shows 4 monitors.  The one in the back is my 49 inch desktop monitor, then the one to the left is the standard iPad, the laptop on the right has a 14 inch screen and the monitor in the middle of it all is the one purchased and reviewed.  As you can see, the size is perfect.  Slightly bigger than my 14 inch screen laptop and much bigger than the standard iPad.  I also included a photo for size reference when compared to things like a mouse, pen and standard iPad. Lastly, I wanted to show just how thin the monitor is compared to a regular iPad, both laying flat on a table with their smart covers open and flipped to the back.  As you can, the monitor is very thin.  With a 1 month long trip in Iceland, Dubai for New Years and then Africa for Spring 2023, this is absolutely the best option to be able to travel abroad while maintaining a productive (yet portable) workspace!</span>

<span>I expected I would need to make some sacrifices somewhere for this price, whether that was in picture quality, maybe delayed responsiveness, or at least in how difficult it would be to set up. None of that was true though. This is everything I could have dreamed of for a portable computer monitor. I carry it with me everywhere in its protective case, which apparently works great as it has not been damaged at all. The picture quality and response time feels exactly the same as I get with my high-end monitors at home. And I can set it up in 20 seconds. I take it with me to the library to do work, and all I have to do is pull it out, flip it open, plug in the hdmi to my computer and a usb for charging it. It doesn't even need to use an extra power outlet! It's seriously so impressive, especially for this price.</span>

<span>At first I was peeved, the monitor powered up but wanted to turn off sometimes then turn back on, and over and over. I emailed customer service about it. They got back to me in less than 24 hours and suggested that I should use the power cord via the lower usb-c since I had my Android phone in the upper usb-c spot and it just wasn't getting enough power to the monitor. That worked and so far all has been great. It's a pretty cool monitor and seems sturdy and well made. The case is somewhat protective but is not the most reliable stand.</span>

<span>Got this travel monitor for work after trying out several others and returning them. The stand is perfect and doesn't fall over like other monitors i tried. I also like the size is equal to my 15 in laptop, i hated larger ones that were bulky and larger than my regular screen! obsessed with this thing!</span>

<span>You know how it goes if you're one of those laptop-carrying road warriors.  I'm always working off one screen while using my company-provided laptop, and it's so slow switching between open apps, copy/paste, and switch back.  I thought I would risk buying this little portable monitor, and I'm glad I dd.<br/><br/>This monitor is easy to set up, easy to adjust, and it's plug-and-play.  It has two C-Type connector plug and one mini-HDMI connector plug.  It gets it's power over a C-Cable, through either a wall-plug powered USB-C to USB-A cable, or if your laptop has a C-connector, then you can use another provided C-to-C cable to plug the monitor right into your laptop, and that powers up the monitor.  You can also get your video signal over a HDMI to mini-HDMI cable connected to your laptop, but since it doesn't provide power, you will still need one of the C-connectors plugged in to provide power.<br/><br/>The screen is bright and colorful, and has many possible adjustments.  It only weights about a pound, and it's thinner than my slim Dell laptop.  For the money, it's a great little monitor.</span>

<span>I was afraid this was going to be one of those cheap TFT displays where the blacks have that backlight dark gray color. But the image quality is very sharp. I played some videos and didn't really notice any tearing running at 1080p 60hz. I have this connected using the included HDMI mini to HDMI cable and powered by the single USB C to A cable to the power supply. The image quality is similar to a modern premium laptop display.<br/><br/>The reading stand is good for a desk environment, but don't expect it to be good at adjusting viewing angles or balancing on your lap. Speakers are very poor sound quality. Its good to have in a pinch but I wouldn't use them regularly.<br/><br/>I'll update this review if the display ever fails but so far, first impressions are good and would definitely recommend it.</span>

<span>I originally purchased this monitor to act as a second screen for my laptop when I travel.  However, I have started using it for gaming as well.<br/><br/>I love the fact that it is plug-and-play and can be powered by a standard USB port.  It comes with all the necessary cables (USB-C to USB-C; HDMI to HDMI Mini; USB-C to USB-A), a built-in kick stand, and a nice storage pouch.  It is very light-weight so it can be easily carried around, and with the built-in speakers, it isn't necessary to connect external ones.  The speakers aren't very powerful, which is understandable due to it's thin design.  A 3.5mm headphone jack is available to use.<br/><br/>It is very simplistic in that there aren't any display settings other than brightness.  You do have the option to connect up to 2 devices at once (one on HDMI Mini and the other on USB-C), and clicking the power button allows you to switch between them.<br/><br/>Overall, I am really glad I purchased this monitor.  I'll definitely get some use out of it.</span>

<span>This is my second small external monitor but my previous one was with another brand I wanted to try something new because my other screen broke within a year. This one has been very comparable so far with the quality + super lightweight, easy for transporting around for someone who travels a lot and still needs a second monitor that is easy to set up on the go!<br/><br/>They also provide an additional warranty which was a MUST for me because my other screen broke within a year with the other brand and their warranty was already up.<br/><br/>So far I would def recommend this monitor!</span>

<span>It can't be any more simple than the plug and play that this monitor offers. It comes with any necessary cables to do just that including USB-C (all in video, audio, power) and mini HDMI.<br/>Part of the reason I was drawn to this monitor is that it comes with a case! I really wasn't interested in purchasing an expensive travel monitor that I would need to spend additional money for to get a case to protect it when traveling. This way, I can place the monitor in my travel bag, along with the computer and any accessories.<br/>I also like that this monitor does NOT  have a touchscreen.<br/>Gets the second monitor job done for travel.<br/>Recommended!</span>

<span>I have a MacBook Pro 16" and have gotten incredibly used to having a second monitor... which means I was stuck in my basement office to work... effectively meaning there was no point to the laptop and I would never see the sun again. ;) That's not how it turned out, though!<br/><br/>I'm brand new to portable monitors, and I must admit that Amazon has a nearly overwhelming number of options, especially in the 15.6~15.8" range. I did learn, though, that the lag time (measured in milliseconds) is a key thing to keep in mind... and what was funny is that as I read about features, and then explored price, I kept coming back to this same Upperizon portable monitor... it's a good size (15.6"), a nice matte finish that doesnt give a ton of glare, comes with a magnetic cover, and then the key thing it is one of the lowest lag times at 3ms... it says it cant go up to 5ms in lag, but that sounds the slowest it can go, thankfully.<br/><br/>It's simple... if you're perhaps on a budget, but for sure would benefit from a portable monitor, I urge you to dig into this one... from at least what I learned in my looking, this monitor seemed to check off all the main things I was seeking, including price.<br/><br/>Really the only thing I have noticed was that when I am outside and it's sunny out, the screen does appear dimmed slightly, but it's an IPS display which is a technology that can stand up to sunlight for the most part anyhow... just overall I would recommend this portable display. Sure it's not the most feature-rich one out there, but I tell you... if you just need a great portable monitor and a fair price to go with it, this is the one.<br/><br/>Included with your purchase is also a free gift, which is cool... you can pick from a foam sleeve-case for the device, an Anker Power Bank, and a couple other options. Totally free; they didnt even charge me shipping. I also have to say that I wrote them and they replied within 24 hours, which is impressive for sure.</span>

<span>I got these since I'll be traveling a lot in the next few months, and hauling my full size monitors around is impracticable, but working off just the screen on my laptop just doesn't work for my job.  I've only had them (2) a week, so I can't speak to longevity, but so far I'm really impressed.  They're just the right size (ie: the largest they could be and still fit in my computer bag - roughly the same dimensions of a large laptop), set up in about 2 seconds flat, and have great screen resolution.  The speakers also seem good, though I don't use them since I prefer a headset.  There's a card included in the packaging where you can order one of a list of accessories for free, as well.  I'll be getting the padded sleeves, but they have other stuff available as well.  The only downside is that the description is a little confusing - it describes the power cable as a "charging" cable, but it's not.  I couldn't find clarification on that in the description, but was correct in my suspicions - this isn't a chargeable device.  However, you CAN power it off your laptop with the right connections, and run for a short while on the laptop's battery (I got about an hour running 2 auxiliary screens on top of the laptop itself).  Overall, I'm very pleased, especially for the price.</span>

<span>As a software Engineer that codes on the go, this monitor is great. Perfect size, it’s long af but still fits in my laptop backpack after I shove it. Matte screen which I prefer. The magnetic case is better than others I have compared it with. They sent me a free stand thingy so I can do vertical which is a plus. I use a MacBook Air 2020 and I just have to plug it in and go to display settings to adjust orientation and the side I want it on (left or right or above). Pro tip, make sure you plug it into the usb c port until you hear a click, I thought it came dead when I got it but it was because I didn’t plug it in all the way on the laptop and on the monitor. Just needs that one cord doesn’t need the charger to be connected at the same time. However my brightness I have up on the monitor so it drains battery quickly on laptop just fyi.</span>
