<span>My coworker kept locking the shared laptop in his tool cart.  I bought this so after getting the shared laptop out I could shame him by leaving this in it's place.  It took 3 three Disney Princess Style Laptop swaps to finally get it through my coworkers thick skull that sequestering a shared tool is not appropriate.  -  Highly recommended!

<span>I don't have a lot of noisy toys for my son. We are very Montessori. I bought this for my son after buying it as a gift for one of his little friends because he loved it . He loves to listen and say the words. It's been a great help with his letter learning and abc's. He's 2!</span>

<span>We got this for my son when he turned 3. He’s almost 6, and still plays with it. We don’t give our kids much screen time, but since this is interactive I don’t mind him using it for extended periods. He didn’t understand a lot of the games at first but he still loved playing with it. Now that he’s reading, some of the games are too easy but still engaging for him and he likes to ‘make mischief’ by spelling his name backwards or something. (Yeah, he’s sheltered lol). His 3 year old sister doesn’t understand it at all but loves finding the letters for her name and spelling it out, or even just trying the games even though she has no idea what they are. The screen IS limited but it hasn’t slowed either of them down with it. Highly recommend if your kid is willing to spend a little time learning how it works. 4-5 is probably the target age range.</span>

<span>Bought this for my now 18 month old grandson who is always trying to use our laptops when we are! While it has what we might think of as an old-fashioned screen, it's fine for little ones. There are tons of learning games on this, and it keeps my grandson enthralled. I wasn't sure if he'd be old enough for the touch-screen games in "tablet" mode, but he leaned those pretty quickly. Tablet mode is really good for the car and has kept him amused when he otherwise may have been screaming!</span>

<span>We lost the old model so I got a new one since my 1.5 year old loved playing with it (even if he didn't quite understand it yet he still loved to press the buttons and hear Scout)<br/><br/>The difference is night and day. It's sleeker, has a backlit screen, is immensely more interactive (for example you can reply to Scout or Violet's emails with emojis-- so cute)<br/><br/>I had the green model before and now have the pink one. My old green model only had Scout talking and now this has mostly Scout and Violet too-- which I think really cool because I want my son to be exposed to girl and boy characters equally (even though she isn't too different from Scout)<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about it-- it's so well manufactured.<br/><br/>I was a little worried since this was was significantly cheaper than the older model so I assumed there would be some drawbacks but nope it's a thousand times better-- it feels sturdier than the old one</span>

<span>Update: Started glitching like crazy right before our return window closed. Unfortunately, we returned it.<br/><br/>Prior to the Leap Pad, we had a kids kindle 7. Compared the kindle, the Leap Pad has way more parental controls. This is a plus for me. The kids kindle unlimited content was showing my kid all kinds of stuff despite me explicitly blocking certain key words. The Leap Pad will allow your child to use Leap Search which connects to the internet. You can pre approve websites in the parental controls and even block certain areas of a website. I approved Outschool, PBS Kids, Lalilo, Explorify, etc. If you approve Outschool you also have to approve Zoom and log in. The only downside of the leap pad is that you cannot add “normal” apps. You can only buy apps through the Leap Frog store. They are priced similarly to what a game cartridge would be for the old Leapsters. You can also buy shows like Octonauts and RescueBots for the about the same price as a DVD. Or you can pre approve Netflix on Leap Search. The stylus on this is awesome when playing games, especially Leap Frog Academy. (The LF Academy is similar to ABC Mouse, it is not the equivalent of Amazon Kids Unlimited.) The built in stand is a bonus. The battery is garbage, it lasts about an hour fully charged. Bottom line, if you’re looking for an inexpensive kids tablet that’s easy to lock down, this is it. Screen quality/graphics are actually clearer than the kindle 7.</span>

<span>My 3 year old likes his leap start tablet. It is very interactive, and I feel happy that he's learning too. It was a little difficult to set up at first but eventually I was able to connect it to my MacBook to download the books. I think its pretty stupid that you have to buy the books then have to go on a computer to download the software. Another downside is that my son struggles to use the pen because he is left handed and the pen in attached in an awkward position.</span>

<span>I love it. My son enough it so much.  I wish the volume was louder, the house has to be in complete silence to hear it. And I wish it came with more books. But overall it was a perfect gift for my 3 year old.</span>

<span>Love how it works, perfect for my 4 year old daughter before she starts school.<br/>- Always seems to read buttons correctly and easily.<br/>- The point on the pen is a bit sharp and leaves little dents on he pages.<br/>- The books are slightly sturdier than a regular book.  Seem to be coated.<br/>- Would be so much better if I didn't have to plug it into my laptop (gotta find I first) to download the audio.<br/>- At least the two books that came with it work without a download.  Major plus when you have a 4 year old waiting to play with it.<br/>- Pricey for sure.  Wish the books were cheaper, I would have bought a bunch more.  $40 for 4 books is so silly.  Was able to get the player part for $35 but noticed the price fluctuating up to $70 in the following weeks. Was originally getting the one with the little digital screen on it but read reviews and saw that it basically only had one or two animations per book.  Would rather have a screen less toy for my daughter anyway.</span>

<span>We are obsessed with our leapfrog 3D learning system!!<br/><br/>We have collected 30 books so far, and this is our second purchase of this system. I purchased one 2 yrs ago and it stopped working, so it was time to replace it. After the other one lasting 2 yrs, I have to say it's worth the additional $50 for the next couple of years.<br/><br/>The system requires batteries, and I highly recommend rechargeable batteries. Just trust me on that one.<br/><br/>How does this system work? Well you need a laptop or a computer so you can download the book audios to the system. There is not a ton of storage so you cant download all of your books at a time. You can have about 6-7 books on your system at a time, depending on the amount of storage each of the books takes up, bc it varys. The 3D books take up way more storage then the story books.<br/><br/>With that being said, I usually trade out books once a week. I have my daughter pick the ones she wants for the week. Then we change them out the following week.<br/><br/>I homeschool my daughter, and I cant tell you how much I love these books! My daughter always gets excited to pick her books for the week and I never have to make her use her leapfrog. She plays on her leapfrog daily. It makes me so proud of her, that she enjoys learning. I am very thankful that leapfrog made this system.<br/><br/>Tips:<br/><br/>I admit it took some getting use to when I first downloaded the system a couple of years ago. But once I got in a good routine of downloading and undownloading the books, it became quick and easy.<br/><br/>One book I purchased from the UK and we live in the US. Well I didnt know the books were different. (Makes sense though.) There is a tab so you can download your UK books and US books. You just have to switch back and forth while downloading. And yes you can have UK and US books downloaded at the same time on this system.<br/><br/>My critique to the company would be to include better instructions for different downloading methods and other issues that can arise while setting up this system. I had to go through trial and error and there were times where I was so fed up and frustrated. The frustration can be avoided if you could provide more detailed instructions, information and troubleshooting for problems that can arise.<br/><br/>Overall, even with the hurdles of when you first recieve this system it's worth it in the long run. Getting to see your child(ren) enjoy learning is amazing. And this learning system helps to encourage that.</span>

<span>This is a great learning tool. The screen highlights sight words and animations them. It can read items by the syllable, word, or sentence. You can download up to 10/12 books at one time due to the limit of preloaded memory. But books are delectable/reloadable per the app. A computer is required to upload the books data to the tablets hard drive it cannot be down with an iPad/android tablet as those are not compatible with the system. The only negative thing I didn’t like were that the pages of the book weren’t a hard plastic like most leapfrog electronic books, they are made from paper so for a toddler it could be easy damaged and the cord attached to the pen could be a bit longer to make it easier to navigate the pages.</span>

<span>It’s nice, but a non-3D seems like it would be fine considering the limited number of 3D books I’ve found available, &amp; I’ve seen that Leap Frog has products that are more like tablets available these days, so maybe these devices are a little outdated now? Just this grandma’s opinion.  Our grandson (5 y.o.) likes it pretty well anyway, so that’s probably the better measure of how good it is.<br/><br/>We replaced one that was not functioning anymore (the old one couldn’t connect to computer even with a new cord &amp; was out of warranty).<br/><br/>You need access to a computer, to create a Leap Frog account and then download the Leap Frog software onto the computer in order to finally download the books onto the device using the micro USB cord, supplied. You need to buy the books to insert into the device for the cold to use. (The child can insert them also, depending on their abilities).<br/><br/>There is limited space for the downloaded book data, so it seemed to me that if you owned the entire Leap Frog book collection, you’d have to swap some out periodically or just keep the favorites in place. If I remember correctly, we put 4-6 books on this, and had a little room left. Sorry, I don’t recall the exact number and don’t have access to the device to check at this time.  I imagine the amount of data used varies from book to book. 6 of these books may be  plenty for most kids I guess.</span>

<span>This product is such a pain to set up. You have to have an adapter on your computer to set it up. You have to upload every book individually. Once we finally got it set up my 3 year old didn’t even like it. We are going to keep trying because it’s actually really cool. I definitely think she can learn from the product. I different books and games are neat.</span>

<span>My kids have had 3 of these and they’re a must have in our house. My oldest got one when he was about 6 months old. He loved it so much that by the time him and his little brother were old enough to really appreciate them fully, one just wasn’t enough to have anymore. I had to buy a second one so they could both have one to use. They had two going for a while until the original one finally broke from being thrown around too much. It lasted then about 3 1/2 years though so that’s great for us since my boys are pretty destructive when it comes to their toys. I just bought another one and now they have two going again.<br/>I love these so much because they help with learning your letters and numbers. There are a bunch of little games your kids can play on it and it seems to have endless fun going on. The best part for me though is that it has a set of contacts being dad, mom, grandpa, grandma and a friend. You can input your own numbers for whatever contact and then they can pretend to call them and it says the number they’re calling. If you’ve input your own personal phone numbers, your kids can memorize your phone numbers. My 4 and 2 year olds know my number, their dads number and their grampa’s number! It’s a great skill for them to have in case of a real life emergency. Just for that reason alone, I think this is a great toy. There is so much learning potential with this and it stands up really well to being thrown around. I will he buying these as long as my kids show interest in them and for however long I need to as they end up breaking on us. So far though, having to replace just one in 3 1/2 years is a sign of great quality. A must have toy everybody!!</span>
