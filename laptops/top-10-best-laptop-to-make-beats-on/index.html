<span>So far I have had no complaints. It was very easy to set up. The battery life is more than adequate. The biggest thing for me was only adjusting to the operating system. Until now, I have only used windows laptops for the last twenty plus years. Before that I had an Apple. It's been easy so far, though I still have difficulties with right-clicking with the trac-pad. I have easily avoided this by using a wireless mouse.</span>

<span>I got this Chromebook to replace my last Samsung 11"  Chromebook which I had for about 3.5 years.<br/>The Acer spin 11 was pretty good and I liked it alot. The keyboard worked much better than my Samsung.<br/>That thing has a mind of it's own, I think. You type one word and the Chromebook types up something else..<br/>Expect for this one small problem and it started just after a month or so after I had purchased this.<br/>Once awhile it wouldn't turn back on after I had idling for whatever time it took to be in power saving mode but<br/>It wouldn't turn back on, everytime when this happens I have to press the side power button for about ten seconds to turn it off first then, I'd give it a minute before hitting the same power button again. I hold it just long enough to see the blue light goes on next to power button you just pressed. Oh just out of curiosity, what does the power button do located right top corner? Cause it won't shut the computer off or on. No matter how long you hold the button down. Anyway back to main issue, just awhile I left the Chromebook to visit UPS store and came back, tried to reboot my Chromebook as usual but this time it won't turn on. I tried unplug &amp; replug all the cables like power, HDMI. Man I only had this for about 4-5 months and this happens. My warranty expired as well.... I'm very disappointed.</span>

<span>I did a lot of research as to what to get for my kids to replace their aging and damaged Samsung Tab A's. We decided that it was time to go to a Chromebook so that they could get more repetition with a standard keyboard and GoogleOS. They are still able to download all the PlayStore apps that they had on their tablets, but now with better hardware and longer support.<br/>This model has 64GB of storage (with SD card option), so thats a huge upgrade. The RAM is 4GB, which is more than most cheap tablets these days, and you can tell. Its a LOT snappier than the Galaxys.<br/>The 2in1 flip with the screen is my kids favorite part! They can use it like a "real computer" and then flip it to make a huge tablet screen instead. Much bigger than the 8" screen they had before.<br/>For an entry level chromebook, these are sturdy, snappy, and cheap! I dare you to find something better for preteens at this price point!<br/>NOTE: some of the reviews here complain about the speaker quality/power. This was one of the only things I was weary about when I finally committed to this unit. Those reviews are DEAD WRONG. The speakers are GREAT on these Chromebooks. The quality is clear, and they are louder than both of my other laptops and tablets. Playing videos through YouTube at 1/2 volume is much louder than the max of my other units. Don't let the "terrible speaker" reviews sway you.</span>

<span>This was a purchase for my son to replace a slightly older model of the same brand, the 8th gen.  The older model we handed down to another family member because it still runs perfectly. We just wanted a little more space, the 8th gen was only a 32gb hard drive, and this new 9th gen has 64gb which should be just right for his needs for some years.  Every device we own from this brand, gets used to its fullest potential or passed to someone in the family when we upgrade.  If we discover my son needs 256gb well, this one will probably replace another even older 6th gen someone in the fam is still using!  That one still works great too though! Zero issues.<br/><br/>Amazing quality always!  This iPad runs smoothly, the sound, video and image quality is great, and the battery life is great.  Most importantly, this brand offers built in security for peace of mind! It is also very reasonably priced for the excellent quality you get.  We are happy customers!</span>

<span>I bought the iPad 9 because I had decided it was time to upgrade from my iPad Air 2 that I bought about 8 years ago. Honestly, while I could have gotten a different brand that cost less, I was impressed that my tablet had lasted so long. The battery had started to noticeably drain faster but that was the only problem I was having with it. After seeing how well Apple makes their products, I decided to stick with them when making my purchase. So far, the iPad 9 is performing well for me. I enjoy the screen resolution/response and it's bigger than my previous tablet. I mostly watch YouTube, check emails, and use it for things that my phone's screen is too small for. But, I've been wanting to get started with digital drawing and I feel that this tablet will be enough for me to get my feet wet. Maybe I can get another 8 years before upgrading again.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>I got a replacement and it's exactly what I wanted! Lightweight and the learning curve isn't so bad if you've never used a chromebook before, it only took me a few days to get used to it.

<span>I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.<br/><br/>This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for "M.2 mounting screws" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.<br/><br/>Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for "disk" in start menu and hitting "create and format hard disk partitions".<br/><br/>Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for "Create installation media for Windows" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.<br/><br/>Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search "asus L210 drivers" then hit "support"). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.<br/><br/>Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 "battery saver" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.</span>

<span>I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.<br/><br/>QUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.<br/><br/>PROS --<br/>Incredible Price to Performance Ratio<br/>Very well built, with no cheap parts<br/>Full-size, comfortable keyboard<br/>Small and lightweight<br/>Good design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)<br/>Full Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware<br/>Internal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot<br/>I could keep going... it's $200.<br/><br/>CONS --<br/>No backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)<br/>Some irksome viewing angle problems<br/>Maddeningly little built in storage<br/>Almost too little RAM<br/>Realtek Wifi Card (explained why in the 'Linux' section)<br/><br/>I've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):<br/><br/>Introduction (above)<br/>Weight &amp; Build<br/>Keyboard and Trackpad<br/>Screen<br/>Battery<br/>Performance (including Gaming)<br/>Webcam<br/>Speakers &amp; Sound<br/>Software<br/>Linux<br/>Other (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)<br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.<br/><br/>The second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.<br/><br/>With that being said, let me get into the details.<br/><br/>WEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.<br/><br/>It's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.<br/><br/>The screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.<br/><br/>Another note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.<br/><br/>Also, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.<br/><br/>The trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>SCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.<br/><br/>There's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.<br/><br/>BATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.<br/><br/>Side note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.<br/><br/>Well, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.<br/><br/>I LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.<br/><br/>I was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.<br/><br/>WEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.<br/><br/>Of special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.<br/><br/>SPEAKERS &amp; SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.<br/><br/>If you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.<br/><br/>The headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.<br/><br/>LINUX - I'm not a super user when it comes to Linux. I do know enough to install and use it on a day-to-day basis, and for low-performance computers like this one, Linux is tantalizing. Unfortunately, the WiFi card in the system [as of 11/19/21] doesn't work with Linux and there doesn't seem to be any support on the horizon. Most people who need or prefer Linux have taken to using a USB WiFi antenna, an untenable inconvenience for most. Some people have been reporting switching out the NIC entirely, but I don't know enough to speak about that.<br/><br/>OTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.<br/><br/>It has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.<br/><br/>If you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.<br/><br/>During normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.<br/><br/>Side note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.<br/><br/>I like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.<br/><br/>Either way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>I bought this replace my laptop from 2016 which suddenly died. It was a great Dell laptop and cost half the price, but I figured it'd be worth it. I only use my laptop to watch youtube/netflix, and just browse the web. So I figured at $600 this would be more than enough, but it's been more of a hastle.<br/><br/>Firstly, the fan is pretty loud, and randomly revs up pretty significantly when I'm doing nothing more than watching a youtube video and scrolling thru reddit. It sounds like it's powering a small generator, and after awhile I have to shut if off because I'm afraid it'll over-heat.<br/><br/>Secondly, for no reason at all, it randomly restarts itself. In the weeks I've had it, its done this half a dozen times. No warning, no error message before OR after. The screen just goes black, restarts itself, and you're back at the startup screen, whatever you were doing now gone. It just did this now, which prompted me to write this review.<br/><br/>With everything going on, it's almost impossible to find another laptop without having to search for EXACTLY what you need, then wait for it to ship and HOPE its what you need. Too complicated to return, and not worth "repairing", I'm stuck with this $600 placeholder.  I just don't understand how this 2020 laptop at double the price is WAY WORSE than my old 2016 Dell, which never had fan or restarting issues. Buy at your own risk.<br/><br/>UPDATE 6-18-20, 5 days after the return windows closed, my laptop is now a $600 paperweight.  Suddenly, the Wi-Fi stopped working or detecting any networks. I googled it an apparently it's a common problem. No fix at home, I took it to a pc repair shop where the guy told me there's nothing he can do and I should return it, which is now impossible since the return Windows closed 5 days ago. The laptop has NO Ethernet port, so it's WI-FI only, which is now busted so no way to download or try to update or fix it online. Now I have to deal with the manufacturer and hope they can fix or replace it.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP, just over 30 days and it's bricked. $600 down the drain.<br/><br/>edit: 8-24-21, this POS is worse than ever, basically unusable. forget about ever worrying about A.I. taking over, because if this is what we have in 2021, there's no possible threat. I'd burn this thing if it didn't damage the environment.<br/><br/>edit almost june 2022 - POS is bricked, dead. pathetic computer, all I EVER did was watch netflix and surf sites like tmz and reddit, I never even MOVE it from where it permanently sits, hooked up to my t.v. HP needs to go out of business, what was once a AAA brand is now clearance-bin garbage.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY ANY HP PRODUCTS. Customer service is useless and ppl tend to sell laptops AS IF they're new in box, but they have removed them and messed around with internal settings and put their own cards and hard drives to "upgrade" it but this just VOIDS THE WARRANTY. Better off buying in-store where you can see it's sealed, new in box.</span>

<span>I bought this laptop to work from home in 2020 during the pandemic. It worked well - good speed, got the job done. I'd had some issues with it being finicky about coming on from time to time. If it was left open, sometimes you'd have to close it and reopen it to get the screen to light up. Other times, I had to hold the restart button and reboot it, even though it was just in sleep mode (clicking the mouse or hitting the space bar didn't get it to come on). This was a brand new (NOT refurbished) item.<br/><br/>Today, it turned on and was charging. At some point, I left the room and the screen fell asleep. When I tried to get it to come back on, it wouldn't wake up. It's making no sounds, has no lights on to indicate it's charging or functioning at all. I even plugged it into a different outlet that my Mac was plugged into (so I know it's working), and nothing. Seems this laptop has bit the dust after just TWO YEARS AND ONE MONTH. Absolutely unacceptable for an item I paid $650 for. I'm especially angry since the support window expired less than a month ago, so I have absolutely no recourse as far as having it fixed or replaced.<br/><br/>It was good while it lasted, but I'll stick with MacBooks from here on out. I only bought this one because I needed Windows for the job I had during the pandemic. What a disappointment.</span>

<span>This was a pretty good laptop for the price. The worst thing about it is the silver keys with letters marked in black, those are really hard to see from any angle but straight up. The function keys are extremely difficult to read. That's probably just a poor color choice on my part. It also runs a little hot, that can be a real problem over any fairly long period of time. It's a good backup to have if you make the mistake of buying a Lenovo.</span>

<span>This unit will not run monitors off of the USB-C port which annoys me greatly since it only does data but it works quite well otherwise. The problem started a few days after I started using it. When I would move the mouse to do what you do with a mouse the screen would starting jumping and acting like it lost sync and at times the screen would go blank. A chat with HP support that ran over several days ended with them asking me to send the unit in for repair and that is where it sits. I did hear they received it several days ago but nothing so far on the return or repair. No calls about not being able to duplicate my issue, nothing. I'm starting to wish I had returned it to Amazon and bought a better model.</span>

<span>This is my first Chromebook. I decided to dip my toe into the world of Chrome OS because I’m embarking on a long-term writing project using Google Docs, and I wanted a small, portable device with long battery life and a good keyboard. After some research, including reviews both on Amazon and on other  sites, I decided on the Lenovo Flex 5. New to Chromebooks, I admit I was very hesitant. A 3D animator and motion graphics artist by trade, I own several Windows 10 workstations and laptops, all of which have powerful CPUs, high end graphics cards, lots of ram and ample storage. I was therefore reluctant to purchase a computer that only had an i3 processor and 4GB ram. But after using the notebook for two months, I couldn't be more pleased.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Battery life: 8-10 hours with daily moderate use.<br/>1. Keyboard: For such a small device, the keyboard is surprisingly comfortable and quiet. Extra points for the nice backlit keys.<br/>2. Display: Sharp 1080 screen that is evenly lit. The touchscreen is very responsive.<br/>3. Size: Small footprint without feeling like you are sacrificing anything in the display or keyboard.<br/>4. Cost: At this price point, the Flex is hard to beat.<br/>5. Responsiveness: In my use (writing and surfing the web), the Chromebook has been very snappy, with no lag.<br/>6. Build quality: This Chromebook has an exceptionally solid feel.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The screen has a gloss finish that might bother some users due to glare or reflections. So far that has been a non-issue for me, but it is a fingerprint magnet.<br/>2. Swivel screen. I hardly swivel the screen to turn the Flex into a tablet since I use mine for writing and therefore want the keyboard. I’m reporting this as a con only because there have been reports of the screen attachment breaking after repeated flips. Such reports have made me a bit paranoid about switching to the tablet configuration.<br/>3. Webcam quality is not very good. I tried it once and probably won’t use it again.<br/>4. Bluetooth mouse. This is a criticism of Chrome OS in general, not the Flex in particular. I purchased a Logitech bluetooth mouse for my Flex. I had no trouble pairing it, and the forward/backward navigation works fine. But scrolling with the wheel while surfing the web is VERY frustrating. Pages scroll smoothly and then suddenly jump much further down, causing you to have to scroll back up to find your place. This aggressive scrolling is not unique to the Flex or to the Logitech mouse. It has been well documented as an issue with Chrome OS and bluetooth mice. It is truly my only major grievance in owning this Chromebook. Google apparently has better things to do and has ignored customer complaints about this for years. Fortunately, the Flex has a touch screen, so you can always forgo the mouse and simply scroll using the display.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I am extremely happy with my Lenovo Flex 5: nice keyboard, crisp display, terrific battery life, excellent build quality, and very attractive price point. But keep in mind that I’m using my Flex only for surfing the web and for writing in the cloud. I can’t comment on how well it handles other tasks, such as playing games. If you’re expecting tablet-like weight, you will be disappointed because it is considerably heavier than a tablet. Personally, I would rather have a well constructed Chromebook like this one than a flimsy, light one.</span>

<span>This is my first time using a chromebook so I don't have anything to paste to besides windows pcs. It took a bit of getting used to not having a right click or caps lock. But I got it so I could write on it like a tablet and it does just that! Tho I can't say it runs android programs terribly reliably. It has crashed literally every game I've downloaded on it at some point and freezes on my writing apps (of which there are no chrome os variants). But then again, phones and tablets also crash too so it's not like this is a complete deal breaker. I love how light it is and how well it responds to my usi stylus. Touch screen is smooth and the touch pad is flawless. Honestly the touch pad on this chromebook is more reliable and sensitive than any windows laptop touch pad I've ever used. The whole this is light and the screen bezel is minimal. Also no island keyboard. Keys feel pretty standard but no issues or sticking or not working. Speakers are clear. Screen graphics are clear. All in all I'm happy I got the best of the mid-tier chromebooks instead of forking out 2x the price for a Samsung or 4x for an iPad. I absolutely love that I can access everything on my phone with it.</span>

<span>UPDATED:<br/><br/>I wrote a long review but deleted it because, well, you guys said most of it, and said it well... No need to repeat. I'll just write an abbreviated review:<br/><br/>1. I bought the first one and I really liked it - until it bricked a few times. I was able to get it going again after doing some extensive research. That was a couple of months or so ago and I forgot exactly what the fix was (press a key and the side button or something) but I'll look for it and post here if I find it.<br/><br/>2. After it bricked a few times - I didn't want a defective item - new computers shouldn't brick - so I decided to return and exchange it. Ultimately Amazon did exchange it after they tried to tell me I'd have to wait over a month! What? There were several in stock according to the product page. I persisted, called again, insisted on speaking with a supervisor - who finally "was able to" get it to me within a week, not the two days that is guaranteed to a Prime member. It was kind of an insult that they tried to push around a Prime customer. My guess is they had several in stock, but not that many, and they wanted to keep those for new Flex buyers and it would take a month for the next shipment from wherever. Who knows.<br/><br/>3. Got this one, it works well and I like it a lot. Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>+I absolutely love the backlit keyboard - this is my first one - and don't know how I ever settled for a computer without one before! It's great for working in low light or the dark. Probably the one best feature of this Chromebook.<br/><br/>+And I like the keys and keyboard, typing is just right, Lenovo always made superior keyboards and this one delivers too.<br/><br/>+The screen is nice and clear, better than I first judged. But I'm really gentle and careful with it and refrain from folding it over tablet style because of all the hinge complaints. It sucks to have to be so proactively careful, but what can you do? I thought of spraying some appropriate lubricant into the hinges, but will have to find out what to use.<br/><br/>+But the speakers are sooo inferior, tinny, low volume with little range, etc.  As a comparison, my Samsung phone with one tiny speaker is much, much louder and clearer than this Chromebook. Makes no sense - the two speaker grills on the front could easily support larger, louder, better quality speakers. What would it cost them, a dollar? Two? Lenovo, come on now,<br/><br/>Overall I really like this Chromebook. It serves most of my needs, is quick, simple to use, light, good for scrolling the internet, good for watching movies (but as mentioned, the volume is low, so it would be a challenge to play for a group in a room), the battery is pretty good - never ran out of battery. I recommend it, particularly at the sale price.</span>

<span>I spent a lot of time researching which Chromebook to get, and I must say I made the right choice with this device. If you are looking for something a grade above what school's pay almost nothing for but don't want to spend a fortune on an overpowered web-browser (cough cough Pixelbook), I would 100% recommend this device.<br/><br/>I have only had the device about a week, but am thus far very impressed for the following reasons:<br/><br/>- When I first unboxed the device, I was immediately struck by the build quality. Everything felt solid well built. There was almost no flex in the screen or chassis and the hinge is firm enough to not wobble when touched but also loose enough to flex into any position easily.<br/>- The screen is plenty bright. It's not the brightest panel out there, but it worked outdoors for me, especially in the shade. Thin top and side bezels also complement the panel nicely; the pictures don't do it justice. Aesthetically this is a nice, modern-looking device (aside for the old-school 16:9 aspect ratio, but I find putting the taskbar on the right side is a simple yet effective workaround for this; I do this on my Dell as well).<br/>- The keyboard is incredible. It's incredibly responsive and tactile. I know exactly when a key has been hit and recorded, and am left satisfied after every keystroke with no doubts and a nice clicky sound. I almost look forward to writing my first essay on this machine. Also, the backlight is very nice. It's one of those features I forgot about but was happy to find when I turned the computer on.<br/>- Performance is fantastic. The i3 and 4gb of memory have me doing whatever I want whenever I want. I've never seen any slowdowns except for using beta Linux programs (like Firefox).<br/><br/>About what I expected was touchpad size. It's not as big as you'll find on a Macbook for instance but it's definitely no slouch. My 15" Dell Precision Workstation has a smaller trackpad. The pad works well, avoid fingerprints and smudges, and is comfortably sized for any stroke (I've never accidentally slid my finger off the pad).<br/><br/>Battery life is also (so far) about as expected. I have never taken it close to all the way down, but as my secondary machine the device does not get nearly the usage as my Dell to test the battery. What I can say is that I have never had concern picking up the device for an hour or so regardless of if I charged it overnight or not. Plus, charging via USB C on either side makes the device easy to charge regardless of what I'm doing or where I've put the laptop down.<br/><br/>Also on the bottom side of acceptable is the camera. It works. The color is good but sharpness and expsure are terrible. Given the compression of video calls, however, these shouldn't be a big deal. Plus, the physical shutter is nice to have for peace of mind without an ugly post it or piece of tape gunking up the lens. It's a typical crappy webcam.<br/><br/>The only thing I expected to be nicer are the speakers. I am a bit of an audiophile (though not nearly to the degree of many self-proclaimed audiophiles), and seeing the large speaker grills in the photos prompted me to expect larger drivers than the device has. Upon testing the speakers, they sound small (even at lower volumes), and with the device in hand you can see that the speakers only exist in about the bottom quarter of the speaker grill - yikes. They get the job done.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very solid device. I have no regrets with my purchase. If you are looking for a good laptop to access the internet on and run some basic software (mainly android apps and PWAs), you should have no issues or complaints.</span>

<span>No one feature is exceptional, but the amount of features/quality at the sub-400 price is impressive.<br/><br/>❧ Solid construction, aluminum lid<br/>❧ Modern (at time of purchase) and moderately-well-equipped Ryzen APU<br/>❧ IPS screen with good max and min brightness, even backlight, and acceptable color rendition<br/>❧ Backlit Keyboard with a great layout and good key quality<br/>❧ Large, responsive trackpad with a turn-off option in the function keys<br/>❧ Good cooling solution for the size<br/>❧ User accessible / upgradable parts<br/>❧ Acceptable I/O (USB, HDMI, LAN, headphone jack, kensington)<br/><br/>Corners that were cut:<br/><br/>❧ Storage size - 128gb DRAM-less SSD as configured<br/>❧ Win 10 in S mode (I believe Microsoft charges less for the "s" license)<br/>❧ Speakers are truly terrible. I cannot overemphasize how bad they are.<br/>❧ Ram Size - 4gb DDR4 2400<br/>❧ No card reader<br/>❧ 1 year warranty (remember when things actually had 2 or 3???)<br/>❧ No Mic jack<br/><br/>The storage is upgradeable. The included SSD is user-replaceable, and there is also an included space /  hardware to add a 2.5" drive. The 4gb RAM is built in to the board, but there is one slot open for RAM. Having filled mine, CPU-Z reports that it is successfully running in dual channel mode (important for APU memory bandwidth).<br/><br/>It strikes me that the corners cut are ALL user-addressable. Windows 10 can leave S mode. Ram/storage is upgradeable. Card readers and external speakers/headphones/audio interfaces can be used.<br/><br/>The 3350u processor has a manufacturer-configurable TDP, which affects its boost clock behavior. This one seems to be configured to a relatively medium-low power. I have never seen it boost past 3.1ghz (the AMD spec sheet lists a 3.5 ghz max). Fine by me, but worth noting. The cooling solution seems like it could handle more, but it does dump heat primarily beneath it (i.e. into your lap if you are using it as a laptop literally). I don't really blame them for dialing it back for this reason or to hit battery life targets.<br/><br/>After adding RAM and storage, I have successfully done some medium gaming at low settings. Civ 6, Life is Strange 2, and the infamously-processor-bound-poorly-optimized Guild Wars 2. All fine, but I would have gotten something more powerful if I didn't have a gaming desktop.<br/><br/>My last laptop was from 2009 and lasted me 'til 2021. The hardware on this one should meet my needs for equally long -- all that's left to be seen is if anything randomly breaks between now and then. If any random breakage occurs between now and 2023 I will update this review.</span>

<span>As a college student, this is very useful and fast from my experience after having it for a month. And it was also a great budget price so for anyone who needs a cheap fast computer, I think this is a great place to start. Just a heads up: the fan will sound very loud when you are first setting it up but it is very very quiet. It’ll sound loud when there are setups or stuff like that. But overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I also have heard that people complain about the backlit keyboard because there’s a timer but you can actually change it to where it can stay on until you press the button again to turn it off. To change the timed keyboard to always on, go to your computer settings, type “Recovery” and click that and look for “Advanced startup” then you might have to wait for it to restart. After that, there should be a blue screen and click “Troubleshoot” and then “Advanced Options” and then “UEFI firmware settings” and you should look for “keyboard timeout” or something like that and click “disable” and then just confirm the settings and once it restarts again, then it should would. Keep in mind that the fan will be loud throughout the entire process. Of course there’s always YouTube videos. Hope this helped!!</span>

<span>I’ve been wanting to switch from my pc. Everything else I own is Apple. When the prime day price popped up I couldn’t resist. It is definitely a learning curve but fairly easy to get used to. As far as I can see I don’t need to add any programs. I was able to migrate everything from my PC and this baby is FAST!</span>

<span>Not sure where these laptops were stored but the musty smell was overpowering when I opened up the box.  The main culprit was the power cord.  I went online to find a solution and found multiple complaints about this model’s cord.  LOVE the computer….hate the cord smell.  Luckily it stays charged so long that I can put it in another room to charge every 3rd day.</span>

<span>Got this as a gift during prime day sale. It came very promptly. I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.</span>

<span>This item was described as having cosmetic damages but after having it for 8 months, I can't tell that it was ever used by anybody else. Came exactly as advertised and has been the best laptop I've ever owned.</span>
