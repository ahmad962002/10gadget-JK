<span>Not gonna lie, super impressed with this laptop. Was considering an HP Spectre or Galaxy Book Pro, but stumbled across this on here of all places. It had everything i was looking for &amp; more than what I even realized.<br/><br/>Presentation in box was nice. Like how it is packaged in a dust sleeve &amp; even has a dust sleeve in-between screen &amp; keyboard. Major plus mark for that alone.<br/><br/>Upon booting first time &amp; getting initially set up, enjoyed how nice the screen is. IPS is the way to go, ngl. Keyboard light &amp; RGB options are a major upgrade for my use. Selection of apps &amp; programs from the get go are too numerous to mention, but is nice to have plenty of options. After removing what didn't interest me, proceeded with updates, as you should with any device.<br/><br/>This thing seems like Sonic... GOTTA GO FAST!<br/><br/>Dragon Center App has tons of various tweaks &amp; options for things like Keyboard RGB light, Power/ Battery, Performance, etc. Definite plus for that alone. Some people can't stand it, so I'll leave that up to particular preference.<br/><br/>Yes, the fans can he EXTREMELY NOISY... BUT for my particular usage &amp; wants in a laptop, quite a fair trade off. Only way they get THAT noisy, is if you select extreme performance/ cooler boost. A good pair of headphones would drown that noise.<br/><br/>Another surprise, is that you can run android games either through The appropriate MSI app or even Bluestacks... was not aware of when I decided to purchase, but cool nonetheless. I would say remove the MSI App Player &amp; just use true Bluestacks, if you want to mess with Amdroid emulation<br/><br/>With this, I plan on investing in Steam, finally. Not to mention, can't wait to see what this thing can handle, emulation-wise (Can't wait to try Stepmania on this). [Edit/ Update 9/7/21 -Stepmania runs just like arcade Dance Dance Revolution on MAX graphical program settings. Just a little side note, SOME games that have a max refresh rate of 60hz may have graphical issues... I'm specifically mentioning Sonic Adventure &amp; Adcenture 2 for PC being OVERLY FAST. There are workarounds to get said games working perfectly.]<br/><br/>Build seems solid. Got the Gray version &amp; am not disappointed at all by my choice. It has a nice blue tinit to it.<br/><br/>[Update 9/7/21- Dont expect to get a ton of battery use out of this thing. Setting battery saver settings via windows &amp; dragon center to as max as possible &amp; lowering screen brightness might get 6 to 8 hours of battery life, with just normal, no gaming computer use. Thankfully you can calibrate battery when needed to extend the service life of it.] [Another note: if you run demanding thinga in this, it will get hot to hold. My suggestion, buy a GOOD laptop stand with fan cooling. I would suggedt KLIM Ultimate RGB for if you are a gamer that plays less demaning games. Binding of Isaac, Emulation, etc. Said cooler would probably be good for some demanding games too, with Cooler Boost function turned on to help get some extra airflow]<br/><br/>This may be The best "budget" gaming laptop out there atm. Got the 512 GB Model with 16 GB ram &amp; the RTX 3060. Going to eventually go overkill with max ram &amp; a 2 tb Samsung SSD. Can't wait to see what this thing can unleash then... but for now, happy camper!</span>

<span>Is a really thin and light laptop, the build materials and the style are clean and settle that add some points on being a powerful gaming laptop without screaming it. Having a Thunderbolt 4 port expands a lot of posibilities to eGPU if you want to add a more powerfull graphic card.<br/><br/>But some things to have in mind are i.e:<br/>- RGB is just one zone in the keyboard, it doesn't have indivitual lights for each letter<br/>- The 3060 is the 65W version so is not as powerfull at first glence if you are planning to game at really high setting or get the same performance from those benchmarks videos. Also to squeez the max from the GPU you have to set the profile to "Max perfomance" in the MSI Dragon Center if not it will limited to 40W and really you can see the diference.<br/>- The fan noise at max power can be a bit to loud but you can get use to and better a cold loud laptop that an quiet oven.<br/>- Minimun upgrability, you can upgrade the RAM but is a headache and the storage you have to remove the current M.2 to add a bigger one.<br/><br/>So far I'm happy with it and you will if accept these "buts"</span>

<span>A fantastic laptop for the low price. The look and design of the laptop is very nice and sleek. The only odd thing about it is the fans on the side pushing all the ports to the middle of the sides. Everything worked out of the box and the MSI Dragon Center is one of the best control centers I've seen among all my previous computers. They keyboard is also very nice. I love the rgb control you have and the presets you can choose from are very satisfying. The laptop has also been very quiet so far. While it has gotten just a little warm, I feel like that's to be expected with literally any gaming laptop on the market so I don't think I can knock it for that, especially when its been minimal.</span>

<span>Note: I got the 16 (blazing ddr5) /256/Xe model with 2560 x 1600 IPS, Evo 12th Gen i7 1260P.<br/><br/>I've been buying portable computers since my Kaypro, and as a road warrior, laptops since my Toshiba T-1000. I've also got kids and a wife who used to work in design. So in addition to building PCs I have bought a LOT of laptops, easily over 50 over the past 35 years. But my now dying Thinkpad lasted so long that it has been six years since I bought one for myself.<br/><br/>I got a chance to see this LG Gram in store and really first fell in love with the screen. It is bright, has great resolution.  I also love the weight and form factor of this machine. It has a very sleek professional look and doesn't look like some plastic masquerading as an advanced alloy. Despite its sleek thinness there is virtually no flex at the palms or hinge. It has the ports I want as well. It has two USB C, both thunderbolt 4, as opposed to a single setup that I have to spend a lot of money to get a better two USB C hub/dock, nevermind the mess that would happen should I kill one port, and two USB-A 3.2.<br/>The balance of CPU and ram is optimal. Win 11 pro runs great.<br/><br/>Before buying I wanted to make sure I could do some upgrading, so I watched some Youtubes. I already cloned boot, and swapped in a 1TB Samsung 980  as boot. I will probably swap out the original 256 to a 2tb in a year and have 3tb total. Keyboard has good action. Speakers are good as well.<br/><br/>For my entire experience buying laptops, prices went down and capabilities went up relentlessly every year. So it was a shock when I started looking last month, given how the chip shortage has made an expensive mess for buyers. This was exactly mid budget for me.<br/><br/>I am using the machine a fair amount, four to five hours a day and will return to note any issues should they arise. At this point I am very happy with this machine. It is a excellent combination of function and form.</span>

<span>I bought an LG gram laptop. It crapped out on my almost immediately. After dozens of calls with hold times of over an hour per call, I got a refund approved. That was months ago. They never sent the refund. Calls and emails go nowhere. There is zero personnel in the refund/warranty department. If your product dies during warranty period like mine did, you are totally screwed. I've never seen anything like this in my life, and I've dealt with AT+T, DMV, and all the other horrible bureaucracies. There is nothing worse than LG warranty service.</span>

<span>Amazing product, especially at under $1,000.00. In my opinion, the LG Gram is the only option on the market if you're seeking a thin and light device w/ a large display &amp; solid performance. No other laptop does it all while being this light w/ this large of a display. This is my third LG Gram, despite already owning a 2021 Macbook Pro 16" M1 Pro and a 2022 Macbook Air M2. Just like the Mac, in my opinion, there's no other device quite like the Gram!<br/><br/>For reference, I'm coming from the LG Gram 17 (10th gen i7; Costco-exclusive model 17Z90N-R.AAC8U1), which was nice but it had a tiny bit of coil whine, and its display was way too glossy - I had to purchase an aftermarket antiglare screen cover to use the laptop. However, this device was perfect out of the box - antiglare screen is just right and no coil whine! Very satisfied w/ the purchase.</span>

<span>The laptop has a software issue that causes wake issues. Five times out of 10, when trying to wake the computer from sleep, the screen does not turn on. This seems to be a firmware issue with the hardware itself, as I've never seen a laptop do this, and I work in IT. It's too bad the issue started a week ago, just a few days after the return period ended. Now I have to wipe the entire thing and hope it's a windows issue, which I assume it's not.</span>

<span>I swore I'd never again buy an Asus but this is a very attractive laptop and I decided to give Asus another shot. Asus lost me as a customer due to their awful mouse drivers in the past. Few things are more frustrating than a jumpy mouse when you're trying to get work done. When I buy a laptop, I mainly care about five things: Display, weight, mouse, battery life, and keyboard.<br/><br/>This notebook has a pretty good (Not amazing) matte, non-touch display, very little backlight bleed and great viewing angles. This is absolutely NOT a 400 nit display, it seems to be around 250 nits - 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>At 2.58 pounds, the weight is a little heavier than I'd like - 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>The large, glass trackpad on this mouse is absolutely spectacular, one of the best I've ever used - 10 out of 10<br/><br/>Battery life is very good. Mine measures at 67.962 Wh. I'd say that 10 hours is reasonable to expect with light to normal use - 8.5 out of 10<br/><br/>The keyboard is also very good, decent 1.4mm travel and a nice actuation, great backlight - 8 out of 10<br/><br/>Some helpful details: Keyboard backlight has three brightness levels. Keyboard backlight stays on for 1 minute before automatically turning off due to inactivity. The keyboard backlight DOES turn back on when you move the mouse. Asus is well known for awful mouse drivers contributing to a jumpy mouse but I'm (thankfully) not seeing that with this laptop so far. As ridiculous as this is, you can't actually upgrade the RAM in this laptop. You're stuck with what's soldered on the motherboard - unintelligible.<br/><br/>I may, however, end up returning this laptop due to a slight, barely audible electric noise coming from the motherboard. If you've ever had an XPS you may know what I'm talking about. Dells are famous for this garbage and I was surprised to hear this on an Asus. An ignominious issue with an otherwise great laptop.<br/><br/>July 9th 2021 update:  I kept the laptop and I'm mostly glad that I did. Battery life is great. The aforementioned electrical noise is largely inaudible. The number pad on the mouse is nothing but a gimmick. I absolutely HATE the fact that you can't upgrade the ram.</span>

<span>The great things about the laptop is that its fast and powerful. But for me the screen is the best thing about it. On the bad side it overheats pretty easily and the battery lasts about 4-7 hours depends on what you are doing. The brightness of some keys are lower than the others on the keyboard. Overall really great laptop for students and productive work.</span>

Power up: The latest 11th Generation Intel Core processors deliver incredible responsiveness and smooth, seamless multitasking.Keeps its cool: A redesigned thermal system unleashes the power of your device while also preserving its thin design. Dual heat pipes move heat away from your CPU and GPU, more fan blades move more air and a drop-hinge allows air to circulate underneath your laptop.Peace and quiet: With a fluid dynamic bearing system, your laptop's fan is not only long-lasting, but it also runs quietly while keeping your device performing at its best. A does-it-all port: Available on configurations with an i7 processor, a Thunderbolt 4 port over USB Type-C supports DisplayPort and Power Delivery, meaning the one port can charge the laptop, connect to peripherals, and supply monitors with a display signal.Strength meets style: Crafted with aluminum on the top cover, your device feels luxurious without sacrificing durability.SpecsProcessor: 11th Generation Intel Core i7-11390H Processor (12MB Cache, up to 5.0GHz with ITBM3.0)Operating System: Windows 11 ProGraphics Card: Intel Iris Xe Graphics Display: 15.6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Anti-glare LED BacklightMemory: 32GBHard Drive: 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDKeyboard: Titan Grey Backlit KeyboardWireless: Intel Wi-Fi 6 2x2 (Gig+) and Bluetooth 5.1Primary Battery: 4-Cell Battery, 54WHr (Integrated)Camera: HD, Dual-array microphonesPorts2 USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports1 Thunderbolt 4.0 1 Universal Audio Jack1 HDMI 1.4 port

<span>The hardware is fine. The title states this is a "Business Laptop" and I purchased it for business.  The "Technical Specifications" as listed in the laptop description (see attached photo), clearly states the operating system is "Windows 10 Professional 64-bit".  However, the laptop came with Windows 10 HOME installed.  I can not join this laptop to our network thus it is useless to us without purchasing an operation system upgrade. Why would you market a "Business Laptop" with a Home OS??? Very disappointed.<br/><br/>*UPDATE* - I contacted the vender who took steps to correct the issue very quickly.  They worked with me to assure that I was able to complete my project and meet my deadline at work.  I'll have no issue buying from this vender again and I would recommend them; they were wonderful!.  Dell should be a bit more concerned with the accuracy of the marketing literature they provide the venders.</span>

<span>Ordered an Acer here on Amazon and it was defective, worked with Amazon tech support and then worked with Acer to try and resolve the problem, It either was just defective or the Tech support at Acer didnt know how to help me.  The computer just would continue to freeze if left unattended, I would have to do a Hard Shut down and Start it again. It happened many time in the course of 3 days.  I returned it to Amazone and I have received my Full Amount back on my credit card.  I ordered another new computer and went with ASUS this time through Amazon with a Seller, and low and behold this computer was defective also.  While workring on this brand new computer for now reason the thing would go into the BIOS mode.  WHAT the heck. It should not do that.  So again I called Amazon Support and we got in touch with ACER support after a couple of days and the thing still preforming the same going into BIOS, the last support persons says it is probably the Motherboard.  Ok this one is  being sent back right now and I am waiting for my refund money from this seller.  I have documented the problem and  have a case number with ACER so I should receive my refund once they get the returned computer back.  Ok now I have just received my THIRD NEW COMPUTER again  going with ACER as I have had them before and  feel they are good.  So Far So Good.  It has been up and running about a week and so far no falty things happening.  I will say this has not been a fun journey as I had to install my prograoms I use 3x unistall 2x from the bad computers.  Restore my data from my Cloud Back up 3x which takes about 3days for each computer.  Had to uninstall my data 2x which took time.  So dealing with this computer stuff for over a month. I hope I am good now, maybe i can get some work done.</span>

<span>My wife is a technical writer, and this is by far her favorite laptop after a little more than 2 months ownership.  She loves the feel of the keyboard, the light weight, bright screen, and lighted keys (for when she's writing late at night).  In the past 10 years she has used Dell, Lenovo and HP laptops, but never loved any of them the way she loves this Acer.  She even prefers the 15.6" screen size over her previous 17" HP.  She has a 27" 1440p monitor for working with 2 pages at a time, but this laptop goes everywhere with her and the screen is plenty big for polishing something she's already written.<br/>The other great improvement over her older laptops is the camera.  The color rendition is great, and it handles challenging lighting very well. We bought a nice 1080p webcam for the HP since its camera was truly horrible.  We've never used that webcam with this laptop because it doesn't need it.  Meetings are much easier now for her without wrestling with extra equipment and cabling.<br/>I can't really say much about battery life or gaming.  However, if you earn a living by typing copious amounts of text, this is by far the best laptop we've found.</span>

<span>for my purposes like excel, word, browsing, social media, blogging, light photo-editing, and other non-intensive (non-gaming) activities, this laptop is great. it's fast, 0 to 60 in 10 seconds (the fingerprint reader helps rather than using the password). it's quiet; it's replacing an old dell inspiron 15 which had become a constant whir of fan and hard drive so that the acer feels almost eerily quiet. i did due diligence and the big bang of cpu, graphics, fhd, ram, ssd, wifi 6, backlit kb, and fpr beats anything out there (there's an asus vivobook that's comparable for a little more and was the last competitor in the running). who knows what the build quality will give me for years of usage but if it's half-decent, it shouldn't become obsolete in just a few. my only complaint as of now is the ever-so-slightly crooked 'full hd 1080' sticker on the left-bottom bezel of the screen, but i'm an ex-qc guy whose eye has been spoiled by too many close inspections. but if anything else wrong appears (knock wood), i'll edit this review.  UPDATE 9/27/21 So I have discovered a quirk which could possibly be a problem if allowed to be one. When the unit is in sleep mode while plugged in (charging), the fan will turn on and apparently stay on while charging. I didn't check to see how long. And I'm not sure how hot the unit actually is. The laptop is fine when shut down and charging. It is also fine when on and in use while charging (in fact, the fan is never on for my particular usages except when first booting it up from shutdown). But if, for example, the unit is plugged in while in use, and I simply shut the cover, causing the unit to go into sleep mode, the fan will turn on. It's not a big deal to me. I still give it five stars. I have been able to adapt. But I thought it worth mentioning.</span>

<span>Bought this laptop with some graduation money. I loved the look and features, but I noticed it wouldn't go to sleep when the lid closed.<br/><br/>This is a minor issue but I wasn't going to just "deal with it." I paid almost $1k for this thing, and I needed it to freaking work right. Got the replacement ordered, and after a bit more troubleshooting I discovered that the spacebar was protruding just enough to be pressed when the lid closed.<br/><br/>So in short, I couldn't have fixed it anyway due to it being a hardware issue. Anyways, I've gotten the replacement set up and I'm loving it.<br/><br/>This thing is so light that it doesn't feel like it should have the components it contains (i7-1165G7 w/ Iris Xe IGPU).<br/><br/>It runs Apex legends on medium to low settings with few hiccups, but be sure to put it on a flat surface to account for adequate cooling.<br/><br/>Battery life is incredible due to the Intel Evo energy management system, I haven't stress-tested it yet, but I have a lot of confidence that it won't disappoint.<br/><br/>When I say this thing is snappy, I mean incredibly fast, at almost any task. (hehe, rhymes) The 16GB of 4267MHz LPDDR4X RAM is a major contributor to that speed. The PCI Express NVME SSD feels like it's supercharged and overclocked; it's that fast. And the 1TB capacity gives me ample wiggle room for whatever files or games I might want to store on it.<br/><br/>Camera is an underwhelming 720p pinhole lens, so nothing really to fawn over there.<br/><br/>The fingerprint sensor is super helpful as well. You can use it to sign in to websites as well as the laptop itself.<br/><br/>Overall, very happy with the laptop so far, but I was disappointed that the first one I got was faulty. Points docked, Acer. I would definitely recommend this to someone who needs a powerful laptop that doesn't take up much space.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, it has a pretty snazzy color scheme as well. The subtle green with the bronze/gold accents really goes well together in my opinion. The only downside is that these colors are the only ones available.<br/><br/>Hope to use it for years to come!</span>

<span>As a relatively inexpensive and light laptop, the Acer Swift 3 is pretty solid. It's not a heavy duty laptop and it isn't going to be a great option for gaming or video editing or anything that requires a lot of processing power, but as a general purpose laptop for surfing the web or watching YouTube videos it's going to be perfectly functional.<br/><br/>It weighs in around 2.6-2.8lbs (my scale isn't very precise and the reading fluctuated between the two after several tries), which makes it quite easy to carry around without feeling weighed down. The construction feels about what I would expect for a computer in this price range, which is to say it's not top quality but it's not flimsy either. The keyboard is not overly clicky, although it is a bit louder than i would like. I am generally not a fan of laptop keyboards as I prefer a bit more responsiveness but all things considered it's not bad. The backlighting on the keyboard works well.<br/><br/>The Cinebench score was a rather pedestrian 5000. But regardless of benchmarks, I have found it works perfectly well for my everyday needs. I can have a full-screen video running on one screen while surfing the web on another with no lag or hiccups. I keep several programs open all the time (including Chrome which is a serious memory hog) and the laptop doesn't have any performance issues. Considering the price point I am very satisfied with its performance.<br/><br/>The one negative about the setup is that the RAM cannot be upgraded (I got 8gb and wanted 16gb but wasn't going to pay the ridiculous cost difference to buy it pre-installed).  I also would have liked 1 more usb port, but 2 is pretty standard so it's not something I would hold against it. Overall I am very satisfied with this laptop. If you don't carry your laptop around very much you might consider looking around for other options because there are probably other more performant options around this price range at the cost of more weight. But if you want a portable, inexpensive laptop that performs well on common everyday tasks then this is a great choice.</span>

<span>This computer seems nice enough out of the box. Easy to set up, runs Windows, etc. I'm sitting there playing a game six days later, and all the sudden a puff of smoke comes out the back. Now I'm sitting here staring at Acer's chat support app. If an agent ever joins the chat, I'll update this review. As of now, it looks like I paid $1,100 for a brick.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It took almost six weeks, but I got the laptop factory-repaired for free, and I have it back. It's a nice laptop for what it costs. By way of illustrating that point, the first thing the Acer support people said to me was "this'll be easier if you just send it back to Amazon. They'll give you a replacement immediately, and we'll repair the unit on the back end." Only problem was, a week after I bought it, the laptop was completely backordered.<br/><br/>From where I sit, this product seems like the kind of thing where you can get a deal for being willing to put in a little elbow grease. The Acer factory maybe needs better QC, but their Tier-2 tech support handled the problem about as well as could have been expected.<br/><br/>If it breaks again I'll update.</span>

<span>I purchased the laptop a little more than a year ago. The sound quality truly sucks but the computer was doing its job. I liked the touch screen, the small size that fits into my purse, and the fact the laptop is very light. However one of the keys fell out on the keyboard after only one year. I didn't expect Acer to be as sturdy as my Mac but after paying more than $1k for this laptop, I didn't expect that the keys would fall out. This has never happened with any of my prior laptops. Disappointing.</span>
