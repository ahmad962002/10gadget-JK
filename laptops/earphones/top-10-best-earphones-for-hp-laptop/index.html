<li><span class="a-list-item"> Unlike traditional, circular earbuds, the design of the EarPods is defined by the geometry of the ear which makes them more comfortable for more people than any other earbud-style headphones  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The speakers inside the EarPods have been engineered to maximize sound output and minimize sound loss, which means you get high-quality audio  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The EarPods also include a built-in remote that lets you adjust the volume, control the playback of music and video, and answer or end calls with a pinch of the cord  </span></li>
<li><span class="a-list-item"> The remote and mic are supported by all models of iPod, iPhone, and iPad (not all models support volume up/down functions). Audio is supported by all iPod models. Requires software version 1.0.3 for iPod nano (4th generation), 2.0.1 for iPod classic (120GB), and 2.2 or later for iPod touch (2nd generation).  </span></li>

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The headphones look very classy and it feels very comfortable in my ears (sometimes feels loose you gotta snug it tight in there). I mostly use it with the nintendo switch and even though the noise cancellation quality isn’t great, the sound quality is great for the price. Compared to the Airpods Pro, the headphones offer weaker noise cancellation than the Airpods Pro in normal mode.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I really like having ear buds that don't have the rubber insert with noise cancelation. these are the most comfortable head phones for me. still have great sound but I can still tell what's going on around me. I also enjoy the wire due to my uncanny ability to lose wireless headphones. I will continue to use these until they stop working and stop being sold.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I really don't like giving Apple any credit whenever I can help it, but if there's one thing that I know has consistently been good on their part, it's these earbuds.<br/><br/>They are, without a shred of doubt, timeless, and for very good reason.<br/><br/>They're comfortable. They sound good. They're lightweight. They're relatively durable. The microphone is good.<br/><br/>What more really can you ask for? I've been using cheap earbuds for a lot of time and I keep coming back to these simply because these are the gold standard of affordable earphones.<br/><br/>Pretty much the only complaint I could have is that I wish I didn't need to use the Apple adapter in order to use the controls completely on Android, but honestly, this works on so many other things just fine that it's barely a nuisance.</span>

<span>This is a classic design and sound quality. Solid. The best thing about it is it doesn't have rubber tips that go down deeper in the ear so your ears will not sweat as much (if you have that problem) and let's build up of ear wax. I use it on a smartphone without a headphone jack, but I bought a quality dongle from Amazon and the combo works perfect.</span>

<span>Got these on a Lightning Deal so wasn't expecting a whole lot. Came in a very nice box. Didn't bother to even look at the instructions/papers that came with it. Plugged them into my phone and BAM! I'm not an audiophile, just someone who likes good music and these put that good music right into my ears. Bass was better than in similarly priced earbuds. I prefer wired earbuds because I'm always scared of losing the wireless or running out of charge just when I need them most. The fact that they have metals housings was surprising and made them feel more solid than others. Does that help with the sound quality? Don't know for sure but it makes me feel that it might. Love the little storage pouch that comes with the earbuds and definitely use it. After a week of use I am still very happy with the look and feel of the earbuds. The red and gold colors reminded me of the Iron Man suit, and the gold wires kind of look like think gold chains. Had a coworker comment on my "bling" earbuds. The wires on the earbuds look like thin braided wires covered in a thin clear plastic sleeve, so am pleased with their look and feel. Haven't had to try any of the other included earbud covers as the ones that came on them were fine for me, but others covers are included as well as a clip which I will use int he coming week.<br/>The only "con" I would give these earbuds is that they are not true noise cancelling, and I believe it even says so in the product description. They fit well and simply block out any ambient noise using that. But even so I would very much recommend these earbuds as a great value and choice for the price.</span>

<span>A fairly average headset that accomplishes just enough, I’d still recommend it.<br/><br/>Pluses: Simple to use, volume up/down works well, audio is clear.<br/>Minuses: Max audio volume is lower than MPow headsets I’ve used in the past. I talk all day for work, and if someone is a few feet away on speaker, hard to hear them. Generally if it’s mostly silent in my workspace, I can hear well.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why these headsets all come with the volume/mute control connected to the wire directly where your elbow rests on the table. Dumb design as I often mute the phone while talking unintentionally.<br/><br/>These are a C+ B-</span>

<span>The volume control is inline with the headset  and it hangs in such a place that it gets hung up on the edge of my seat's arm rest  or the table edge. I the volume control is a great idea, however, I have unknowingly disabled the audio because I hit the top of the control.<br/>The headset (speakers) are great, sound quality is great, Just need to remove the volume control or place it closer to the end of the cable where it is out of the way.</span>

<span>They're a cheap set of USB headphones. They sound decent, not the best. Of course, the difference between mediocre and the best, for me anyway, isn't much. I learned a long time ago not to buy expensive headphones. They wear out just as quick as the cheap ones. The cord on this set is a little shorter than on my last set (guesstimating 6 feet/two meters). Not a problem for me, but might be a concern for others.</span>

They plug into the laptop USB and are instantly recognized by my device. The ear padding and adjustable headband are very comfortable, the microphone swings out of the way so I can keep these at the ready on my desk, but they are never in the way. The sound quality is great. I even used them for a virtual Teams meeting at work, which was recorded, and the playback is crisp and clear. Thinking of getting a set for home use as well.</span>

<span>Our household finally upgraded to smartphones. We have let our ENV3's carry us until Verizon killed them by not allowing them to run on their network anymore due to them eliminating their 3D network. Our household doesn't use Wi Fi or Bluetooth so we were looking for a good old fashioned corded headset.<br/><br/>This Cyber Acoustics headset is practically perfect in every way. We purchased four of them. Three to use with LG Stylo 5 cell phones and 1 to keep as a spare. It's good that we purchased a spare because one of the headsets had a short in it. You can tell there is a short in it because it cuts out two or three words every few minutes.<br/><br/>The other headsets are working beautifully which is why this product still warrants 5 stars. I've used other Cyber Acoustics brand products in the past and never had any problems so I literally think we just got one bad headset and it was not a huge deal or hassle to return.<br/><br/>The basic things you need to know about this headset:<br/>~3.5 mm sized plug. Fits easily in our cell phones as well as in my laptop computer<br/>~Microphone is easy to move back and forth between the left and right side<br/>~Noise cancellation blocks all background noise even in a moving vehicle<br/>~Easy to wear only one side so you can use it while driving<br/>~The cord is made of their proprietary material which is made of nylon so doesn't get tangled<br/>~There's a volume control on the actual cord so you don't have to adjust your device's volume<br/><br/>While I use this headset all day while making and answering phone calls my significant other only uses his in the car. He only wears one earpiece so he can still hear traffic around him. I love this headset because when I am talking to him while he's driving I do not hear any background traffic or the car air conditioner.<br/><br/>This headset is super clear. The quality is amazing for the price. I've used Jabra and Logitech devices in the past and the sound quality on this headset is much clearer. When I am talking to someone whether they are in a car or at home it literally sounds like I am sitting right next to them in the same room.<br/><br/>My friends tell me that I'm much easier to understand on the phone now with this headset. I no longer hear myself saying "what" a million times trying to hear what the person on the other end of the call said because their voice is crystal clear as well.<br/><br/>This headset comes with a one year warranty, but since one of the headsets came with a short in it and was still during the return period I choose to go through Amazon rather than the manufacturer. For the price it's easy to keep a spare headset (or two) around in case one gets broken.<br/><br/>Comfort wise I find the leatherette material provides a lot of padding to my head and ears. I don't get uncomfortable when wearing this headset for a long period of time. It's completely adjustable and fits a big head like mine (I wear an XL in hats) and a small head like my significant other (he wears a medium in hats).<br/><br/>I love the cord. It's not the plastic coated cord like I'm used to. Instead it's a nylon braided cord. It feels durable, doesn't kink easily, and it doesn't get tangled easily, though I have managed to get it tangled a couple of times. Even when it's tangled it is super easy to untangle due to the material it's made of.<br/><br/>All in all, I would highly recommend this headset and I am satisfied with our purchase of these headsets. I don't think you will find better quality sound at this price with any other headset.</span>

<span>The janitor recently stole the pair of Skullcandies I usually left at work.  I wanted a good music listening pair to replace them.  I recently bought several "cheapish" ear buds, one 20 dollar set, and a set of JVC flat headphones recently.  I couldn't decide based on reviews alone, so tried several different options.  I know it was silly.  I should have just spent it all on one "nice" pair, but I thought it would be fun, and it actually was.  Besides, why give the Janitor such a big target.  ;p  I also discovered different roles for the buds I bought.  They nearly all have a place in my collection.  :]  Win win.<br/><br/>I'm no audiophile, or sound professional.  Evenso, I bet I'm like a lot of you.  I want nice sounding music to accompany my day while quieting the environment.  I hope these comparisons will be helpful so you don't have to buy a bundle of buds, and can maybe zero in on a set or two that will serve your tastes best.  I enjoyed comparing and contrasting, and actually noting quit a bit of difference.<br/><br/>The buds/phones I tried are<br/><br/>iLuv iEP322ORG [orange] in-ear Ultra Bass ~6 dollars<br/>Panasonic RPHJE120K [black] in-ear ~6 dollars<br/>Yamaha EPH-20Bu [supposedly blue but actually purple] in- ear ~20 dollars<br/>JVC 10HAFC earphones ~3 dollars<br/>JVC "Flats" on ear headphones black ~12<br/>Skullycandy "Ink'd" in ear buds ~15 [already owned, but in for comparison]<br/>Sentry Wind-Ups in-ear buds ~5 dollars<br/><br/>iLuv:<br/>I chose the orange iLuv's because it was the cheapest color on Amazon.  I enjoyed their sound overall.  They are the most bass heavy of the group.  However, they leave the highs and mids a little neglected.  They also reduce ambient sound decently, so you can focus on what you are listening to.  So while these are not the most balanced, your teen will probably love the sound.  They are also on the "loud" side.  Even at minimum device volume these came in the loudest.  As such, I will probably put these in with one of my DS systems' carrying cases.  It will be great for those, and be on hand so I won't have to scrounge around for a pair, when I want to hear the game and not my wife's TV programs.  These also won't be my work or walking pair, because they don't look very adult [again, your teen will probably love them], and they produce the second most "cord noise" in the group from the cords rubbing on your shoulders or clothes while you are walking or exercising.  If I had nothing else to compare to, I think I'd have been very happy with this set.<br/><br/>Panasonic:<br/>The Panasonics were probably the quietest of the group.  Sound is relatively balanced, with no real extremes.  Bass seems light for an in ear bud.  They are now my go to bed buds.  I can put my device on minimum volume and easily go to sleep.  The iLuvs and Skullcandy were too loud to be comfortable on both my phone media player and iPad mini's lowest setting for sleeping.  The Panasonics are also small enough, that they weren't uncomfortable for side sleeping.  These also produced the least cord noise from movement, so should be good to walk, exercise in.  Noise reduction was decent and reduced my wife's snoring several decibels.  This might not be so great for outdoor exercise, where you may want to hear your environment for safety.  I may even get a second set or carry mine back and forth so I can walk at lunch break in these, since I have a protected area to walk [no cars, etc.].  The lack of cord noise really makes the difference here.<br/><br/>Yamaha:<br/>I was curious about what I would get by going a little upmarket.  Granted it's not much of a jump at "only" 20 dollars.  The Yamahas were probably most similar in sound to the Panasonics or JVC flats.  They had a good all around balance and were more full than the Panasonics.  Bass is not prominent, nor is it missing.  They sound best with Classical music in my experience.  On the down side, they were advertised as "blue", but Yamaha's idea of blue is very clearly Purple.  It's not a major issue, but be aware, if you choose this color.  Cord noise seemed on the loud side, compared to the JVC buds and Panasonics.  I probably would not want to do anything active in them.  However, if I could "only" have one bud, this might be it.<br/><br/>JVC HAF10C earbuds:<br/>For only around 3 dollars you shouldn't normally expect too much.  Agree?  Well, I already had a blue pair [ 4 dollars at retail] so knew what to expect.  It's a testament I bought another.  This pair was black, and I far prefer the gorgeous blue plastic set, but would not pay a couple extra dollars on Amazon for that choice.  I know it shouldn't matter, but I REALLY like blues.  Anyhow, the most unique feature of this set is the clamshell case you get.  It allows you to wind your cord and protect the buds.  I wish higher quality buds would do this.  I'd pay a couple extra bucks for it.  The case does not work well for most in-ear buds, I would guess.  I am able to get the above Yamahas in one case [why I ordered an extra set], but it is not a perfect fit.  Larger buds probably won't fit.  The buds themsevles have a durable hard plastic casing and should be quite durable.  Sound is actually nice, for non-in ear buds.  For the price I doubt you'd find better sound.  They are also on the quiet side, and not being directly in ear, you could probably give these to your kids without the threat of hearing damage you might get from louder and in ear buds.  I use these to walk, talk radio, and some music.  Unlike most in-ear, I can wear comfortably all day if I loosely cradle them on ear.  While outdoors, they allow you to hear the environment, including wind, which is a downside.  Fortunately, they do not generate the cord noise that is such a pet peeve of mine.  Great all around value.  I don't know that the value can be beat for the quality of plugs, and the very well designed case.  Being so cheap, I also don't have to fret too much if the Janitor decides to steal this pair also.<br/><br/>JVC "Flats":<br/>These are on ear headphones, so probably not fair to compare to ear buds.  Still they were part of my purchase, so I am including for contrast.  At only 12 dollars, I was very surprised how crisp and clean these sounded.  They delivered a balanced spectrum, without sacrificing bass as I'd expected.  They do not isolate noise as well as in-ear, but you do get some reduction without having to turn your music WAY up.  For straight music listening or watching a video, I might choose these most of the time at home.  They do not seem to generate cord noise due to movement, but are bulkier than what I want to walk in.  They also fold "flat" making them a nice travel pair for people who don't like in-ear buds.  I keep mine in an inexpensive ipad mini neoprene case, for example.  Would be easy to take on a plane.  I have a big head [really], despite their diminuitive size, they adjusted to fit very comfortably.  I can wear for long sessions, without bother.  Can't go wrong with these.<br/><br/>Skullcandy "Ink'd":<br/>This may not be a fair comparison either.  I think these had the greatest "retail" price when they were new, but I bought them on sale at Ross stores for about 15 dollars.  These are a few years old, so might be an older make than what is available now.  However, I am still surprised by how good these sound to me.  Of all the ear buds in my collection these are probably my favorite for music.  It figures, after buying several, the one I had still sounded best to me.  It has plenty of bass, without sacrificing the overall quality like the iLuvs seem to.  However, it is still one of the loudest of my collection, and is uncomfortable to sleep with on my devices.  My radio is more sensitive and can tune more quietly, but I rarely use that to sleep to.  This set also probably produces the most cord noise of any ear buds meaning they won't walk the beat with me.  It also features metallic red and white buds, white cord, and the companies trade mark as a red skull.  While I think they look "cool" the skull and colors all look a little childish.  They are not as garish as the iLuvs, but they are certainly second in my comparison.  That said, there are more sedate colorings available, however they all have the contrasting skull logo in some fashion or other.  As such these will mostly be used privately.<br/><br/>Sentry Wind-ups:<br/>These were my least favorite.  I was drawn in by the promise of a nifty carry case again.  I might have kept just for that, if they'd have worked.  However, the cord winder was rather difficult to accuate, at least for my biggish hands.  Also my pair of buds may have been defective.  The right bud produced only half the volume of the left.  I took back to Wal-mart asap.  At only 5 dollars, I didn't expect much, but I did expect balance across left and right.  I would presume that was a single item issue, but I did not want to get a second pair to find out.  Sound was more hollow than most I tried, not even measuring up to the 3 dollar JVC's.<br/><br/>There it is.  I hope you've these comments helpful in finding your pair.</span>

<span>Panasonic’s ErgoFit Wired Earbuds are perfect if you're looking for something lightweight and comfortable. These in-ear models have dynamic, crystal clear sound that won't interrupt your listening experience, while their ergonomic design ensures they stay put all day long.<br/><br/>This is my fourth or fifth pair of Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds. I have tried other brands and types, but these are the most comfortable for me at this price point (and I have little ears that are sensitive to fit). Also, they don't last forever but seem to have about the same lifespan as any other earbuds I've tried.<br/><br/>The sound quality is good for basic use--podcasts, video chats, etc. If you're looking for high-quality audio for music or gaming, you'll want to invest in something else, but these work great for everyday use.<br/><br/>I recommend these to anyone looking for a cheap, lightweight, and comfortable option.</span>

<span>Before you read this review I can save you a lot of time.  Buy these.  However if you want more info than that you can read on, but keep in mind this is not an in depth review on how these buds are technically.  I could get into frequency range before and after break in with pink noise and all kinds of other crazy crap, but I'm not going to bore you with that.  You might be able to find that type of review in one of the other 1900 five star reviews.  I'm just going to give you, what I hear, aside from the voices.  But seriously, you can save yourself a lot of time by just buying them.  C'MON THEY'RE ONLY $6.  Okay, waste your time if you want.  Read on if you must.  But you'll probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>I normally don't write reviews because English is not my first language... bad English is, but on these I just had too.  Let me start out by saying before these I had an awesome pair of Bose In Ear Headphones, the old ones.  They cost about $100.  I did not pay for them.  Someone else who is dumb did, and then further proved their lack of intelligence by giving them to me.  Actually, they were a, very generous, Christmas gift I got a few years back from the company I work for.  Those ear buds were awesome, but like everything else I love, they died.  I did manage to get several years of good use out of them, and I treated them like a red headed step child.  The fact they lasted as long as they did only goes to show that Bose makes quality stuff.  Well, now that I think about it, for $100 maybe they should have been impervious to damage by human means, or possibly even mythical means.  I'm going to say it, they should have been Centaur proof.<br/><br/>So after what I refer to as the "Great Loss of 2010."  I then went on a search for a decent pair of replacement buds, in the $20 range; because as is proof by how I treated the Bose ear buds, I shouldn't be allowed to have nice things. I tried many different types of replacement buds from different manufacturers.  I'm not going to list them all because I don't have that kind of time.  I will say through all my testing that 50% were just okay, and the other 50%... well I would rather have listened to the final death rattle of a puppy.  A really cute and sweet looking puppy.  You know, the ones you see on the TV that make you feel guilty for not donating to the ASPCA.<br/><br/>Well, after losing yet another pair of the okay ones, how I had those Bose for so long I have no idea, I needed a replacement and decided to try a different brand.  I went again to the internet and performed the search, "good cheap headphones for someone who should not have good things."  I hit enter, the search results came up, and clicked on a link that appeared to be a tech review site and let me tell you... they are really good at disguising porn sites to look like normal sites in search results these days.  So after seeing something that I will never be able to unsee, I came across the Panasonic RPHJE120S and figured for $6 on Amazon I'll give them a shot.  I've wasted $6 on far worse.<br/><br/>They arrived the day before I ordered them, as Amazon has awesome shipping, especially if you are a Prime Member.  I grabbed my Zune, no I don't have an IPOD because I believe Apple, and the late Bea Arthur, are trying to kill me.  I put in the buds and selected a track to play, expecting either okay sound or sound so bad that I would black out and wake up naked in a quarry with a dead rodent in my mouth.  The latter has only ever happened to me twice in my life... three times tops... four at the most... possibly every Friday.  Once my selected track started playing I was just amazed, to find my neighbor on his roof trying to fix his satellite dish in a t-shirt, pair of boxers, rubber rain boots, and a tool belt, with no tools in it, unless you count him.  The sound out of the ear buds was awesome too!  Clear highs, nice bass, just great frigging sound.  It sounded like the puppy was right in the room with me.  Then I turned on some music and was further impressed.  Initially the highs in certain songs seemed a bit, too high, but over time the buds broke in to be just pure awesome.  A $6 dollar pair of headphones that competed with those $100 Bose buds I had.  Don't get me wrong, Bose is Bose, but to even approach sound quality on par with those Bose buds in a $6 pair of Panasonic's is damned amazing.  But be warned, these buds ARE NOT Centaur proof.  I checked.  They are fairy resistant though.<br/><br/>I have also found them pretty comfortable, and they stay in my ears pretty well.  I have fallen asleep with these things in.  I did an experiment in which I tried to give myself night terrors using audio.  It worked, I have never felt the same since.  I may have also released something that can only be described as pure evil into the world.  But like I said they were real comfortable and stayed in my ears even when I woke up screaming and thrashing about.<br/><br/>Maybe if you are insane, or a complete audiophile, or both, because they usually go hand in hand, you can pick apart these headphones.  I have friends who are audiophiles/insane/schizophrenic and they can find issues with even the best audio gear.  If you are looking for a good set of buds to use in everyday use that have great sound you really can't beat these.  My first pair of these I had for about year, and then I lost them.  I actually think I know where I left them but promised I would never go back... DAMN YOU NEBRASKA!  I just bought 2 more pairs and just got done making sure the they worked and thought to myself; "I have to review these, they deserve it.  Also, I need to teach Amazon a lesson for giving me an outlet to share my opinions."  I believe this is the first product I have ever reviewed on Amazon and if you have read this far you can probably see why.  I'm an idiot.<br/><br/>If you need ear buds... get these.  If you don't need ear buds get them. Hell, if you don't like them you are only out $6.  With almost two-thousand 5 star reviews, including this one, it's a pretty good sign that these are in fact good buds.  If you don't buy these it's a pretty good sign that you are in fact an idiot.  I would know, we can spot our own.<br/><br/>Yes, I have read the bad reviews, that's what I do.  I research a product to death and then look only at the bad reviews to see if the complaints really seem valid or sane. This may sometimes scare me away from perfectly good products like the Nokia N-Gage, HD-DVD, and reusable toilet paper.  But sometimes, especially with bigger purchases, I really want to feel sure after ordering the product, that I have made a huge disastrous mistake.  However, that being said, I have no idea what happened to some of the people that left bad reviews for these.  Maybe they got defective buds, or they are really picky audiophiles, but having heard them myself I can't agree with those reviews.  I also don't agree with the law of gravity or that 9/10 of the law involves possession.<br/><br/>I have also beat the hell out of my first pair of these buds.  I used them for everything, airplane, car rides, while I was cleaning around the house, and in the gym.  Occasionally I have used these as a leash for my dog, and in two instances these saved my life from demons, that live in my head.  Apparently head demons hate death metal, but absolutely love smooth jazz.  Strange, I know.  Seriously though, in the gym these things got ripped out of my ears a whole lot of times and they still kept working.  Like I said, in the end I lost the first pair, but they still worked great when I lost them.<br/><br/>I'll finish on a serious note and stop joking around for just a bit by saying this, at the end of the day everyone's hearing and preferences are different.  You can hate something that I love and vice versa.  That's just how it is.  So in the end there is no guarantee, but if you do the math and you even count the 3 star reviews as bad, only 19% of everyone that bought these did not like them.  The other 81% like me... nothing but love baby.  These things sound great, fit in my ear comfortably, they stay in my ear pretty good, even when I am at the gym, and seem pretty durable.<br/><br/>See, I told you could have saved a whole lot time if you would have just bought them, but you needed to keep reading.</span>

<span>I bought this pair after I lost a previous wireless earbud's master earbud. The sound quality of these UGREEN earbuds was good, but I'm no audio expert, plus I mostly just listened to audiobooks, and music occasionally when at the gym or through YouTube. I have some small complaints, and some praises for these earbuds.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/> - Charge per earbud is longer than my working shift of ~6-9 hours (varies per day).<br/> - Quality did not diminish over time that I could tell.<br/> - You can connect either one or the other earbud or both and they'll work just fine.<br/> - Ear pieces didn't bother my ears, but everyone is different.<br/> - Had no complaints from others when using earbuds during phone calls.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/> - After about 4 months of near daily use I have lost the ability to connect my right earbud and/or it just won't charge anymore. Slightly disheartening, due to the lack of durability compared to a previous pair I had. I will be honest there were times when the earbuds were dropped, so perhaps it eventually broke something inside.<br/> - The case's battery life was not as long as I expected it to be, but it could keep my earbuds charged for about a week or so.<br/> - The only noise the earbuds make is when you change the EQ setting, or when they connect. I'd rather have a set that beeps or something when I activate them to play, pause, or skip.<br/> - The earbuds are touch activated and not an actual button, so if you're careful then you won't have accidental activations causing your media to start playing. If you're like me and store them in your pocket until used next then you might get times when your media plays for either seconds, or what happened to me a couple of times of which was hours.<br/> - These earbuds are said to be noise cancelling, but the only way that feature worked to any extent was just the earbud in my ear playing my choice of media. In other words, it didn't have any and was only seemingly louder than my surroundings.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I bought this pair, but a ~$30 pair of wireless earbuds is exactly the price you get for them. Moderate sound quality, good battery life, good bluetooth range from connected device, and decent enough material quality. Like all products, they could do some stuff better, but you can't win everything.</span>

I love all of my headphones I’ve ever head. I get great compliments on the look and they sound pretty amazing.<br/><br/>These are really no different. They are comfortable and don’t fall out of my ears. There are also other pads to make the fit better if the standard ones don’t work for you.<br/><br/>People can hear me just fine when using the microphone on a phone call or virtual meeting.<br/><br/>The controls for calls and volume are large and easy to find without looking. There is a clip so you can attach this to your clothing.<br/><br/>Where it loses points is sound quality and the cord material.<br/><br/>Sound quality is tricky - I use some over the ear headphones and the sound is full. These are tingy. I get it, they are earbuds, they won’t sound as good.  But the previous generation of Symphonized ear buds sounded closer to the over the ear ones than they sound like these.<br/><br/>As for the cord - the rubber material sticks to things. So now I not only have to worry about getting tangled because I’m still dumb and use a cord, but if it rubs against anything smooth, it clings on and sometimes the earbud falls out of my ear.<br/><br/>So while not perfect, neither of these are major detractors. They serve the function they were created for at a good price. Lucky for me, my dog will eat them soon enough and maybe these short comings will be improved the next time I buy them!</span>

<span>I bought these after initially buying and returning the ‘beats pro fit’ which advertised basically everything these do with the addition of the silicon piece to better secure the earbuds in your ear.<br/><br/>I returned those because that piece made them uncomfortable to wear for more than half an hour or so but their sound quality and especially their noise cancellation were phenomenal—they sounded a bit better than these do. Not by an extremely large margin but especially in regards to the active noise cancellation, the Pro Fit did it better and I’m not sure why since they’re nearly the same product but perhaps they have more differences internally than I realized.<br/><br/>I’m tempted to return these and re-order the Pro Fit and just trying to find a way to make them tolerable to wear because I miss the level of noise cancellation they achieved.<br/><br/>Alas, these are still great earbuds and I’ll need more time with them to make the decision of whether or not to keep them. From only a day’s use I can say that they’re far more comfortable to wear for extended periods and the charging case they come with is of better quality than that of the Pro Fit’s (which isn’t saying too much to be fair).<br/><br/>I’ll update this after I’ve had a chance to use them at the gym a few times.</span>

<span>The sound quality of these ear buds is excellent, as with other Beats products the bass response is superb, which is lacking in the AirPods, IMO. Understandably, it's difficult to pack a lot of bass amplification into a tiny set of wireless ear buds, but Beats managed to do so. They also work with my iPhone 12 Pro Max as seamlessly as the AirPods.<br/><br/>The fit is nice and they stay in my ears better than AirPods; however, I do NOT like the physical buttons being directly on the outside of the buds, opposite your ear canals. I often have to adjust my ear buds and push them back in my eyes to optimize sound because they tend to move around, and this pauses the sound every time - SUPER annoying and dated design flaw. Also, the noise cancellation is pretty lame - not nearly as good as the AirPod Pros. I can hardly tell the difference with it on/off. Lastly, I'm not a fan of the lack of magnetic charging - it is USB-C only. As much as I would love for everything to switch to USB-C, Apple seemingly refuses to let go of their Lightning port, so I still have mostly Lightning cables and thus it would be nice to have magnetic charging instead of just USB-C.<br/><br/>All in all, this a great product at a good price, but if noise cancellation is important to you, you might want to spend the extra $ on the AirPod Pros.</span>

<span>I bought these for work and honestly would give them 5 stars BUT they are not small ear friendly, even with the smallest buds AND the battery life is trash. I wear one then the other just so I can wear them all day. Heaven forbid Im on the phone more than a few times, they’ll be dead by noon. At least the case holds a charge I guess. Still 1000xs better than apple airpods.</span>

<span>Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.<br/><br/>For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.<br/><br/>The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.<br/><br/>I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.<br/><br/>These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).<br/><br/>For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.</span>

Upgrade your sound and style with Samsung Galaxy Buds Live. Designed with a larger Galaxy Buds speaker, improved bass, and an open fit, playlists sound more like live music than ever before. An open design creates a live listening environment, suiting those who prefer a natural, spacious sound. When you need to block out background noise for a phone call or important tasks, initiate Active Noise Cancellation with a touch. Tap earbuds again to let in surrounding live sounds— colleagues’ voices, flight announcements, street traffic—while still enjoying your favorite playlist or podcast. Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are easy on the eyes, light on the ears, and have long-lasting battery life. Features including Active Noise Cancellation is enabled through a Bluetooth connection or the Galaxy Wearable app on Android, available through Google Play Store and the Galaxy Buds app on iOS devices, available through the App Store. Actual battery life may vary and depend on usage conditions such as function settings, playback file type, and Bluetooth signal strength.

<span>Usually I am listening to podcasts or morning radio. So for me, this is fine. The noise cancellation is pretty non-exisent on these.  I live in NYC, so its hard to cancel noise....Phone calls are fabulous!!!<br/><br/>Now, Samsung buds tend to stop working by my experience before the year is out, so I am going to see how long they last.  If the bud blows like the last pair, I am going back to headphone jack!</span>

<span>There are some very nice features to these buds, and I do intend to keep them. (Another reviewer was about to return them.) But there are some things that just aren't as good as I had hoped. I'll try to be as detailed as possible.<br/><br/>First, the out-of-box experience is kinda nice, but not fabuous. The smallish box presents the much smaller charger box that the buds live in, and a tiny box that contains a charger cable. Wait -- are there really no instructions? And I thought there were interchangable ear thingies to accommodate ears of different sizes. Ok, so the very brief instruction book clings to the top of the box because it's too big not to fall out on its own. And the ear thingies are hiding in the box where the charging cable is. I seem to be ok with the default ear thingies that are already installed on the buds. (Note, you have to use your own charger with the charging cable. You probably already have too many of those.)<br/><br/>You'll need to download and install the Galaxy Wearable app (on Android, a different one is available for iOS). The app helps you connect to the buds, pretty easy, and is reasonably fully functional. There are numerous options you can play with.<br/><br/>The fit -- quite comfortable actually. Looking at the peculiar shape, I wondered whether these would stay in my ears, and whether they would be uncomfortable. Yes, they stay put, even when walking around, and no, not uncomfortable. This was a pleasant surprise; Samsung really got this part right. I feel as though I could wear these at the office all day and not get ear fatigue. Much, much better than a clumsy pair of headphones slipping off my head when I'm walking around. When wearing the buds, you can hear outside sounds/conversations very well, and perhaps that's the whole idea of these buds. I like this.<br/><br/>There's an equalizer section on the app's main screen. The equalizer options are sort of ok, but not wonderful. I don't know why there's no option for a 10-band graphic equalizer. I just settled on the default after not liking the other choices any better.<br/><br/>You can turn on and off the ANC (active noise cancellation). I have a pair of conventional headphones (not Bose) with ANC that works really well. You feel like you're in a cocoon. These buds have ANC that you can barely tell is working. It sounds a little different, maybe even a little bit of an improvement, but it doesn't seem like it's getting rid of any particular noise. So the ANC is sort of a bust.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about sound quality. As I say, I really wanted to love these little guys. The sound quality is good but not great. Maybe I'm expecting too much. My pair of $250 conventional headphones sound spectacular, and I can listen to music for hours with them. These buds aren't that impressive. The sound quality is ok -- just ok. It's not "bad" in any way at all, but it's not great. I listened to an entire CD that I know well and like. The experience was pleasant, but at the end I really wanted to listen to it on the stereo instead. As I say, maybe I'm expecting too much. The sound quality is probably good enough to listen to at work all day. I had the volume up a little too high, and when my test CD was finished and I took the buds out of my ears, I felt that my ears were ringing a little bit. Next time I'll set the volume lower.<br/><br/>As an interesting aside, I'll compare the sound quality to another wearable that I just got, the Bose Frames (audio sunglasses, a weirdly interesting product). The sound from the Bose Frames is "smooth" in a very wonderful way -- much better than the buds. However, the Bose Frames have absolutely no lower end -- no bass sounds at all. The sounds they do have are great. By contrast, these buds are full range, with pretty good bass. But the sound just isn't smooth.<br/><br/>I didn't try to take a phone call., so I don't know how seamless this works. Considering it's Samsung, and I have a Galaxy S9, I bet this works well enough. I'm not very fussy about sound quality on calls -- I just need to be able to understand what's being said. So "good enough" for me is probably not hard to achieve.<br/><br/>There's a "button" on the buds that you press to skip a track, answer a call, etc. It's not a real button, it's just a touch-sensitive area on the outside of the bud. I haven't been able to get this touch point to work reliably. I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with the bud, probably just my fat fingers.<br/><br/>Bottom line? I think I'll have a use for these, most likely when I want to listen to my own music without disturbing others, and without the very wonderful but cumbersome conventional earphones. When I'm walking out and about, the smooth sound from the Bose Frames is better. So it's a toss-up with the Galaxy Buds Live. They're good enough, but unfortunately not better than that.</span>

<span>Perfect for my ears.  I've tried many wireless ear buds and so far, these are the best.  Noise canceling isn't as good as others, but that is because of their design.  They are called buds live because of the live music experience they give you.  So,  you can hear the music, which sounds great and you can hear the ambient noise around you.  For me,  that's perfect.</span>
