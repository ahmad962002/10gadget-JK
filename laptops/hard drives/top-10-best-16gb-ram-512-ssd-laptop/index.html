<span>We purchased this laptop as a backup for our photo booth business and as I was familiarizing myself with it I realized that this is now going to be our main laptop. It boots up incredibly fast and seems to be faster and more responsive than the i7 we were using. It may be due to the SS drive vs. traditional hard drive, but it makes a big difference! The screen quality is excellent and the I/O has everything that we need to connect the camera, monitor and printer. After a lot of research I am SO glad that I found and purchased this one.</span>

<span>I got this laptop in 2021. After tax my total was around $725. Which is a lot of money for me. This laptop has been extremely frustrating. Every single time I use it, the screen will go blue and says “your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart” But it never restarts, even if it says 100% complete, it won’t. It just stays like that on the screen. This happens literally every time I use this laptop. I’ll be in the middle of something important and then the screen turns blue and I lose everything I was working on.<br/>It will randomly disconnect from my Wi-Fi, even though my Wi-Fi works just fine. Then my Wi-Fi won’t even come up as an option to use. When I watch shows on the laptop, the quality is not good. I wanted to edit videos and I can’t even access my photos or videos so there’s no point in that now. It loads very slow, sometimes the down arrow on the keyboard will lag and I’ll have to restart it. Or this little clear square pops up on the screen and I can’t get rid of it so I have to restart it. I have to constantly restart this laptop for it to work somewhat properly. I should’ve just saved my money. My laptop I’ve had since 8th grade works better than this laptop! I had high hopes for this because pretty much all of the reviews are great and there’s almost 5 stars. So maybe I just got a bad one? I wouldn’t be so upset or writing this review if this hadn’t cost me $725! I expected a lot more for the price of this. Waste of my money. So disappointed.</span>

<span>I will try to cover all important information that is necessary before buying this laptop, mainly i will focus on hardware and performance .To start with , I bought this laptop for my study purposes and with 16gb of RAM it works great, However if you are seeking for games as well , i would not recommend this laptop due to low screen quality and Graphic card.<br/>MANUFACTURING - The laptop is made of plastic , quality is good but Could not compete metal body. Moreover , I love the design of screen , almost minimum bezel and it gives a premium look. Keyboard keys are smooth.I sometimes face a little issues with touchpad sometimes it stuck or hangs maybe i can call it less sensitive that isn't a big issue to worry also the touchscreen works really fine , no worries at all. There are no lights under keyboard pads,so it makes it difficult to type in dark.<br/>PERFORMANCE- This laptop starts pretty fast in almost under 20 secs, it will boot up and take you to desktop. I played Asphalt 9 on this laptop on the very first day and it played smoothly  , and you can play other games also but problem will be that it will be in low quality due to less resolution of screen otherwise processor has no problem in running games (for more information you can search for processor details on google according to your priorities).I would not recommend for gaming purposes.<br/>THINGS TO NOTE- Since this product is available from third party you won’t be getting 12 months warranty cause they upgrade the laptop and then deliver further, in my case i got 9 months of warranty.<br/>Laptop is quite slim and gives a quite unique look. No problem with wifi and battery (4-5hrs on screen battery backup). This was all i knew , To sum up product requires smooth handling due to plastic build , system never hanged for me although i tried to overload it .So if you are looking for light usage and minimal gaming its great also touchscreen is a great feature. .I have attached few screenshots of the device full name and general specs</span>

<span> It’s my first MacBook, I’ve been a Windows user my whole life.<br/><br/>I've been using it for 10 days and it’s fantastic, great battery, amazing sound, ProMotion and 4K HDR looks astonishing. Only have one little (big) complaint.<br/><br/>I notice that on the display there are some tiny black dots, dead pixels, I called to Amazon (they have a 90-day warranty) but since it was not a software problem, they told me to solve it with Apple and it’s recommendation was to visit an authorized seller, that means that if I have to replace the display, I will stay 1 month without laptop.<br/><br/>Very bad experience considering the price of the equipment, it arrived in perfect condition, new (I took advantage of the USD 400 discount from the sale) and the box in excellent condition too, I guess it's a random issue, but to be aware of.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's a factory fault, I'm only afraid that the problem gets worse, meanwhile, I'll try to ignore it.</span>

<span>This thing is very fast and the screen quality is amazing. The 14” M1 Pro is the perfect laptop for anyone who uses Final Cut, it’s super fast exporting in ProRes, my 2015 would take hours, I can go to sleep and wake up to find it still exporting. This thing does the same project in minutes. The speakers sound great, I tried the 16” but I didn’t like it, even though it sounded better because of the larger speakers. The keyboard and larger trackpad looked off to me, the machine was great but I didn’t like the design of the 16”, too much empty space. The 14” keyboard and trackpad fill up most of the space and looks great, The 14” is the perfect size for all around usage. It beats all laptops out there and most desktop available.<br/><br/>The M1 Pro is a great upgrade if you’re coming from an older MacBook Pro. I skipped the 2016 to 2019 because of the ports and dongle. The SD card slot is very important to many of us and to see that it’s back, is just awesome. “14 is the perfect upgrade for the 2015MPB lovers. It has the same similar style ports but the updated versions, plus the MagSafe is back.<br/><br/>I love the preamps on the headphone jack it’s very loud and clear compared to my other macs. Love how you can charge it using the MagSafe or any of the three usb-c ports. I can finally use my portable charger.<br/><br/>I’m glad I got the 1tb as it comes with the 10 core plus it’s faster in comparison. The 8 core is still a great option plus better battery life, but the 1tb Will be better for “future proofing”. My 2015 has 512gb and it fills up quickly when doing multiple projects, with the 1tb I at least get some breathing room.</span>

<span>The Battery life is the only down side of this macbook pro 2021<br/><br/>This is a great laptop to use for productivity, which is why I mainly purchased it. Has a reliable reputation, bright AF screen, sturdy chassis, 16gb ram is good enough for most users so it's pretty damn fast, and just an overall well rounded computer. There are however a few things I do no like about the computer itself and macos. I come from a long line of window users and continue to prefer windows over macos.<br/><br/>1.) The keyboard is so mushy! It's so annoying to use. I own a 2018 MacBook Pro and I prefer the keyboard on that 1000 times over. It's more response and tactile. I absolutely hate the keyboard on the macbook 14. I went out of my way to purchase a logitech craft keyboard and that's amazing let me tell you.<br/><br/>2.) The window splitting on macos is so stupid! I cannot have multiple windows open on the first attempt. I wish it was more like windows were you just drag them to the side and you split it! Boom that is so simple.<br/><br/>3.) Macos does not support a lot of games, but that's a pretty decent trade off I guess.<br/><br/>4.) The price and the fact that for that price it's not customizable.<br/><br/>I mean there aren't a lot of bad things about it but for the life of me I am unable to stand this pc when I need to have multiple excel spreadsheets and Adobe or Word documents open! I usually end up closing this pc in frustration and just use my blade 14! Now that's a PC! Just wish the screen was oled or at least 4k, but it's fine. I would prefer that over the macbook 14 anyway.</span>

<span>I got the base 256GB 8GB of ram model and this thing does everything I need it to and more. I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding. Cannot recommend this thing enough. Great job Apple.</span>

<span>I had windows before and now I have a Mac. This is a great purchase. The laptop made a big impression on me.<br/>The delivery: I was supposed to sign for it upon delivery and I never did. It was dropped off on my front doorstep. She caught me doing something with my hands full and wet, and I assume she had to be going to her next delivery to stay on schedule. Back to the Mac review.<br/>The M2 Air: What can I tell you? This thing is really small. Upon taking it out of its packaging, I held it in my hands and it felt like I was holding a composition notebook, but a tad bit lighter. It does not feel like holding an envelope like it was revealed back in the first Mac Air laptop. It was like holding a windows surface laptop, except lighter. The laptop turned on on its own and I set up everything in less than half an hour. I may miss right clicking with my old windows laptop, but holding down the scrolling pad is way easier on this thing. I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now.<br/>The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboard<br/>is about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for.<br/>Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that.<br/>Multi-tasking / browsing / usage<br/>Some sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage.<br/>Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves.<br/>And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go. Thanks for the read through on my review and to Amazon for this amazing machine. Farewell.</span>

<span>I'm a grad student studying Data Science, and this laptop is outperforming my older macbook pro. Prior to owning this laptop, I owned a Macbook pro 2020 (intel) with 16gb of RAM. I was a little hesitant to get a 8gb macbook air at first because I was afraid of the laptop not being able to handle intensive processing. Luckily, I've had not issues with it throttling under load. I've had pcs that only had 8bg of ram and they'd struggle with multiple chrome tabs. This macbook air is able to handle multiple tabs of chrome while training a machine learning model.</span>

WAY OVERPRICED for what it is - wish I could say something great. I can't PS IF THERE IS ANYWAY I CAN GET AN EXCHANGE I THINK I WANT ONE THIS CASE IS CRACKING DAILY!!!! PS THE CRACK RUINED THE CORE OF THE LAPTOP AND IT HAD TO BE DESTROYED. STAY AWAY. I CAN'T EVEN GET A PARTIAL CREDIT TOWARD SOMETHING ELSE FROM THIS SELLER. SO FOR LAPTOPS I THINK I WILL GO RETAIL so I can see the hinges.</span>

<span>Quick delivery,accurate description of product. Has everything I was looking for in home use laptop including ODD. Initial setup was easy. I will be adding some software(Gimp)... Battery life @midrange use setting is 9+ hrs. Currently at 60% which translates to 6hrs. Great for work /school on the go. Screen can be hard to see when watching movie/gaming depending on back lighting in room and screen angle view. Side speekers are clear /loud. Mouse pad takes some getting used to but not bad.</span>

<span>The power button didn't work so I couldn't turn my computer on to begin with. A friend suggested holding the button down and this actually worked. He said it was probably a hibernation issue and this was no big deal. I was able to go through the set up procedure and then the screen started flashing. I shut down the computer and started over, but the flashing worsened.  For this being a brand new computer to be having these issues right out of the box is unacceptable. I had no choice but to return it. Very disappointed as I was really excited about this computer. I've had 3 Gateways before and loved them.</span>
