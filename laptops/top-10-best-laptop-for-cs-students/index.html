<span>I have only used Microsoft on computers but found this to be great. Contrary to comments from others, there is no problem with the picture quality. I am hard of hearing and the sound is not loud enough for me is the only thing I can criticize it for. It does not have a touch screen so I can't rate that and haven't had it long enough to rate the battery life except is last a long time before charging.</span>

<span>Purchased on April 22, 2022 and it completely stopped working on October 13, 2022. A blank white screen &amp; nothing would work!! Then you are stuck having to contact HP Customer Service for them to determine if you receive a refund. It’s not worth the hassle!! Very disappointed in this product.</span>

<span>This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet.  I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.<br/><br/>Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid.  The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal.  The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.<br/><br/>It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once.  The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated.  Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook?  You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates.  I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.<br/><br/>If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy.  It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place.  I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough.</span>

<span>I am one who will buy a product based on reviews and all of the reviews here were giving this chrome book such high praise, I figured it’d be worth a shot.<br/>What did I need? Something slim, lightweight, easy to transport, something with speed and CHEAP.<br/>I was in desperate need of a new laptop b/c mine is a dinosaur, very clunky and sloooow. Being in school is what really got me looking and trying to save up for a MacBook was never going to happen on my student budget. This little Lenovo chrome book is quick, sleek, and slim. And most of all, only $100. No touch screen but the battery life is incredible. I use it a few hours every day and only have to recharge it every 3-4 days. I use this chrome book for Google docs, internet surfing/research and e-mail. With that being said, I’m not using much storage so I can’t speak to that.<br/>GREAT buy as it was everything I needed for an unbeatable price.</span>

<span>You might think that only 4 gb for a Windows 10 laptop that cant expand the ram is a bad idea... Well, I've found this small laptop is actually fine, even quick for internet browsing, email, word processing and watching videos.  Sure, the keyboard is smaller, but even with large hands, I had no trouble typing...<br/><br/> Obviously, this is not a good choice for gaming or video editing work.  Battery life is very good for the intended basic uses; not Apple Ipad good;  but should give you at least 6+ hours for the basics...<br/><br/> It DOES have a micro SD slot, in addition to the 2 USB ports.<br/><br/>While you can't expand the RAM, you can also expand the storage with an internal NVME stick.<br/><br/>This is a great idea as it noticeably speeds up the computer if you make it the boot drive.  I added a 500GB Samsung 980 NVME stick and am very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Having read about issues with the Samsung Magician cloning software, and difficulties in making a boot drive change work well on this laptop; let me tell you what worked well for me...<br/><br/>Ordered the Samsung nvme stick, along with a $15 external USB enclosure for this type of chewing gum stick size drive. Downloaded the free version of Easeus Partition Master software to clone the built in Asus L210 drive. Loaded the new stick in the external drive enclosure, connected the drive with a USB cable to a USB slot on the Asus, and followed the directions to clone the Asus C drive.  Opened the Asus and inserted the Samsung stick into the open nvme slot. Pressed power button holding down F2 key to get into bios.<br/><br/>Change the boot order to start with the nvme stick. Save and exit. Booting then detected issues with Windows, so choose to download and install a new, clean copy of Windows 10.  ( If you do this right after you have received the Asus, then you don't have any reason to save data or settings on this Windows clean install.  You don't yet have any personal data to save.)  When Windows is finished with the reinstall, make sure to do your windows updates.<br/><br/>After that is done, use Disk management tool to reformat the original drive,  and resize the partitions on the new nvme drive to what is available.<br/><br/>Now your little, inexpensive laptop is faster, with plenty of drive space.  Certainly one of the better values you can get in a very portable size, great for traveling when you may not want to carry a larger, more expensive laptop.  Screen quality is very good, and the Asus has a full size hdmi out for easy video sharing.  Definitely recommended for the price point and its intended use.</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop to use as a spare machine in my consulting practice, and also for use with my ham radio hobby. When I saw the specs on this laptop, followed by the price, I couldn't help but order one. My key requirements were size, weight, and a decent screen. This little machine fits all of those requirements in spades.<br/><br/>I have been more than impressed with the L210's performance and features. While it's definitely not a gaming machine, it's more than adequate for anyone that needs to do web browsing, office apps, and other non CPU- or memory-intensive tasks.<br/><br/>I'll start with the cons:<br/>- 4GB RAM (non-expandable/soldered in, despite Asus page stating otherwise)<br/>- 64GB SSD (easily expandable; I added a 500GB SSD for about $50)<br/>- Just adequate screen resolution (1366x768) - fine for most tasks<br/>- Non-back lit keyboard (even though the product listing says that it is backlit)<br/>- Relatively slow, but adequate Intel Celeron CPU<br/>- Limited USB-C support; cannot charge the laptop via USB-C and it will not support an external USB-C monitor adapter.<br/>- Weird 10-key pad on the touch pad. Enabled via a small button on the touch pad; it's too easy to accidentally turn it on, wreaking havoc when you use the touchpad. No way to permanently disable via BIOS.<br/>- No touch screen, but not surprising given the price point<br/><br/>All of the above were clearly spelled out in the product description, so none of them were a surprise. And several of them were definitely design decisions, in order to keep the cost down and the battery life high.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Amazing battery life. I've been seeing 8-11 hours per charge in normal use<br/>- Super lightweight and small form factor; 2.3 pounds/1.05kg and very thin<br/>- Nice port options. Built-in HDMI, USB-C plus 2 "classic" USB ports<br/>- Expandable hard drive via "M2" SSD stick. Took me about 5 minutes and $50 to expand storage by 500GB<br/>- Very nice keyboard, rivaling much more expensive laptops<br/>- Comes with Windows 10 "S mode", easily upgraded to Windows 10 Home for no charge<br/>- Really great price. I had fully expected to have to buy an unknown branded laptop at this price point. Asus is a great brand with a history of providing good support and high-quality products.<br/><br/>In summary, I'm very pleased with this purchase. It fits the bill for my needs perfectly and has fantastic battery life. It weighs less than my iPad Pro with folio keyboard and runs full Windows 10, including all of the apps that I need it to run.<br/><br/>Of the cons listed above, only the 4GB RAM limitation and the lack of a backlit keyboard are major annoyances. That said, this machine supplies all of the functionality that I need as a backup / travel / ham radio laptop. Since I have other machines for video editing / gaming / etc, I don't need this machine for those tasks.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a nice little laptop for basic office tasks, this is a great choice!<br/><br/>(I forgot to mention that Asus is giving me a 90-day warranty extension in exchange for writing this review.)</span>

<span>After many years of using actual netbooks, I was in the market for something the same shape and size after they discontinued the term. I wanted something that was somewhat future proof and wouldn't crap out after a few windows updates like all of my previous models.<br/><br/>I saw a video review (it is posted on here and elsewhere) and knew this was the netbook for me. The NVME expansion slot plus the SD card reader made this thing elite compared to other models. I popped a 512GB in here and am able to install old video games, my programs, and even a virtual machine or two.<br/><br/>Windows 10 runs flawlessly on this. Bootup times are a breeze. Program loading times can be a bit slow compared to a much higher end model, but for something as light as this, it is incredible how responsive this little engine that can is.<br/><br/>As everyone will tell you, this thing does not game well. It will play games of yesteryear which is exactly what I bought it for, but of course I tested things like Left4Dead, Tower Unite, and a few others. Left4dead barely runs on here even at lowest settings. Farm Together needs render quality dropped to the bare minimum. I was actually expecting it to run some UT3 engine and Source Engine games at minimal settings, but it failed horribly. I also noticed in the bios, there is not much wiggle room to throw more memory at the GPU and I think that is where is struggles outside of the already known single channel memory flaw. So if you are looking for the casual game of Simcity 2000 or Roller Coast Tycoon, this can handle it, just don't expect to play anything after the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have not made the jump to Windows 11 yet and am a little weary because of the 4GB limitation, but it is constantly reminding me to upgrade so I know that it is fully 11 ready for future proofing.<br/><br/>The numpad seems like a cool idea at first, but I had trouble getting the hang of it and often forget it is even there. I think this is a great feature and may serve a college student who isn't used to traditional trackpads very well. My old self is just so used to a traditional laptop, I need to train myself to utilize it.<br/><br/>I love this netbook and would definitely buy another one if there is an upgraded model in the future when this one starts showing age. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something small with decent storage and great response times.</span>

<span>I had a previous version of this laptop before so after four years I decided to get a replacement and gift my old one to a friend.  The laptop works great just like the last one.  It's perfect for basic work like office suites and surfing the web,  It is lightweight and I take it with me when living abroad.  The only issue I have with it is that even though I have the power management set to shut entirely down with either the lid closed or pressing the power button, The battery isn't holding the charge.  I can fully charge it, shut down and unplug it; in about three days, it will be about 35 percent battery life.  However, I don't know if its MS 11 or the Hardware itself.  Other than that, I love the Asus product line and this little laptop. Just don't expect it to be fully charged if you leave it unplugged after a few days.</span>

<span>I personally love this laptop, in fact, I'm writing this review on this laptop, but that's only because it's the right laptop for my needs. This laptop is not for everyone, because I don't believe it's all that practical to be used for multimedia purposes, AKA, gaming and streaming, etc. There are specific reasons why I say this, and one of the reasons for that, is yes, just like the other reviewers say, the screen is a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to say that the screen isn't bad, it's just not great. It is a full HD display, but you do pretty much have to look straight at it to get a clear picture. You can see it okay from certain angles, but nothing too fancy. That's why I don't think it's good for multimedia, for example, if you want a laptop to stream movies and watch shows with friends and family, I would not recommend this laptop. It'll stream it just fine, because this computer is very fast, but the picture won't give a clear picture to a group of people watching it. However, if it was you, then I'd say go for it.<br/><br/>The other reason why I don't think this laptop is good for multimedia use, is because of the audio. I am going to be brutally honest when I say that the audio on this laptop is absolutely horrible. I put max volume on my Spotify, and it the volume was so unimpressive, that I could comfortably hold a conversation with someone next to it. So, not only will the screen give a person issues, but unless you have a good speaker connected, you're not going to hear any music, shows, or movies very well with this one.<br/><br/>I also don't recommend gaming on this laptop, not just for the reasons already stated above, but because of performance. This computer can perform very well at several multimedia tasks in terms of processor and memory, and you could play some simple games. But the moment you talk about WoW, or Overwatch... well, let's just say I don't believe this laptop was designed to be a gaming laptop.<br/><br/>That all being said, I love this computer because I don't need a laptop for gaming, or for multimedia purposes. I am a writer, and I also love doing research, and doing basic stuff like checking email, or Reddit. For those basic tasks, this computer is actually quite phenomenal. Because of the SSD (Solid State Drive for those that don't know), it boots up very fast. It could be completely off, and from the time I push the button to turn it on, to the time the computer is ready for whatever task I want to do, barely 4 or 5 seconds have passed. That is not an exaggeration!<br/><br/>The battery lasts for several hours, as long as you're smart about it. Like making sure the light on the keyboard is either off or low, when using the battery, and turning the screen brightness down. You can google tricks like that to extend battery life on all kinds of electronics, but as long as you do those basic things, the battery should last at least 6-7 hours.<br/><br/>The processor is super fast, and I never have to wait more than seconds, if that, for the computer to act on anything I do. The moment I click on Google Chrome, the browser and my personal front page is up in less than 2 seconds. This computer is very fast, and despite what I've said before about the screen and audio, it actually does stream Netflix and all the other streaming apps pretty well.<br/><br/>To anyone wanting to play games, watch movies with friends/family, or listen to loud music, I would not recommend this laptop. However, if you want a laptop to do everything else, I would not only recommend this laptop, but I would even go so far as to say that it's the best one on the market, for its price.</span>

<span>First of all, this is a big upgrade for me. My previous laptop was a Toshiba C55 with Intel i3 4th Gen proccesor, 8gb DDR3 ram and a 256 SSD. I was ok with that laptop but I felt that I needed an upgrade. Man I made the right decision!<br/><br/>This laptop has everything I've wanted in a computer, except the graphics card of course. All in all, I'm really happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. This laptop is thin and light. I can definitely take this laptop anywhere without noticing that I really have it with me.<br/>2. I've seen some comments that the sound is bad. Well guess what, It's not bad at all. Not the quality of a Mackbook pro, but come on, for the price? It actually sounds pretty good. Those two speakers in the bottom, when hitting against the table, it bounces off giving a really good base sound, allthough they have the potential to get a bit louder, but that aside, it's great for a laptop this thin.<br/>3. Others say that the screen is horrible. I don't see anything horrible about it. It's not full IPS quality, but the 1080p screen looks pretty good. Again, taking you back to the price, can't beat it.<br/>4. The backlit keyboard is beautiful! Even though the keyboard needs a bit more work (make it feel more clicky), the white backlit makes this laptop look like a pro when putting it side by side with other well known brands out there.<br/>5. There's enough peripherals for what I need. Comes with 2 USB's on the left side, 1 USB-A on the right side, HDMI, USB-C and the sd card slot. Not bad for the size of this laptop. Enough for a thin laptop. Unfortunately it didn't come with an ethernet port, which I use a lot for a more stable connection, but that's what external usb network arapters are for.<br/>6. Extra slot for another 2.5 HDD/SSD. Not many laptops at this price range have that, so I'm really glad this one does in case I want to expand my storage a bit more.<br/>7. The battery life is just great. The first time I fully charged it, I used it for about 5 hours and it still had some juice left. I think I could have used it up to 6 hours for me to charge it back again. I used it with minimum backlit brightness and about half screen brightness. Not bad at all. Oh, and the charging time, amazing, from 10% to 100% in about an hour, could have been less<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The flex cable adapter for the additional internal HDD/SDD is not included in the box. I believe this should be included all the time for all of the laptops that offer the chance to expand the storage. Not much of a biggie though, you can find that adapter in amazon for about 12 bucks.<br/>2. Cannot upgrade the ram further than 16gb + the integrated 4gb that's soldered into the motherboard. This is unfortunate since it would have been a great oportunity to add some options to update the RAM to 32gb.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are way more pros than cons, so you can definitely tell that I really like this laptop. Give it a try, I totally recommend it.</span>

<span>This laptop is genuinely pretty good. You probably won't find a faster laptop for this price point. Most laptops around this price tag use a few year-olds processor, while these uses a true 2022 processor. Intel's 12th gen i3 here is so much powerful than the competition. 3x faster than my old laptop that I had to replace, that was nearly the same price as this 3 years ago.<br/><br/>You definitely should spend the 40$ to add an 8GB stick of RAM to the laptop to completely unlock this beast.<br/><br/>The only complaint is the screen. It's simply not good. Not only is it a slightly above 720P screen (pretty low for 2022), the viewing angles and colors are also atrocious. You could remediate this by using a proper screen (usb c!), however that defeats the purpose of a laptop. But it's very much good enough, just wish it was better.</span>

<span>I have used Chromebooks for business for the last 10 years or so and this one does not disappoint. As described it starts up fast and quickly jumps online.

It immediately accessed my files and links with log-in and password information intact. My previous Chromebook had a larger screen, but oddly, I prefer the smaller one for better portability. I am well pleased and plan on using this until expires in another 5 years or so! I certainly do not miss the slow boot-ups and file updates of a PC.</span>

<span>I purchased this device for my son, for college. It’s perfect for his needs. He writes papers, does research, even has several windows open at a time, with no slow down in performance.<br/><br/>So far, it’s reliable, it’s fast, it’s easy to use. Neither my son nor I have any complaints. He’s actually surprised at how well it’s working for him. I’m well pleased.</span>

<span>For the money I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I've had the machine for about 3 weeks now and it only took 3 days to arrive, just in time for me to prepare documents, etc for my troop meeting. My only complaint is trying to use M364 tools (Word) was VERY slow so I reverted back to Google docs. I'm downloading all our wedding photos to it so it will probably take up most of the 64 GB of space but I'm ok with that as well.</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop with the sole purpose of installing Linux. I didn't want to mess with my better computers Secure Boot to try to dual boot it. I  had read on one website that this particular model, and this processor worked well with Linux.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that Manjaro XFCE Linux installed and booted flawlessly. The only thing I had to do was change the display resolution - very easy to do with the graphical tools included. The only problem was a setting the proper time. I had to do that through the terminal, but was extremely simple and has maintained the proper time ever since.<br/><br/>The display quality doesn't match my more expensive laptop, but is more than  acceptable for normal use, including watching videos. The computer is fairly responsive for normal use, including watching videos.  All in all,  I am happy with this computer for running a Linux distribution.</span>

<span>I'm writing this for a typical user, using plain language, so they know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation, which is a monster configured for performance, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop, knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy, but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced, and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.<br/><br/>My preferred browser is Opera, so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault, that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world, so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.<br/><br/>My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge, the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages, and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it, until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate, and that's a serious problem.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it came optimized the way I made, it, I'd give it a 4, maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3, if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year, and based on what I saw, there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email, that has better data management than a Chromebook, then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.</span>

<span>I bought this HP Stream because my 2012 Mac is dead and I really don't use a computer anymore. My iPhone 12 Pro works just fine for everyday use, and I just can't afford to buy a new Mac right now. So, I just needed an inexpensive little computer to connect to the internet to do personal business and take online classes. I do not intend to store anything on this computer, but rather continue to use my iCloud for storage and Google Apps if necessary.<br/><br/>You can download the necessary cloud apps such as iCloud, Google Drive, and shortcuts to Google Docs, Sheets, or whatever you like. Once I got the computer set up, I went in and uninstalled Microsoft Office. I don't care that it's free for a year. Google Suite works just fine.<br/><br/>I've used this computer quite a bit, and this is what I think about it...<br/><br/>Contrary to the negative reviews, this computer doesn't suck. You just can't have high expectations of a $350 laptop. You will be setting yourself up for a bitter disappointment. With that said....<br/><br/>The mouse and keyboard are horrible and uncomfortable to use for my taste. Granted I don't intend to use it away from home very often, but I did a couple of times and it really doesn't function like I'm used to. Also, I can't really say for certain that the wi-fi connections were all that great. It could've been the networks I was connected to. For some reason it wouldn't let me connect to my iPhone hotspot. I don't know if there is a setting that I have to adjust, but it shouldn't have been that difficult to connect.<br/><br/>However, it works FANTASTIC when I switch out my work laptop and connect it to my desk set up where it's hardwired to the internet and connected to a USB keyboard and mouse.  I am able to do personal business that requires me to use a computer rather than my iPhone. This computer IS NOT built to have sophisticated software installed such as Office, FilemakerPro, Quickbooks, Photoshop etc. It is also, not meant to store large files or photos. It is PERFECT to use cloud based software and storage.<br/><br/>I recommend this laptop as an internet terminal and NOTHING MORE! I cannot express this enough....do not expect it to perform in any other way. It's a perfect light use laptop to connect to social media (if that's your thing) or even school,  or access websites that you really can't on your smartphone. It's an affordable option as a transitional workstation.<br/><br/>Some people complained about not being able to update Windows due to lack of disk space. I suggest that you make sure you purge temporary files, internet cache, and downloads often. Also uninstall applications that you do not use or are unnecessary. This will free up a bunch of disk space. If you are using Office360, this will take up a ridiculous amount of disk space. I know it's free for the first year...but is that really worth your low disk space frustration? While you could get a Chromebook, I'm not keen to them. In a Windows OS you can set up Google Suite. It's cloud based, free, and doesn't have a trial period. You won't have to pay a subscription to keep and all your documents, photos, etc. They will be gone if you don't move them out of OneDrive and to another cloud storage at the end of the trial period. Why bother? Just set up Google account, which comes with free storage, use their version of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc and you don't have to install it on your computer. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!</span>
