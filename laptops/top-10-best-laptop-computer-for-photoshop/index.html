My iPhone 12 Pro works just fine for everyday use, and I just can't afford to buy a new Mac right now. So, I just needed an inexpensive little computer to connect to the internet to do personal business and take online classes. I do not intend to store anything on this computer, but rather continue to use my iCloud for storage and Google Apps if necessary.<br/><br/>You can download the necessary cloud apps such as iCloud, Google Drive, and shortcuts to Google Docs, Sheets, or whatever you like. Once I got the computer set up, I went in and uninstalled Microsoft Office. I don't care that it's free for a year. Google Suite works just fine.<br/><br/>I've used this computer quite a bit, and this is what I think about it...<br/><br/>Contrary to the negative reviews, this computer doesn't suck. You just can't have high expectations of a $350 laptop. You will be setting yourself up for a bitter disappointment. With that said....<br/><br/>The mouse and keyboard are horrible and uncomfortable to use for my taste. Granted I don't intend to use it away from home very often, but I did a couple of times and it really doesn't function like I'm used to. Also, I can't really say for certain that the wi-fi connections were all that great. It could've been the networks I was connected to. For some reason it wouldn't let me connect to my iPhone hotspot. I don't know if there is a setting that I have to adjust, but it shouldn't have been that difficult to connect.<br/><br/>However, it works FANTASTIC when I switch out my work laptop and connect it to my desk set up where it's hardwired to the internet and connected to a USB keyboard and mouse.  I am able to do personal business that requires me to use a computer rather than my iPhone. This computer IS NOT built to have sophisticated software installed such as Office, FilemakerPro, Quickbooks, Photoshop etc. It is also, not meant to store large files or photos. It is PERFECT to use cloud based software and storage.<br/><br/>I recommend this laptop as an internet terminal and NOTHING MORE! I cannot express this enough....do not expect it to perform in any other way. It's a perfect light use laptop to connect to social media (if that's your thing) or even school,  or access websites that you really can't on your smartphone. It's an affordable option as a transitional workstation.<br/><br/>Some people complained about not being able to update Windows due to lack of disk space. I suggest that you make sure you purge temporary files, internet cache, and downloads often. Also uninstall applications that you do not use or are unnecessary. This will free up a bunch of disk space. If you are using Office360, this will take up a ridiculous amount of disk space. I know it's free for the first year...but is that really worth your low disk space frustration? While you could get a Chromebook, I'm not keen to them. In a Windows OS you can set up Google Suite. It's cloud based, free, and doesn't have a trial period. You won't have to pay a subscription to keep and all your documents, photos, etc. They will be gone if you don't move them out of OneDrive and to another cloud storage at the end of the trial period. Why bother? Just set up Google account, which comes with free storage, use their version of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc and you don't have to install it on your computer. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!</span>

<span>I purchased this laptop with the sole purpose of installing Linux. I didn't want to mess with my better computers Secure Boot to try to dual boot it. I  had read on one website that this particular model, and this processor worked well with Linux.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that Manjaro XFCE Linux installed and booted flawlessly. The only thing I had to do was change the display resolution - very easy to do with the graphical tools included. The only problem was a setting the proper time. I had to do that through the terminal, but was extremely simple and has maintained the proper time ever since.<br/><br/>The display quality doesn't match my more expensive laptop, but is more than  acceptable for normal use, including watching videos. The computer is fairly responsive for normal use, including watching videos.  All in all,  I am happy with this computer for running a Linux distribution.</span>

<span>For the money I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I've had the machine for about 3 weeks now and it only took 3 days to arrive, just in time for me to prepare documents, etc for my troop meeting. My only complaint is trying to use M364 tools (Word) was VERY slow so I reverted back to Google docs. I'm downloading all our wedding photos to it so it will probably take up most of the 64 GB of space but I'm ok with that as well.</span>

<span>I needed a laptop with a decent battery life, and room for upgrade. Mostly for office work and media consumption. Web surfing needed, strong wifi, I wanted S mode for security. I wanted access to office.com for document use. I wanted decent audio too. The laptop I got provided all of that. The audio at 100 percent was adequate for media, but my Bluetooth speaker works better. I can still hear it fine without the Bluetooth. I charged the laptop to 100 percent and watched a series, I like, for three hours before it reached 50 percent. So, for media consumption at full brightness gave me plenty of battery. I think I could get a total of five- or six-hours watching movies. I charged it back up from 50 percent to 100 percent in two hours while I watched more series episodes. I keep the touch pad turned off all the time. I never use it, because I prefer a wireless mouse. The laptop is about the size of my 14-inch Chromebook. This laptop, however, is more powerful. So far, I am pleased with this purchase. This would not be suitable for gaming or video editing, but I use my desktop for those things. I recommend this laptop for the things I've mentioned and the low price. The laptop I bought has the following specs.<br/>Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop was delivered in two days.

<span>I got this for my elderly mother-in-law who uses a computer almost exclusively for emailing. So she doesn’t need a whole lot of memory; 4/64 gigs is plenty of memory. At this price point, it’s a surprisingly attractive and solidly made laptop—comparable in initial quality, fit/finish to a MacBook. By far the worst aspect of this unit is the inclusion of Windows ‘S’ mode. The ‘S’ stands for safety; I have another word in mind! I won’t go into the ugly details here; half of the other reviews will do that. Suffice it to say that I opted out of ‘S’ mode, despite the possible risks/downsides. Many have complained about the keyboard; I see no problem with it whatsoever. Other than the ‘S’ mode issue, the laptop itself may just be the best inexpensive PC I’ve encountered.</span>

<span>If you are using this laptop just for normal use like streaming videos, Ms Office. Great for consuming contents but not great for making yourself productive. It cannot handle adobe products or any heavy software that requires GPU or even the CPU. If u start using even like 3 tabs the fan noise just irritates your ear and the bottom part gets Super HOT. My best suggestion, get an external Fan along with this laptop if u have one.</span>

<span>I got this laptop in 2021. After tax my total was around $725. Which is a lot of money for me. This laptop has been extremely frustrating. Every single time I use it, the screen will go blue and says “your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart” But it never restarts, even if it says 100% complete, it won’t. It just stays like that on the screen. This happens literally every time I use this laptop. I’ll be in the middle of something important and then the screen turns blue and I lose everything I was working on.<br/>It will randomly disconnect from my Wi-Fi, even though my Wi-Fi works just fine. Then my Wi-Fi won’t even come up as an option to use. When I watch shows on the laptop, the quality is not good. I wanted to edit videos and I can’t even access my photos or videos so there’s no point in that now. It loads very slow, sometimes the down arrow on the keyboard will lag and I’ll have to restart it. Or this little clear square pops up on the screen and I can’t get rid of it so I have to restart it. I have to constantly restart this laptop for it to work somewhat properly. I should’ve just saved my money. My laptop I’ve had since 8th grade works better than this laptop! I had high hopes for this because pretty much all of the reviews are great and there’s almost 5 stars. So maybe I just got a bad one? I wouldn’t be so upset or writing this review if this hadn’t cost me $725! I expected a lot more for the price of this. Waste of my money. So disappointed.</span>

<span>We purchased this laptop as a backup for our photo booth business and as I was familiarizing myself with it I realized that this is now going to be our main laptop. It boots up incredibly fast and seems to be faster and more responsive than the i7 we were using. It may be due to the SS drive vs. traditional hard drive, but it makes a big difference! The screen quality is excellent and the I/O has everything that we need to connect the camera, monitor and printer. After a lot of research I am SO glad that I found and purchased this one.</span>

<span>SUMMARY<br/>A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.<br/><br/>LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE<br/>Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021.  I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.<br/><br/>The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks.  A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those "laptop-y" things... and an 11" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.<br/><br/>PRIME DAY HUNTING<br/>With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook.  I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago.  A few other "deals" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).<br/><br/>I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).<br/><br/>I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review.  In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.<br/><br/>UNBOXING AND USE<br/>When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook.  I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook).  No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.<br/><br/>The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.<br/><br/>The screen is a matte screen... yes!  I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.<br/><br/>The trackpad works well and is consistent.<br/><br/>Battery life is extremely good.  I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours.  I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.<br/><br/>Performance is more than adequate.  The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.<br/><br/>TAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT<br/>Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit.  It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired.  That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.<br/><br/>Lenovo has been "killing it" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space.  Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.<br/><br/>I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were.  I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.<br/><br/>I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.<br/><br/>I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks.  I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.</span>

<span>Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.<br/><br/>Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.<br/><br/>I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment.</span>

<span>Item #1 below is focused on Windows 10 S Mode. I didn't intend to write so much about S Mode, but I did so and thus it is there for you to consider. The rest of the comments made are about the Asus laptop itself.<br/><br/>1.) I find Windows 10 S Mode to be excellent. The more I use it, the more I like it. {I've used S Mode on other devices for about 8-months.) You can exit S Mode easily, but I say it is really an awesome and an under rated OS. It virtually blocks malware, period. You can't tell the laptop is in S Mode unless you try to install something from outside of the Windows Store. Unless you are a gamer or need some special program, S Mode should be considered. It can save you a lot of concern about being compromised by hacking, which is becoming more of a concern of late, especially with the increase in sophistication in attacks from nation states and organized crime. Yep, I'm a techy with an opposing view to the techie press. Seems they mostly trash Windows 10 S Mode, but they rarely seem to articulate the benefits of S Mode. I think Microsoft should do a better job of marketing the OS. Why they don't is beyond me.<br/><br/>I upgraded from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro via the Windows Store. I then as an admin joined this device to Office 365's Intune. I realize the tech world seems to talk down Windows 10 S Mode, but I am a contrarian and think it is outstanding. Also, S Mode requires way less Windows updates than regular Windows so, again, I am a fan. As an admin, I don't need to concern myself with updates as much. This OS is really hard to compromise.<br/><br/>2.) This laptop is an outstanding value for the price. It has and i3 Intel processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD hard drive. Really, this is perfect configuration for the average business or college user. The performance is excellent for what it is equipped with. The i3 Intel chip works a lot better than most people realize. Even running when streaming video, it does well.<br/><br/>3.) The display is adequate for business use. If you are a gamer or watching lots of video, it will likely be somewhat disappointing, good displays cost. You don't usually get something for nothing. Again, the display is adequate for what it is. Although the viewing angles are tight, I've seen other reviewers comments about the display and find their comments exaggerated and I wonder what they expect for a laptop that costs less than $500. Let me add that I have worked on a lot of PCs over the years, and I can tell you this display is good, but not great. However, if you want a premium display, like I said earlier, you need to pay for it. Again, this display is good enough for general use.<br/><br/>4.) The ports provided are the latest version of each type provided. Again, this laptop is a great value for the cost.<br/><br/>5.) The backlit keyboard is really good. I like the feel of the keys, and I like the numeric pad. The keyboard is quiet and comfortable to type on.<br/><br/>6.) The laptop's body/frame. Is plastic. Looks pretty darn good given the price of the unit. However, I am unsure as to how strong the body is should the laptop take a fall. I'm not doing a drop-test on this one because I have pay for it if I break it, but again, the price point of this laptop gives you a pretty darn good device for the price.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: A surprisingly great laptop for the under $500 price charged and will be appreciated by a general or average user. (Suggestion: Keep the device in S Mode and save yourself malware and update headaches.)</span>

<span>Like many of the reviews said, the volume is not very loud, but sound is not something I use my computer for a lot. I have a bluetooth speaker that can give me all the volume I want when I do want it. I think the screen is nicer than what some had described, especially at the price point this computer came in at. Also like many reviews said, the keyboard is not backlit as it is described, unless I'm missing something to turn it on. This was not really a big deal to me, but wish it wouldn't be in the description if it don't have it. Otherwise, I've had it for a few days and am enjoying it very much. For what I paid it seems very fast for my use and a great value.</span>

<span>Lenovo laptops are usually very reliable. I’ve used them for work and used a friend’s for gaming on one occasion. The things to love about this specific Lenovo Laptop are the size, the ventilation, and the speed. First of all, the screen is an optimum size for gaming. I have been needing to cast games onto my larger monitor for better visuals but I find that this screen is often too big for a more specific focus (especially in shooter games) and this screen is truly the perfect size—not too small, not too big. This also features quad vent ventilation which helps it keep cool even with long-term usage. Usually, these computers need an extra strong fan which can be a bit noisy, but this fan is nice and quiet and goes on with more of a lulling noise than a mechanical one. It can actually be quite calming! I’ve used this for over 3 hours at a time and didn’t notice any extreme heat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this computer is a bit heavier than the others I’ve used before. If you want this to be stationary for a desk, then that is fine, but laptops are meant for travel and this one is a lug to bring anywhere. It charges quickly but the battery is extremely large and is the majority of the weight here. I haven’t had any issues with battery life so far (it is about 6-8 hour battery life, and more like 4 when used consistently for gaming).<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a great computer for gaming. The matte screen helps with eye fatigue, the battery life is excellent for long-term use, and the fan is nice and quiet for white noise. I recommend it!</span>

<span>I've been running a Ryzen 7 4700U (bought Feb 2021 for $600 after tax) with built in Vega 11 graphics adapter on a 16Gb laptop with expandable 256 SD-Card reader and I play most things on low end graphics, but I can play them nonetheless. I was excited to get this system that sells for under $1,000 with a Nvidia graphics card.<br/><br/>+ The Ryzen 5 6000 series is actually pretty nice.<br/>Part of me was thinking a Ryzen 5 is a step back from my Ryzen 7, but this 6000 series is 20% faster than my Ryzen 7.<br/><br/>+ You cannot beat a dedicated video card for performance.<br/>The RTX 3050 4Gb GDDR6 is over 200% faster than the Vega 11. I'm running Skyrim Anniversary Ed. on Ultra Graphics, Monster Hunter: World on Highest and still getting 60fps. Some cut scenes on Monster Hunter: World drop the FPS to 44-46, but no lag.<br/><br/>-- Only 8Gb of RAM...for a 'gaming' laptop?!?<br/>At least it's DDR5-4800MHz. But anything less than 16Gb is a bottleneck.<br/>I mean if you price it out here on Amazon to swap out 8Gb for 16Gb module is only $15 more. Really seems like a no brainer to have started this out at 16Gb and charge the extra few dollars.<br/><br/>Also, I've reached out to Technical Support and 16Gb is the MAX. So your only option to upgrade the RAM is find an additional 1x8Gb RAM from another brand that will work with the existing SO-DIMM or buy 2x8 to replace existing and have two pieces that should be 'guaranteed' to work together.<br/><br/>-- 256Gb with no SD-Card expansion...for a 'gaming' laptop?!?<br/>For me this is the biggest loss of a star here.<br/>After uninstalling the 5Gb of trial subscription of Microsoft 365;<br/>then replacing with my 3Gb standalone MS Office;<br/>then replacing the 1.3Gb of trial McAfee and replacing with my 2.5Gb BitDefender subscription;<br/>then installing Steam and Epic Games launchers;<br/>and finally another 5Gb-7Gb of productivity/utility apps...I was left with 150Gb of space.<br/>I honestly don't feel I went crazy here but tried to keep things as lean as possible.<br/><br/>Problem is 256Gb drive is too small for a 'gaming' laptop as I'm limited to only one full game of anything modern to play:<br/>Red Dead Redemption 2 = 150Gb installer<br/>Borderlands 3 = 75Gb installer<br/>Horizon Zero Dawn (2yrs old already) = 100Gb installer<br/>...and the list goes on.<br/><br/>C'mon Lenovo! To go from 256Gb M.2 2280 SSD to a 512Gb would have only been $15-$20 more here on Amazon.<br/><br/>Instead of charging customer the extra $30-$40 for the SSD and RAM improvements (just so they can have an 'under $900' tag at $899) Lenovo makes customers have to find professional technicians and spend a lot more time and money to swap these parts out to get this laptop up to what should be for 2022 some basic gaming requirements.<br/><br/>&gt; The battery is bigger at 45Wh than the 41Wh in my other laptop, but this laptop has a lot more load on the battery life. Especially with the dedicated video card.  So I get maybe 3-4hrs of internet and streaming at 80% brightness before I get the 15-20% low battery warning.<br/><br/>&gt; I like the 15.6" FHD (1920x1080) IPS screen for the speed.<br/>But as mentioned by others the Brightness is lacking.<br/>If VLC player didn't have a way to adjust brightness I couldn't effectively watch some TV shows or movies.<br/><br/>&gt; This does weigh over 5lbs, which may be heavier than some may be used to or expecting.<br/><br/>&gt; The 10-key is included in the laptop keyboard...BUT...the keys are 3/4 the size of other 10-key and thus it's difficult to type on it (I do financials and use 10-key daily) because it's all so close together.<br/><br/>+ Nice big trackpad that doesn't respond to my hands laying resting on it when typing on the keyboard, like I'm doing right now for this review.<br/><br/>&gt; I think this laptop would benefit from adding a USB hub onto it.<br/>One USB A taken up by mouse receiver/transmitter...you cannot game with a trackpad...at least not effectively.<br/>One USB C taken up by an external hard drive/SSD (only way to easily get space for music, movies, etc.)<br/>Leaving one USB A open for a game controller (some games are better on the controller than the keyboard/mouse); for transferring of files; or whatever other device you might hook up (i.e. DVD/BluRay drive or Burner, etc.)<br/><br/>+ Keyboard feels very solid and is easy to type on.<br/>AND it has a backlight that is easy to turn on/off (Fn+space bar)<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/>For a below $1,000 laptop with a nice video card, it's worth checking out.<br/>The fact this cost $300 more than my 1.5yr old laptop I would say is WORTH the extra money, which the extra cost probably comes mostly by the dedicated video card.<br/><br/>Just realize if you're really looking for a 'gaming laptop', then it feels in it's current state that upgrading the RAM and storage space are an immediate next step. Otherwise the nice video card and descent screen are going to waste as you attempt to play recent/modern games, POSSIBLY, on anything other than low graphics or not at all because of not enough RAM for the rest of the rig or not enough storage to even install the game.</span>

<span>Lenovo - 2022 - IdeaPad Gaming notebook<br/><br/>(Photo included with a widescreen monitor -- the notebook is that black shadow at the bottom)<br/><br/>Imagine you could buy a muscle car with all the parts which would be prohibitive to upgrade, like the engine block, but missing some optional parts needed to squeeze the last horsepower out of it, but wouldn't be too hard to add aftermarket. The price reflects this, and happens to match what you can spend right then.<br/><br/>There's a good chance you would go with this deal, wouldn't you? You would still have an awesome car, and you could beef it up more later with added parts. It's like money in the bank. This notebook is like that car: it has the right motors, but is a little scanty on RAM and storage--the parts than can be upgraded.<br/><br/>Out of the box you get 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD... minimalist by today's standards, but capacity to upgrade the memory to 64GB and the disks to 2TB later. I can tell you I paired this with an Alienware 38 inch ultra wide monitor, and as soon as I switched to external display only, the graphics processor knew exactly what to do with that bad boy. Other than that, I'm not a big fan of keyboards which leave your firearms resting on a large flat spot but there are many options for external keyboards. It's there if you need it.<br/><br/>On another less than perfect note, it's been a while since I activated a new Windows machine (11 Home), and I thought, this time I'm going to go with the program, Microsoft account and all, and see what MS can do for me today! I started down that path but soon they were trying to sell me an Office 365 subscription: just be a good fellow and give us your credit card now, would you? And maybe some games? The more I played along the more depressingly familiar it all seemed. Sorry, not today, MS, not today. Nothing has changed here and they might want to market to the new user like an adult.<br/><br/>This is still a solid notebook with potential, and pursuing the car metaphor the blue fins in back are a clear nod to BMW, the last automaker to embrace a full line of ICE standard shifts. I hope to own one while there is still fuel left, but perhaps there is a convincing simulation.<br/><br/>  *UPDATE*<br/><br/>On July 12 Lenovo released Security Advisory: LEN-91369 concerning a vulnerability in UEFI, which allows the insertion of malware with all the cunning and inextricability of viral DNA hiding in the mitochondria.<br/><br/>I checked the best candidate I could find for the model number against their list of affected machines: no match though many of their high-end laptops were vulnerable. I guess that's a good thing.</span>

<span>I am about to take a vacation and needed a reliable and fairly powerful unit to assemble and compile some code for a project that I am working on. Getting a laptop that is aimed at gaming should meet these requirements and exceed on others.<br/><br/>The process is pretty snappy - this is my first AMD experience, as usually I stick with Intel processors. The unit loads Windows fairly quickly and luckily is filled with bloatware. The screen is nice and sharp, however under certain situations (brighter lights, lit rooms, etc) it is not as bright as it could be.<br/><br/>It only comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB HD space - so you'll eventually want to update those for any serious use applications.<br/><br/>There is only 1 USB C port available. This is a large negative for me. Since most peripherals are migrating to USB C there should be at least 2 of these available.<br/><br/>The battery life is great - good for an all day project.<br/><br/>Overall at under $900 this is a pretty solid system. For another $100 you could upgrade the memory/storage and really make this the best.</span>
