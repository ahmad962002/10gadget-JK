<span>The label maker is easy to set up and prints great. The software is kind of a pain. It doesn’t default to standard address-label format, and makes me update the type of label every time I open it even if I haven’t touched the machine. It also doesn’t recognize generic labels, so you have to buy the more expensive branded ones. It’s great if you print a lot of one-off labels, but if you print a lot you are much better off buying sheets of labels to put in your printer.</span>

<span>Product software fails to download on brand new laptop. Unable to use printer, attempted to contact support and their site isn't working, so i guess i now own a really expensive paper weight! Never buy dymo apparently. Dymo customer service does not exist, i had to take the printer to a professional for him to fix it, i don't recommend dymo to anyone</span>

<span>When searching for a label Printer this one was suppose to be the same as we already have in our office.  It was suppose to be the Plus model but that is not what we got.  It would not work with our program and wouldn't print the labels we needed.  Return was easy and was refunded.  Thank you!</span>

<span>This is a great printer for Windows users and with the proper knowledge for Mac users too.  As a Mac user, however, I returned for replacement a perfectly good printer because I did not know how to reset the print queue.  And when I contacted tech support they knew nothing about it and only had in hand instructions to help windows users.  This is not uncommon, and because the 4XL is used primarily by business for shipping labels, no surprise.  Businesses are overwhelmingly windows users.  But if you are a Mac user, please read the comments below and buy this printer with confidence.  There are two things you need to do when the printer refuses to print but the software thinks the printer is ready to go and the print light is lit.<br/><br/>1.  Reset the printer by unplugging the power supply and wait till the blue light goes out on the front.  Count to 15 slowly to fully drain the capacitors and then plug the power back in.  80% of the time that will take care of things.<br/><br/>2.  MAC OSX USERS....  After resetting the internal software of the printer following the above instructions, the software recognizes the printer and lights the print light, and yet pressing the print button does nothing, you need to restart ("resume") the print queue.  You do this as follows:<br/><br/>(a)  Select Printers &amp; Scanners in the System Preferences Window under the apple menu at upper left.<br/>(b) Select DYMO LabelWriter 4XL under the printers list.  If it is not there, close and restart the label software.<br/>(c) Press "Open Print Queue"<br/>(d) In the upper left hand corner of the Print Queue window press "Resume".  This will start printing the jobs in the queue.  If you dont want them printed, press Pause and use the x marks by each print job to remove any or all of the items in the print queue.  When the queue is cleared, press Resume.<br/>(e) Before leaving this window press Print on the Dymo Label software and verify that it prints.  If not, make sure Resume is lit.  If not, go back to (b) and proceed until you see Resume lit and press it.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that the Dymo label software does not provide direct access to the Mac print queue so that you can resume from the label application, but it does not.  So Mac OSX users need to be cognizant that they need to resume the print process following the instructions above.  This is a great printer with decent software, but optimized for Windows.  And Tech Support was totally incapable of helping me when I called.  Nice people but all their knowledge is for windows user support.</span>

<span>I sell a lot of items on Ebay and I recently purchased this printer for the sole purpose of creating 4x6 inch Ebay Shipping Labels on a Mac.  I was worried about whether I could get it to work because I've read about the various problems other people have been having getting it configured and the fact that Label Printers are not officially supported on the Mac. I'm pretty good at figuring things out so I took a chance and bought it.  Long story short, I had to come up with my own solution in the end, but I ultimately got it to work quite easily.  And I am now happily printing out perfect 4x6 inch Shipping Labels on a Mac.  The printer is working flawlessly and the labels I'm printing are perfect.  Therefore, this is a printer I highly recommend even if you're using a Mac. Below are the step-by-step instructions on how to got it to work:<br/><br/>*********<br/><br/>How To Print Perfect 4x6 Shipping Labels from Ebay usng the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL Printer and a Mac...<br/><br/>Most users selling items on Ebay already have their computer set up to print labels to their laser printer and to other kinds of printers, and for PC users, that also includes to Label Printers as well, such as the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer.  Unfortunately for Mac users, Label Printers are not officially supported.  The good news is, there is an easy way for Mac users to make use of the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer as well, and can easily print out perfect 4 inch by 6 inch shipping labels every single time. The following explains how...<br/><br/>For Mac users, when printing a label via Ebay, on the page that says "Purchase and Print USPS Postage", once you've clicked the button that says "Purchase Postage" to buy your label, a secondary page should open allowing you to print your label.  It is on that secondary page that we will choose certain options which will allow us to print directly to the DYMO Laserwriter 4XL printer with a Mac, and we can get perfect results every time. The following are my step-by-step instructions...<br/><br/>Step 1 - After clicking on the "Purchase Postage" button and arriving on the secondary page, click the button above the label window that says "Print Label".  This will open up a Print Dialog Box to allow you to select your printing options.  Note, we will NOT be printing from this particular Print Dialog Box at this time because we first have to "crop" the label.  To accomplish this, ignore all settings and options in the current Print Dialog Box.  Instead, at the bottom of the Print Dialog Box window, click the button that says "Preview".  This will open the entire label including your receipt in a separate window in Apple's Preview program.  We will now use the "Crop" tool in Apple's Preview program to "crop" the label from the page...<br/><br/>Step 2 - Once the label is open in Apple's Preview program, you may notice that it is now oriented sideways.  Don't worry about the orientation. It will still print correctly once we're done.  In Apple's Preview program, choose the rectangular selection tool and select the area around the label where you want it to be cropped (I generally select an area about a 1/4 inch around the entire label). Once the area has been selected, choose "Crop" from the Tool menu (this crops out the receipt and all other unnecessary portions of the page).  All that is left is your label, perfectly cropped, and ready for printing.  Note, before you proceed further, make sure your DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer is connected to your computer and turned on, and that all software has been installed...<br/><br/>Step 3 - From the File menu (still in Apple's Preview program) choose the "Print" command.  This opens up the Print Dialog box again.  We will now choose certain printing options in this dialog box...<br/><br/>a.  In the Print Dialog box, from the pull-down menu that says "Printer", choose the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL as your printer.  (Note, your DYMO LabelWriter 4XL must be connected and turned on at this time in order for it to show up under this menu)...<br/><br/>b.  VERY IMPORTANT - Under the pull-down menu for "Paper Size", scan down through the list of sizes and choose the preset that says: "1744907 4 in x 6 in".  This option will match your cropped label to the 4 inch x 6 inch labels in the 4XL printer (otherwise, it will print at the wrong size).<br/><br/> c.  ALSO IMPORTANT - Under the Scaling Options, choose the "Scale to Fit" option and also the "Print Entire Image" option (this scales your label image down to fit within the 4 in x 6 in label space without any portion of it being cropped off).<br/><br/>d.  Under the pull-down menu that says "Preview", pull down the menu and choose "DYMO Options".  For the "Print Quality" setting, change the menu from "Text Only" to "Barcode and Graphics".  For the "Print Density" setting, change the menu from "Low" to "High" (this tells the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL to print the label with maximum density and with maximum contrast).<br/><br/>e.  All options have now been set.  We are now ready to print.  Click the "Print" button at the bottom of the window.  Your DYMO 4XL printer should begin printing, and should print out a perfect 4x6 shipping label every single time...<br/><br/>By following the above, I've been happily printing out perfect 4x6 shipping labels from Ebay using a DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer and a Mac.  And it's been working without a hitch...<br/><br/>**********<br/><br/>IMPORTANT UPDATE:  For those of you who are using the Mac program Garage Sale when selling items on Ebay, an excellent shipping option to complement Garage Sale is the shipping program called "Endicia" (it costs about $16 per month).  Not only does Endicia provide direct USPS Parcel Select support (which Ebay won't offer until March), but I've also learned that Endicia is fully integrated into Garage Sale.  Meaning, once you have both Garage Sale and Endicia installed on your computer, and you then make an Ebay sale, in the Inspector Palette of Garage Sale there is an option you can choose which allows you to "ship the item with Endicia".  By choosing that option from within Garage Sale, Garage Sale will then automatically find and launch your Endicia application, and the best part of all is that (...GET THIS!!!...) when Endicia opens, it will already be pre-populated with all your Ebay sale data!  That's right, you won't have to copy and paste anything because all your Ebay details for the transaction will already be imported into Endicia and you'll be ready to print your label.  All you have to do is just verify everything you see, make any changes needed, and then Print your shipping label.  It's so easy.  And did I mention that the Endicia for Mac program also offers direct support for the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer.  That's right.  Ebay doesn't offer any Label Printer support for Mac users, Paypal doesn't offer it, Stamps.com doesn't offer it, but Endicia DOES!  There is a preference option in the Endicia for Mac program where Mac users can now print directly to the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer without any fuss or problems at all.  I've been printing 4x6 labels using Endicia and the 4XL and it's been working like a charm.  The 4x6 shipping labels are coming out perfect (even better than printing them via Ebay as outlined above).  Endicia and Garage Sale are like a match made in heaven.  I've found very few things otherwise to complain about.  If you want a great Ebay shipping option solution that truly works on a Mac and is designed for a Mac, then Garage Sale and Endicia and the DYMO LabelWriter 4XL printer is your ticket.</span>

<span>Amazing printers in general but two out of the three that I bought had weak web sensors. That won't be an issue if use continuous label but will be a headache if you use normal 4x6 shipping labels. Basically it will spit out labels until it hits the maximum theoretical length of a label then say "out of paper" since the web sensor is too weak to read the beginning and end of the labels. I managed to get one working by turning up the power of the web sensor in the internal settings but it still only reads about half as strong as a new GX420d.</span>

<span>The item will only work with Walmart systems<br/>Seller called me.  Very nice. Very polite. Tried to set the printer up.  While I have to return because could not get to work  seller was 5 stars<br/>Gave 4 because probably should not sell a unit that will only work with Walmart or if you use a 3rd party to ship. Who charges a monthly fee<br/>I wanted to use on USPS Site</span>

TSC Auto ID offers the reliable TTP-244CE thermal transfer barcode label printer. The TTP-244CE is designed for superior price versus performance in your favor with a small footprint that offers the high-performance that customers have come to expect from TSC. Durable, reliable and fast, the TTP-244CE generates 4-inch labels, tags or receipts at up to 4-inches per second, offering a price-performance desktop printer that suits all your needs.The TTP-244CE offers industry standard 203 dpi print resolution and prints at up to 4-inches per second. The TTP-244CE prints labels up to 4.25″ using either direct thermal (DT) or thermal transfer (TT) printing technology. DT indicates that the media has a special coating that reacts to heat as the label or tag passes under the printer's printhead. DT media does not require an additional ribbon in order to print. TT media requires the addition of an installed ribbon in order to operate correctly. As both the ribbon and label pass under the printhead, the ribbon coating is transfered onto the media, creating a durable printed image that is more durable and lasts longer than most direct thermal labels.

<span>Bought this printer as a back up for the same model we are currently using.  We have had one like this in use for 13 years in our medical laboratory.  Can not live without a barcode for our specimens.  Recently had a scare that our current one was going to crash on us, so we ordered another for back up.  Turns out that we were able to get our current one going again!  Such a work horse piece of equipment!</span>
