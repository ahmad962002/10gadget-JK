The EcoTank Photo ET-8500 wireless all-in-one prints lab-quality color photos, graphics and everyday documents — all at an incredible value. Epson’s cartridge-free, 6-color Claria ET Premium Ink system delivers vibrant colors and sharp text for all your creative projects. With low-cost replacement ink bottles, print 4" x 6" photos for about 4 cents each compared to 40 cents with cartridges (1). Print everything from borderless 8.5" x 11" photos to customized CDs/DVDs. You can even print on cardstock and other media up to 1.3 mm thick. For added convenience, each set of bottles lets you print for up to 2 years (2). Plus, save up to 80 percent with replacement ink bottles vs. ink cartridges (3) — that’s about $2,000 on each set (3). The EcoTank Photo lets you do it all with affordable in-house printing. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO 29103 page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of June 2020. 2. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 200 pages. 3. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO 24712 page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of June 2020. 4. Color photo in Draft Mode on Premium Photo Paper Glossy measured from start of paper feed. Actual print times will vary based on factors including system configuration, software, and page complexity. For more information. 5. Replacement ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Replacement ink bottle photo yields are significantly lower and are based on the ISO/IEC 29103 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information. 6. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of Black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of June 2020. 7. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps. 8.

<span>Thought I got good deal with this price but when it came and what it said on this site, and what came was a 8'11 printer not a wide format printer. This is a regular printer with a eco tank. BACK IT GO I will go to Epson for the ET-8550. I have one already but needed another for solvent ink and the one I have is for Sublimation printing. Don't feel like changing ink from one to another.

<span> I bought a Cricut for Christmas and needed a great 3 in 1 printer to print stickers, print docs front and back, print 4x6, 5x7, and 8x10 photos, as well as scan my ultrasound photos. (I did not use this for sublimation, but hear that it can be great for that too.) This thing exceeded my expectations. I’ve been using it almost every day for 5 months and it still is almost filled completely full with ink, which I can see on the front of the machine. Setup instructions were super easy and was a pleasure to get through. Before this printer I had returned 2 other printers that disappointed me. (I ended up tossing my old one years ago because the HP printer dried up so quickly.) This printer feels like it was built to last. The doors and cassettes click into place, feeling very satisfying and never leaving me wonder if I pushed it in all the way. I’ll probably never use ink cartridges again. Eco tank is the way to go.<br/><br/>First of all, I had no idea when I bought it that you can scan and print photos using the app on your phone. It’s made things so much simpler to manage and edit. One thing I wish it had was color sliders to tweak the images a bit before printing.<br/><br/>The scan bed is AWESOME. It’s very basic with a thin plastic lid, but I’m comparing it to the scan job the scanners at Office Max did. Those were terrible, costly if you have multiple images needing scanned, and always came out blurry with noticeable glares. (The employees also wanted to argue about HIPPA with me with my own ultrasounds…) This printer’s scan does a phenomenal job. With 300 dpi it is crystal clear with no glare! And I love that it saves directly onto your phone. A USB or SD card is only optional. You can choose to scan in color, grayscale, or black and white. For ultrasounds, definitely use the grayscale.<br/><br/>The photo print quality is very good as well. Not sure if it’s as good as WalMart prints when it comes to color, but the quality is pretty similar. Sometimes the photos appear slightly blue, but I think it’s the photo paper I’m using. The white paper may have a slight blue hue to it. As a photographer, I’m content with saving me the trip by using this printer instead for my own personal needs.<br/><br/>The main con I can think of is that it does print slow if you choose higher quality prints. (May take 3 minutes to print a photo.) If you need speed, this may not be your guy. If you choose Normal quality prints it goes a lot faster, but documents appear very pixely. I had a paper jam once, but it was very quick and easy to open up the printer and pull it out.<br/><br/>I have yet to try printing with the cardstock paper feed in the back. I’ve been printing thin cardstock from the top feed and that seems to work out just fine.<br/><br/>Another con is sometimes when I’m printing from the computer I have to turn the printer off and on again because for some reason it doesn’t always get the signal to print. Not sure what is going on there, but it doesn’t happen too often.<br/><br/>Overall, I am still elated with my purchase 5 months later. Never had a printer that made me smile weekly before. This was worth every penny.</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Previous printer was an Epson XP-830. I do a lot of printing of photos and CDs and DVDs both for myself and for customers. I was looking for some way to cut the high cost of using the printer because the cost of the ink was extreme. I read a review of this Epson ET-8500 printer and was interested that the cost of the consumables (ink) would be drastically lower. Overall, it's a nice looking printer, and quiet -- but I need good quality photos and disc labels, and this one is far below the quality of the XP-830.<br/><br/>I'll state the biggest problem up front: The quality of the printed images is about on par with that from other printers, except that the images are always darker than the original. It seems there is too much black or grey being used, as well as too much red. The faces of people in the photos look like they all have severe sunburn, but on the computer screen the faces look just fine. Whenever there is a somewhat darker area on the image, that area is printed out almost all dark. Where you can see the different shades of grey and black on-screen, you cannot tell any difference on the printed image. So if the majority of the image is dark on-screen, then the printed image is almost all dark and unrecognizable. This is entirely unacceptable.<br/><br/>With the Epson XP-830, there was a similar issue. If the image on-screen had darker areas, they would be quite dark when printed. However, that printer's print utility has a function where you can set the image to "lighter" by one to three shades to compensate. That made the printer OK. For the Epson ET-8500, the user manual shows the "Epson Photo+" print utility having the functionality to do color correction and light/dark correction; however, the actual software installed on my PC has no such functionality. I checked the Epson website and I have the most current version of the Epson Photo+ software. There is no functionality for making any corrections when sending it to the printer. As a result, I need to import the images to an image editing program (I use both Photoshop and GIMP) and use that to do color correction and to increase the brightness. It's a hit-or-miss thing to do, however. I haven't yet figured out if there is a linear degree of correction needed (so I could perhaps make the brightness 10% more on each image, for example) or if it's just a plain old guess every time. After adjusting the image in the program, it looks poor on-screen but it prints out much better, if I get it right. But still there are times when I have to go through several tries to get it right.<br/><br/>The Epson Photo+ printer utility has a function to do a "Test Print". However, when I use that to print the image on plain paper, the color and brightness on paper is the same as on-screen, but printing on photo paper or on a disc label results in the problems mentioned. So that's no help at all.<br/><br/>The printed images are crisp and clean, not blurry or anything -- but what good is that if the color is all wrong and the images are too dark?<br/><br/>Then there are a few other irritations with the Epson Photo+ printer utility. For example, when preparing to print a disc label, you click on the icon to import the image. That opens the image and displays a new window where you must select a pre-defined pattern to crop the image (square, circle, star, heart, clover, etc.). You have to click on the crop pattern, then click on the OK button. It would be much easier to be able to just double-click on the crop pattern, but that doesn't work. So that's a hassle, and an irritation, but it can be lived with. In addition, the program always displays the square crop pattern as the default pattern, even when you selected a different pattern the previous image. In other words, it doesn't remember your previous selection and make that the default with the assumption that you would be doing that same crop again. That would also be easier, and not having it is an irritation, but one that can be lived with.<br/><br/>Then the Epson XP-830 print utility had the ability to precisely place the image on the disc label template by entering the upper-left corner position and then specifying the width and height. That was super easy and fast to get the image perfectly centered on the disc label template. With the Epson ET-8500, however, the only way to place the image on the disc template is to manually move it around. Not only does it take longer, but the results are always going to be slightly inconsistent with the other labels. This also is an irritation, but one that can be lived with.<br/><br/>So there are irritating and aggravating things about this Epson Photo+ printer utility that don't make sense. Why would the same company make software that is less easy to use and has less useful functionality than one of that same company's previous products?<br/><br/>But the main issue with this printer is the poor -- very poor -- print quality. When the printed image does not match the on-screen image, and there is no ability to make corrections using the printer software, then those corrections must be made manually using an image manipulation program (Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.net). This results in inconsistent printouts, and sometimes results in having to redo the print job. It's a waste of time, a waste of ink, and a waste of photo paper and discs.<br/><br/>Overall -- very unhappy with this product.</span>

<span>I searched on Amazon for All-in-One printer/scanner/fax that works with a Mac.  I then spent a lot of time comparing the results.  Of the choices, the Epson WF-4820 seemed to be the best.  I was very excited to get rid of my old Brother All-in-One.  Sadly, the excitement turned to extreme disappointment when I tried to set the WF-4820 up on the network.  The WF-4820 connected to the network relatively easily, and I could find the WF-4820 when I used the iPhone app, EpsonSmartPanel.  However, part of installing the printer driver on the iMac requires the iMac to find the printer on the network, and that simply would not work whether I tried an Ethernet cable connection or WiFi connection.  I even used a USB cable, and it did not work.  I called Tech Support, and the advice was ridiculous.  The technician wanted me to run an ethernet cable directly from the router to the printer, which would not be feasible on a daily basis, or reconfigure my WiFi system specifically for the printer even though it would make other operations more difficult. (I actually did move the WF-4820 to a position where I could connect it directly to the router, and that solution did not work so basically the advice from Tech Support was terrible.  And it was frustrating because the technician had the stereotypical attitude of the problem cannot be their device.  It must be a user problem.) I was about to send the WF-4820 back and write a more scathing review when I decided to look online for the software necessary to run the printer and scanner instead of using the installation software provided by Epson.  It turns out that the software installer provided by Epson is almost 2 years old and designed for Apple iOS 10.4.  Most of the Apple world is on iOS 12.4 so the Epson software installer is very out of date.  Sure enough, when I located more recent software and drivers for the individual functions of printing and scanning, everything worked fine.  And the printing quality and scanning software is far above my old Brother unit.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this All-in-One unless Epson updates its installation software.  It was not easy doing what I eventually had to do to get the WF-4820 to work.</span>

<span>I highly recommend the ET-5850 and would definitely purchase this printer again (but hopefully won't have to for at least 5 years!)<br/>PROS: My documents must be professional quality when I send them to the Judge and my Epson ET-5850 gives excellent quality documents. I did not give any stars to tech support because I haven't needed tech support - set-up instructions were straight-forward and simple and use is just as easy, and I am not a tech-savvy person. NOTE: Be sure to download the Epson Smart-Scan for easy scanning. I tried to scan some other way and it was frustrating, until I read more instructions. Ah ha! now scanning is a mouse-click away.<br/>ANSWERS TO CRITICS: I was worried by a few reviews such as "almost all the ink was used by set-up". MY ANSWER: the description in Amazon says more ink will be used in set-up than on a daily basis and its true. I was left with at least 1/2 the ink after set-up. However, after approx 40 days, my daily use barley made a dent in the remaining ink levels, which are easy to see on the ink-level panel on the front of the machine. My machine came with a full extra round of ink bottles so I'm good for quite a while.  Further, the price of the ink bottles is less  $ than the cartridges for my old Epson WorkForce3640.  Another concern a reviewer had was the "noise" during printing. MY ANSWER: The ET 5850 is not any louder than other printers I had and is quieter than laser printers I've worked with. Also not messy like some laser printers. People also were concerned about the cost. MY ANSWER: 1) the ET-5850 is a high quality printer; 2) In 40 days, I've already saved the cost of 1 set of ink cartridges (at a cost of about $70 monthly) as I had no need to replace ink; 3) This is not a disposable printer but is a solid piece of office equipment I expect to have for a few years.<br/>CONS OR DOWNSIDE(S): There is a delay between when I hit print and when the printer begins printing, enough so that I wonder if the ET-5850 received my print request - then the printing begins. Also, the printing is slower than expected. I saw on the box this is an "ultra-high-speed" printer. hmm, not so much. I may check my instructions again to see if I can speed things up. OVERALL: I am quite pleased I spent the extra money and got a quality product with expected savings of time and money from fewer trips to the office supply store.<br/>Robin G, South Dakota</span>

<span>This printer is really nice. I needed it for my new business and was hesitant to grab such a pricey machine but I think its well worth it.<br/><br/>Once I figured out the correct printer driver to install, it was easy to set up. It was also quick to set up and I did it all wireless, which was awesome!<br/><br/>I did use quite a bit of the first ink bottles setting the machine up but there are two sets if all the colors and I just filled the ink back up with the second set. I print a few pages every day and it seems the ink is everlasting. I had an HP previously and I would be running low on ink already with the HP.<br/><br/>The touch screen is a good size and easy to navigate for me. I'm a "techy" type person so I'm not sure if it's easy because I love that stuff or if it's just generally easy.<br/><br/>The print quality seems to be very good. I've tried general every day printing and printing photos on photo paper. General printing is great but phot printing needs some adjustments at times. My photos came out a little light but very good color saturation.<br/><br/>Overall this seems to be a really nice printer.

<span>Once upon a time I had some great customer service from Epson and had been a dedicated customer ever since and had pushed them to friends and family.  This was a PRICEY printer, and I admit, the print quality has been very good.  But I trusted Epson including their claim that it included free ink for two years.  I filed my first and only claim for ink after 15 months or so, but when I asked for the form, for the first time, I learned they require that to actually get reimbursed for the "free" ink you have to save and ship empty vials that HAD contained the ink back to them (mine had already been recycled -- which I explained on the claim form). Rejected. Keep in mind the submission also requires data directly from the printer proving how many pages had been printed AND the receipt from the purchase of new ink, so it's not like there was much risk of them getting scammed.  So either their customer service ebbs and flows, or it's just take a turn for the greedy.  But Epson, strapping your customers with meaningless t's to cross and i's to dot to avoid paying on a promise hurt your reputation with me.  Hope the $79.99 was worth it.</span>

<span>There are things I really like about this printer, and there are things that are very problematic. I'm writing this review after using this printer for less than a week and with a few thousand pages under my belt.<br/><br/>First, some things that I really like about this printer:<br/>1. The print speed is acceptable. It's sufficiently fast when compared to consumer grade inkjet printers. It's not the fastest printer, but it doesn't choke on text pages. Print speed will slow on graphics heavy pages with significant coverage, as expected.<br/>2. The ink is reasonably priced and provides acceptable quality for printing. Most of my prints are text-heavy and the text is clear and readable.<br/>3. Multiple paper trays allow for flexibility in paper type.<br/><br/>Things that are aggravating, but not show stoppers:<br/>1. This thing is noisy. You won't want to keep it in your office.<br/>2. The printer used a ton of ink during priming. More than half of each of the color tanks and a full third of the black. The good news is that the box came with two bottles of each ink color. The maintenance box also shows half of the serviceable life used before I printed a single page.<br/>3. I seem to have to turn the printer off and back on again for my computer to find it every morning. Not sure if this is an issue with my network, but none of my other printers or devices have this issue.<br/><br/>Things that are dissatisfying to me and might make me not recommend this printer:<br/>1. Frequent paper jams, especially when paper is low or when the printer switches between the paper trays. This is really frustrating.<br/>2. Large print jobs will often have issues. I often print a 260 page document (training material). It's double-sided so it runs 130 pieces of paper printed on both sides. I have yet to print this document on this printer without it jamming. The printer recovers well and prints from where it left off, but it has NEVER made it through without an issue. I have used several brands of quality paper with the exact same results. The jams are usually when paper is low or when transitioning between paper trays, but not always.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm mixed. There are things that I really like and things that I don't. At this price point, I expected more. I'll update my review in a few more weeks as things progress.<br/><br/>Update - April 2021. I would give this a solid 3.5 stars, close to 4, after using this for a while now. One of my big frustrations was that I couldn't print a training manual (the most common big job I print) without it jamming at some point in the process. I can mostly do this without issue now, so long as I don't have to switch between paper trays. I'm now accustomed to printing my manual one at a time and making sure the paper is topped off. This has reduced my issues, but is still really annoying.<br/><br/>Also, I am impressed with the ink. The quality is satisfactory and it has kept my print costs low, especially when compared to the print suppliers I was using previously. That said, keep spare ink and a spare maintenance box on site if you plan on doing higher volume printing.</span>

<span>Easy unboxing, easy to load ink but it is a bear to figure out how to use. Instructions are atrocious. After two hours I gave up and searched for help on you tube. Yup, that did it. A two minute video someone created and I was printing from my iPhone. No idea how to print from a laptop yet but that will be my next project. Aren’t there any tech writers left in the world? Assuming this printer lasts a few years I think it will be a good purchase.</span>

<span>I'm only giving a 4 because I haven't been using it that long, but what I've gathered from my use is that most of the changes you need to make need to be done on the phone. Directions are sparse that come up on the printer or on my computer when I go to print. I'd like more help while I'm on the computer printing, than to have to get out my phone to make printing changes. Also, the ink is not very dark. That is one thing I haven't figured out how to remedy. I've tried, but there's no default for High printing, only Standard. I have to get into my phone each time to get the High printing. Also, the scanning is subpar, and, again, not enough instruction is enabled as you scan. And only goes up to 600 ppi. I have to go through my phone, which is a pain. However, I like that I don't go through a lot of ink. So far, after over a month's use, my ink use is barely noticeable. That's why I gave it a 4 and not a 3.</span>

<span>As a years-long user of HP printers, I finally got tired of essentially being mugged every time I was forced to purchase only HP ink cartridges.  Ridiculously priced at nearly the cost of the printer itself, HP locked out the ability to stop firmware upgrades which cause their printers to reject any cartridge that is not genuine HP. (Which means you cannot use recycled cartridges that are not HP Brand)  I felt like the long arm of HP was reaching into my home and controlling what I could do with a personal device that I owned.  I purchased the Epson ET-2850 because among the many different models offered, this one seemed the best fit for home office use.  One of the biggest selling points for me was the sea change from ink jet cartridges to ink tanks.  Admittedly I was having to replace my old HP cartridges 2-3 times during the use of a single 500-pack of copy paper, while the projected life of the initial ink tank liquid furnished with the ET-2850 is around 7500 pages, about 2 years worth of use. I have been thoroughly pleased with the ET-2850.  Set up was remarkably easy with DVD provided as well as a very simple iPhone app that walked me through each step with photos and easy to follow instructions.  In short order I was able to print from my desktop, 2 laptops, 2 tablets, and 2 iPhones.  Since my purchase I have utilized most of its features, especially the scan function which I use for projects much more than regular printing.  The unit is well worth the cost and I would highly recommend this printer for home office use.  The only non-positive aspect I've encountered is the touch screen which is so small you actually need glasses to read it.  I find that adjusting settings from the computer software is much easier.</span>

<span>I had an EcoTank 7700 for over 4 years. It was a BEAST. Print quality was phenomenal. It was damaged during an overseas move, so I had to buy another printer. I couldn’t find my original model, so after some research, I went with this.<br/><br/>This was only about $100 less than what I paid for the 7700, so I was expecting something in the ballpark range of what I had. This is…not that. At all.<br/><br/>Anything I print looks cheaply done. Colors are not very vivid, and everything looks grainy. I’m a graphic designer and have tried everything under the sun to improve print quality (printer settings, color profiles, resolution/DPI, file formats, documents, photos, photo paper, etc.) — none of it makes a difference.<br/><br/>My 7700 printed photos that rivaled a photo lab. Photos from this thing look like I took them in a dark closet, with a digital camera from 2003, and saved them as smallest file size. (This is printing highest quality onto premium photo paper.) It also takes FOREVER for “high quality” printing.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this thing is that, like my first, ink usage is phenomenal. I filled my 7700 up twice in its 4.5 year life and never once had to buy ink; I only ever used what ink came in the box. I print multiple times a day/week still and believe this one will probably rival that pattern as well (though this one came with less ink.)<br/><br/>Maybe I’m salty about movers wrecking my 7700, but this just feels very similar to a $30 HP printer my son used for school a couple years ago. Nothing special, unless I’m drastically missing something.</span>

<span>Bottom line move up the larger version of this, the 37 or 4700 series.  Pay the money, it's worth it.<br/>This 2760 was great for about one year and then started having issues, freezing up, etc.  We did all the upgrades, etc. Never got through the first load of ink on that one and the touch screen was painfully small and hard to use. Got frustrated and moved up to the 4760 with no regrets.  More ink, MUCH better touch screen size and layout.  Will stay with Epson due to the eco tank option, no rip off ink cartridges, etc.  Next time your brand X ink cartridge goes dry, crack it open and see how small the ink chamber volume actually is!</span>

<span>I purchased this for my small business so I can start printing things in-house. Using the settings for plain paper was horrible, so I had to change to photo glossy and that helped with the resolution. The print looks great, but it took FOREVER to print (~5 min per sheet). Thankfully I'm printing low volumes, so this is a minor inconvenience.<br/><br/>Also, Epson is really pushing for the Wifi printing for this printer, but connecting the printer to the network has been so unreliable. If the printer goes to sleep, it loses wifi connection and I have to go through connecting it to the network all over again in between prints. I got so frustrated with the connectivity problems that I ended up just getting a wire to directly connect to my computer. Now jobs are sent really quickly.</span>

<span>I’ve been a fan of Epson printers for many years, based on my ownership of an Epson Workforce 633 for over 8 years.  I purchased refillable catridges and a chip resetter that kept my printing costs WAY down.  I printed a BUNCH of stuff on that printer.  The printer outlasted 3 kids through High School and College and printed forms for our photography business (Wedding contracts, order forms, etc.) and even custom DVD labels that looked VERY professional.<br/><br/>So, when my Workforce 633 finally refused to print, I looked for another Epson as a replacement.  Luckily, Epson now has a line of printers that you can refill with ink without purchasing 3rd party components.  Welcome the Epson Ecotank series of printers!<br/><br/>I looked at the Epson EcoTank ET-2720 and ET-2760 as possible options (I’m thrifty and my printing needs are NOT that elaborate).  The latter was about $30 more, and I opted for that model.  The main reason I selected the ET-2760 is that automatic double sided printing is supported.<br/><br/>The printer arrived quickly, as most Amazon Prime shipments do.  Unpacking involved removing a lot of tape that secures the printer in the box for shipment.  Unboxing and setup are super quick and easy.  The longest part of getting ready is filling the EcoTank with the supplied ink.<br/><br/>The total time from start to printing out my first document from my computer was about 30 minutes.  I was taking pictures during the unboxing and installation with my phone, so probably a bit slower than other reviewers.  I followed the steps outlined in the “Start here” guide and you should too.  Especially where it mentions “do not drink the ink”.  Seriously, it’s there under setp 2’s warning section.  So, I heeded their warning, although I was tempted to take a sip (No, not really).  Notice that you don’t connect the printer or turn it on until after the ink tanks have been filled and the printer drivers and utilities are installed on your computer.<br/><br/>A few more notes on setting up your printer if you utilize the wireless option.  If your router has dual band capabilities – i.e it broadcasts in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz - make sure you select the 2.4 GHz connection.  And, if you’re running software that monitors and allows/disallows connections through your firewall (HIGHLY recommended), don’t forget to allow access for the setup to complete successfully.<br/><br/>So, how does the printer perform?  Very well if your expectations are in line.<br/>Setting up voice activated printing was easy, but a little tedious.  Like most other devices that connect to Alexa – like our Wyze Cams and our Whirlpool microwave/oven combo – you have to enable the proper Alexa skill and perform a few more steps before use.  Then, you have to setup your printer to an “Epson Connect” account.  You’ve hopefully already completed this step when you setup your printer drivers and utilities.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, this printer supports voice activated printing.  What actually does that mean?  Well, as HUGE fans of the Amazon Alexa devices, it does provide some interesting “neat” features, although I’m not sure how often we’ll actually use them.  We have, at last count, 6 Alexa devices in the house, ranging from Echo Dots to the Echo Show (2nd gen).  So, you can do things like “Alexa, ask Epson Printer to print my shopping list…” or “Alexa, Ask Epson Printer to print my calendar”.  Of course, don’t forget to include “Ask Epson printer”, or you’ll confuse Alexa.  But, this isn’t really necessary for me, as I use the Alexa shopping list and to do list on my phone and don’t need a printed copy in hand.  The same goes for my my Google calendar or to do list.  But, if we were printing a calendar for the family fridge, that might be a cool feature!<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can point to about this printer is the paper capacity (But, after reading the reviews, I already KNEW that).  It says 100 sheets, but that’s a stretch.  I’ve found that anything more than say 35 pieces of white copy paper will not work without an issue.  You’ve been warned.<br/><br/>So, am I happy with the printer?  After a few weeks of use, I can say that things are really going well.  We’ve printed about 250-300 pages thus far.  This includes several wedding contracts awaiting signatures, bridal fair wedding package handouts on high quality resume paper and professional looking DVD labels for the DVDs we’re handing out at the bridal fair later this month.  All of the print looks AWESOME and the colors are true to what’s on my monitor.  If anything changes, I’ll update the review and adjust the star rating if necessary.</span>

<span>I bought this printer for my small publishing company.  Does a good job handling black and white interior, but on a premium paper and glossy cover, the ink colors don't match the he's.  I tried a gray color and the hue went almost light purple.  I tried black and the color came out dark blue.  The same design prints correctly on my Canon Prograf, so it's not on my end with colors.  If you are buying for black and white text, it works good, but printing is slow.  We will only be using it for that.  It's disappointing.</span>

Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard-capacity color laser toner cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the ink bottles using the manufacturers' online prices and yields for the best-selling similarly featured color laser printers, available at retail, priced at $999 or less (USD) with speeds of 40 ppm or less per industry-available data as of July 2019. Savings of up to $600 (USD) and cost per ISO page of about $0.09 (USD) for XL-capacity color laser toner cartridges based on the same methodology. 2. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. 3. Based on comparing manufacturers’ reported TEC values of the best-selling, similarly featured color laser printers priced about $999 (USD) or less with print speeds of 40 ppm or less as of July 2019. 4. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. 5. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. 6. Wi-Fi CERTIFIED; level of performance subject to the range of the router being used. Wi-Fi Direct may require printer software. 7. 12 months of standard limited warranty or 80,000 plain paper sheets (whichever happens first). For an additional 12-month extended service plan (total of 24 months or 80,000 plain paper sheets, whichever happens first), register your product and use Epson genuine ink bottles. See Limited Warranty for details. 8. SmartWay is an innovative partnership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that reduces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants and improves fuel efficiency.

<span>Great product so far. Although photo quality not quite as crisp as Xerox dry ink printers.  Perfect for printing  on ANY Type or SIZE paper. Perfect for printing greeting cards, flyers, brochures and everyday printing.  Have not used the scanner, as I have an Epson Scanner I use just for pictures &amp; negatives (that I am VERY pleased with). Agree with all pluses on ink usage.</span>

<span>I love this printer! I can print so many pages before it even looks like I’ve used any ink, it is incredible! It is quite expensive but if you print a lot, the money you will save on it more than makes up for it. It’s an easy printer to set up too.</span>

<span>Super expensive machine. Yes, the eco-tank feature is great (definitely saves on ink) BUT tech support is highly inconsistent. One rep said I couldn't print wirelessly because my router wasn't 1 2.4 gHz router, whereas it in fact is dual band 2.4 and 5.0; this ignores the fact that a $800 machine should be able to detect both bands. Turned out the problem was that I simply needed to power down the Epson which allowed it to reset; I figured that out on my own. Also turns out that you can't use this printer to print standard size Quicken checks when you're printing fewer than three at a time. That doesn't cut it. Black and white print quality is less than what I get from my Ricoh printer, so not good either. Last, this machine is ultra complicated with endless settings and options that make it very hard to use for a normal, non-technical user. I've returned it and will go with something (1) less expensive; (2) more functional and (3) easier to use.<br/><br/>The great news is that Amazon's customer service has been outstanding in helping me deal with the problems this machine caused and taking it back for a refund. Definitely a good reason to shop on Amazon!</span>
