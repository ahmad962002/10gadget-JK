<span>I bought this printer because I was in a bind, and needed something that would work right out of the box... and I needed is FAST, to complete some orders within a deadline. I also needed something that would print Nylon well, and with no issues, again right out of the box.  I use Prusa Mk3s for most of my production- And, if I'd have had time, would have just ordered another one of them. But- I didn't have time for it to arrive and to get it assembled. So, after reading reviews and doing some research, I bought this one.<br/><br/>Don't want to read a long review? Here are the Pros and Cons-<br/><br/>PROS-<br/>-Prints well, right out of the box.<br/>-Easy, guided setup.<br/>-No assembly, testing, or tweaking<br/>-Easy to use touch screen interface, Web based 'cloud' printing through WIFI, and easy to use slicer included<br/>-Great US based customer support<br/>-Fully enclosed, VERY quiet.<br/>-All metal hotend can handle just about any filament<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>-Build area is on the small side<br/>-Designed to use Dremel filaments. You CAN use 3rd party, but you'll have to make some changes. Dremel spools are smaller than 'normal' spools.<br/>-A little tough to adjust settings while printing<br/><br/>If you still think it might be for you, read on!<br/><br/>So- How easy is it REALLY to set up? From opening the box to starting the first print was less than 20 minutes, and most of that time was spent removing all the packing material. This machine is ready to go, right out of the box. All you really have to do (other than remove all of the packaging!) is to put the bed in place and load the filament. Oh, you have to plug it in, too...<br/><br/>I switched it on, and it walks you through the setup, first connecting to your WiFi network. I loaded one of the included filament rolls. The printer does not have a self leveling bed, but it uses an assisted leveling process to get everything set. It's quick and painless, the printer tells you EXACTLY what to do. Since my first time leveling, I have not had to relevel the bed yet. I have checked it a few times, but it's always OK.<br/><br/> You have several options to control the printer- Using the web interface, the touch screen, or via a USB connected computer.  For the first print, I decided to just use one of the files that was preloaded in the printer, with the touch screen. You scroll through a couple of easy to navigate menus using the touch screen interface, hit start, and let it go. The first print turned out nice.<br/><br/>For the next print, I used the web-based interface. There is a slicer online, but I chose to use the slicing software that came with the printer, The DigiLab Slicer. Those who are familiar with Cura will immediately recognize it- it's Dremel's own version. It is quick and easy to use, and like other versions of Cura allows you to do a lot of custom setting changes to tweak your prints as needed. I chose to do a 'benchy' so I could compare it to the others I have printed on my other printers. I uploaded it, and sent it to the printer via Dremel's online interface. The really cool thing about printing from the cloud is the video monitoring- I can check in on it any time i want to on my iPhone or computer. And, when the print is done, I get an Email that includes a time lapse video of the entire print. The Benchy turned out great. Not QUITE as nice as the ones that I print on my Prusas, but bear in mind i'm getting this quality of output right out of the box.<br/><br/>So- Next thing to try is a more 'exotic' filament- Nylon. I've always had difficulty with nylon, and have avoided it. I read a lot of reviews about this printer that said it did a great job with Nylon. So, I loaded the included spool of Nylon filament and gave it a shot. The first thing that I printed was a simple wall hook. It printed very nicely- Almost flawless. The strength and flexibility of nylon prints is unbelievable. I'm really looking forward to using more of it.<br/><br/>The printer is 'optimized' for using Dremel filaments- In fact, the filament spools have RFID chips in them that allow the printer to identify what kind of filament you have loaded.  You are not restricted to only Dremel brand, though, it can also use other filaments as well. The Dremel uses a smaller spool size, so you'll have to make some arrangements to use the materials from other manufacturers. You'll also have to tell the printer what the filament type is since there won't be a chip for it to read. I found a new cover for the filament spool opening on Thingiverse that has an opening to feed the filament through, and I mount my filament on a spool holder next to the printer.<br/><br/>I have put several spools of 'third party' filament through my 3D45- Mostly PETG. It prints it beautifully.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a 3D printer that is going to work right out of the box- With no tinkering or assembly, this is a great choice. If you use just the Dremel Filaments, it will be about as painless a process as 3D printing can be- You will just hit the 'print' button and come back later to take your print off the bed.  It is about as easy to use and user friendly as a 3d printer can be. This is where 3D printing needs to go to make it more 'mainstream'... Not everyone enjoys playing with settings and tinkering- Some just want to PRINT!<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/><br/>I've now had this printer up and running for about 3 weeks. I have it going just about 24/7 for about the previous two weeks, producing PETG parts for a machine that I build and sell. It has performed flawlessly, and has produced incredible parts that are both accurate and strong.<br/><br/>I decided to try out some other filaments on it, too. The last two pics are items printed with Carbon Fiber PLA. I used SunTop 3d filament, which is available on Amazon. The quality of the prints is incredible- Both of them are right off the build sheet.</span>

<span>They're not kidding when they say you can have this thing printing within 10-15 minutes of unboxing it. Once you have it unboxed, all you need to do is plug it in, follow the steps to level the bed, connect wifi, etc. Then, load your first filament and run over to your slicer program and hit print! I can't say enough good things about this printer, but here's the bullet points:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The RFID system is amazing. It makes it so easy to quickly swap filament types. I'm constantly bouncing between PLA, PETG and ECO-ABS and all I have to do is click change filament, snip the old filament line and feed in the new filament. Once fed it detects the RFID chip on your roll and configures all the temps for you. Very, very, little effort. Half the time you don't even have to consider what type of filament you stuck in, it'll "just work".<br/>- When you run out of filament, rather than failing, it automatically pauses and waits for you to add more. So if you run out of filament in an overnight print, no big deal. Just swap out the roll when you wake up.<br/>- I've printed several flawless PETG prints, amazing because PETG is usually very difficult to work with. But with this printer, it's no different than PLA. I have not tried Nylon yet, but I'm guessing it'll be the same experience.<br/>- You really can set it up in 10-15 minutes.<br/>- Bed leveling is so easy it's almost cheating. You just hit the bed level button and wait, if pokes around the bed looking for unleveled surfaces then tells you exactly what knobs to turn and prompts you when you've turned them far enough. A 5 year old could relevel the print bed on this in about 1-2 minutes.<br/>- There's no smell at all (unless you open the door obviously), no matter what material I print with. The filter on this is amazing. I print only 3 feet from my desk (and in fact, it's printing right now behind me) and there's no odor of any kind what so ever.<br/>- It's very quiet, but not completely silent. I can whisper to my wife on the other side of the room while its running and she can hear me just fine. You know it's running but its not disruptive what so ever.<br/>- Love the internal bright lights. Makes it really easy to see your print.<br/>- This is the only printer I've used with a heated bed, so I can't say much for how good it actually is. But it seems really good. I've never had issues with it, and the only time I've ever had build adhesion issues is when I missed a spot applying glue (and even then, sometimes its fine anyway). I've also only experienced warping once out of about 50-60 prints thus far, and it may have been my own fault.<br/>- Literally every print fail I've had was my fault.<br/>- It can do some amazing bridging, I'm shocked what this thing can print without supports. I accidentally printed a model with a *4 inch long* straight overhang in ECO-ABS, and *somehow* it magically printed with no issue.<br/>- Touchscreen is very nice and easy to use.<br/>- and of course, the print quality is exactly what you would expect from a nearly $2,000 printer.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Awkward spool size, if you buy third party filament you may need to print yourself a Dremel-sized spool to put the filament on (There's one on thingiverse), or just keep an old Dremel roll around to respool your third party filament to, just remember to rip off the RFID tag.<br/>- Official Dremel filaments are very high quality but does cost more. It can cost anywhere from $20-$35/roll, and the rolls are only 0.75kg. Although you can use third party filament anyway, you just lose the benefits of the RFID system.<br/>- I had one bug, I believe a firmware glitch, that misreported the Z level of the bed, causing the bed to smack into the extruder when printing. It was an easy fix, simply just rebooted the printer.<br/>- The "Dremel" brand slicer program is based on an older version of Cura (1.2.3). But it still works like a champ, and I've really not had any issues with it. It also has a ton of 3D45-specific profiles already setup to use.<br/>- Sort of a pro and a con; The printer stubbornly will refuse to print if you have the door open. So make sure you always keep it closed. Up side, you don't want the door open when you print anyway, Down side is you may know it's open and you're just wanting to initiate the print while you're cleaning up your workspace or something, and the printer may be in another room. But you *can* open the door after printing has started.<br/>- The camera is nice to have, but admittedly, it's fairly low quality. It's a 720p camera, but the framerate is super low (guessing about 10 FPS). It's perfect for checking your prints, but don't expect to use it to make really cool high-resolution time lapses for Youtube.<br/><br/>There's a reason this printer costs nearly $2,000. If you're more interested in printing things than tinkering with the printer, this is the printer for you.</span>

<span>As a mechanical engineer myself, my expectations were extremely high to begin with.  I have interacted with 3D printers before and have seen a few different models in action.  We even have one in our office (Prusa i3 MK3) and I can honestly say that this 3D printer is a great purchase.  I am 100% satisfied.<br/><br/>Below is the criteria that was important to me and the basis of my evaluation;<br/><br/>Ease of Use:<br/>It took me just a few minutes to pull it out of the box, clip the build plate in place and we were up and running.  I have seen my colleagues at work struggle putting the Prusa kit together with parts not fitting 100% correct or braking in the process.  It was a great experience with the Dremel being ready to go out of the box with not adjustments needed.<br/><br/>Prints are easy to setup with the included slicer software and entry level folks can easily print without spending hours trying to make it work.  For advanced users, the advanced options are available where every parameter can be adjusted.  The slicer is Cura based.<br/><br/>Enclosure:<br/>One of the big selling points for me was the fact that the printer comes with an enclosure.  With other printers that are open you have to worry about breathing the fumes, ultra fine particles, temperature control issues (particularly when printing ABS and Nylon).  I have small kids that can inadvertently stick their fingers in the printer while it is operating.  Having an enclosure ads an extra layer of safety that was important for me.  I have the printer located in my garage where temperatures can get cold but since the enclosure keeps the internal temperature well control, I don't have much of any issues with the prints warping or the first layer not sticking.  It just simply works!<br/><br/>Filtration:<br/>It comes with a built-in filter and fan.  The fan is properly sized and built into the electronics.  As a result it can be easily controlled.  You can easily and quickly adjust whether it turns on or not and the speed.  The enclosure comes with mounting provisions already integrated in the event that an external filtration system is desired.  The user can also use those same mounting provisions to vent the fan output to the outside by connecting a hose and adapter to the mounting provisions.  The printer comes with the file needed for the adapter, you can just print it, bolt it on to the back of the enclosure and hook up a hose.<br/><br/>Quality of Print:<br/>This printer is just simply amazing.  The quality competes with the best in the market for the given price point.<br/><br/>Filament:<br/>The Dremel proprietary filaments work great.  There are a lot of folks that complain about the cost of the filament and the fact that it is half of the amount you get from other filaments.  So you pay more for less literally.  However, the user can actually use any filament they want.  The settings are adjustable and the printer itself has the capability of handling any filament brand.  You just need to adjust the settings and the spool itself will have to sit outside of the printer.  Not a big deal at all.  A simple online search will yield several videos showing how to do this.  My understanding is that Dremel no longer disqualifies your warranty for doing this.<br/><br/>WiFi/Web Cam/Cloud:<br/>These features are just simply great and extremely helpful to setup a que of various prints, monitor prints remotely, and track filament usage.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it?<br/>Absolutely YES!</span>

<span>I've had my 3D45 for a couple weeks and have been printing pretty much 15-24 hours a day with no issues.<br/><br/>The unit itself is built with quality materials. Nothing seems cheap. I was really impressed with the Operating Instructions manual. If you've ever owned Bosch or other high quality power tools, you will definitely appreciate the level of detail included in the 3D45 manual.<br/><br/>The online reviews for this unit all agree, it's a high quality consistent machine. Knowing that schools regularly purchase the unit enough that Dremel markets an educational version, says a lot. It's safe and durable for around children.<br/><br/>I especially like the design of the filament spool loader. My first 3D printer had the spool floating above the unit on a flimsy plastic rod but this unit's design is built into the unit and completely hidden from exterior.<br/><br/>The unit also just looks cool with the ambient lighting.<br/><br/>I have only had one issue so far and that was getting the cloud based website to allow registration. I've only been able to use the supplied USB stick to transfer files. I assume that was a website issue and had nothing to do with the machine itself. Just while writing this review, I checked again and it worked, so there. No more issues.<br/><br/>One minor issue I see on the touchscreen is that the way the files are listed in big letters, it makes it difficult to differentiate files with similar long names. It's best to label files differently in the first few characters or else have to wonder which file you're building. This may only be an issue with using the USB drive and not printing from the cloud.<br/><br/>I also found the Digilab slicer to work very well. It takes a little bit to learn the controls but all the pre-sets seem to work perfectly.<br/><br/>If it's your first printer, you're going to have difficulty swallowing the price on this unit but I can attest after having tried cheaper units (&lt;$800), I think the extra money is well spent.<br/><br/>A few other points:<br/>Leveling system is dummy-proof. You''ll like it.<br/>I really like the glass build plate after having another machine with a gritty plastic removable pad. Prying material off the glass build plate (when using glue stick) can be a little difficult but I tend to rinse the plate with water and soap and then use the supplied "spackling knife" to wedge the material off. The first time I got pushy with it the blade slid into my opposing palm and cut it so I learned to push away from my hand from then on. I would've thought using glue every time would be a hassle, but it's not. The glue washes off very easily and then you're back to work again in less than a minute. Taking the plate on and off is very easy. One catch on the build volume is to remember that even though your build may technically fit on the glass, it may not work when you include the required skirt. Read up on skirts if you're new to printing, since it affects the overall dimensions of the build volume.<br/><br/>The front door is a bit flimsy since it has not frame. I would appreciate a surrounding frame to give it a little more strength. I will eventually break that door, I'm sure. Otherwise, it opens and closes very nicely.<br/><br/>You may find the noise a bit loud even with machine doors closed. I moved mine into a spare room so I can close the bedroom door. If you're using it in your home office, you'll quickly become annoyed by the buzzing and fan.<br/><br/>My top deciding factors in my selection were: price, build volume, material options, connection to computer (usb/cord/wifi/etc.)<br/><br/>I hope this helps your decision. I would recommend the purchase if you can afford it.</span>

<span>This is my first 3D printer and I had zero prior experience. I bought the Adventurer 3 Lite almost exactly a year ago after reading reviews until my eyes bled. It has the features that I wanted and there was an open box one available, which tipped the scale :D I've been running it all day as of this review (Sept 2022) and was inspired to come back and say something nice.<br/><br/>This thing is awesome. I have a lot of hobbies and I print brackets and doodads and adapters all the time. I'll think "hey, wish I had a... solder fume extractor" and then pull one down from Thingiverse and bam. I've printed DnD minis, rocket nose cones, parts for quadcopters, household things (like brackets to hang a mirror), etc.<br/><br/>Thoughts:<br/>1. You'll see this in other reviews. Don't worry about the proprietary filament if you can dedicate another 12" of space next to it. Drill a hole midway up the filament door, directly underneath the feed, and put your spool outside on a roller tray.<br/>2. Try ABS on the default settings. This thing prints ABS like a boss, out of the box. The enclosure is apparently everything. I do use blue tape and glue stick to make sure to get adhesion, but otherwise no problem. I spent a lot of time screwing around with PLA and to be honest I doubt I'll swap back.<br/>3. I've experimented a bit with other slicers, but I always go back to FlashPrint because it just works (most of the time). That said:<br/>4. If you're getting crazy spiderwebs inside of an open vase (or similar), it's probably not the print settings - it might be the slicer settings for things like the bottom layer count. I pulled my hair out trying to figure out why I was getting this insane combination of stringing, weird delaminations, and overall ugliness inside when I was trying to print some hollow sculptures. In the end, it was the slicer trying to put bottom layers halfway up the inside of the print.<br/><br/>I think there are some limitations to FlashPrint but I'm not really expert enough to comment beyond my experience that it is great most of the time, and that the default settings are surprisingly consistently good.</span>

<span>If you look at the features of this unit, you realize that it's a deal for the price. It's quiet, enclosed, touchscreen LCD screen, Wifi, etc are all features that you have to pay extra for with other products and you have to install them. The unfortunate part is that many of the parts and even the software are proprietary and as such, you won't get much support from the internet communities. The company support is responsive to a degree and at least answer emails. However, I kept having issues where no matter what filament, temp, or z calibration, I couldn't stop the prints from fusing to the build plate. This resulted in every print, while good, being damaged while being removed.<br/><br/>The printer can print ASA really well and it didn't take too long to get settings relatively dialed in. However, if you do encounter a problem, finding internet help is a pain because even their software doesn't use terminology that other slicers use. That's one of the biggest issues. Because when you ask someone for help, they tell you settings in cura, but you can't find them in Flashprint because they are named differently.<br/><br/>So, it's a weird paradox of a printer. It's decent for beginners because it does a lot for you with the many included features, but you have to know what you are doing when you encounter a problem. The price is quite good for the stuff you get however.<br/><br/> I really wanted to like the printer, but not being able to get the prints off of the plate really, really annoyed me because of the work I had to do to get them off just to have them damaged and then clean residue. Maybe there was some magic trick I could have done to have fixed all that, but honestly, I would have wanted that in the beginning if the device is meant to be super user friendly for beginners. Also, the limitation for .5 KG spools if you wanted them internal in the device was a big letdown. I can understand the reason, but it also ties you to FlashForge's filament which is expensive.<br/><br/>So, if they were to have better software safeguards for fusing prints to the plate, more community standardized software setting names, and the ability to use full 1 KG spools, it would be a very amazing printer. The first two options can be done for no extra money, but the third might raise the cost of the device a little due to the physical dimensions. In the end, I liked the printer, but in the end I never got a fully functional print because of the damage always done.</span>

<span>Needed some additional 3-D printing capacity.  I have 3 units (Dremel, Snapmaker, generic) and it seemed that at times I have more to print than those units can do.  I consider myself a bit more than a novice, but certainly not a pro with 3-D.  I do make my own drawings and print the items as well as download a lot from sites like Thingsverse.<br/><br/>The features I liked on this were fairly low price 150 x 150 x 150 print space, enclosed (quieter), ethernet ability.  I do not need the absolute best quality for most of my stuff.....and this one spec'ed out to match my needs.<br/><br/>First....out of box to printing test block was less than 10 minutes.  Block was pre-loaded, so it was easy.  First print was about 11 minutes and ended up dimensionally near perfect.  Two other prints (from my files--one thing verse, one mine) loaded via usb stick perfectly.  Both were items I have printed previously.....about the same time as printing with my Dremel and dimensionally (and finish) an improvement.  5 items on three prints all have been perfect.  Running a "torture test" print now and will up date with those results.<br/><br/>Flexible build plate has made removal of flat pieces easy with no tools.<br/><br/>I am using Flashforge PLA material....small spools that fit into the feeder build into machine.  Will feed from larger spools external to machine of other brands later.  Their material is pricey.....but it is very good compared to many other.brands....and the machine mount feeder is nice and quite easy to use.<br/><br/>I have used Flashforge downloaded software and it works ok but has limited options.  Will use a couple other slicers and update info.  The touch screen controls are very simple and intuitive.<br/><br/>For my skill level and expectations, it has been perfect out of box.  Will see if longevity is good as well.  I would think a new to 3-D printing hobbies will be happy with the machine.  I see them getting up to speed with basic stuff quickly.  For those like me, just above that level, it is performing well...no fuss and giving nice quality.<br/><br/>I should mention sound.  I have enclosures on my other three machines as well...but this one is quieter than the other three.....something that is good for all night prints.<br/><br/>OK.....unit has operated over 200 hours.  Most of time using ABS, the rest has been PLA.  Two failures out of all that (since original part of review) One was a design issue I created, the other I have not figured out<br/>Quality has been good but not spectacular.  Better than the Snapmaker 1.0.  I suppose it is due to time and adjustments, but the Dremel can do a bit better than this....but most will not notice the differences.  I have tried old and fresh filament, cheap and brand name and it has fed and placed anything I have run through it.  Snapmaker is really fussy and Dremel enclosure design provides some issues with using non-dremel internal mount filament<br/><br/>Changing the filament is quicker and easier than any of the other machines I have.  Removable flexible heated bedplate seems like a good design, looks new after 200 hours of use.<br/><br/>Would be a nice first choice as the learning curve is not steep.  Enclosure makes it quiet.  Variety of materials it uses has proven accurate in description.<br/><br/>Still happy with choice.  Not the most technical unit....and has some advanced feature limitations but for most users it will be just fine.  I have found the 150 x 150 x 150 volume a bit limiting so next unit will exceed that.</span>

<span> Will update if fixed<br/><br/>Bought the Artemis , but it clearly has the Aries ( from voxelab ) as it says Aries on the screen.<br/>As you can see in the video ; a simple “home” command creates a mess ( the extruder hitting the wall non stop ) and filament is not pulled through ( probably because last year Aries had the motor on the back not in the extruder.<br/><br/>That said : there’s no way to find anything about Artemis online , no place to get a firmware that would fix this. Tried resetting but again it’s saying Aries.<br/><br/>Such a shame , my adventure 3 was working perfect since day one. Was excited for the Same experience with the Artemis</span>

<span>So I did quite a bit of research on this topic, and I'm a high tech guy without a lot of time.  I had this printer working in under 15 minutes timed.<br/><br/>I looked at a start review above and I decided I needed to write one.  When you unbox this, there are zip ties and clips holding the print mechanism in place.  It's REALLY important that you remove all of those prior to powering on the printer.<br/><br/>The included manual included unboxing instructions I read through a couple of times prior to powering on.  Once I powered it on, I used flash print and printed these models above.  I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't plan on learning anything.  This printer seems to be good for people that just want to print things.<br/><br/>FYI -- this machine is super quiet, like the fan in room at slow speed is way louder than this printer.  I have a friend whos printer makes a lot of noise (like a OKIDATA from 1998).  This thing is perfect.<br/><br/>Thank you Flashforge for making this machine.</span>

<span>I am still relatively new to the 3D printer scene though I have a strong technical background.  I have two Creality ender 3's (one 8 bit and one 32 bit version) and a Creality  CR-10.  I have become comfortable with and familiar with Ultimaker Cura's slicer software but have not really used other slicers.<br/><br/>So I wanted to try out a delta printer and felt the V2 version of this Monoprice printer was a good starting point. Setup was straight forward and easy. Printing factory provided sample files worked pretty good.<br/><br/>Next I tried printing files sliced with Cura, that was a no go.  These prints will not stick to the bed.  Seems the printer settings profiles in Cura for thise Monoprice Delta printer won't allow you to print anything.  As I said earlier, I am new to this and after one print failure after another, I gave up...for about a month.<br/><br/>When I did finally come back to it, I was able to nail down a few things such as Cure was not able to slice to print and that when using the Monoprice package slicer software, it would print successfully. This eventually lead to more victories as I discovered  first layer settings needed slowed down and start g-code for this printer needed to be changing in Cura (probably end g-code as well).<br/><br/>I think this is a very easy printer for someone with little to no experience to set up and start printing something, however, I don't feel like this printer would be a good choice for a beginners.  This printer as a first will still leave a very steep learning curb when transiting into other 3D printers.</span>

<span> This is going to be a long one.<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>This printer comes in an ok box, with minimal protection. The box arrived damaged, so I was worried that the printer wouldn’t work. The printer was wrapped in bubble wrap, and came out of the box assembled. It includes an SD card, micro USB cable, (awful!) 3D printed spatula, and some Allen keys. Keep in mind that this printer doesn’t come with any filament, so make sure to buy a spool at time of purchase.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Setup was easy. All you had to do was remove some packaging, attach the spool holder, and plug it in. The instructions weren’t the best, but they gave some general tips. You loaded the filament, and pressed a button. The printer would then automatically print a test file. While you do that, you install the latest version of Cura, and import the profiles for the printer. It really wasn’t that hard. From there it gets more complicated. The bed is self leveled, but you need to change the offset values in the firmware (reasonably easy) to test and get it just right. I would definitely say that this printer is not as beginner friendly as it suggests.<br/><br/>Design:<br/>This printer is well designed, and made out of aluminum. It is lightweight, but it is pretty sturdy. The interface is a full color screen, and 3 buttons. Don’t be fooled, it IS NOT a touchscreen. It looks so much like one that I kept pressing it expecting it to work. The buttons are a bit clumsy. The printer uses a build-tak like surface, but you may still need to use some glue to make prints adhere. The print head uses a Bowden setup, which is ok, and works pretty well. So far, I have no had any jams with this printer.<br/><br/>Overall Review:<br/>This printer is NOT very beginner friendly. Sure, it was so easy to setup, but dialing in settings and firmware issues are a hard sell for an absolute beginner. There is an amazing wiki and I would suggest you look there for any problems. There is also a thingiverse collection with upgrades. The print quality blew me away for the price of this machine. It is on par with even an Ultimaker, a $2000+ machine. There were some hiccups in getting the bed level right, and it sometimes has glitches and jams the print head into the build plate. The main upgrade I did was replacing the bed with a piece of glass for better first layers. Again, the Wiki was an excellent help for this. As you can see but the pictures, I got some amazing prints with this machine. I was overall very impressed by this machine, especially for its price. It has features usually on found on $1000+ machines. I have to appreciate all the work that has gone into this machine. I would recommend this printer for anyone, but if you’re an absolute beginner you may find it tedious/time consuming to get this completely up and running.</span>

<span>On line in 10 min. Very smart design. The only problem is the small usb slot is a bit offset and  I missed the opening (black on black)  put the card into the box. SO I printed a slot cover that fixed the problem.</span>

<span>Factory support is virtually non-existent and the manual is not really helpful. This is billed as an out of the box printer and to an extent it it. But in order to get reliably successful prints you will need modify the g-code for bed leveling. Additionally, make sure you have a micro SD reader before you by this. I didn't have one so I had top download cura separately. For most printers I would imagine that's not an issue, but the mini delta is not a compatible option by default. To get everything to work I had top download a 3rd party patch (easy enough to fix with the directions, just drag and drop).<br/>As far as the printer itself is concerned, there are several issues, firstly its actually pretty loud. Just saying that doesn't really do it justice. I can hear this thing printing on the second floor while in on the first. If I am printing while on the computer, I have to have the volume turned way up to hear any videos.<br/>The auto leveling feature is not functional in any meaningful capacity, hence the need to modify the g-code<br/>And for some reason there is no power switch.<br/>The preheating is also really really slow and the print bed doesn't seem capable of even reaching 60 degrees Celsius. Temperatures seem to fluctuate by as much as 5 C. This may have to do with the 5 amp power supply, but I have also read that it could also be something in the firmware (more investigation is needed on my part)<br/>Print bed adhesion seems spotty at best, but that could also be something I am doing wrong, so take that with a grain of salt<br/>All that said, this is my first printer, and I am still dialing in the print settings on Acura, but after only 3 days of printing, the results are promising. This is helped in no small part by the absolutely massive community of makers out there and there is even a really dedicated community of makers around this once printer specifically to iron out its kinks and quirks.<br/>All in all, if I could go back to before I ordered this I would definitely order a different printer. There are a lot of quirks that need ironing and I was absolutely not ready for that.<br/>With that said however, I am incredibly happy with this printer. It is a lot of fun to watch it go and because of the quirks I have had to learn a lot about 3d printing in general, and fairly quickly too.<br/>Basically, if you know what you are doing, this is a great printer with a little work. If you are new to 3d printing, maybe get something else to get your feet wet. I had nearly given up and returned it before I figured out the worst of the kinks, but I am having fun now though,  so I quite happy with it.</span>
