<span>Awesome bundle! Exactly what you need and amazing detailed prints with barley any effort!</span>

<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I have ZERO experience with these printers but bought this for the positive reviews as I am a beginner. VERY easy set up. The prints are very detailed and so easy to do. My objects are usually 1 x 1.5 inches and I get about 6 on a plate. It takes about 3 hours to run. Easy clean up. I strongly suggest using Elgoo resin as its much easier and made for these printers. I have used another brand and it was not as good. You cannot go wrong with a bundle. The wash station is much easier than poking around with alcohol and having things messy. The curing station is amazing. My 6 small characters take 3 minutes til done. Beats the sun!</span>

<span>The Orange 30 is a budget-priced 3D Printer.  The print area fairly normal for this price range at 120mm x 68mm x 170 though, that makes it a little taller than normal in this range.  They check off the normal check boxes with a 2k LCD screen (2560x1440 resolution), and it comes with resin and additional FEP film.<br/><br/>Now, what sets this 3D Printer apart.  First, when you unbox it, you’ll find that it is HEAVY.  This thing uses a lot of steel in its build.  It is put together very solid.  When you fire it up, something else you will notice is how quiet it is.  If you have owned an Orange 10, you will know that the fan on that is rather loud.  This is much quieter, and honestly, quieter than the Photon or the Mars.  The Longer 30 also has an LCD temperature safety system to prevent the LCD from overheating.  The LCD display is very clean and easy to read.  It also shows the models well and has a really nice touch interface.  Their resin that it ships with is very low in smell.<br/><br/>They have their own specific slicer, and you can use the Chituibox slicer giving you more choices for slicing your prints.  I’ve made a number of prints on it, and not had a failure.  It came properly leveled and ready to print from the factory.  I’ve been very impressed with the details and it works terrific to print 3D Miniatures for RPG games.<br/><br/>Not everything is great, this printer has one drawback, and that is the hood.  You have to build it and it is held together by rubber bands.  It’s not quite as solid as others.  It works fine, and I understand why they do it, to save space in shipping to reduce costs.<br/><br/>If you run into problems, Longer 3D has a good community on Facebook for helping with community support.  They are quick to respond to problems and the community is terrific for helping out as well.  It is definitely a selling point of this printer.<br/><br/>Overall, I have been very impressed by this printer, especially compared to my FDM prints.  It is messier (As liquid resin is) but it produces amazing prints every time.</span>

<span>UPDATED: I returned this after fail after fail after fail began to happen. The final straw was when the plate stuck to the FEP twice after trying to level over and over again. I had maybe 10% success and it was 2 weeks of searching online, trying every single piece of advise, with no luck.<br/><br/>Bought a Mars Pro and I am 99% successful now, right out of the box and dozens of prints later. The Orange 30 is NOT a beginners printer.<br/><br/>This is my first 3D printer of any kind and I went with a resin printer because I mainly collect and paint gaming miniatures. The Longer Orange 30 was recommended by a friend that has been printing for a long time as a good entry level printer. After about 5 days of tinkering and many failed prints, I made my first successful miniature. I am hesitant to give this 5 stars and really it should be 4 for a few items that apparently are not common features. I have included them below, and then at the bottom of this review are some troubleshooting advice from what I had to do to get a good first print.<br/><br/>As a newbie in printers, I did not notice the uncommon features until after pointed out by others, so it wasn't really a big deal, but here they are:<br/><br/>1 - Out of the box you will have to build the case (the orange blue blocker case you see in the product photo) and it is held together by 2 rubberbands. This was a bit strange even to a newbie like me, and it time, those will need to be replaced by something more permanent<br/><br/>2 - The USB port is in the back. This is also a bit odd, but not really a big deal for me, but I imagine for someone planning on placing the printer in a corner, access will be less convenient.<br/><br/>3 -  The LongerWare software that comes with the printer is very, VERY, basic. I highly recommend using Chitubox and see Troubleshooting below for more on that. I struggled with the LongerWare and do not like it at all.<br/><br/>4 -  The manual is inaccurate. It is outdated and I do not recommend using it. Go to the website, join the FB group, and watch video on YouTube. There is where I found my answers.<br/><br/>5 - Forget about the test prints that come on the USB. They are terrible. Get a presupported file from the web, and go for it. After 2 attempts at a print with the test ones, I just used a file I had purchased that was presupported, and it worked (using Chitubox).<br/><br/>6 -  The images show that it comes with test resin and films (FEP). It does not. Apparently they stopped sending those in the box recently, so if it's a newer manufacture, it will not have it. If you get it, you have a early production run.<br/><br/>Ok, but does it work well once tweaked? YES! My print was amazing and I very happy with the result! It took tweaking and learning, but I am really looking forward to lots of printing. Once you get going, the actual functions are a breeze on the unit itself.<br/><br/>TROUBLESHOOTING<br/>So why did my first prints fail? Here is what I discovered:<br/><br/>1. Put the USB into the unit BEFORE you power on. Apparently you can get LCD malfunction if you do not. Then power off BEFORE you remove the USB.<br/><br/>2. Level, level, then level again. When you are setting it up, really spend time on leveling, with cross tightening of the screws while holding down both sides of the plate. I discovered on mine that one of the screws always lifted a certain corner. I had to figure out a tightening pattern so that it would not. Same goes for the resin vat. One side needs to be tightened first. Once you have the plate properly leveled, you shouldn't have to do it again, but just check it now and then.<br/><br/>3. The instructions for using Chitubox plugin in the manual is WRONG. There is this whole thing about creating a ZIP and putting it into LongerWare, etc. No. Don't do that. Follow YouTube instructions on how to do it right. Then you will be able to save directly as a Longer file.<br/><br/>4. In Chitubox, (Once you have the plugin properly loaded) make sure to set the Resin settings in the drop down correctly. I used the Longer3D Standard Rapid for .05mm and I have water washable resin (Elegoo here on Amazon).<br/><br/>5. Until you are a pro, go with the default settings in Chitubox for the Longer3D Orange 30. Someone had me move all of the defaults, and it failed. Just stick to the basics.<br/><br/>Hope some of this helps. Enjoy</span>

<span> Pros:<br/>Great prints, comparable to others such as elegoo and anycubic<br/>Lower price pint that the competition<br/>Linear Z rail stabilization<br/>Quiet operation<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Setting up the acrylic screening is difficult and held together by rubber bands and it isn't a clean look<br/>Tricky to set up into Chitubox (which you want to do for the software support and features)<br/>Non intuitive way to put files into usb drives for it to be read<br/>Touch screen is super sensitive or not so...  It takes practice to get it right<br/>Build Q&amp;A needs to be better<br/>Manual / Videos need some conversion for a US based audience<br/><br/>I am a avid miniatures hobbyist and someone that runs a D&amp;D game, is a tournament organizer for a competitive miniatures game, and someone that wants to be able to print my own miniatures for my games and others.  I also thought to use this printer for terrain, but there are much better/ cheaper options I've found out.<br/><br/>I have been looking at buying a resin printer since the new year to make custom trophies, and giveaways for the tournaments I run, as well as print and then paint my own miniatures or miniatures that I have bought.  I wanted to buy the Elegoo mars, but as I was getting close to buying it, news hit of the Mars Pro.  When that  went on sale it sold out fast, and I was left holding money in my hands.  So I started doing research into the other resin printers and stumbled on the Orange 30 from All3dp.<br/><br/>The orange 30 spouts many of the same dimensions as its' competitors, but it has 20mm more in height (Z axis travel) then the others and had some other features such as a linear z rail stabilization that wasn't present on others. Given the cost and some of the reviews I saw I decided to take a chance on it.<br/><br/>The machine arrived nicely packaged, and I immediately took it out and started to set it up. The first problem I ran into is "building" the enclosure.  There are 4 long acrylic pieces and one top piece to put together.  I failed to see the l shaped brackets, and they were not apparent to me in how to use them, but you have to use these brackets to hold the various plates together while they "fit" in place; and then rubber band the enclosure to keep it together.  It took me about 10 minutes of trial and error before I finally got the pieces to all hold together and for me to get the rubber bands on.  The plates do cut down on the packaging height, but I wonder if it was worth it.  There was at least one curse word said in doing it.<br/><br/>My second issue with the machine was that I knew I wanted to use a more universal software (Chitubox) in order to "slice" my files so that the machine can read and print them.  Well that involves doing several steps... and only in a certain order.  I've put the video on here so that others can understand.  You need to first download the plugin, install the plugin AND THEN  set up the printer profile.  If you do it the opposite way... nothing.<br/><br/>My third issue is that you need to use a USB with a certain file format (fat32); and that alone isn't enough, then you need to put all your files into a specific folder you make called longer3d.  Failure of either of these points and you won't be able to have the printer read or process your files.<br/><br/>My fourth issue is that after 2 months of use my lcd screen has failed.  While this is a consumable part, I will be filing for a new lcd screen to be issued to me.<br/><br/>Now to the good.  The prints.... are amazing!  As good as any other printer if not a bit better.  The resolution is there, the build plate is very stable, the way it is designed to let resin drip to one direction, and towards the back of the machine and not the front is great.  Once working it was a workhorse.  I haven't needed to relevel the build plate and basically only add resin and play around with settings.<br/><br/>Would I buy this again?  Maybe...  There is a lot of competition in the market for the budget resin printer. New printers are coming out almost monthly, and they are all getting better.  It is a dark horse in the printer market, but it is a good one.<br/><br/>The one way they could instantly help themselves out, is to be able to give us upgrades to make the printer even better.  Develop a monochrome screen and 4k resolution as upgrades and you would sell out.  But I digress.</span>

<span>I just started in 3D printing with this amazing machine, and I have to say it gets the job done well. I've never printed anything before, but I found it extremely quick and easy to get up and running with the Longer Orange 30 in no time. Rather than go with something easy, like the included files, for my first prints, I went with the objects you see in the photos. Talk about trial by fire--but I really learned a lot about how to do supports that way. The very first print I made on this machine was the cat. I was very pleased with the overall quality of the print produced. The only issue I had with it was the thumb on the one side--I failed to properly support it and it appears slightly melted-looking. My second print was the green knight. It was extremely difficult to get all the supports in there, and I lost some of the fabric at the bottom of the garment because I got the supports too close to the fabric and it snapped off during cleanup. (note: as you can tell, I did not do any sanding to get off any support leftovers on the base and figure) After the knight, I did experience a slight problem with a leak in the vat, which led to a big problem. I'll get to that in a moment. After I resolved that issue, I printed out the ring. The details are quite fine and apart from some support nubs that need removal, it looks superb.<br/><br/>As for the problem I experienced, after printing the knight, I had an issue where resin somehow got into the area between the vat and screen. I have no idea how it got in there, but the very next print I did, between the knight and the ring, turned out a very expensive brick of resin. I removed the vat and inspected the machine, and was saddened to find the seal had failed around the screen and allowed resin to get onto the wires. I removed the screen in the hopes of attempting to clean the wires, and the corner snapped off with light, gentle handling. I reached out to company support and received a prompt response. Within days they sent me a replacement vat, lcd screen, and new bottle of resin for my trouble. I was very impressed with their commitment to customer service/support to say the least, and I have no problem recommending this purchase as a result. I'm back up and running, very happy with my wonderful 3D printer. My only advice to you on this matter is to carefully inspect the seal after/before every print, check the vat for any leaks, and be extremely cautious with the resin because, as some have pointed out elsewhere, the stuff tends to get places you'd never expect it to get.  As for the seal, I'm currently using electrical tape and will update this review if I have any news to report. I hear that kapton tape is the stuff to get, and I will probably switch over to that as soon as I can.<br/><br/>I gave the touch screen only 3 stars because it isn't as responsive as I'd like. It works okay, but I generally have to make sure a fingernail and the fleshy part of my finger are touching it at the same time for it to register contact. Having said that, it's clear and easy to use otherwise. Just can sometimes be a pain in the rear.<br/><br/>The included software seems okay, but really I found Chitubox much easier to use with a necessary plugin file to make it work with this printer. Both are free, but the plugin was hard for me to locate. I went with the link provided by this guy at youtube: gj-ii3XzTEw. That plugin worked great for me, and after installing it, I never touched the included software again. A couple of things about Chitubox--DO NOT use autosupport function as it will likely mess up your print, AND there seems to be a bug on really high resolution layers where holes that are placed in objects do not go all the way through. You can find mention of it on their forum. I had to use a drill to let the resin out through the hole which did not go all the way through on both models. That's an issue with Chitubox, however, and not Longer's printer.<br/><br/>As for my settings--I was using the translucent green Anycubic plant-based "safety" resin with the following settings and they worked well for this resin: Layer Height .04, Bottom Layer 6, Exposure Time 10 and Bottom Exposure Time 60. I did switch up to .05 mm layer height after having the hole not complete issue at .04 mm, but it did not seem to help. It may have been because I didn't make the hole a large enough diameter. Not sure. Again, not Longer's fault. You can see the print quality in the knight especially--right down to the leather buckle straps sticking out on the sides of the chest plate armor. My advice for noobs like me on support structures is to check out 3DPrintingPro's updated settings on YouTube. Very, very helpful stuff. You see what I was able to make within a few days of receiving my printer. If I can do it, anyone can.<br/><br/>Apart from one hiccup, I'm very impressed with Longer and their printer. They provide superb customer service, and even though the replacement screen was shipped from China, it arrived in only a few days. Be sure to check out their Facebook support page for news and tips. Oh, and one of the creators/company founders got his Phd at Georgia Tech. Very cool. I was nervous about taking the plunge on an item like this with no 3d printing experience, but I'm extremely happy and satisfied with the return on my money that this has given me. For the print size possible at the price point offered, I think it's a worthy investment and point of entry to the hobby+. Still working out whether or not it will be possible to make money with this.</span>
