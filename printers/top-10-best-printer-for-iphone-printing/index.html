                   <h4> What People Say:</h4>
<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>My only complaint is that it changes the connection number and has 3-4 each time and have to reconnect each time I open the app. However, the set up for my iphone was easy. There was a card in the power box that I could scan and it lead me to the right app to download and I can print from my phone. I just save my labels to my document folder and then open the app and select the file and then connect to the printer and print.<br/>The printer was very easy to load and the feeding tray for the label to sit in is also simple to put together. So far I have no other complaints then the connection to the printer each time.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>The first thing noticed when opening the box was the label holder inside.  Maybe I didn't read the description, but I thought I was going to need to purchase a label holder if the flat-fold didn't work out.  But now I don't have to!<br/>The Label Holder was very easy to assemble and can do both the flat-fold and rolled labels.  Cords &amp; accessories are individually wrapped.  The only shortfall I noticed was the printer was shipped in its own box and there wasn't protective tape over the pull-out opening.  Otherwise, the inside was very well thought out.<br/>Took about 3-5 minutes to assemble without accessing the directions.  Power cord &amp; USB standard, nice action on the release button to open the top cover, it's firm, not flimsy.  Opens nicely and there's already a test print label for your inspection.  It has the model, Serial #, and Software Version which you could cut off and apply to the front of the printer for easy reference.<br/>It comes with flat-fold labels that will allow you to start printing immediately.  It automatically aligns the label, so you're not wasting any.  The instruction book is well done and very picture-to-picture oriented.  It comes with a USB drive setup, but you can also get the drivers online.  The reset/form feed button is very efficient, one press feeds one label, hold down for about 5 seconds/beep for two labels feed while the printer verifies the space between labels, holding down for 10 seconds another beep and when you release you get a self-test printout with the current status of the printer.  Very fast print, too.<br/>Overall a very easy piece of equipment to purchase, install, and print from.  Recommend buy!<br/>PS-It is Bluetooth capable, so you can follow the instructions to link it to your laptop or phone.  Their website has videos and tutorials to make that easier.</span>

<span>I have a Dymo 4XL Label Printer and absolutely love it. 10 years and its still going strong. BUT... more and more I'm finding I need to print customer labels on the go. So I set out on a mission to find a printer that worked wirelessly and came across this gem.<br/><br/>My initial impressions:<br/>1 - fast shipping.  I ordered and received this and labels in the same day. Perfect.<br/>2 - easy. the instructions are clear and I was up and printing labels in less than 10 minutes<br/>3 - print quality. My Dymo produces crisp and clear labels. It also cost me over $400. For $100 this does pretty good. On a scale of 1 to 10 for print quality, I'd give it a 6 or 7. It's not crisp, but it gets the job done. I print UPS and USPS labels directly from my Shopify store and both print well. I have not had to deal with the other feature where you import a file and crop it and print it. Reading the other reviews, that feature does not seem to work well. Hopefully that won't be a bridge I have to cross.<br/><br/>How it Works:<br/>It's not true wireless or bluetooth printing. You have to download an app (albeit a very basic one). When you go into Shopify and tell it you want to print a label, it opens open the "file sharing" dialog (I have an iPhone). It then gives you options to send the file to the printer app, or airdrop, send to email, etc.  You pick the printer app which then opens that app. From there you have to choose 4 x 6 labels, and then review the printer settings. Then you click print and it goes.<br/><br/>Ideally, I'd like to be able to choose the printer from within the shopify app like a normal person, but the extra steps go quick.  To make it go a few seconds faster, I adjusted the settings on my phone to show the printer app among my top 4 choices for printing so I don't have to keep hunting and scrolling for it.<br/><br/>So far so good. My other choice was a Brother QL1110. It's out of stock just about everywhere and those that do have it in stock are charging twice the normal listed price ($400) ugh.  I'll update my review if this little guy fails me, but fingers crossed, I won't have to.</span>

<span>This printer was literally a life saver. I wanted to ship items to FBA before I went on vacation without paying their prep and labeling fees because they add up. I ordered overnight along with a USB adapter for MAC because I figured I would need it. Nice surprise it already came with the adapter!! It arrived at my house at 6:50am next morning! It also comes with 4x6 labels and I ordered 2x1 barcode labels for the Amazon skus. I haven't figured out the barcode labels correct gaps because it spaces like a standard 4x6 but I'll call after my vacation lol. Right now I just made it work with it printing while skipping a few because of the time crunch. I was able to print 54 sku labels plus the UPS labels, plus suffocation warning labels all in minutes. I was feeling myself and my husband had to return some shoes using USPS so I ended printing that at home too. Taped the boxes up, stuck the labels, dropped them off and finished!!</span>

<span>I bought this printer and the photos it printed had scratched and streaks of color on them. I contacted customer service which was actually helpful and responded quickly. I tried different ink cartridges but it didn’t seem to help. I returned the printer and received another one. The second one started okay, it didn’t have the streaks of color at first but it still had scratches. After one or two pictures printed with no color streaks (just scratches) the photos began to print yet again with color streaks and scratches. I’m just going to accept it and be thankful I have the hard copies of photos and try to ignore the color streaks.</span>

<span>It does the job, although I’m still working on the color settings. On standard quality, pictures tend to print lighter than they should. High quality setting seems to print much richer color results. I still kinda miss my MG5200 series, but it crapped out and started printing blurry pictures and particularly anything with text. Even after a deep clean maintenance run. So we’ll see how it goes after a couple more months, but so far, I’m fairly pleased.</span>

<span>I wouldn't say set up was easy but it was doable. Android app (necessary to print) is not user friendly at all. No print quality (resolution) settings. Prints washed out right out of the box. Cleaned heads 2x, deep cleaned 2x - 2nd time after 24 hrs as instructed, replaced ink cartridges that came with the printer with brand new Canon cartridges and STILL get washed out prints. In the attached image the 4x6 was right out of the box &amp; the 8.5x11 is after all the above steps completed. Extremely disappointed. Today's Labor day so can't speak to a customer service rep until tomorrow. I'll update this review if &amp; when this gets resolved.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>Okay, returned 1st printer &amp; received replacement quickly (even before they received the 1st one back). Again the Canon print app is not user friendly for set-up. There is no "register product" or "set-up" option identified anywhere on the home screen.<br/>To register your printer:<br/>Tap the printer icon with the + in the upper left corner of the home screen then follow the instructions.<br/>To set-up the printer:<br/>Tap the printer icon at the bottom of the home screen then "check/change set-up." Follow instructions for "printer preparation" and then "network set-up."<br/>NOTE: I also found how to make the printer "identifiable" for setting up the network on the paper instructions included.<br/>Once you've done these steps the printer will remain connected even after turning it off and on again.<br/>At this point the actual printing process is a breeze. I've included an after photo of the same image.<br/>All said and done I gave 4 stars, it would have been 5 if the app was more user friendly.</span>

<span> this is an amazing thermal printer. No ink needed and it can print pictures. It works  with my i phone perfectly with the phomebo app. It connects by Bluetooth to the printer and can print amazing black and white images, or list, or study notes, work projects , you name it. Only thing I have to buy is the paper no ink at all. I can’t believe how easy it is to use and so much fun. The app is incredibly easy to use and create things with. I also love the blue color of this printer. It can be used with sticky paper too so I can create labels or stickers or so many other things . Endless ideas !</span>

<span>I purchased a thin paper and it kept sliding blank sheets out and half printed pages. It's shakes when printing. It's difficult to set up. The ink it came with ran out fast. It had an automatic refill option to sign up for but I was not aware of that during purchase so I bought ink along with printer. The refill option expires in 7 days that's not enough time to determine how often someone would need a refill option. I purchased this printer on sale thank God I did not pay full price. It looks cheap and like it's going to break any day. Whenever I have to use it I try to make extra time for printing because I never know when it's going to just print. The only good thing I notice is the pages come out pretty fast. The page catcher could use an extra flap especially since the printer shakes.</span>

<span>So I have to say, after reading the reviews about this being renewed, I was wanting to cancel my order but it was to late. I got it today which is 4-6 days sooner then was estimated for delivery, granted I live in the same town as 2 Amazon distribution centers so… either way as for the “renewed” I opened the box to find it extremely well packaged, with tape to hold anything from sliding open, as well as wtf padding I’ve never seen this extent of padding before, all the cords were neatly wrapped up in a zipper bag with brand new ink cartridges included. So this is beyond what I expected from the bad reviews and instead I hope this posted near the top to be seen, not all returns/renewed items are always in this type of condition but most are. I’ve only had 1 bad experience from renewed items which is able to easily be returned if there’s any issues with it upon delivery.</span>

<span>Extremely frustrating… bought this for small mobile office as it is small and says connects easily to phones, etc., as it’s primary home will be without a permanent/stable WiFi network in an effective Faraday Cage (metallic box - trailer).<br/><br/>Install HP app on a Windows 10 machine. Barely finds printer in setup, but takes forever and finally fails setup (poor/spotty WiFi … see use purpose above).<br/><br/>So alright, it comes with USB connector… I can connect direct to Ethernet connected computer at 200Mbps. Wrong, it fails that connection/setup also. Plus, in setup for the 3 options(WiFi, Ethernet (there is no Ethernet port on printer) and USB), it says InstaInk is not supported by USB connection?! Seriously, WTF a connection is a connection.<br/><br/>So I try the WPS option…. (Press the Info and wifi buttons at the same time with a piece of paper in it to get a code that only lasts 5 minutes!) and this fails to connect also.<br/><br/>Going to try connecting via a smartphone next. But I suspect this is not connecting by Bluetooth, but rather in fact via an established WiFi network ONLY.<br/><br/>Most likely sending back. Luckily it is a 90 day return guarantee. Just annoyed given my need for a small all in one, it ONLY (presumably) works when networked on a strong and stable WiFi network. Which coincidentally, was the reason I bought a second printer …. The other is at the edge of WiFi connectivity cannot maintain a stable connection.</span>

<span>A review in three parts:<br/><br/>1. I was sceptical of this printer but needed to purchase one rather quickly. I had difficulty sourcing the more mainstream brands that I had been interested in. Earlier Pantum reviews had raised significant worries re: set-up and durability of the P2502W.<br/><br/>It was delivered quickly and the installation was smoother than expected (15 minutes). I had no difficulty downloading the driver with Windows 10 on my laptop and no difficulty with setting up the USB and wireless connections.<br/><br/>On Day 1, the printer worked great and I printed about 15 pages without difficulty.<br/><br/>2. On Day 2, I tried printing several more pages. Midway through a print job, my laptop displayed a printer error. It indicated that the "printer cover" was "open". While the cover was not visibly open, I opened it and closed it. This had no effect. I repeated this several times but the printer continued to report that the cover was open. I cancelled the job and tried again. I restarted my laptop and the printer. Nothing fixed this error message.<br/><br/>I reached out to customer support via Amazon.<br/><br/>3. On Day 3 (~12 hours later), Pantum customer support responded via Amazon message. They suggested reinstalling the printer driver.<br/><br/>I did this and the printer has begun to work again without the error message.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>I remain somewhat sceptical. I increased my initial "star rating" but will definitely try to return the printer if the error message continues to return. I'll definitely update this review if I do.<br/><br/>Two additional concerns were that:<br/><br/>1) The printer gets hot. I have it on a hard surface and it's reasonably well ventilated but I worry about this in the longer term (particularly as an earlier review had indicated that components of the printer had warped due to heat)<br/><br/>2) (It doesn't bother me too much but) The printed pages come out curled up at either end. Of note, I'm using Hammermill Printer Paper, Premium Color (also from Amazon) - Perhaps this is the cause.</span>

<span>I bought this to be a quick and easy to use, black and white laser printer. I need a printer available, and until my office gets rearranged and the new furniture put in place, my regular printer isn't available. I set this new printer up in my bedroom and read through the manual to get it set up to be available for wifi printing. (This was an absolutely non-negotiable requirement.)<br/><br/>Figuring out how to set it up was not easy. I'm very familiar with setting up printers, I was IT and Help Desk for printer support for several years for another company. The instructions for this printer were not particularly up-to-date, so they keep referencing a CD and using a CD to install. It took some extra effort to find a non-CD option.<br/><br/>I got the printer (finally) set up, after two different tries, and confirmed that it printed wirelessly. Hurray!<br/><br/>And then problems hit.<br/><br/>Some genius cut a fiber cable somewhere and took down internet in a large portion of my state. Then the company that supplies my internet got my address and someone else's mixed up and caused additional issues. These are not the fault of the printer, but they do directly impact the performance of the printer.  My router was rebooted multiple times and ever since, the Pantum printer does not print wirelessly from my computer.<br/><br/>I only ever get printing errors.<br/><br/>I've removed the printer from the system, reinstalled the software, re-set it up... and it still won't print. In desperation, I've gotten the app on my phone so that I can print absolutely necessary things that I do not have time to mess around with. But I shouldn't have to do that.<br/><br/>All my past printers could recover from issues like a rebooted router and it appalls me that the Pantum can't. If the return window hadn't closed already, this thing would be bundled back up and returned.<br/><br/>Is it a decent little printer? Yes.<br/>Is it worth the price I paid for it? Um... if your power never goes out, you never have to reboot your wifi router, and/or you only print over a wired connection, then yes. But otherwise, I can't truly say it is.<br/>Would I recommend this printer? Only if you can't afford a better one with better software or you really LOVE having to struggle to print.</span>

<span>The printer accomplishes the basic job of printing photos directly from your phone.  However, the quality is variable.  Photos I take on my phone are generally "meh," even ones with good light.  The colors are just not as intense and true as they appear electronically.  I have printed a few things taken a long time ago and uploaded on a photo site that seem to print more consistently high quality.  Oddly, a photo of a very old photo printed pretty nicely as well.  I am probably not going to be using this to print photos for framing because of this variability.  Instead I am using them in art journaling; to my mind the image by itself doesn't matter as much as the entire story told on the page.<br/><br/>My bigger issues are : (1) the battery runs out super fast.  Even a handful of prints sucks all the life out of the printer; and (2) the software is clunky.  Case in point: it was always printing two photos even when I sent the print copies to 1.  To fix this, I had to delete the app, restart my iPhone, download the app again, login again and re-pair the device to my phone.  This really just should not happen.  I was told by their Helpdesk that they roll out updates all the time.  Why not fix this very basic issue then?</span>

<span>This is a great little printer *for what it is*. It’s incredibly small and lightweight, and the app is well-designed and easy to use. The print size is a smidge larger than other printers, which I like, and the sticky-back Zink paper is perfect for journaling. But (and DO NOT come at me over this) you should not expect to get the best results without a little effort. There’s a reason that photographers use apps like Photoshop and Lightroom and it’s because NO printer will reproduce exactly what you see on a screen.  Some of that is due to the printer calibration and some of that is your screen/device/camera calibration.  If you demand high quality image reproduction, you don’t want a pocket printer — they all return worse quality in color, sharpness, etc., than a half-decent desktop inkjet printer. You are buying *convenience* with pocket printers. THAT SAID, a fair number of people are reporting a pink (magenta) or blue (cyan) cast to their prints that other manufacturers’ models do not seem to have, which is decidedly disappointing. Mine has a pink cast, hence my -1 star.<br/><br/>There are instructions from the manufacturer for resetting the unit to address this problem, and you should use the calibration card in each Zink packet as recommended (and keep it for recalibration).  If those things do not work, there are some simple edits you can make to your photo (before you open it in the HP app) to correct for the color cast if you otherwise like the Sprocket Select and are willing to sacrifice a few prints in the process.  The suggestions below will not be news to most photography enthusiasts (let alone professionals) — I’ve included them here because even though I think that HP has considerable room to improve the thermal control of this printer (which is how the colorization occurs with Zink paper), I still think this little printer has a lot going for it and casual photographers can get much improved prints from it.<br/><br/>1) The simplest method: You can counteract color casts by finding the “tint” setting in your photo editor (ALWAYS be sure to make and work on a copy of your original image if you’re not sure you can revert the image to its original state by undoing the edits).  If your prints have a blue/cyan cast, use the tint adjustment to push the image towards red/magenta; if your prints are pink, move the tint towards green.  For relatively simple editors (e.g., iOS Photos), you might start by making a 100% adjustment and then backing off from there in 10-20% increments for subsequent prints (of the same image) if you’ve gone too far.  The image may look horrible on screen, but that’s not the point. Whatever setting you decide gives the best result, apply it to future images (or their copies) before you open them in the HP Sprocket app; this won’t work 100% of the time, but should help in many cases.  Also be aware that various editing apps for different devices will apply differing amounts of adjustment at comparable settings (e.g., “50%” in one app on one phone may be “75%” on another phone or in a different editing app), so you may want to follow some of the additional steps below to dial in the best possible correction, albeit at the price of a few more test prints.<br/><br/>2) If you’re willing to put in a bit more effort: pick a photo that is representative of your most common subject (e.g., landscape, portrait, nighttime) and choose one with a good range of values (light to dark) and that is not under- or overexposed.  Convert this to black and white (monochrome) in your phone/tablet/computer photo editor (no fancy enhancing filters, just a basic conversion) and print the image.  This will allow you to see which values in the image have the greatest color cast (highlights, mid-tones, or shadows), which can be hard to see in a color image.<br/><br/>3) Go back to the original color image (or your copy!) and target your tint correction by looking at the values (areas) of the image with the worst color cast in the black and white version.  This is inherently subjective, and remember it’s not meant to look good onscreen. Make a print and assess whether you need more or less tint correction. Rinse and repeat until you’re satisfied enough, recalling that you’re not aiming for perfection from this convenience printer.<br/><br/>4) For the folks with more sophisticated photo editing apps that allow targeted editing of color balance in terms of value ranges — highlights, mid-tones, or shadows (e.g., Lightroom or Pixelmator Photo on iOS):  Start with Step 2 to figure out where the color cast is the worst but instead of changing the image tint in the original color image (which affects the whole image), tweak the cyan/red or magenta/green balance for just the values in the image that need the most correction (e.g., mid-tones). If you’re not sure whether the cast is in, for example, the mid-tones or highlights, just pick one (mid-tones) and make a 100% change in the color balance relevant to the color cast your prints have — if the area you’re concerned with (from step 2) changes the most onscreen, you’ve got it.  If not, undo and try the other value range.  If you like the result and your photo editor allows it, save this setting as a preset and apply to future images before printing. (And you can edit two or all three of the value ranges with differing amounts of color correction!)<br/><br/>5) For the truly adventurous: follow step 4 with additional enhancements, such as slight bumps to settings like “vibrance”, “clarity”, overall brightness (if images print a bit dark) and contrast (if images look a bit flat).  Your photo editor probably allows changes to brightness in the value ranges of the color balance section, too, if you want a targeted effect. Save as a preset and apply to future images before opening them in the HP Sprocket app for printing.<br/><br/>Using these techniques, I was able to get a *much* better, more true-to-life color print after five prints (original; B&amp;W; 100% green tint; less tint correction and more brightness; and finally, targeted value range corrections to color and brightness with bumps to overall vibrance and contrast based on earlier prints).  You may not want to have to do anything to your images before printing - in that case, move along or take your chances and be prepared to return you unit if you dislike the prints.  But if you don’t mind a little twiddling, I actually recommend this little printer.</span>

<span> This is a great little device! I use it to print out photos for scrapbooking and note boards, etc.... The print quality is pretty good for much a small machine, and it’s very easy to use. It comes with one pack of photo paper, and you can buy more easily (I recommend the non branded ones - much cheaper and pretty much the same quality, fit the machine fine).</span>

<span>This little printer is great! Perfect for journaling since the pics have sticky backs. The set up was a tiny bit confusing, but I’m old and technology is challenging for me, thank goodness for my kids 😍</span>
