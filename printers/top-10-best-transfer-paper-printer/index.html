<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>These work really well, fourth time we are using this! A few tips for you, especially since the instructions leave a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>1) WASH THE SHIRT FIRST<br/><br/>I forgot about the washing of the shirts ahead of time.  The first time we used these the shirts are still hanging in there after about two years and multiple washes.  The next two times we forgot to wash the shirts, the iron ons looked great but are peeling a bit already.<br/><br/>2) DO NOT PRINT IN REVERSE, THIS IS NOT AN IRON ON TRANSFER!  THINK OF IT MORE LIKE AN IRON ON PATCH!<br/><br/>Meaning: What you print out is what you will see EXACTLY on your shirt.  The ink does not transfer to your shirt.  if you're not sure what that means, do you know those little kid toy tattoos that you peel, apply to skin, and then put a wet sponge on the back of the tattoo to get the ink to "transfer" to the skin (and it does it in reverse of what you see).  That is a transfer.  This is more like an iron on patch, but instead of a patch, it is what you print out on the printer sheet.<br/><br/>3) PEEL THE BACKING FIRST!<br/><br/>Because the "iron on patch" will be stuck to the surface it is on.  If you do not peel the backing, then your print will be forever sealed to the backing.  You want it sealed onto the shirt.  Fortunately, the back of the sheet has numerous pieces on it, not just one big piece, so I was able to cut the shape of the heart on my transfer and still was able to peel it quite easily.<br/><br/>4) Use the white sheet included in between the iron and the printable.<br/><br/>I think otherwise you may discolor your shirt with all the heat from the iron<br/><br/>5) 3 minutes, not a lot of pressure, repeatedly going over the entire printable esp the edges<br/><br/>I did not use anything close to a lot of pressure, I think that also may discolor your fabric.  Just fairly light even pressure over the course of 3 minutes, not staying in any one place too long, over and over and over<br/><br/>6) Let the surface cool down a bit after each iron<br/><br/>Mostly because otherwise the next shirt will get hot when you put it down and it's waiting and you don't want to accidentally have your iron on printable get heat sealed any little bit before you apply the iron.  Just to be on the safe side<br/><br/>Great product!!!</span>

<span>Easy to use once you get all the materials. Fortunately, we just broke down an old desk, so I used a piece of the particle board to iron on top of.  It fit perfectly. That’s the only issue I’d have with this - would be finding a wood-like surface to iron on top of.  Otherwise, directions are clear and simple. Print design, cut, peel side that’s face down, iron, cool, peel top side and you’re done! Colors came out well on red, blue, green and yellow canvas bags I was ironing. I even accidentally started to iron without peeling the bottom side - realized my mistake fairly quickly and was able to pull it apart and still use it! Wasn’t perfect but at least it wasn’t wasted.</span>

<span>I'm a graphic designer, coach various kid teams &amp; always seem to be making shirts for them. I began using the Avery transfers in 2010 &amp; have some shirts that have been through the wash countless times since then. Never had a problem &amp; the colors seem to last amazingly well over time. Other than using only white or light grey fabric &amp; a good quality shirt, my tips would be:<br/>1) pre-wash the shirt (I've used cotton &amp; 50/50) &amp; tumble dry.<br/>2) Plain paper final review: ALWAYS look at your design through the back of the paper (hold it up to a window or bright light) &amp; make sure all of your text has been mirrored &amp; the design looks good.<br/>3) Print the final design using the best quality your printer can output.<br/>4) Trim close to the printed parts but leave a bit of a margin - 2mm'ish. Don't cut so close that your design falls apart or warps while you are ironing. Round off points, if even a little.<br/>5) For fine designs that have been cut to the flimsy stage, cover with a sheet of parchment paper in the beginning of the ironing  to get it stuck down. The parchment can be removed to finish the ironing. Baking parchment will not stick to this stuff &amp; can get pretty darn hot. Do not use waxed paper or regular printer paper: they do not like to get hot.<br/>6) Follow the package ironing instructions. Simple as that. I use a cutting board on the floor so I can apply good pressure. For sleeve designs, my hubbie made me a little block of wood that fits inside. He cut a small groove on the bottom for the seam so the wood lays flat.<br/>7) After I peel the paper off I lay a piece of parchment over the whole design &amp; give it a final hit with the iron. This seems to really set the transfer into the fabric &amp; gives the most natural feel.<br/>8) If you can plan ahead, it's good to give them a final rinse with a bit of vinegar in the water to set the dye. Line dry &amp; tumble on low to soften the whole shirt. I've never had the nerve to do the full heat dryer before the 'event' but that's my own weird thing.<br/><br/>My worst experiences have come from using a cheap, lightweight shirt, using transfers that were too old or had been exposed to moisture (they did work though, just needed some extra tlc), or using a shirt color other than white or light grey.<br/><br/>Love these things, just ordered 18 more. Buy them, have fun.</span>

<span>Problem:  third grader wanted to do a piano/singing tribute to Bowie, and online printers would not print the design sought due to copy right, though we had modified some of the graphics.  Their position was understood.  Then I discovered the Avery transfer paper.  I bought both the dark and the light color transfer papers not knowing which the little guy would prefer at the end.<br/><br/>Here is the upshot, working with both the light and dark paper:<br/><br/>• Wash and dryer dry your t shirt/fabric first.  A shrunk fabric works best<br/>• the more time you spend prepping and the closer you follow the instructions the better your end product<br/>• don't be afraid of force (pushing down) and heat<br/>• Trimming the extra paper on the light paper minimizing areas that will be clear but somewhat glossy<br/>• Trimming the extra areas on the dark paper avoids transferring the color white to the fabric<br/>• Through trial and error I figured out it is better to avoid sharp corners to make them round, reducing the risk of corners peeling off<br/>• The side of the paper you print on is the white side  for both dark and light paper, so make sure you know how to load the paper in your inkjet printer<br/>• Your final print area can be larger than a sheet as you can cut images/words from the paper and space them or  use them elsewhere on the shirt (for instance, arm badges can be printed in a corner of the same sheet)<br/><br/>Trick:<br/>• To avoid damage to the reverse side graphics, if you do a front/back design, use a large cutting board or a piece of flat wood slide it in the t-shirt that way the wood sits between the front and back.  This also solves the issue of both sides of the t-shirt not being perfectly flat/ironed before you start<br/><br/>Light Color Paper:<br/>• You need to print in reverse as the image is reflected back on the fabric.  I used Powerpoint and flipped the images and writing and avoided the online Avery tool for doing so<br/>•  As mentioned before, you don't have to cut very precisely as you only leave behind gloss/clear where you don't trim<br/><br/>Dark Color Paper:<br/>• You DO NOT need to print in reverse<br/>• You need peel of the printed paper BEFORE initiating transfer with an iron -I wasted one sheet not bing careful<br/>• The portion you don't trim transfer as white and you can create a border, rough or smooth, as I did with the front of the dark t shirt<br/>• Peeling the transfer portion from the t shirt before ironing is difficult....I used tweezers and eventually I managed to peel off the backing<br/>• You use an included parchment paper over the peeled paper to press the image onto the fabric<br/><br/>Final Impressions:<br/>• Don't expect professional grade printing<br/>• Recognize these are not permanent and are intended for fun and event needs<br/>• Mistakes and rough edges on my work is my own haste getting in the way<br/><br/>This met my needs, to have a front/back t-shirt design on both dark and white t-shirts, using the appropriate paper for each color.<br/><br/>**** UPDATE *****<br/>Both the white and black t shirts have been washed about 15 times each by now.  And, they still look very nice.</span>

FOREVER LASER DARK No-Cut Heat Transfer Paper This Self-Weeding 2-Paper-System from FOREVER gives amazing and consistent results:Transfer white and light colors onto black, dark, and light-colored garments, including cotton, polyester, and blends, as well as paper/carton and book covers, with an Oki 711 White Toner Printer and Forever Laser-Dark Paper. This media also works extremely well for transferring solid dark-color designs from an Oki 800 series CMYK printer. Benefits:Transparent print media for exact positioning Low processing temperature (150C-160C, 300F-320F)Extremely high wash fastness due to a special top-coating Higher white cover and stronger full-tone colors High processing tolerance, especially when separating A&B papers Suitable for OKI White Toner and CMYK Printers How it Works:The B sheet has a coating which adheres to toner on the A sheet. Because CMYWT printers produce white toner, the B Sheet now has something to adhere to for coverage of white and light-colored areas allowing them to be transferred.You just print on the transparent A-Foil, press it together with the dark opaque B-Paper LowTemp and separate both sheets from each other while hot. Now, you have white coverage on the image through the B-Paper LowTemp, which does not only increase the opacity of the transfer on dark garments, but also contributes to its washability. Both steps are done at the same temperature. The application tolerances are extremely high, reducing handling errors and allowing the user high flexibility A - FOILThis is the transfer media on which you print your image. It holds the toner extremely well, but does not leave any residues in the copier or any background on the garment. No more guessing where the transfer is applied! The transparent foil gives precise placement on your garment. Now you can place transfer onto your textile. B-PAPER LowTempThe B-Paper LowTemp was developed specifically for the A-Foil. It is finely tuned to ensure optimal processing

<span>I purchased this paper to make personalized t-shirts for Christmas. I found a video on YouTube with very detail step-by-step instructions on exactly how to use this paper. The video demonstrated the paper on a hot press. I posted a comment about using the paper with a regular iron and received feedback from the manufacturer very quickly. The only reason I did not give five stars is that it is a little tricky to use this paper with an iron. You must keep the iron on the transfer paper for about twice the amount of time the instructions call for  and let it cool for much longer. When you go to remove the backing from the paper, be sure there is no resistance whatsoever or your image will be ruined. I messed up a couple of shirts, but it was because of lack of experience on my part. Once I got the hang of it, the shirts turned out beautifully, so you may want to practice on an old item or two before beginning your project. The items are wrapped and under the Christmas tree so I have not experienced how they hold up in the wash yet.</span>

<span>Update on 03-11-2019: I wound up putting decals on four shirts. I washed and dried them today, and they look great. Original Review - Excellent. I used this to make 3.5" round iron-on patches for my astronomy club. I carefully followed the instructions, and they worked great. I ironed the patch onto two shirts to make sure they're okay before I take them to the next club meeting. So far, so good. I'll be washing and drying both shirts over the next couple of days and will follow up if there is a problem after washing. Some important points: 1. I used the "cotton" setting on my iron, with the steam shut off. I pressed hard each time and kept the iron in full contact with the transfer.  2. You have to use parchment paper in the final pressing step. I ordered mine from Amazon, but you could probably find it in a grocery store as it is frequently used for baking and for separating frozen meats, etc.  3. I put both of mine on cotton shirts. At first I used the "cotton blend" setting on my iron, and the decal started lifting up when I tried to peel the backing paper off. So, before it did any damage, I increased the iron setting to "cotton" and ironed another 10 seconds on the backing paper. After it cooled, the backing paper came right off.  4. For the second shirt, I used the same parchment paper, and a small piece of the decal stuck to the parchment paper. So my recommendation is to use a fresh piece of parchment paper for each transfer.  5. If you haven't done this before, start out with something small and on a piece of fabric that you don't mind pitching if you mess up.</span>

FOREVER LASER DARK No-Cut Heat Transfer Paper This Self-Weeding 2-Paper-System from FOREVER gives amazing and consistent results: Transfer white and light colors onto black, dark, and light-colored garments, including cotton, polyester, and blends, as well as paper/carton and book covers, with an Oki 711 White Toner Printer and Forever Laser-Dark Paper. This media also works extremely well for transferring solid dark-color designs from an Oki 800 series CMYK printer. Benefits: Transparent print media for exact positioning Low processing temperature (150C-160C, 300F-320F) Extremely high wash fastness due to a special top-coating Higher white cover and stronger full-tone colors High processing tolerance, especially when separating A&B papers Suitable for OKI White Toner and CMYK Printers How it Works: The B sheet has a coating which adheres to toner on the A sheet. Because CMYWT printers produce white toner, the B Sheet now has something to adhere to for coverage of white and light-colored areas allowing them to be transferred. You just print on the transparent A-Foil, press it together with the dark opaque B-Paper LowTemp and separate both sheets from each other while hot. Now, you have white coverage on the image through the B-Paper LowTemp, which does not only increase the opacity of the transfer on dark garments, but also contributes to its washability. Both steps are done at the same temperature. The application tolerances are extremely high, reducing handling errors and allowing the user high flexibility A - FOIL This is the transfer media on which you print your image. It holds the toner extremely well, but does not leave any residues in the copier or any background on the garment. No more guessing where the transfer is applied! The transparent foil gives precise placement on your garment. Now you can place transfer onto your textile. The B-Paper LowTemp was developed specifically for the A-Foil. It is finely tuned to ensure optimal processing

<span>It comes with 5 sheets plus the special paper you need to put over the transfer when you iron it.  REMEMBER TO LEAVE THE PAPER ON WHILE IT COOLS!  My first one would have come out a lot better if I had remembered that instruction.<br/><br/>I purchased these to make iron-ons for a Halloween costume (on white and on dark green fabrics).  Since then, I've made 2 shirts for my younger brother as well (on yellow and medium green).  On all colors we used the transfer's white color as white in the design, and it looks white and opaque like it's supposed to, unless you iron it for too long (REALLY too long--I get nervous and iron too much.)  The one I did the fastest looks the best.  The clothes we decorated wash fine--we wash it normally then hang dry.</span>

<span>Worked GREAT! Color was originally a little light after printing, but once transferred onto the shirt the colors really popped and looked fantastic!  Love that you do not have to "flip" your image.  In response to some of the reviews that stated it was difficult (or impossible) to remove the backing, it really was very simple...just gently brush the edge from the paperside forward and it begins to peel away...then gently remove from there.  I used them for the inital project that I purchased them for, but they worked so great, I volunteered to make shirts for another event soon after...all were a huge hit.  Wash well with no fading or crinkling.  Will be purchasing more of this product!</span>

<span>They did exactly what they were supposed to, I made shirts for each of my daughters for Christmas, they've all been through the wash a few times now and let me tell you my teens NEVER wash according to label, temp or turn anything right side out, they just toss an armload in and call it good. and the shirts are still great. no peeling etc.<br/>I bought the ones specifically for dark fabrics and the shirts were grey, black and maroon. all came out great.<br/><br/>The only thing to warn about is to make SURE you print a test piece on paper before printing to this paper. One of mine came out far too dark and I had been rushed and didn't check it, just printed it, if the test is too dark (as in my case) you can't adjust it unless you start over with a new paper, and since there are only 5 in a pack that's not good. Make sure it's exactly what you want on regular paper before using this.</span>

<span>Set the iron to the highest setting, they said. Use both hands and your body weight to press the iron onto the paper, they said. Press firmly for 40-60 seconds, they said.<br/><br/>Don't believe the instructions. Start with normal ironing pressure, for 25 seconds, move the parchment paper to take a look and see how things are going, and go from there. And make sure the shirt is 100% cotton. My first transfer I used a 50% polyester shirt and blindly followed package directions and it basically scorched and melted the transfer onto the shirt, allowing the black shirt fabric to show through the transfer and muting all the colors. The second shirt I did was 100% cotton, I took it easier on the heat and pressure and time, and it came out perfectly. I also pre-washed the second black shirt in hot water with oxi-clean to get as much of the fabric dye out as possible, which may have helped. But I think it was mostly ironing technique and fabric type. I put another transfer on top of the first one on the polyester shirt and did less pressure and less ironing time and it turned out looking like the 100% cotton one. We shall see if the transfer stays on the shirt but for the event it's intended for, it will do the job.</span>

A bundle containing one pack of Commercial grade t-shirt transfer paper for black and dark color fabrics and a pack of additional Silicon Papers for T Shirt Transfer Iron or Heat Press by Photo Paper Direct ( PPD ). Create custom designs that can include text, images or the two combined. Transfer these designs onto a wide range of fabrics, textiles and clothing such as t-shirt, aprons, pillow cases, fabric labels, baby grows and others, limited only by your imagination. Application - Transfer customized design onto dark and black color fabrics. If using an iron, use a solid, heat resistant, flat surface when applying heat (Solid Table, Work Top, Floor or similar – Ironing board CANNOT BE USED). When the transfer is exposed to heat (from an iron or heatpress), the design is released onto the fabric of choice. You can peel the transfer when HOT or COLD. Peeling hot will result in a matt finish, while peeling cold (room temperature) will result in gloss finish. Compatibility - Printer and Ink - all Inkjet printers using every day normal inks. Heat Transfer - use a domestic iron (1400w or higher) OR heat press machine (for commercial use). Fabric - can include a wide range of garments such as, Cotton, Viscose, Polyester, Silk etc, as long as they do not melt from heat. In the Pack: Step-by-step printed transfer instructions including printer settings. Reusable silicon sheet which helps make the transfer incredibly durable + additional silicon sheets. No experience needed. The pack comes with full instructions.

FOREVER LASER DARK No-Cut Heat Transfer Paper This Self-Weeding 2-Paper-System from FOREVER gives amazing and consistent results:Transfer white and light colors onto black, dark, and light-colored garments, including cotton, polyester, and blends, as well as paper/carton and book covers, with an Oki 711 White Toner Printer and Forever Laser-Dark Paper. This media also works extremely well for transferring solid dark-color designs from an Oki 800 series CMYK printer.Benefits:Transparent print media for exact positioning Low processing temperature (150C-160C, 300F-320F)Extremely high wash fastness due to a special top-coating Higher white cover and stronger full-tone colors High processing tolerance, especially when separating A&B papers Suitable for OKI White Toner and CMYK Printers How it Works:The B sheet has a coating which adheres to toner on the A sheet. Because CMYWT printers produce white toner, the B Sheet now has something to adhere to for coverage of white and light-colored areas allowing them to be transferred.You just print on the transparent A-Foil, press it together with the dark opaque B-Paper LowTemp and separate both sheets from each other while hot. Now, you have white coverage on the image through the B-Paper LowTemp, which does not only increase the opacity of the transfer on dark garments, but also contributes to its washability. Both steps are done at the same temperature. The application tolerances are extremely high, reducing handling errors and allowing the user high flexibility. A - FOILThis is the transfer media on which you print your image. It holds the toner extremely well, but does not leave any residues in the copier or any background on the garment. No more guessing where the transfer is applied! The transparent foil gives precise placement on your garment. Now you can place transfer onto your textile. B-PAPERLowTempThe B-Paper LowTemp was developed specifically for the A-Foil. It is finely tuned to ensure optimal processing.
