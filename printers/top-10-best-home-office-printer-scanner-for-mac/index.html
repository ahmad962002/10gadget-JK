The only thing I don’t like is the small 212 cartridge as you run out ink real quick. They are very small compared to 273 I used in my old XP.</span>

<span>This is a replacement for the 9120, which I loved. This new 9520 provides good quality prints and the scanner is terrific. I wish the paper output tray opened automatically, like the 9120, but, hey, I guess we move on. I do like the Canon software suite and the wider paper formats.</span>

<span>Choosing a printer/scanner to go with my 2020 M1 Macbook Air was a lot harder than choosing a laptop, but after much research and procrastination I went with the Canon PIXMA TS9520 and so far I have not regretted that choice. My very old HP device was not able to connect to my current network (although it did at a previous residence) so as a back-up I wanted a machine that could be connected to the laptop via a cable. They don't include the cable, but I purchased one from Amazon. So far I have not needed it. From box to completion it was a little over an hour for a mechanically/technologically challenged grandma.<br/><br/>Connecting to my network was a breeze (it didn't even ask for the password!), the ink cartridges went in easily, and the only issue I had was that the paper cartridge looked nothing like the paper cartridges my HP printers have had and I couldn't find it! I finally went online and found a youtube video that walked me through the process. In less than 90 minutes after I opened the box I had printed a test page and scanned a document. The automatic document feeder was very easy to use as well. The only negative I can report (and the reason I gave it four stars instead of 5) is that apparently this printer does not print labels (except for labels on printable CDs). I wish it did, but I can get along without that function. If you need to print address labels or lots of file folder labels that would be a problem. I think the adhesive backing is the issue. The documents it has printed for me are clear -- no smudges. I don't print photos or do much color printing, so I am hoping that most of the time I'll just have to replace the PGBK cartridge rather than the color ones. That is much less expensive. You can check the ink levels either on the display panel or on your computer (in Settings on a Mac). But Canon won't highjack your printer the way HP's Instant Ink seems to. At least I hope not!</span>

<span>I've been an hP printer user for years, so this is my first Canon. I considered it an upgrade, since it was $300, twice the cost of th HP.  Perhaps it is.  But it's been a learning curve Im not happy about.  And ket me say that I've been around computers since dial-up and when 256meg was considered a lot of storage.  And i've done user-inerface developing.  Im only saying this in case you think i should just know better when you read the rest.<br/>First, the panel screen is not as user friencly or comprehensive as the HP's.  I spent hours, across several days, searching for how to get it the scan 2-sided documents.  Everythng that came up was about printing.  The manual had no reference to duplex scanning.  Turns out you need to dig your way thru a seperate utility to set that up. So far, i still dont have an option for it on my panel.<br/>Second, it keeps dropping the wifi connection to my PC.  Signal strength has always been fine for the  HP's, and great for the PC sitting immediately next to it., so I dont get it.  i need to shut everything down and restart to get reconnected.<br/>Im also not crazy about the design. The paper tray is so low down it pretty much lays and slides along, on the desk top.  Its awkward to get your fingers under it to pull it out. And the spce in front of it needs to be cleared entirely to add or check paper.<br/>It  has a flip up panel and display, which needs to be up in order for he printer to work.  Never saw anything about that in the start up instructions. That took a while to figure out as well.<br/>When you try to add a new device - printer, iPad, phone... etc to its network, it searches for a while then tells you to follow the instructions on the device. Which device does it think its adding?  It doesnt tell you what its found, or not.  Where is this instruction on the device?<br/>The document feeder is limited.  Once you exceed a certain thickness, which it will accept, the grab pressure starts taking multiple sheets and/or jamming.  Then you need to start all over.  I had to break my insurance policy into 3 parts and keep redoing it to get everything done.  So now i have 3 files instead of one.<br/>on the positive side,  print quality and speed is good.</span>

<span>I got this printer to replace our old one that would no longer pick up paper from the paper tray.<br/><br/>So far, it has printed flawlessly, though it does suffer from the same thing that all inkjet printers do, the SUPER EXPENSIVE ink dries out before it all gets used. In addition to this, it seems that HP likes to update the firmware periodically to prevent 3rd party and refilled cartridges from being used, locking you in to using HP cartridges. Even knowing this, I still would have purchased this printer.<br/><br/>The print quality is very good, having printed a few documents and some pictures. The print speed is very good for an inkjet printer.<br/><br/>It has good connectivity with WiFi and LAN built in, so it is easy to print over the network once it is set up.<br/><br/>All things considered, I am happy with this printer, but wish that HP would stop trying to lock people in to using their print cartridges.</span>

<span>I am not a happy adapter of new technology.  When my printer finally gave out, I searched for an unused model of the same kind, no longer manufactured, and used it.  It had actually been free as an Apple Store promotion when I bought my computer.<br/><br/>But the color function never worked, so I was limited to black-and-white.  It was somewhat compatible with my newer MacBook, but I found it easier to use the older one.  Finally, I realized I needed to move forward and purchased a new printer-- which was immediately returned because it was so complicated to install and never actually worked.  So, back to the old one for a long period, until I decided to be brave and attempt a new model again.<br/><br/>Researching online the best models for my computer, I found this one was rated highly.  My previous printer was an HP and, although the quality was never quite as good as my previous model (and I can't even remember the brand), it was good.  Most important to me, it can be used with a USB connection, as I have had terrible luck with wireless anything.<br/><br/>When it arrived it sat in the box for at least two weeks, as I avoided the presumed hassle plus endless waiting for tech support.<br/><br/>I was thrilled to find out that it was actually quite easy to set up and install.  The ink cartridges separate the three colors, which of course means you aren't paying the exorbitant cost to replace a triple cartridge when only one color is depleted.  But they install as my old HP cartridges had, so not a challenge.<br/><br/>The happiest aspect is that connecting the WiFi is as simple as entering the password for the modem.  I was absolutely thrilled to find it instantly functional.<br/><br/>In fact, I did not rate the tech support for this review as I had no reason to contact them<br/><br/>I have thus far only printed, and haven't attempted to use the assorted other functions, like faxing or scanning (I have a separate scanner which I have used for years and doubt that the smaller version included with the printer would meet my needs, though it could be fine for various documents).  The printing quality for scanned photos is so-so and a bit streaky, but I only have attempted this with garden variety copy paper as a trial for modifications before taking it to be professionally printed.</span>

<span>As usual, a great HP product. I upgraded (or downgraded depending on how you see it) from a Photosmart printer that has recently seen most of its apps be rendered unusable due to HP killing them off from that generation of printers. I was tired of the random quirks I was having with ePrint since they moved to a new service they call HP Connect. I'm also doing less photo printing and more document scanning.<br/><br/>First off: Yes, this printer can do automatic 2 sided scans! I was getting tired of trying to find if it did or not considering the material only points to automatic 2 sided printing and the ability to scan multiple documents to copy as 2 sided (2+ single sided to 1+ double sided). So I honestly bought it on a risk and also due to price when I bought it, $20 less than price shown on 1/18/17. When I installed it, I started messing around with settings and at the bottom of the page options for copying was 2 -&gt; 2 sided. It isn't mentioned anywhere, but that's the setting to take a 2 sided document and copy as a 2 sided document. There was also a 2 -&gt; 1 sided which allows you to undo the dual sided and copy each side as a single page. This will be a huge time saver with all the documents I plan on saving digitally.<br/><br/>Second: For the price, this is one of their faster models. Although color still lags behind after all these years, I feel it is still respectable at 11 ppm at best quality. The product page on HP claims it can be as high as 20 ppm or so if using draft. Considering the only color prints I'd use at best quality are photos, this is blazing fast to me. Black can get as high as upper 20's in draft. I have never seen a reason to print a document in best mode, so to have speeds of upper 20's black and roughly 20 color is more than adequate for most people. Also, draft mode ensures a longer life for your cartridges. Even during my heaviest printing times, I've had cartridges last me months using draft mode. And ever since getting the Photosmart as my first dual sided capable printer, I have bought paper in years! I admit though, I over bought paper a few years ago when Staples did buy 2 get 1 free on cases.<br/><br/>Third: I have always hated tri-color cartridges. Yellow is ALWAYS the first to go since black printing uses some yellow as well for whatever reason unless you set default document settings to gray-scale. Even when I would print photos way back when, the 3 colors never finished at the same time. A tri-color cartridge guarantees that you will have to buy a new one before using all the ink. Part of the reason I took so long to change printers was that HP seemed to have gone back in time to strictly tri-color. This printer though uses a single cartridge per color! Thank goodness. This is the 21st century, tri-color cartridges should be totally obsolete, or at the very least relegated to the cheapest of models.<br/><br/>Fourth: Wi-Fi connection appears very fast. There is a caveat though, this printer takes a while to start from a cold start. I sell often on eBay and print from the app. With the Photosmart, maybe due to the change in service, I used to have to wait a while before the printer processed what it was doing. With this one, as soon as the printer states it's online, it begins within seconds any print job received from either HP Connect or HP Direct (the mobile to printer connection that uses Bluetooth I believe). I have had consistent success with HP Direct since it takes out of the equation everything except my phone and the printer. HP Connect though I always had issues with. The eBay app seems to hate printer plug-ins, so I decided to try going the HP Connect route. This involves e-mailing the printer what you need to print. Well, I e-mailed a shipping label. I decided to sit down and wait the customary forever for it to print (based on Photosmart experiences). After hitting send and touching the chair to sit, the printer had already began the printing process. Since this printer was made after the switch to HP Connect, it went super fast! I can say I am completely impressed.<br/><br/>Fifth: Paper tray. Yeah I know how cares, it's a tray. But coming from a Photosmart, being able to put what looks like a third of a ream of paper into the tray is so nice. I always felt I was reloading paper too often on the Photosmart due to the small tray. I do miss the dedicated photo paper tray though.<br/><br/>That's all I could think of with my limited use of the printer thus far. The only negative is that I feel it takes too long to be ready from a cold start. I know it is partially my fault because I kill the surge protector to save as many pennies as I can. Florida Power and Light really loves shafting us with the power bills here in Miami. But I have restarted the printer without turning off the surge protector and it still took a bit longer than the Photosmart. But with 5 positives so far vs the Photosmart, whats a bit longer boot up time?</span>

<span>I have owned HP printers forever.  Our old HP all in one was still going after 12 years but the scanner bed had gotten dirty and I also decided it was time to upgrade because I needed double sided printing and also the ability to print wirelessly from my iPhone and iPad.  A nearby Office Depot was closing its doors and having a big blow out sale to get rid of all its inventory so I decided to go look at printers thinking I could get a screaming deal.  I talked to one of the sales associates about my needs and she said this was a very popular model that offered all the features I want and then some.  They had it marked down from $180 to about $153 on sale.  Before I bought it I do what I always do and checked Amazon and was shocked to find that the exact same printer in the exact same package was only $99 with Prime!  I bid farewell to Office Depot (no wonder they're closing) and went right home and ordered it!<br/><br/>I have to say, so far I REALLY LOVE this printer!  First of all, it was the easiest printer to set up EVER!!  I mean, I truly couldn't believe it!  I'm a gadget tech nerd (built my own PC) and was prepared to have to spend an hour getting it all unpacked, turned on, calibrated, set up on my network and also connected to my devices for wireless printing.  That's what I'm used to.  Set up of this printer BLEW MY MIND with how simple it was!  Literally, you take it out of the box and remove all foam and plastic etc., plug it into the wall, press power, insert the ink (SO simple) and follow the instructions on screen to align the cartridges.  Once it was aligned the touch screen informed me to go to hp.com/setup to download the drivers I would need.  My computer/network automatically detected the printer and knew just what drivers I needed.  Download and setup was a breeze!  You can use the provided disk instead but I didn't even remove it from the sleeve.  The one thing I would say about HP and their software is that they tend to over do it.  My recommendation is to select the option that enables you to choose which additional programs you want installed instead of letting HP do it for you.  I always get way more than I bargain for and end up uninstalling a lot of the "bloatware" programs that I don't use that just take up HD space like HP photo etc.  I use photoshop.  There is an option for just the basic drivers that you can select.  Your printer will work just fine with those and you won't get blogged down with unwanted software.  Either way works great though.  I tried both.  The driver setup took 5 minutes.  Then I got on my iPhone and downloaded the HP ePrint app which IMMEDIATELY recognized and connected to my printer all on its own!  You can use it to print from your photos, the web, email and the cloud.  AWESOME!!!  That was it!  In about 12 minutes from the box I was completely set up, connect and printing!<br/><br/>Here are some other things I love about this printer:<br/><br/>- Fastest setup of any printer ever (yes I know I already mentioned this but it deserves repeating).  No having to manually enter IP addresses or anything like that!<br/>- Design is very sleek and modern.  I love the all black with little color screen!  It's pretty sexy as printers go!<br/>- Small/slim profile.  For everything this printer does and how well/quickly it does it, it really is quite small!  WAY smaller than my old HP all in one!<br/>- Touch screen is really high quality!  I often get frustrated with touch screens at check out stands and elsewhere because they're not very sensitive to your finger or pressing down in one spot causing a neighboring button to be selected.  That is NOT the case with this touch screen.  I find that it's very sensitive and accurate and also the display is crisp and beautiful!<br/>- AUTOMATIC DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING AND SCANNING.  HALLELUJAH!<br/>- Printing is very fast and the print quality is excellent, even and especially with photos!<br/>- I LOVE that this printer only needs one cable (unless you want to use the fax feature as well) and works so well wirelessly!<br/>- Printing from the app on my mobile devices is my new favorite thing<br/>- Unlike my old printer, this guy is whisper quiet when it's printing.  It's a little thing, but I live with an autistic 4 year old and a husband who sounds like he's calling in air support for a military strike when he talks on the phone so...sometimes the little things make a big difference!<br/>- Scan quality is really fabulous!<br/><br/>Honestly, I rarely give 5 star reviews to things, but this printer really does deserve it, from price point to set up to functionality and features.  I HIGHLY recommend this printer for all your in home office needs!  And no, I didn't get it for free or at a discount.  I paid full price for it and I would do it again!  I hope this helps someone else who is looking for an office upgrade!<br/><br/>UPDATE 1/21/17 - After a couple weeks I started having issues with this printer going offline spontaneously and the only way I could seem to get it back online to was by restarting my computer.  Around that time we also bought a Roku 4 and started having trouble with streaming.  The signal was dropping all the time.  I finally realized that it was because of our router, which, while a great work horse for many years, was getting seriously old in "tech years" and needed to be replaced.  I bought a dual band Asus router and ever since I installed it we have not only had flawless streaming but the printer now stays "online" all the time!  If you're having this issue with it going offline, I would look at your network setup before you blame the printer itself.</span>

<span>I’ve had this printer for almost two months now and have had zero issues. If you follow the set-up guide you shouldn’t have any problems. The set up was quick and smooth. I used one of the promo codes I got from other reviewers and got an extra month of free insta ink. The codes do work!<br/>I got this printer for school related stuff and I’m so glad I did! BUY IT! You won’t regret it.<br/>My only gripe is the paper stock tray is outside of the machine and slanted off the back, so you can’t load a bunch of paper at once. Other than that I love this printer!</span>

<span>Pros: Easy set-up, connects to computers via WiFi, small and compact<br/><br/>Cons: Just try and print something, anything, and this printer will sit on it until it's darn good and ready to actually print.

<span>My old HP printer gave out and since I'd had such good service from the brand, I bought this as a replacement. I needed all-in-one capability, which this printer has--scanning, copying, printing- and I wanted wireless capability. For some reason, I felt like the instructions to set this up to get the wireless capability started were just not as clear as they could have been. I finally resorted to just common sense after some frustrating tries, and got it working, but frankly, I still don't know how I got there. No matter. Once it was connected wirelessly it worked perfectly. The print quality is great, it's responsive, and it does exactly what I need it to do. It's a simple printer for home use. Other than the annoying matter of the instructions, there's one other small detail that owners should be aware of: there's a small, pull-out extension to the finished print tray that's only about three inches wide and rotates out to extend maybe six inches or so. It's not the width of the fixed print tray. It looks like an option. It's not. Use it. If you don't, you're liable to find your print job has shot across the room all over the floor. Ask me how I know. First glance, the finished print tray appears to be long enough to keep the printed pages stacked in place, but it just isn't. Without that little extension rotated out, you're going to have to pick up your print job off the floor. OK, I know; it's an inexpensive printer. But another 50 cents worth of plastic to keep this from happening wouldn't have bankrupted Hewlett Packard.</span>

<span>I blessed my caring Healthcare Aide, as a gift, as she was searching for one. She wanted my printer, I was replacing, but, I got another "ink replacement," order, so it delayed my giving to her. But, I thought she deserved "better for her kindness," to I surprised her, and it arrived before her return, on time, undamaged, n sitting waiting for her! She was delighted! I told that the ink replacement n "HP Smart Link," on her phone is priceless, n she can do n manage her printer, anywhere! N they include "paper counts," n if you need they ship paper, if you need to you! I already have boxes of "bulk paper reams," caught a supply store going out of business. For me, I have been using another HP printer, n my replacement is another HP, I am actually adding a printer to my home network, I am a great fan of 4 in One printers. I noticed the shipped ink cartridges have more ink than the store bought ones. The ink usage is monitored, and informs you to replace or you are running low, n ink arrivals, on payment method. You will be pleased with your purchase, we both, were!!!</span>

<span>I followed the instructions for set-up. It guides you along, but if you are going to download the phone app, those instructions are even clearer.

Instead I googled Canon drivers and downloaded what I needed, and Ta-Dah! It worked fine. The picture shown here was printed from my phone. It allowed me to crop it and select the resolution. I selected the lowest. It came out great. So far, no problems except for stalling the instructions if you get off the app page (to do learn suggested add-ons); then I had to start over.

<span>UPDATE: I'm not calling a divorce lawyer, but am on the verge of packing a bag and going home to mother. Trying to Reader's Digest this as much as possible, the printer stopped talking to the PC. Every print job gave an error message and got stuck in the queue, I uninstalled and reinstalled constantly, posted on the user "help" forum,  ignored, then I found that instead of the printer icon, or the FAX version, that had downloaded, Microsoft IPP Class Driver (?) kept going to default so I tried printing with that, and it worked with Word and Adobe, but nothing else. No photos, no email. I tried the forum again and got such a condescending, idiotic response from a "moderator" -- you know the kind that never held any position of any authority at any time in life, and now has a picture of Putin hanging in their bedroom? No help there. I haven't called support yet because it's all just been too much in general these days, but it's still a neat little printer, when it wants to be bothered.<br/><br/>*************<br/><br/>I bought this printer with the sword of Damocles swinging above my head; my Epson printer reached its print limit, yep, you read that right, and could only be reused if I got it to Epson so they could change the pads in the ink waste tank (neither one of us is on anything, you're reading that right, and I'm telling it straight) and reset the print capacity, and for a cost higher than I paid for the foul thing - keep in mind, this is happening all in the middle of my business I actually took it apart and replaced the pads successfully with a kit from ebay, but the code to reset the counter was buggy as a picnic, so...in a panic, I bought an HP, and it was OK for a couple of weeks, until I had to use the scan function; FAX would have worked as well. If it worked. None of that downloaded with the regular printer software, and if you ever saw the circus of downloads that didn't work, no support, conflicting instructions...bless Amazon, they took it back and sent me this.<br/><br/>In the time it took me to use the "F" word in several languages while trying to get the HP to work, this little beauty downloaded everything perfectly, scanned beautifully and allowed me to finish up all my unfinished business. The touchscreen is clear and a good size, the text sharp, what an absolute relief. Of course, as with many honeymoons, this may go sour, and I'll let you know if it does, here, I'm not going to make a Tik Tok or ask strangers for their opinion on Reddit or anything...But so far, this is acting like a little gem.</span>

<span>I haven't had this printer for too long, but so far, it works pretty good. I have suffered at the hands of cheap inkjet printers from HP for years and was sick and tired of paying ridiculous prices for the stupid tiny ink cartridges that were prone to dry out and quit working if you didn't use them for months. This is my first laser printer, and I am pretty happy with it. I see a lot of people complain about toner issues and connectivity problems with these printers, and after my experience with this one, I can see how a lot of people might have a problem setting this up if they are not very tech savvy. Luckily, I am a computer wiz, so I was able to overcome most of the technical roadblocks in a timely manner. Below is quick run-down for some of the issues people might have with this type of printer and how to overcome them.<br/><br/>The first issue someone might have right off the bat is getting it to connect to their network. The DHCP needs to be enabled and have enough addresses available to accommodate another device. Most are set up this way, but not all routers people have for their home networks are created equal, and some come set up from the factory with settings that may limit the ability for peripherals, like printers, to connect to them properly. This is especially true with equipment that is purchased used. Some people, like me :), have their router locked down so tight, that nothing can connect to it unless they want it to.<br/><br/>There is a setting in most routers with regard to either "Set AP Isolated" or "WLAN Partition" or some other jargon, but they all serve the same purpose. That is to disable network equipment connected to the router from being able to talk to each other. This is great if you want added security on your network, but If these settings are enabled on your router, then you will never be able to print to this printer from any device connected to your network unless you are connected directly by a cable from the computer to the printer. It's  a give and a take. You give up added security, but hey, at least now your can print, right?<br/><br/>The next mistake most people are going to make it to try to install the printer directly from Windows from the "Printers &amp; Scanners" or from the device manager. Windows has default drivers that work with the printer and will find and install it, but you are shooting yourself in the foot right from the get-go when you do this. The reason being is that you will never be able to get to the settings and preferences that fully manage this printer, and you will not be able to find the setting that allows you to bypass the setting that makes the printer stop printing when the toner gets low. Many reviews on here complain about the toner-stop-printing issue, so this is how you fix it....Go to the Brother website and download the latest drivers for your printer and install all of the software on your computer. DO NOT use the CD that comes with the printer. It could have been sitting in a warehouse for 6 months or a year for all you know, and the drivers are probably not up to snuff. When the software installation reaches the point where you have to opportunity to update all of the software and firmware from the printer, do it. Do not skip that portion of the installation process. There is a sticker on the back of your printer with the "password" that it will ask for when you choose to remotely configure it, and within those settings, you have the wonderful option of setting the "Toner-Low" setting to "Continue" instead of "Stop". That way, you will never have to use those tricks or sequences to bypass when the printer stops printing when you still have oodles of toner left in the cartridge. Another issue that this solves is the fact that, without the software installed, you would never be able to scan documents from the scanner portion of your all-in-one printer and send them to your computer. You would be stuck with only basic print capability.<br/><br/>I highly recommended that people also go through their settings for the printer directly at the printer itself and disable the "Auto Power Off" function altogether on the printer. It does not gobble up a million volts of electricity all the time when it's not being used. The reason I suggest this is because it will disconnect from the network and become "unavailable" for printing until you drag you carcass over to the printer and turn it back on. With the function disabled, it is always connected to your network 24-7 and will wake itself up from "sleep' and start printing a lot faster then if you had to go and turn it on every time when you haven't used it in awhile. I will update this review after a few months or add more info if I find any issues that I had to overcome.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this  is a nice little device that can print, fax, scan and copy for a pretty good price. So far, I am really enjoying the benefits of a laser printer over the junky inkjets that I have been using for so long. If you are like me and only print some stuff every now and then and are fed up with clunky inkjets, then you can't go wrong with a laser printer like this one.</span>

<span>I was in need of a printer that could scan, print quickly, not cost a fortune to replace, and was small.<br/><br/>The Brother monochrome printer is the exact product I was looking for.<br/><br/>I was like most of you. I was reading reviews on different printers deciding which would be the best fit for me. I looked at Canon, Epson, Brother, and each printer had their own pros and cons. Some could print beautiful photos but not scan images. Some could scan images and print photos, but the ink was super expensive. Others could do it all but the size of the machine was huge and the price exorbitant.<br/><br/>Basically, choosing a printer was harder than setting up the one I ordered. When selecting a printer it is important to research how much this machine will cost you in the long run. If you don't mind spending 60 dollars on ink and refilling it every 400 prints, that's on you.<br/><br/>But me? I hate spending money on ink. I hate having to refill all the time when I haven't printed that much. I also hated that the ink dries out if you don't use it often enough. Therefore, I realized I needed a LaserJet printer. Toner was the answer I was looking for. But when you get a LaserJet printer, the cost goes up and you tend to lose the ability to print in color.<br/><br/>Did I need to print in color? No. Most of the time I'm printing out tickets, labels, documents, and postage labels. I didn't need color. So a color LaserJet was out.<br/><br/>Short story long, this brother printer was the solution I was looking for. So what are the pros and cons?<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Prints quickly.<br/>- Can print significantly more pages than an inkjet without needing a refill.<br/>- Scans at a great quality.<br/>- Easy to setup for WiFi printing.<br/>- Small size, easy to place on top of a shelf or countertop. (Check measurements first!!! It is not the smallest printer but it is small)<br/>- Can fax if I ever decided to get a landline again.<br/>- Has the option to automatically order toner when your supplies run low. Hi yield can do a thousand plus pages without needing replacement.<br/>- LCD display is responsive and easy to use.<br/>- Has prompts to guide you when printing address labels. E.G. Open the manual feed tray and the rear tray. Place labels in the tray.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Cannot print in color.<br/>- Does not print graphics well. It's serviceable but definitely not intended for photos.<br/>- The scanner software used to scan in your documents is extremely barebones. Canon has a much better utility that sorts your scans into folders by date. Brother does not. You have to manually create folders with dates in them.<br/>- If you don't plug the printer into the USB, setting up the WiFi becomes harder. You have to manually select your network on the printer LCD display and enter the password using the arrow keys. It's time consuming and annoying. Could go significantly faster if you plug in the USB.<br/>- In order for users to use the scan feature, they need to install the brother software the comes on a CD onto their computer. Annoying and inconvenient.<br/><br/>So if you need a printer that can do all your basic office tasks in black and white, I think the Brother monochrome printer would give you the best bang for your buck. This is definitely the type of printer that would be useful for someone who prints a lot of documents, scans sensitive information like ID's or social security cards, and prints postage or mailing labels.<br/><br/>If the utility that came with it had been more robust like Canon's, I would have given this printer a 5. But because it doesn't, 4 it is.</span>

<span>I'm (re)writing this review in the hope that it may help some of the folks out there who have struggled with the "Printer is offline" error message in Windows without much success. One post I ran across in an online support group said he had tried three different 7740 units and all gave the same error message and that HP tech support was useless. I'm sure that's probably true. I struggled with the same issue after a new wireless installation and it came close to driving me nuts. I seriously thought about sending the printer back, but the fact that the online poster had tried three different units gave me pause. The likelihood of three identical machines all being hardware defective in the same exact way is pretty darn small.<br/><br/>If you're lucky, the problem may be as simple as unchecking the "Use printer offline" box. Go to "Control Panel," "Devices and Printers," right click the HP 7740, click "See what's printing," then click "Printers" at the top of the next window and uncheck "Use Printer Offline." But if you're unlucky, like I was, "Use Printer Offline" won't be checked anyway. Don't panic. While I offer no guarantees that what I've written below will help and take no responsibility for any damage you may do to your setup trying to follow my advice, it may again be helpful for some people's situations, even for folks with a different printer.<br/><br/>Let’s think about what “Printer Offline” really means.  As many have said it doesn’t mean the printer is “off” or won’t print a test page from the control screen.  What it means is that Windows can’t find it.<br/><br/>There are at least two possible reasons for this.  One is that you have a driver conflict with a different printer.  You may not even think you have another printer installed, but because of how Windows operates you may.<br/><br/>Another cause may be that Windows can’t find your printer where it thinks it should be because of how your router is assigning your printer’s wireless (IP) address.  I suspect this is an even more common problem but has a fairly straightforward though involved solution.<br/><br/>The LEAST likely cause is a hardware defect.  As the example above shows, the likelihood that three identical units are all defective in the same way is practically nil.  It is almost always a problem with Windows “finding” the printer, that is to say, software communication issues, not with the printer itself.<br/><br/>OK – apologies for the length of this in advance.<br/><br/>In the case of a driver conflict – which I had, unbeknownst to me – I found the conflict when I right clicked on "Printer Properties" in "Devices and Printers (in Control Panel)," and then clicked the "Ports" tab.  There to my surprise was an HP driver installed for the HP Envy, even though I'd never had the Envy connected to this computer. (It was left over from cloning the boot drive from another OS.) The 7740 was listed as the default printer, but the Envy driver had the TCP/IP port and was “online.”  The Envy seemed to be confusing the OS into thinking that the Envy should be online and the 7740 shouldn't be.<br/><br/>The immediate solution there was to delete ALL the printer drivers (including the 7740) from the machine. (You can't delete MS XPS or Adobe PDF but that's OK.) You can try just deleting every printer listed in "Devices and Printers" by right clicking them and choosing "Remove Device," but you may need to use an uninstall program or go into the Windows Registry - which is NOT for novices.  (Basically DON'T if you don't know exactly what you're doing and aren't prepared to reinstall your whole OS. Fair warning!) Deleting drivers isn't always easy, but again, the error message is probably not caused by a problem with the 7740 hardware itself.  As other sites describe, I then manually reset the 7740 unit by unplugging it while it was still powered on, waiting 60 seconds, and plugging it in again. It powered on automatically.<br/><br/>Once I did that, I reinstalled the 7740 drivers MANUALLY in "Devices and Printers" using the "Add Printer" button. (It's usually the best way to do a wireless printer install anyway.) The OS found the 7740 using the TCP/IP port (the TCP/IP connection - always best), and it all worked fine – for a time.<br/><br/>That’s when I discovered the second likely cause for the “Printer Offline” error message.  Even though I no longer had driver conflicts, Windows still often lost track of the wireless address (the IP address) of the 7740.  Why would Windows do that?  Let me explain.<br/><br/>Modern routers assign IP addresses to any device that connects to your wireless network automatically by a protocol called DCHP.  Before DCHP, routers assigned addresses the way you get a social security number: each person gets her own unique number and no one else has it.  Good enough.  But because there can be so many devices connected to a home network, and also because as devices turn off and on they disconnect from and then reconnect to the network, DCHP will REUSE addresses from a disconnected device for a NEW device that connects (or an old device that reconnects), even if a device that reconnects had a different address before.  Or it may get an entirely new address.  Whatever.  This means that when your printer “goes to sleep” to save energy and thus disconnects from the network, when you go to wake it up to print something later, the DCHP router will give it a DIFFERENT IP address from the one it first had, but Windows, bless it, will still try to find the printer at its old IP address.  And if it can’t, which it often can’t, Windows will conclude that your printer is “offline” and refuse your new print job.  It’s the equivalent of the Post Office “Moved. No Forwarding Address.”  (DCHP is fine for most devices but for whatever reason doesn’t play well with many printers.)<br/><br/>Again, this isn’t the printer’s fault, though it is to some degree the manufacturer’s fault, since they don’t tell you how hard it can be to make a solid wifi connection for a printer to a network.  “Just put your install CD in your CD drive and…”  Yeah no.<br/><br/>So how to fix?  Well it can be intense but it’s been working for me for several days now, fingers crossed.<br/><br/>First, go to your router’s admin program.  It will have an address like 192.168.0.1  (Read the router manual.)  Type the address into your browser (the periods are important).  You’ll need the userid and password for the router, something like “admin” “admin1” depending on model.  Check the manual.<br/><br/>Go into your router IP address settings – maybe on a tab like "LAN settings" (manual will show).  This tab will show the router’s starting IP address setting – the numerically lowest address the router will assign to a device – and the highest IP address setting – the highest numerical address a router will assign.  These will typically be something like 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.255.  See photo.<br/><br/>Change the last three digits for the highest setting to any lower number – for simplicity’s sake say 250.<br/><br/>Apply the change.  Leave the router admin window open for now.<br/><br/>Go to your printer’s settings screen on the 7740 and locate the printer IP address, again something like 192.168.0.xxx.  Type that into a new window in your browser too.<br/><br/>You’ll then get the 7740 internal settings screen in your browser window.  Go to Networking, Wireless, and IPv4 addresses.  Deselect “Automatic IP” or “DCHP” and select “Manual IP.”  In the actual address space type in the first three segments of the numerical sequence you typed above, and then “251 (or 252 or 3 or 4)” for the last segment.  See photo.  Hit Apply/Save.  Also, on the “Network” tab choose “Network Protocols.”  “Check IPV4 Only” and “Apply.”<br/><br/>Ok.  A few more steps.  Go back to your router window to the LAN settings page.  If you’re lucky, your router will have a setting that lets you MANUALLY assign an IP address to a device.  See photo.  (Can’t help you here if you’re not.)  Get your MAC address for your printer from the printer settings “General Summary” page.  See photo.  Type that address into the “New Device” or whatever space on your router manual assignment page. The IP address should come up automatically.  See photo.  Exit your router setup.<br/><br/>Go back to your 7740 settings.  Go to “Network” “Advanced Settings” “Microsoft Web Services.”  Uncheck everything.  See photo.<br/><br/>Go back to HP 7740 in “Devices and Printers” and delete it by right clicking “Remove device.”<br/><br/>Next go to “Add Printer” on the “Devices and Printer” page on the upper bar, and choose “Add network printer.”  The wizard will search and should find the 7740 at the IP address you just assigned it, 192.168.0.251 or you can enter it manually.  (Remember, use the first three segments that your printer settings panel says, not this example.)<br/><br/>Go with “Use the current driver” or you may need to select the manufacturer and then the specific printer.  No worries.<br/><br/>When you get to “Print Test Page,” click it.  Your page should print, your printer now has a PERMANENT IP address so Windows should never lose track of it again and thus should never say it is “Offline.”<br/><br/>The reason this is so involved is why printer manufacturers don’t want to tell you to do all this to install a wifi printer.  And in many cases they don’t need to.  But in other cases they do.<br/><br/>This is also called “setting a static IP address.”  There are simpler procedures on the web but they didn’t work for me.  “Howtogeek.com” and “linerarthoughts.co.uk” are the main sources if you run into difficulties.  Again, when so many people are having the same problem it usually isn’t the hardware.  Hope this helps.  Please comment if you find mistakes.  Best of luck!</span>

<span>My HP printer died so I needed a new one.  I don't use my printer every day so I didn't need a lot of bells and whistles or super great printing, I just needed to copy, print, or scan to emails occasionally.  I was originally looking at HP since that is what I've always purchased but I am really turned off by needing to install an app to set up, change print quality, scan, whatever, and all new printers seem to require this.  My HP could do everything from the display and I wanted that ability again.  After reading many reviews I purchased this Brother printer.  I don't need the fax but was happy that an app, although available, was not necessary to set up or use this printer.  I am a techno-boob and was able to set it up, connect it to my Chromebook wirelessly and quickly,  connected my desktop computer by cable (not included, I had one for the HP printer available), and was able to scan a document and send it to email all from the printer in about 20 minutes.  Take heed of a previous reviewer and make note of the PIN number on the back, it will be necessary for updates.  Connecting the computer cable to the USB port under the scanning bed is a little awkward in appearance (should be able to connect at the back of the machine in my opinion) but easy enough to do.  This prints super fast and the ink cartridges are easy to insert into the front of the printer.  I haven't needed to buy new ink cartridges yet but they are much cheaper than the HP ink.  It stays connected wirelessly, unlike my previous HP which I often had to reconnect before being able to print from my Chromebook.  All in all, so far, I am very pleased with this printer, its features, and its function at a very reasonable price.</span>

<span>I love this printer. I recently replaced another brand of printer and I was a little worried because I’d never used this brand before. After reading good reviews about it, I decided to purchase. I’m so glad I did…I love it!  It was easy to set up. I was a little nervous about it, but I just followed the provided instructions and everything worked perfectly. I use it wirelessly and that worked great; connected immediately. I’ve also printed to it from my iPhone. The print quality is excellent. It’s super fast - printing, copying and scanning. I’ve used the one sheet copy and scan on the glass, and also used the multiple-page paper feeder on top. It saved me so much time from my previous printer. The printer utilities app that installed on my computer is straightforward and easy to use. It also has a fax machine but I’ve not used that as I haven’t had a need. I’ve used the print on both sides feature and that works fine. I also needed a printer that would both load paper and print to the front and this does that. I have this printer stored on a small rolling cart underneath my small desk in a kitchen nook where I do most of my work. I couldn’t be happier with it.</span>
