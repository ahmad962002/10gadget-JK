Dremel, your go-to brand for all your 3D printing tools, 3D filament, printers, and accessories, proudly presents our flagship 3rd generation 3D printer. The Dremel DigiLab 3D45-01 offers superior quality and ease of use to anyone from the 3D printing novice to the professional 3D printer, boasting highly advanced printing capabilities with easy-to-use features that make it an accessible 3D printer for beginners. The printer has an RFID reader built-in to detect the 1.75mm Dremel filament that you place inside and automatically choose the best print settings for that filament, you can easily connect the printer to Wifi and use the included remote printing software to send prints from wherever you are, and you can also use the software to monitor your prints using the built in HD camera. The fully enclosed 3D printer helps reduce the chance for warping and keeps curious hands out of the printing area, and it also makes the printer very quiet. It also helps the printer achieve a very high quality with 50 micron layer height. You can pause a print and change filament to print in multiple colors, too! You can print using the included cloud software, the included Dremel Digilab 3D Slicer for Windows or Mac, or your favorite 3D software that supports . gcode, . g or . g3drem files such as Cura, Simplify3D, Craftware, KISSlicer, Slic3r or Repetier, and the large 3D printer features a 6" x 10" x 6.7" (402 cu in) build volume. The Dremel Slicer can be used to print multiple objects at a time, add supports, change layer height, change infill and even access advanced settings for the best prints.

<div class="slideshow-container">
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>I’ve never used a 3D printer before, so this is my first, which is important because I’m a newbie.<br/>This review has four parts: unboxing, quick setup, printing, and result.<br/>1. Unboxing<br/>Neat packaging, easy to unpack, but I wonder: what is the separate plastic-surrounded glass plate for? (I found out in the next step, despite the quick setup instructions which omit it)<br/>2. Quick setup<br/>I immediately connected it to a wired ethernet connection, and then turned it on for the first time. It put me through a wizard to connect to one of the many wireless networks around, but this was completely unnecessary as I suspected. I finally saw an indication on the small touch screen that suggested that it was connected to the internet (despite not being connected to wifi), and it was.<br/>The firmware update was smooth.<br/>The quick-start guide does not mention the build platform (the glass plate mentioned above), but then shows it in a picture so I guessed that I was intended to install it. I did place it on the platform with the DREMEL label on it before starting a test print, and IMO that’s an important step; I guessed correctly and a good thing too.<br/>I used the black ECO-ABS filament that shipped with the printer. Threading the filament was more complicated than the quick-start guide let on. I had to go back and do it again because I thought I was following instructions, but I hadn’t threaded the filament enough. I wish the quick-start diagram showed clearly that the filament has to be manually threaded through the white plastic tube, and then over to the print head assembly, through the black plastic slot and then down into the shiny metal hole until it stopped.<br/>It was unexpectedly challenging to thread the filament and place the filament spool so that I was confident the thread stayed inside the spool boundaries before being drawn into the white/translucent plastic tube; this is probably important, so it doesn’t get hung up on the outside the spool.<br/>Connecting to the printer from the printcloud.dremel.com site is relatively easy and an important step.<br/>But, how do I enable the in-printer camera?<br/>3. Printing<br/>The Dremel 3D45 is about as noisy as the year-old 2D paper printer I have, right next to the 3D45 in my study. It smells a tiny bit, but there is a small muffin fan running constantly to push air out of the printing area and through a filter.<br/>I first tried Dremel_Test_Print from the printcloud.dremel.com site (a cartoon frog I think) but it failed the test print because of two mistakes that I made for which I blame the Quick Start guide: first, I didn’t use glue, because the Quick Start guide doesn’t mention that until too late (see above) and second, I hadn’t clicked in the build plate correctly, because the guide does not mention the build plate AT ALL until near the end when it describes build complete.<br/>Second attempt was a test print “the builder” from the printer menu. From the printcloud.dremel.com site, during this print I went to PRINTERS tab and clicked the DETAILS button for the job to open the “DREMEL STREAMING” page for my 3D printer, and it showed these log statements which were emitted at different times during the print:<br/>[15:49 04.16.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from offline to idle<br/>[16:20 04.16.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from idle to heating<br/>[16:24 04.16.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from heating to printing<br/>[20:57 04.16.2020 PDT] Printing progress: 10%<br/>…<br/>[13:32 04.17.2020 PDT] Printing progress: 100%<br/>[13:33 04.17.2020 PDT] Printer status changed: from printing to idle<br/>[13:33 04.17.2020 PDT] Object printed successfully in 23:20:59<br/><br/>Note the 4 minutes heating (for heating the build platform, and heating the extruder tip), plus the total printing time which was more than 23 hours.<br/>It was challenging to remove the print from the build plate without damaging it, but the tool included with the printer eventually worked. A sharper and wider scraper might help.<br/>But, it was worth it…<br/>4. Result<br/>There were just a few stray bits of the black ECO-ABS sticking out in odd places, and it could stand a bit of smoothing, but otherwise it seems very paintable!<br/>Beautiful! My kids love this so one of the things we are working on for school-at-home is learning how to modify and create new objects.<br/>My brother sang for the MIT Chorallaries, so of course I thought of The Engineers’ Song.<br/>This is a great 3D printer, I recommend it!</span>

<span>They're not kidding when they say you can have this thing printing within 10-15 minutes of unboxing it. Once you have it unboxed, all you need to do is plug it in, follow the steps to level the bed, connect wifi, etc. Then, load your first filament and run over to your slicer program and hit print! I can't say enough good things about this printer, but here's the bullet points:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The RFID system is amazing. It makes it so easy to quickly swap filament types. I'm constantly bouncing between PLA, PETG and ECO-ABS and all I have to do is click change filament, snip the old filament line and feed in the new filament. Once fed it detects the RFID chip on your roll and configures all the temps for you. Very, very, little effort. Half the time you don't even have to consider what type of filament you stuck in, it'll "just work".<br/>- When you run out of filament, rather than failing, it automatically pauses and waits for you to add more. So if you run out of filament in an overnight print, no big deal. Just swap out the roll when you wake up.<br/>- I've printed several flawless PETG prints, amazing because PETG is usually very difficult to work with. But with this printer, it's no different than PLA. I have not tried Nylon yet, but I'm guessing it'll be the same experience.<br/>- You really can set it up in 10-15 minutes.<br/>- Bed leveling is so easy it's almost cheating. You just hit the bed level button and wait, if pokes around the bed looking for unleveled surfaces then tells you exactly what knobs to turn and prompts you when you've turned them far enough. A 5 year old could relevel the print bed on this in about 1-2 minutes.<br/>- There's no smell at all (unless you open the door obviously), no matter what material I print with. The filter on this is amazing. I print only 3 feet from my desk (and in fact, it's printing right now behind me) and there's no odor of any kind what so ever.<br/>- It's very quiet, but not completely silent. I can whisper to my wife on the other side of the room while its running and she can hear me just fine. You know it's running but its not disruptive what so ever.<br/>- Love the internal bright lights. Makes it really easy to see your print.<br/>- This is the only printer I've used with a heated bed, so I can't say much for how good it actually is. But it seems really good. I've never had issues with it, and the only time I've ever had build adhesion issues is when I missed a spot applying glue (and even then, sometimes its fine anyway). I've also only experienced warping once out of about 50-60 prints thus far, and it may have been my own fault.<br/>- Literally every print fail I've had was my fault.<br/>- It can do some amazing bridging, I'm shocked what this thing can print without supports. I accidentally printed a model with a *4 inch long* straight overhang in ECO-ABS, and *somehow* it magically printed with no issue.<br/>- Touchscreen is very nice and easy to use.<br/>- and of course, the print quality is exactly what you would expect from a nearly $2,000 printer.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Awkward spool size, if you buy third party filament you may need to print yourself a Dremel-sized spool to put the filament on (There's one on thingiverse), or just keep an old Dremel roll around to respool your third party filament to, just remember to rip off the RFID tag.<br/>- Official Dremel filaments are very high quality but does cost more. It can cost anywhere from $20-$35/roll, and the rolls are only 0.75kg. Although you can use third party filament anyway, you just lose the benefits of the RFID system.<br/>- I had one bug, I believe a firmware glitch, that misreported the Z level of the bed, causing the bed to smack into the extruder when printing. It was an easy fix, simply just rebooted the printer.<br/>- The "Dremel" brand slicer program is based on an older version of Cura (1.2.3). But it still works like a champ, and I've really not had any issues with it. It also has a ton of 3D45-specific profiles already setup to use.<br/>- Sort of a pro and a con; The printer stubbornly will refuse to print if you have the door open. So make sure you always keep it closed. Up side, you don't want the door open when you print anyway, Down side is you may know it's open and you're just wanting to initiate the print while you're cleaning up your workspace or something, and the printer may be in another room. But you *can* open the door after printing has started.<br/>- The camera is nice to have, but admittedly, it's fairly low quality. It's a 720p camera, but the framerate is super low (guessing about 10 FPS). It's perfect for checking your prints, but don't expect to use it to make really cool high-resolution time lapses for Youtube.<br/><br/>There's a reason this printer costs nearly $2,000. If you're more interested in printing things than tinkering with the printer, this is the printer for you.</span>

<span>I have owned a Dremel 3D45 since the first week in October, 2020. Since that time I have built 40-50 parts. These are usually quite simple. Some I have experimented with building in different orientations to see how that affected the build quality, particularly in terms of filament support.<br/><br/>I was new to 3D printing. In examining printers to buy, I wanted something that 1) got good reviews, 2) had good product support, 3) could print with different materials, and 4) was enclosed to reduce noise. So although I could have purchased a decent 3D printer for $500, I opted for the $1900 3D45 because it met the above criteria. I thought over the long term, it would pay for itself.<br/><br/>However, I have had a LOT of trouble with the nozzle clogging when printing with Dremel PLA for parts that needed some filament support. I show an example in the photo. The part is a simple wheel with a short axle at the back center. You can see a bunch of horizontal defects, where the nozzle was starting to clog, but the build ended with the wheel only partially finished when the nozzle totally clogged. In a half dozen tries, I was not able to successfully build this part. I could build it with PETG, but not with Dremel PLA.<br/><br/>Dremel did give me good product support, and suggested using different temperatures for the nozzle and the build plate. This did not solve the problem. Eventually they sent me a new spool of PLA, and I was able to build the entire wheel but not without some defects. I note that I was able to build the sample parts (with my Dremel PLA) included with the printer, such as the frog, but these parts did not require filament support, which seemed to be related to the problem.<br/><br/>I have had no problem building with Dremel PETG, and since that is the material I intend to primarily use, I have been happy with that. The second photo shows a failed build with Dremel PLA on the left, a mostly successful build with new Dremel PLA in the middle (green) and a successful build with PETG on the right. Certainly I expected to be able to build with PLA with a $1900 printer.<br/><br/>Now, other things. The documentation is a curious blend of clarity and obscurity. For example, the user's manual says, "Dremel3D cloud based software can be accessed on www.digilab.dremel.com." As far as I can tell, that is not the case. You can find the manual and FAQ, etc., there, but to access the cloud software, you have to go to printcloud.dremel.com. This, by the way, appears to be a website run by Bosch, who appears to actually be the manufacturer of the printer. To register the printer you must enter a "token," not the serial number. You get a token through the touch screen. This is buried a couple of levels deep in the touch screen, and on my screen says "Clouds" but in the user's manual says "Tokens." I have had to enter tokens now several times to keep the cloud stuff working.<br/><br/>I had to search on-line to find documentation about unclogging the nozzle--that is not included in the user's manual. Eventually I found a five page document, written by Dremel, on this. I will say this a little scary the first time you do it, as it involves using a pair of pliers to yank out the filament from a precision, $1900 machine.  At some point I was pleased to find a short YouTube video, made by Dremel, that shows this. However (and at this point I had carefully unclogged the nozzle several times), I was very surprised the video doesn't show the user pressing the filament release lever--an important action. It actually has a sign that comes up and says something to the effect, "Make sure you press the release lever but we are not showing that." What?? They can't show the proper steps in their own video?<br/><br/>Another important action you can do through the interface is nozzle gap calibration. Nothing about this is explained in the user's manual. Again, you have to hunt this down on-line to understand what it means and what the user is supposed to do.<br/><br/>So to summarize, 1) I've had a lot of trouble with the nozzle clogging printing with Dremel PLA, 2) the documentation is incomplete or confusing in spots, and 3) I've had good success with PETG. For $1900, it should be better than this.</span>

<span>Im new to 3d printing but not new to CAD and CAM software and CNC equipment/machines so for me it was a huge leap into the unknown.  I wanted something that could start working right out of the box and didn’t require a whole lot of fooling with setups and balancing or whatever the cheaper erector set looking printers require.  and Dremel 3D45 delivered!<br/><br/>Anyone who takes the time to read the instructions can successfully use this printer without any previous 3d printing experience.  The machine makes it easy to load and change filament and level out the print bed.  The removable print bed or tray is easy to take and will usually go back the exact same way so you dont need to level each time but it is advisable to check if youre working on something important or long print time.<br/><br/>The bad....  The front loading USB drive port was damaged right out of the box.  The metal housing that goes around it was bent in slightly and i couldnt get a usb drive in it not even the one it came with.  I bent it out to the right shape and its fine now but sort of poor quality control.  I have yet to get the Printer style USB port on the back side to work with the supplied cord or any I had laying around.  Two different computers hooked up to exactly like the directions say and neither will recognize the printer or vice versa.<br/><br/>the network connection does work great!  I can send files to the printer from my laptop or through Dremels cloud printing site which is kinda neat.  The thing I dont like is that the printer wont save the files sent to it over wifi or the cloud printing site.  Once its done with the job or you manually stop it the file is gone and it must be resent.  This is kinda of annoying but not a huge deal.<br/><br/>The next thing that is annoying to me is there’s no good pause or freeze button while the machine is printing.  There is a pause and if you press it while running the printer will finish the line it’s on, lower the print bed all the way, and then move the print head to the back corner, then turn off the heat to the head and bed.  Some times when starting a print you might get a little ooze from the nozzle and depending on your part and if there’s a skirt or brim around it you might need to reach in and grab that bit of ooze before it messes up the start of things.  I want a pause feature that just slightly retracts the bed and leaves the print head where it’s at and the heat on.  Again not a deal breaker but annoying.<br/><br/>Print quality is great and the predetermined settings help a lot for novices like me.  Dont buy any Dremel PLA or experimental PLA.  I read other reviews on how bad the regular PLA is so I wanted to try Dremels new PLA in purple for my wife and daughter.  Its terrible as well.  It will print great for a little bit the completely clog up the nozzle no matter how hot or cold I run it or what settings are used.  This was fresh right out of the vacuum sealed bag.  The ABS, Nylon, and PETG print great!  Never had a clogging issue or anything out of them.  My printer came with ABS and PETG so maybe Dremel knows how crap there PLA is.<br/><br/>Anyway,  it’s a good printer and even though it has some annoying things I dont like I’d probably buy again.</span>

<span>I ordered this for my son after he went to a 3D printing camp and wanted to make more things at home. There's no user manual in the box so after some failed attempts to get anything to print we found one online. There's a specific splicing software needed which we downloaded and played around with but were able to figure out and then got the printer to work. Loading/changing filament is easy. The touch screen makes the menu easy to navigate. Things worked great for a while but after some time the builds would break free from the baseplate during printing and get all messed up. We tried several tricks we saw on youtube but nothing worked. We contacted customer service but they were no help. Eventually, I broke down and bought a new plate which wasn't expensive but it seemed too early to need replacing given the low use. Then my son wanted to try a larger build - roughly 60mm x 110mm x 95mm which was set to take ~5.5 hours to build but around 4 hours in the printer just froze. We (foolishly) tried two more times and each time it stopped at the same point. Customer service was again no help - they initially respond but only to ask questions. I answered them, sent pictures, etc and they go off to 'research' but never come back. My son now breaks the taller things into parts (nothing taller than 50mm) and we glue them together but it's annoying we can't come close to the stated build height of 150mm.<br/>We'll continue to use it because it's here and we've figured out workarounds to the issues we've faced but I can't say I'd recommend this to others.</span>

<span>This purchase was my first 3D printer.  I had debated about getting a more expensive one that was also larger, but decided to get this as my introduction to the world of 3D printing.<br/><br/>After a rocky start (my nozzle clogged up), this device got me hooked.  It has been used nearly every day since I got it and I am now addicted to 3D printing.  Most of the items that I print are very high quality.  It seems to have a little more trouble on smaller prints, but the type/brand of filament does make a difference as well so it is hard to tell.<br/><br/>My first call for support was fantastic.  The gentleman was extremely patient and really took the time to work with me and solve the issue.  I found this better than the e-mail support which left me a little cold.  Also, I felt like I really had to do my homework figuring out which software to use, but again, once this was done, it was a breeze.<br/><br/>My plan is to continue to print things that have already been designed and continue to learn the intricacies of this hobby.  Then, I will use the printer for designs of my own.  To that end, I truly believe that I made the right decision to purchase this model.  In a year or so, I am sure that I will upgrade.  The print bed is on the smaller side and I have high ambitions of creating larger items.  This model I believe, is equivalent to that of Flashforge and at the time of purchase, was considerably cheaper.  So, keep that in mind.<br/><br/>In summary, don't hesitiate to pick this up if it is your first forray into this great hobby.  There are many video reviews online that will echo my sentiment.</span>

<span>So this is a shot for shot remake of the Flashforge Adventurer 3 or so it would seem. It's got Monoprice branding, and uses a special monoprice version of the slicing software (FlashPrint-MP).<br/><br/>Where to begin.. I have a lot of mixed feelings on this box.<br/><br/>To start, Amazon was offering it at $400 US when i ordered it, hours later I discovered that Monoprice was offering this exact same machine for $300 US. I contacted their customer service to see if they would credit me for the disparate $100 dollars but they said that they were not able to. I'd have to cancel the order on amazon, and reorder through them, and wait the intermediate time for more shipping days. Little disappointed with their service at that point.<br/><br/>Totally my fault for not checking their website first but frustrating and i ended up just keeping the order on Amazon and biting the bullet for $100 in impatience.<br/><br/>On to the printing: This box is pretty easy to set up, finding the correct slicer (FlashPrint-MP specifically) was a bit of a challenge, there's no download link in the box or any included software so you're in for a bit of a googling.<br/><br/>Once you've successfully googled your way to a working slicer you'll find you have most of the general options you would in something like Cura but it's not quite as comprehensive. The supports are not nearly as robust, the fan control is not as complete, it just generally has slightly fewer options than you might want.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the only option with this machine (for some reason) is to use FlashPrint-MP to slice with. You CANNOT use any other slicer (and good luck editing gcode from another slicer to make it print on this box, i've tried my hardest but couldn't do it). Pretty glaring negative right there.<br/><br/>Secondly, this DOES NOT auto-level the bed. It does a single point calibration in the middle of the bed but no checks at the corners or sides. DO NOT BE FOOLED by the marketing. To get the level correct I have resorted to propping up or down each corner with bits of discarded print or paper to make the bed 1) more secure in it's bracket to prevent minute sliding, or 2) get each corner leveled as close to properly as i can. Very disappointed with this as bed level is the #1 factor in bed adhesion.<br/><br/>On to that, bed adhesion. It's really really hit or miss. I've resorted to only using rafts when I print from this machine, the rafts 99% of the time, work great. If you don't use a raft, i've had maybe 20% success rate with brims instead. If you get this, i guess all i can say to help successfully print is, USE A RAFT.<br/><br/>The touchscreen. The best i can say about it is that it's effective. It's responsive, but it gets the job done.<br/><br/>The wireless. NOTE THAT EVERY TIME YOU POWER DOWN THIS MACHINE IT WILL FETCH A NEW IP FROM YOUR DHCP SERVER. this can be very annoying if the machine you print from is not directly next to this box.<br/><br/>The stepper motor on the extruder is prone to skipping as many other reviews will say. I just let it power through it, it's annoying to listen to but it only happens for me on the rafts and only on corners where the bed is too high (like i said it's impossible to actually level this bed).<br/><br/>The PEI sheet that it prints on is flexible so + for that. I can't really fault the sheet much. I have wedged paper on the sides of it to get a tighter fit on the bracket as it has about a millimeter of play in any direction which can affect print quality.<br/><br/>Which i guess we can talk about now. For all it's annoying faults, the saving grace of this machine is that it's got pretty decent print quality, once you fix the many annoyances you're likely to have getting to that point. That said, it's .1mm and even .6mm prints turn out looking fantastic, if you dont have to use many supports.<br/><br/>Prints that need supports are really hit or miss, I've had about 50-50 success for prints that have a lot of supports. it's kind of luck of the draw and the filament you use. That said, any prints i've done that dont require supports come out with a fantastic finish, it's really the saving grace of this box.<br/><br/>So overall.... i guess overall i'd say this machine is disappointing. It has so many little things that it needs fixed, that seem like they'd be easy to fix, i just find it more annoying than anything else. The bed leveling i'd think could be fixed with a software patch to make the bed calibrate in multiple points. But thats just my thoughts, and obviously the devs aren't beholden to me... yet....<br/><br/>I'd say take your money elsewhere and either save up for a Prusa i3 mk3s (700 at the time of this review for the kit, and well worth the 300 more) or a comparably priced prusa mini which will at least give you upgradeability, reliability, a wide user base, and the ability to use any slicer you want.<br/><br/>If you do get this machine, prepare for a lot of time spent babysitting.</span>

<span>Updated after a few weeks with my replacement printer:<br/><br/>I wish I could give this printer a higher rating. It's really cool to use, but the quality issues I experienced are too much for me to go above 3 stars.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Ready to use practically right out of the box. I've never owned a 3D printer before and I was able to get my first print started within an hour of unboxing (after calibrating, connecting to the wifi, and connecting to polarcloud). It's extremely simple to setup and start using.<br/>Good quality as best I can tell. I'm not an expert, but the prints have great detail when set to the high quality resolution.<br/>The printer is quiet and unobtrusive, it blends in well with its enclosed frame and while it definitely can be heard while in operation it's a low murmur noise that's barely audible in the background.<br/>Monoprice customer support is good. Responded within a day and genuinely seemed to want to help me get my issues resolved. Worked to get me a replacement with minimal muss and fuss.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Quality of the printer. I had to return and replace my first printer because the nozzle stopped heating up after 2 weeks of use. The replacement has had the build plate heater partially fail (it doesn't get above 30ish C when it's supposed to be capable of 60) within a week of usage. Thankfully that doesn't matter to me, since I don't plan to print in ABS (and it works fine still with PLA) but it's frustrating that these things seem to be so shoddily made that they fail within a few days.<br/>The printer's filament holder is tiny and doesn't seem sized for any purchasable filaments I can find. Bought a couple of recommended by amazon monoprice filaments with the printer and neither fit. Be prepared to print your own filament holder.<br/>Camera is hit or miss. It's strange that it's locked so tightly to the USB settings (can only have 1 active of USB port or camera) and it disconnects randomly from PolarCloud even when the USB port is off. It wasn't really a selling point for me, but if you're dead set on being able to monitor your prints via camera remotely, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Overall I'd recommend this printer if you are willing to deal with the likelihood of a hardware failure and having to call into a helpful customer support and are willing to do a bit of work to deal with its limited filament holdings. Otherwise, look elsewhere (I have no idea where to be honest, I arrived at this one after weeks of searching so I don't know what's better out there. Good luck).</span>

<span>First, overall this is a great printer for the price. My son absolutely loves it and was printing on it non-stop until the thing went up with a pop and a whiff of blue smoke.<br/><br/>The issue is that on the underside of the build plate, the contacts between the jack, where the cord for the plate plugs in, and the heated plate itself are exposed. This NORMALLY would not be an issue - EXCEPT - to attach the build plate to the heated aluminum bed, which are two separate pieces, Longer includes some binder clips. The black triangle shaped metal clips, with the chrome metal arms that can flip back so that you can squeeze/open the clip, and then swing forward out of the way. (If my description is confusing, google 'binder clip' to see what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>The problem with this design flaw is that my son had a hard time removing a print from the print surface, and not wanting to screw up the leveling by trying to pry it off while it was still attached to the heated bed, he removed the clips, and removed the print surface from the heated bed. After prying the print off the surface, he popped it back on the printer, reattached the binder clips that hold the print surface in place, and flipped the clip arms back under the bed. POP!<br/><br/>The metal arms from one of the clips hit the contacts for the heated bed and shorted the ENTIRE printer out. It seems the printer does not contain ANY fuses. Smoke came from the touchscreen. Peeking into the control box we could see scorch marks on one of the chips on the main board. The SD card that was in the printer at the time was dead. The short blew out every component. If the printer HAD used fuses, a simple fuse swap would have saved the printer. As it was, without them, the entire thing went up in smoke and had to be returned.<br/><br/>User error? Sort of? My son was only reattaching the print surface to the heated bed using the clips that Longer provided for that very purpose, and an arm from one of those clips caused a short on the exposed terminals which are located really close to a corner of the bed, where you'd clip the print surface into place.<br/><br/>I attached a pic of the underside of the bed, showing the exposed terminals. You can see scratches from where the clips were attached and removed, and a scorch mark by some of the terminals where the arm of the clip touched them.<br/><br/>It's a good printer, it just has a safety-related design flaw that buyers should be aware of.<br/><br/>I did buy a new printer to replace the dead one, and returned the dead printer. The flaw is just something to be aware of, not anything that kept me from replacing it with the same model.</span>

<span>Received for my birthday.  Had no problems assembling and getting setup and running.  Have been using it a lot in the last 2 months, but have struggled with it just as much.  Right now I'm trying to print face shield headbands to support the CV19 effort, but haven't gotten a viable print yet.  Knowing what I know now, if I had the choice I would choose something else.  Let me break down the good and bad.<br/><br/>Note: This printer is essentially an Ender 3 clone, but with smaller lower frame rails and Y axis rail.<br/><br/>Good:<br/>- Having a touchscreen is nice.<br/>- The glass build plate is a nice feature.<br/>- Having a heated build plate for the price is nice.<br/>- After some temperature tuning it works great with the Amazon Basics PLA filament.<br/><br/>Mediocre:<br/>- The touchscreen is finicky.<br/>- The surface that comes on the build plate isn't great - I had a chunk come out the first print I took off.<br/>- It does not use the steel rods, but uses roller wheels that clamp onto the aluminum guide.  Those wheels have to be adjusted just right.<br/>- As others have noted, it came with one leg slightly short.<br/>- The bed leveling function doesn't actually put the head over the leveling screws.  I end up doing it all manually.<br/>- Customer service is slow - typically 2 days for response turnaround.<br/>- The community is limited.  There is a Facebook group but I rarely see issues resolved.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/>- The glass build plate that comes with it is usually warped.  I had to shim mine extensively in one direction, only to find it was warped in both directions.  I ended up buying a new build plate from another company that was much more flat.<br/>- I found that the X axis rail on mine was not straight - everything on the right 1/4 of the plate would not print properly even when the bed was perfectly leveled.  They sent me a new one, but it is going to be 3 weeks to get a new one.<br/>- It vibrates a ton when printing.  Lately so badly that I can hear metal rattling somewhere and after a day of printing it vibrates the bed leveling screws out of level.  I can see the vibrations end up in the prints.</span>

<span>I’ve had this printer for about 2 years and during my time with it it’s been easy to use and great for understanding what the printer is suppose to do. The only downside for it is that there is still some work you have to do to get really high quality prints on a small scale, but those can be corrected with some effort. Customer support from the company is also great and hasty to respond to issues that occur. Firmware updates are all available and the printer itself has an easy to use user interface.

<span>Updated review again based on order for spare build plate and grip surface pack directly through Makerbot. I ordered on the 26th of last month (more than 30 days ago) and after a dispute with them today, canceled the order because they cannot ship until maybe next week. Makerbot store cannot tell you stock status or how long you might wait for filament or supplies for this printer. It's pathetic in 2016 to find an online store and they cannot even tell you if they can ship you parts and supplies. I'm knocking this down to 1 star. At best, it was 3 stars for an overpriced and under performing 3D printer, now it's 1 star for the worst customer experience on the planet. If you need build surface or grip packs for this printer- best of luck dealing with MakerBot. It's not that they aren't friendly, but talking on the phone does you zero good if you need parts or supplies. Find another brand that understands logistics. The MakerBot name is trash. Again, I still have an ongoing ticket with them for print quality issue (ooze, layer alignment, infill). All these others giving 5 stars are not telling you the full story long term just one month into ownership.<br/><br/>Ongoing longer term review updated 10/25/2016 dropped a star to 2 stars. Makerbot is unable to tell me when they might have grip surface packs and the removable build plate. This means you as a new user cannot damage your existing build surface because you have no idea for how long you might be down if you damage it. I placed the order with Makerbot the 26th of last month, I have called support numerous times about this order, I've even spoke directly to a manager at least 3-4 times in the last 2 weeks. I waited 2 weeks and again opened yet another ticket on this order for spare grip surfaces and as of this morning, got a response that basically said they don't know.<br/>It's not that Makerbot support is not trying to help, it's that they cannot help. The company is the most disorganized I have ever seen it. Supplies, filament, and parts are a major concern going forward. On top of that, I'm still not getting comparable prints to other existing and cheaper 3D printers I own. The frustration just a month in of ownership is beyond all belief.<br/><br/>Review updated with new pictures 10/14/2016. Note the darker grey PLA is the new Tough PLA while the lighter pictures are the standard PLA. Also note, my machine required a repair to reduce binding in the X axis gantry. This did improve print quality significantly.<br/>Most important, please, if you buy this printer, run the built in example test print Stretchy bracelet as soon as you get the printer. This is a great test to see quality and problems if they exist early on. If your machine does not print that test well, contact MakerBot support right away. See the first photo for what bad layer alignment looks like.<br/><br/>So here is the review by a trusted 3D printer enthusiast with a comparison to the previous Replicator 5th generation machines. First, let's just jump right into the hardware. The mechanics have been completely changed for the better. The Z axis cantilevered shelf is a huge piece of cast aluminum as a single piece making it one of the most stiff and rigid Z axis designs I've seen. It really cost MakerBot a lot of money and investment in this new Z axis and the components pay off. At the same time, the entire XY H-bot style motion system was changed from a single stamped plate in the previous generation, to now a series of custom made aluminum extrusions and cast end brackets for the motors and idlers. The linear bearings are canted 45 degrees to bring even more torsional rigidity to the mechanism (a know weak point of choosing H-bot over Core XY). Another huge upgrade is that the new plastic frame is made of a different plastic formulation that is much tougher, and the mounting points for all attachments are now molded in threaded brass inserts. In addition, a Z upper safety limit switch was added in case during homing, something went wrong to prevent the axis from running into the extruder. It's not used for homing, but is a nice additional safety feature. Finally, the noise reduction statements are from the change of the frame of the machine being stiffer, sound dampening material being attached to the metal panels, and the biggest one of all, rubber dampeners/isolators on the XY stepper motors. Almost forgot, the X gantry has the additional linear bearing and rail such that the moving extruder no longer hangs and can flex under the gantry as before. All of these changes represent significant engineering effort went into a serious overhaul and thus the + label is truly deserved.<br/><br/>All that said, it's not all roses. Due to the electronics remaining exactly the same as before, the stepper drivers are noisy as before. If you hate the "robot" sounds, it might be quieter, but it still there. Note, this sound is louder than almost every other brand I've touched (I own 42 printers of all brands and models for those who know me). I would say it's still uncomfortably loud to have on a desk next to you in a bedroom printing for hours. Also, the print quality is not great. Yes, it has printed something every time so far (I've only had it one day), but vertical layer alignment and errors like ringing (bumps at direction changes caused by flexing of components) are present in the print example files on the printer. In fact, the stretchy bracelet was the worst example where 2 sides of the object had very poor layers. I've also found that the raft was almost impossible to remove from the object. I honestly believe this error now (since the mechanic have been upgraded in the + ) is from the nozzle movement in the smart+ extruder. Basically, for Z homing, the nozzle can move up and down when it touches the bed triggering a sensor to home. That same movement is not precision such that the nozzle returns to the exact XY position every time. The return spring is intentionally weak to make homing accurate, but between required tolerance for thermal expansion and just bad design, the nozzle can wobble well more than a layer width (0.5mm from a 0.4mm nozzle) resulting in the poor vertical layer alignment. Basically, the retraction at movement to the next layer pulls the nozzle up, and allows it to move slighty in XY randomly when it begins extruding the next layer.<br/>Another huge problem, no rubber feet!!! That right, a $2000+ printer that sits on the bottom of the frame with nothing but the plastic edges of the frame. In fact, there are protrusions on the metal plate that could damage your desk/table if not sitting flat.<br/><br/>So a recap: Greatly improved mechanics, frame, and overall construction. Again, hats off for this upgrade.<br/>The bad is, the same electronics, no rubber feet, noisy, poor print quality, no heated bed, and while not "restricted" to MakerBot filament, the warning stickers put some fear into you.<br/><br/>I cannot deny, it printed out of the box. The setup was easy. No leveling, no adjustments. The new software is simple, and maybe somebody likes it, but a professional user is likely to be frustrated.<br/><br/>It a tough call here, so make your own informed decision. On one hand, this is easy for even the novice to use. Likely, you will have fair success in printing an object. If you are a pro user, if you have access to other brands of machines, you are likely to be unhappy with noise, performance, print quality, and lack of settings in the software. The real difference here is the old 5th gen, I honestly could never say it was a good printer, and definitely for the price. This new printer is greatly improved on the hardware level. It really is wonderful engineering. It's crippled by the electronics which are the root cause of the noise, and smart extruder system with the sloppy nozzle that can wiggle left and right in the down position. Fix those 2 things (and might as well say the software too given the latest release) and it might be a good printer for folks starting out.<br/><br/>Also, minor rant about the software. The new version is the worst ever to a pro user and maybe even to amateurs. The symbols representing actions and buttons are cryptic and it just has very, very, very, limited printed settings (raft and support on/off, infill%, and shells, layer height, and extruder type). I highly recommend you download the latest version if considering buying this printer. Don't take my word for it, see for yourself.</span>

<span>This thing prints everything, just as they are designed.<br/><br/>That's the most important thing.<br/><br/>But in a little over 2 years, I'm on my 3rd unit.

<span>Short Story:  I purchased the FlashForge 3d Printer Creator Pro in mid December 2014 and started using it on December 25th.  I have printed ABS things that came with it, an ABS bicycle I created with SketchUp, and a wrench using PLA glow-in-the dark filament.  Everything works great.  This is a fantastic machine and technology.  And I had a couple of questions and the legendary Tang answered the first email within an hour on Christmas Eve and the second email within an hour on Christmas morning (Central Standard Time).  Great product, great service and the concept of 3d printing is really cool.<br/><br/>Long Story:  I got interested in 3d printing about a year ago and began shopping and reading web sites.  I noticed that the machines were getting less expensive and per the reviews, more reliable.  In early December I decided it was time to buy one and I suggested to my wife that I was going to do this and ‘it could be my Christmas present’.  She said that was fine, but I could not open it until Christmas day.  That was not what I intended but it turned out to be a good thing.  For the 3 weeks or so before Christmas I read everything I could find about how to set up and use this printer.<br/>The first thing I discovered is that there is a lot of software involved, and three ways to get objects to the printer.  First, you can download files from the internet.  Second you can create an object then print it, and third you can buy a scanner, scan an object, and then print it.  And you can combine elements of all of those.  You could download a file, merge that with something you scanned, and then import that file into a 3D modeling software like Google SketchUp and modify it.<br/><br/>I’m a baby boomer and we all learned things by reading the manual.  Kids today never bothered with manuals so when they started inventing all this stuff they don’t bother writing manuals.  You have to figure everything out by reading Customer Reviews and researching on the internet.<br/>Scanning.  I purchased a Matter and Form MFS1v1 3d scanner.  I wrote a review about it, so won’t repeat that here.  It works.<br/>Create a Model of your own design.  You have to learn to use a software program to do this.  I selected SketchUp because there are good reviews and it is free.  But there are no manuals.  You load it on your PC, then work through 4 training tutorials provided by Google, then you just have to do google searches to try to figure out everything else you need to know to create an object that you can print.<br/><br/>Here is what I learned about SketchUp essential to 3D printing:<br/><br/>1. Build your object in a large size, then let the printing software (more on that later) reduce it in size.  SketchUp was developed as a 3d tool for architecture and lacks the ability to make very tiny parts.  But you can make a big part with high detail then reduce it.<br/><br/>2. Every time you create an object on SketchUp – you must select it then “make a group”.  Then you right-click and look at ‘Entity Info’.  If you see ‘volume’ you have created a solid that will print on a 3d printer.  If you try to print something that is not a solid the print software will discover “manifold” problems, and the print won’t work.<br/><br/>3. After you create solids, you join them together using a tool called “outer shell”.  This is the tool on SketchUp 2015.  I think tools on earlier versions had other names.  You get to this tool by: View, Toolbars, Solid Tools.  A bunch of solid objects joined together with ‘Outer Shell’ result in a model that can be printed.<br/><br/>4. When you first download Sketchup you get the Pro version (for 30 days).  With the pro version you get other Solid Tools and you can output ‘object’ files.  I got so frustrated that I could not get objects to print properly (just using the print preparation software – see below) that I bought the Pro version.  I now don’t think you need it.  The free version will output STL files and the Print Prep software can use either an “STL” file or and “OBJ” file<br/><br/>5. When you are finished building your object – export it as on OBJ file or Export it as an STL file.  To export as an STL file you have to add the STL functionality to your SketchUp program.  Again, just Google: “Add STL to Sketchup” and you will discover how to do this<br/><br/>Convert your File to a Print File:  Next – you prepare your file to print.  This is required regardless of whether you download a model from the internet of use a model you created from SketchUp.  You must have software that is capable of creating a file in the format expected by your printer.  The Print File provides all the info the printer requires heat the extruders, move the print bed, move the extruders, push out the plastic, and so on.<br/><br/>The directions that come with this printer instruct the user how to download free software and install it – along with other programs and drivers and so on.  I found this baffling and for $140 bought Simplify3D, which is an alternative to the free software.  Simplify3D has about 9 tutorials that explain how to use it.  Remember, I’m killing time until Christmas and working through these was very helpful.<br/><br/>When you first launch Simplify3D you tell it the brand and model of your printer.  Then, as you import the model you either created or downloaded, the software has preconfigured processes to facilitate printing.  You can change all these but I found the defaults to work great.  When you are ready to print the software shows you an extruder suspended in space above a print bed and it prints your model, on your computer screen.  You can watch it and use the “repair” menu to find all the problems – before even using the actual printer.  When you have the model printing correctly on your PC, you move the file to the actual printer.<br/><br/>But this is the cool thing – if you are thinking about buying a 3D printer – get SketchUp and buy Simplify3d.  Make some models; see how they print.  You can learn an awful lot before making the leap to buy the printer.<br/><br/>Now to the FlashForge<br/><br/>It came, from Amazon, in two days.  It was packed well and everything was in it.<br/>The instructions for assembly are clear – but I also found a video of how to assemble a slightly older version that was helpful.<br/>This version includes an acrylic cover and front door that help keep the temperature constant which is useful for ABS printing.  The instructions that come with the printer provide a web site with a video that shows how to assemble the acrylic cover that goes on the top of the machine.  Hint:  Take all the protective paper off the acrylic, use some of the painters’ tape that comes with the printer to tape the acrylic pieces together, install the screws, and remove the tape.  This is a lot easier than the process in the video.<br/><br/>It took 20 minutes and a lot of patience to get the print bed level.  I finally settled on this procedure – Launch the ‘Level Build Plate’ on the printer, push the extruder assembly until it is right above the leveling wing-nut closest to you.  Adjust that wing-nut until paper just barely slides; move extruder until it is above the other wing nuts and do the same thing.  You just push it with your hands.  Keep moving the extruder and adjusting the wing nuts until paper just slides, anywhere on the bed.<br/><br/>Printing was the easiest part.  First, I printed the objects that are on the SD card that comes with the machine.  These printed fine.  I was a little impatient getting the first print off the print bed, which has a layer of Kapton tape. I used a sharp knife from the kitchen to pop the model loose and actually cut into the tape.  So on every subsequent print there is a little flap of Kapton tape sticking up.  Note, however that when you use the Printing Software (in my example Simplify3D), you can check a box for “Include Raft”.  When you do this, the printer creates a lattice of plastic under your actual object.  That lattice just peels right off when finished.  And the lattice covers up the Kapton tape tear and minor imperfections in levelling.<br/><br/>Then I moved to printing from my PC.  I could not load the driver necessary to connect my PC directly to the printer – but just copied ready-to-print files from Simplify3D to the SDCH card that came with the printer.  Then put the SDCH card in the printer and it works fine.<br/><br/>ABS.  First 10 prints were using the ABS filament that came with the printer.  I had studied all the settings and variables available to control the print – but when it came time to do it I just told the Simplify3D software that I was using ABS and wanted a ‘raft’ and everything came out fine.  NOTE regarding “Supports”.  The reason I bought a two extruder printer was because I thought you needed a second extruder to generate ‘supports’ for parts with a big overhang, using one of those soluble plastics that can later be dissolved.  It turns out that the Simplify3D software (and probably most others) can print ‘supports’ just using the same ABS spool as your model.  Somehow the supports are printed so they don’t stick very much and they just break off.  The only time you would really need soluble supports is if they had to be printed inside your model where you could not easily remove them.<br/><br/>PLA.  Same story (almost).  I backed out the ABS filament and loaded some PLA (that actually glows in the dark!).  Everything had been printing so smoothly on the Kapton tape that I just told Simplify3D I was using PLA – and printed! I did not bother to use the Painters’ Tape as instructed because that would require re-leveling the print bed.  The PLA print on the Kapton tape worked fine for about 10 minutes then the entire RAFT pulled loose and got caught against the extruder and I was not watching closely and a LOT of PLA got gummed up on the end of the extruder.  Cleaned it up, installed a couple strips of painters’ tape, re-leveled and it prints fine.  LESSON:  follow the instructions.<br/><br/>This machine and all the software are really fun.  About the equivalent to a two hour college course, I think.  I highly recommend this machine and the company that backs it up.<br/><br/>11/5/2018 Update:  I have had this machine for 4 years.  I had to replace the print nozzles when they got too clogged, and I NEVER use the dual nozzle feature but this machine is a champ.</span>

<span>This is my second 3D printer.  I've upgraded from a Printrbot Simple Metal with heated bed to this one because I needed more build space for some parts I've designed as well as wanting the second extruder to be able to print dissolvable support material.  At the time I purchased (Sep 2015) I was heavily considering the new Printrbot Plus, but I was very much on the fence about the purchase.  The major cons to me were lack of enclosure (making ABS prints trickier) and the fact that they had just upped the price for the dual extruder model charging a whopping 400 dollar premium for the second extruder (with no way to upgrade the single extruder model after the fact).  This got me looking for another option.  When I stumbled across mentions of this printer it seemed like it would fit the bill perfectly and the price was unbelievably low for the features that it packed in.  I did some quick research and though it seemed I would have to change what software I was using to control my printer, I felt like that was going to be a relatively minor inconvenience.  Without hesitation I placed the order and within two days it was sitting at my door.<br/><br/>Initial impression<br/>The printer construction is much more solid than I had expected.  I knew that it was a metal frame, but I expected the plastic parts to be much lower quality than they are.  When I first fired it up it played a tune (something common of many chinese appliances).  I found this overly loud and irritating, but it is easily disabled in the settings.  Initial print quality was quite good, better than my Printrbot.  After having used it a bit I now realize that this is due to the difference in slicer being used.  If I use the same slicer as my Printrbot used, the quality degrades to what I was used to seeing on there.  Oops, I guess I should have done a bit more research when I still owned the Printrbot.  The ReplicatorG software works well with some minor inconveniences:<br/><br/>- When printing a skirt it only does one loop and I can't space it as far away from the actual print as I would like<br/>- When it generates gcode it always wants to set the bed temp to 110C which is probably fine if you are doing ABS, but for PLA it's WAY too hot.  I haven't found a way to change what it generates, so I always end up editing that line in the gcode after generation.<br/>- If the ReplicatorG window is covered up while printing, it will eventually stop moving the print head leaving a big blob in your print.  I solve this by having a second monitor and just moving the Replicator window there to allow me to continue working while it prints.<br/>- Slicing takes quite a bit longer than I'm used to, but does seem to produce a better quality finish than I'm used to getting as well.  It takes something along the lines of 3 or 4 times longer.  This is because ReplicatorG uses Skeinforge where I was using Cura or MatterSlice.<br/><br/>You can also use MakerBot Desktop software, but although it works I can't say it works well.  No option to print a skirt, no jog controls makes it a no go for me.  It did let me adjust the bed temp properly though.  :)<br/><br/>Customer Service<br/>When the printer arrived all parts were well packed and padded and everything seemed in order.  When assembling it though I noticed that the front door had a large scratch in it.  I know I didn't put it there because the plastic was still in tact when I was assembling and removing it revealed the scratch underneath.  I was a bit bummed, but figured I would reach out to Tang and see if he could send me a replacement.  After explaining the problem he said he would send a replacement right away.  It just arrived yesterday (even MORE well packed and padded) and is flawless.  I installed it last night and I'm thrilled with the aesthetic of the printer now.  I am quite surprised with the quality of customer service received from Tang as I know that usually Chinese electronics get something of a bad rap in the US.  If I hadn't known it was coming from China I would have assumed I was dealing with a top notch US electronics company.  Kudos on that!<br/><br/>Print Quality<br/>Now that I have gotten the bed leveling procedure dialed in (I didn't have to do this with my Printrbot) I am getting great quality prints.  The extruder is a little messier than the Printrbot's when getting started, often leaving a pretty big blob as it starts to print a skirt, but it seems flawless during the print itself.  The Printrbot was somewhere in the middle on both those things, smaller initial blob, but it could "leak" during moves even if significant retraction was used.  I believe this is due to the difference in extruders between the two printers.  The heated part on the Printrbot was much larger, so more of the filament was molten during printing.  This meant that even with retraction it was hard to stop molten filament from leaking out of the bottom.  The FlashForge has a much smaller heated part, less molten plastic at any given time leading to less leakage.  My only complaint with the new extruder is the fact that internally the hot end seems to have  a larger diameter than the extruder opening.  This means that you have to be careful how you change filaments to avoid causing a jam.  Since this process seemed pretty intuitive to me and I've had no problems with jams.<br/><br/>Ease of Use<br/>This printer is definitely harder to use than my Printrbot was.  If this is your first printer, expect a steep learning curve because nothing about the software is going to hold your hand like it does on the Printrbot using MatterControl or Cura.  However, once I got it dialed in, it is only slightly more complicated than my previous print process.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Every printer has some downsides and this is no exception.  There are a few things that I will be changing on this printer.<br/>- I don't like the way the filament spools work.  I have already printed a new spool holder to fit the existing screw pattern on the top of the printer so that I can hang them from above.  This will likely get in my way for enclosed ABS prints, but I'll tackle that when I come to it.<br/>- The fan on the bottom that cools the motor drivers is CRAZY loud.  I'm in a small apartment and it's just about too much to have running for a 5 hour print.  I expect to be changing the way those driver chips are cooled in the future in order to eliminate that fan<br/>- There is no active cooling on the print head.  This really is necessary for good quality PLA prints, especially if you're bridging or trying to print pieces that push the "no support" limit.  I'll be printing a fan duct to solve this, but the clearance on all sides of the print head are going to make this a little tricky to get right.<br/><br/>I don't feel like any of these things is a deal breaker or even unsolvable, so I'm pretty happy.<br/><br/>Overall Value<br/>This printer seems like a fantastic value for the money.  I still can't believe it has all these features at this price point.  Customer service is really good and Tang really seems to care about how his company is perceived.  I appreciate that.  All in all this printer gets my endorsement as a great bang for the buck with quality far exceeding my expectations.</span>

<span>Background: I'm a professional industrial designer and have a lot of experience with different types of large-scale 3D printers. I was looking for a something I could use in my home and private practice for a mixture of personal and client work, and after establishing my budget and doing a lot of research I settled on this guy.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Setup took me a couple of hours, but that's only because I was being very deliberate about everything and read the manual cover to cover before I started putting things together. Having done it now, I'm pretty sure I could do it again in under an hour if I wanted to. Especially since a large portion of my setup time was devoted to unwrapping and assembling the plexiglass covers and door, which are supposed to be removed when printing PLA anyways to allow for better circulation (I've opted to do most of my work in PLA instead of ABS, more on that below).<br/><br/>Looking back on it, the setup is not actually that complicated. Mostly you have to unpack a couple of the more delicate things and screw them in place.<br/><br/>DOCUMENTATION:<br/>Manual is passably good. The english gets a little rough in some parts, and I question the order in which a couple of sections are presented, but I managed to get the whole thing up and running and the software installed without using any outside resource, so it clearly does the job. Overall if you're unfamiliar with the machine I suggest giving it a skim-through before you start and that should prevent any surprises.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE:<br/>There are a number of "slicer" software packages out there in the 3D printing world, and a number of them will apparently work with this machine. A copy of ReplicatorG is included here (on an included SD card, which is used for printing). RepG is good but not great. I've used it exclusively so far, but when I attempted to slice a very complex model yesterday (a very dense mesh of a human figure), I discovered that it has an absolute limit in terms of memory capacity. I'm now looking at a couple other packages that will supposedly work better. Options range from open source (CUDA, --I had some issues setting it up and ultimately moved on, but I've seen people who apparently use it) to paid professional software like Slic3r or Simplify 3D. I'm currently testing Simplify; besides the memory issue, it looks like it may streamline my workflow a bit, which would be very nice for me when it comes to professional work.<br/><br/>Having said that, if you're primarily a hobbyist or your parts are simple-to-intermediate in complexity, ReplicatorG would conceivably work just fine.<br/><br/>USE:<br/>I've been creating/downloading a bunch of different types of parts and trying out a couple different materials since I got it. There is absolutely a learning curve when it comes to the temperature and hotbed settings for each model and each material (even if you're using all PLA, different colors have different quirks). I had some severe warping issues when I first tried the included ABS materials. I managed to greatly reduce this by experimenting with the temperature settings, but for most stuff now I'm just going with PLA as I said, as it's much less prone to warping. Unless you have a very specific reason why you NEED ABS, I don't see why you wouldn't.<br/><br/>Was initially concerned about having to level the bed, seemed like a huge pain. Turns out it's pretty easy, just takes a little practice. Some of the experienced guys on the internet make it sound like they have to level before every job (maybe they do), but honestly I've been doing it every couple of jobs IF something seems off and it's been running fine.<br/><br/>Also, when I was shopping, I worried that the build envelope would be too small at this price range. While, yes, bigger would always be better, honestly this one is big enough for most of the things I would ever do. Anything much larger would probably be better to print as separate pieces anyways.<br/><br/>Common observed print failure modes (things that can go wrong):<br/>-Parts don't stick: This happens when the printing bed is not level, or your temperature settings are off. The printer will try to lay down the first layer, but since it won't stick to the bed, you just get a string of "spaghetti" that gets dragged around and keeps getting worse. However it's not that big a deal. I let it run (accidentally) for an hour or two like this once, and it made a big old stringy pile, but I canceled the job and just pulled all the waste out no problem. The material isn't sticky or anything, you just snap it off and pull it out. Minimal mess.<br/><br/>-Goopy start: can be a temperature issue, or maybe related to a partial "didn't stick to bed" issue as described above. A rogue element of goop clings to the nozzle and interferes with the rest of the job.<br/><br/>-Parts are "stringy" or "hairy:" exactly what it sounds like, your part finishes but has little spiderwebs of thing plastic strands on it, like a hot glue gun would leave. Again this is a temperature issue--you're slightly off of the ideal setting. Having said that, it's been very minor on the one or two jobs that had this issue for me, and i just pulled the hairs off.<br/><br/>-Part de-laminates midway through: usually happens when a support structure (auto-generated by your slicer software) snaps, doesn't stick to the bed, or just doesn't do its job right, resulting in a layer not being laid down where it needs to be, and then you get a spaghetti mess midway through your file. Rare but annoying.<br/><br/>-Part breaks midway through: basically the same as above, except the part itself fails due to a too-thin cross section. I printed a tiny little human figure and one of the legs snapped at the ankle. This was compounded by the fact that the bed was very slightly off of level, so the nozzle was dragging just a little bit on that leg and not the other. Corrected by leveling bed and scaling up the part a little bit. Could also have added support structure.<br/><br/>Solutions for most of these:<br/>-Level the bed<br/>-Adjust the temperature of the extruded and/or hotplate (remember that Celsius jumps faster than Fahrenheit...whoops)<br/>-Add stickiness. I put a little hairspray on the bed and it seems to help, though I try to contain it so it doesn't go shooting all over the other components (which concerns me). Some people seem to like klapon tape or blue tape or glass beds; do some research. So far I'm still using Flashforge's stock blue bed sticker, that seems to be fine.<br/><br/>Most of these will occur in the first few minutes/layers of a print, if they're going to happen. I usually stick around and watch it when it starts to make sure it gets going OK, then I'm comfortable walking away while it runs. For some jobs I find that simply canceling and restarting (for example if it lays down a goopy opening layer) is enough to fix it. You can also adjust the nozzle temperature on the fly, but the bed must be adjusted via computer.<br/><br/>Also, apparently, don't use the USB cable. The computer may not stream the data fast enough, and it makes the circuit vulnerable to EMF interference (static), which can screw up the print.<br/><br/>RESULTS:<br/>High success rate for small to medium size/complexity parts. Support structures generated by RepG are a mixed bag; sometimes easy to remove, sometimes not. I have higher hopes for Simplify 3D's supports.<br/>Having some issue with larger parts (longer runtimes). See below.<br/><br/>PROBLEMS:<br/>One major problem so far. When running larger parts - particularly anything that takes more than a couple hours - there seems to be a chance that the printer will "hang." By that I mean that it just stops at a random point during the job. Extruder is still on, but stops feeding. Menu can be accessed and even functions, but nothing will make the printer resume the job. It has to be canceled. I'm not sure if this is a software glitch or a hardware issue. A solution is in the works, see customer service below.<br/><br/>I also had some intermittent issues with bad toolpaths, but I believe that was a software problem.<br/><br/>CUSTOMER SERVICE:<br/>Flashforge is based in (I think) China, but they are very eager to provide technical support. I received an email several days before the printer arrived with contact information for Mr. Tang, who is the (or one of) customer support rep. for Amazon sales. After trying unsuccessfully to fix the "hangup" problem myself, I contacted him last night and received a quick response (given the time difference). He first suggested I check on a software setting in RepG, which was indeed set incorrectly. However upon further analysis he suspects something is wrong with my SD card, or the SD port. He opted to ship me a new SD card reader, which is now on the way. Overall he's been very helpful, so I would say that service is a positive mark for Flashforge. I was initially concerned that it would be hard to get tech support from around the world, but I'm not worried about that anymore. Hopefully the new part solves the intermittent hangup problem, but if it doesn't I believe they will continue to try until it is fixed.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/>Overall, pleased so far. Would like to get the hangup problem resolved, but Flashforge is working on that as fast as I could possibly ask, so I can't hold it against them. Also looking forward to trying the new software in the meantime; perhaps that will resolve it too.</span>

<span>After quite a bit of comparison shopping and research I purchased one of these for work. It was my first experience with a 3D printer, so I was starting from an absolute newbie perspective.  The printer arrives in a very plain brown box, and other than the size and weight (and the fact that you're expecting it), you'd never know what was inside until you open the box.<br/><br/>Setup is a breeze, but be sure to look at the owners manual before you begin trying to get the packing foam out of the interior.  It will make things much easier.  Setup, leveling the print bed, loading of the filament (comes with two spools of ABS), and test print (the little traffic cone) is very easy.  You'll be surprised at how well it prints and the quality of the finished product.  I've seen 3D printed models (both online and in person) in the past, and they were not very good.  I have to say that after using this printer and seeing the quality of the output, I have been very impressed.<br/><br/>After a few weeks of using this at work I liked it so much that I purchased one for my home.  Since then we have printed everything from bird houses to doorstops and many other things.  I'm now printing a drone.  Besides ABS (which I use most of the time), I've also purchased and printed with PLA and PETG.  PETG would be what you'd want to use if you intend to make and use something that comes in contact with food or liquids (I used it for a bird feeder).<br/><br/>Since I had to learn all of this the hard way, I'll give you a few pointers that hopefully will save you some time.  For what I was doing at work I needed to create my own 3D models.  After looking at all the options I went with Blender.  It's open source, free, and has a huge support community so you can find answers quickly.  Blender is not intuitive, but it is very much worth learning.  Search YouTube for Blender and you'll find plenty of tutorials.  The first few days are frustrating, but after you begin to figure out how to use Blender, you'll be hooked.  I've made some amazing things after learning Blender.<br/><br/>The next software I would recommend is Simplify3D.  It works great and is very easy to learn and use.  Why do you need this?  Whether you download a model (.stl file) from Thingiverse or create a model in something like Blender (which you would then export as an STL file), you need a way to get that STL file converted to gcode for the printer.  The printer comes with some software for this, but in my opinion the included software is nowhere near as powerful or complete as Simplify3D.<br/><br/>Simplify3D does all the work and makes it super easy to go from STL to printer.  You basically open an STL file, view it in Preview Mode, and then export it (save it) to the SD card that goes in the Flashforge Creator Pro.  That's it.  Simplify3D has a lot of options you can play with if needed (most of the time you don't).  This software costs $149, but I would recommend purchasing it.  It will save you tons of headaches and you'll be printing very quickly and easily.<br/><br/>Before I forget, this is the 2016 model of Flashforge Creator Pro.  I didn't know they had a different model before 2016, so if you download and print an add-on (see below) for the printer, be sure you're downloading something for the 2016 model, otherwise it may not fit after you print it (I found that out the hard way)<br/><br/>Once you are printing, I would suggest downloading and printing two "add-on" parts for the Flashforge printer (neither of these are my designs, I just found them on Thingiverse):<br/><br/>1. Filament Feeder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1582238).  This makes it much easier to load/unload the filament, and keeps it better aligned with the center of the filament reel.<br/><br/>2. Universal Filament Holder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641112).  You'll need one of these because not all filament spools are the same width, and many will not fit on the hubs supplied with the printer.  These are simple to use and can be swapped for the ones that come with the printer in about 10 seconds.  They mount exactly like the ones supplied (requiring no tools... simply hangs on the back like the factory ones).<br/><br/>There are many variants of both of these add-ons on Thingiverse.  I personally have printed and use these, so I can vouch for them.  They work just fine, but I'm sure others would work equally well.<br/><br/>The last thing that I would highly recommend is replacing the blue print bed platform sticker that comes with the printer with a glass plate. After having used the blue sticker for about a month, and then switching to glass, I still can't figure out why they wouldn't ship the printer from the factory without a glass print bed.  In my opinion glass is far superior.  I don't need a scraper of any kind to remove a print.  It simply cools and pops right off.  I use a light coating of Aqua Net hairspray on the glass (wiped off with a paper towel after spraying) before printing.  This makes the glass sticky so the plastic will stick while it is printing.  As soon as it prints and cools, however, the part will pop right off without even prying. The glass bed kit that I purchased (from Amazon) is borosilicate glass that is cut to the right size for this printer (220mm x 150mm x 5mm high). The kit I purchased was from Makersome.  There are two corner brackets (part of the kit) that mount on opposite corners of the print bed and the glass plate simply sits on there.  The beauty of this design is that as soon as I print something I can lift the glass plate out (usually with a pot holder because it is hot), and set the glass on the granite counter top.  It cools very quickly (1-2 min) and the part literally unsticks itself.<br/><br/>Instead of hairspray I have also used an ABS slurry by mixing ABS scraps with some acetone (must use a polypropylene spray bottle for that) and spraying and wiping it off the glass.  I've done both, but I get the same results with hairspray with the bonus that it is much more convenient and it is clear so it works with any color ABS I'm printing.<br/><br/>I clean the glass between printings with just dish soap and warm water.  When I'm ready to print something else, I simply spray on (and wipe off) the hairspray and print again.<br/><br/>Hope this helps, and enjoy printing.  The Flashforge Creator Pro is a great printer.</span>

<span>I ordered this printer after seeing some very positive reviews and, at first the test prints I made came out great.  Then things went downhill rapidly.  This was only my second 3d printer, so I'm still quite the noob, but the Cadet I got appears to be defective.  Here are a few of the issues I encountered:<br/><br/>WiFi -- worked exactly one time and never would connect again.  As it stands, that by itself is not a big deal since the WiFi usage is minimal at best, but I did expect it to work more than once.<br/><br/>Magnetic build plate -- this thing is seriously lacking in hold strength.  Quite often I saw the build plate shift quite some distance while a print was in progress even though it seemed to attach quite firmly when I first put it on.<br/><br/>Z-axis controller/motor/??? -- after tuning the Z-axis offset I thought all was well, then I started a print and went about my business.  Suddenly I started hearing all kinds of racket.  Come to find out the Z-axis had slammed the nozzle into the build plate enough to scratch the plate.  Very irritating and pretty much the last straw so I opted to return the printer.  I have now wasted far too much filament for a printer that was supposed to be so user-friendly.<br/><br/>Positives?  Well, the auto bed-levelling seemed to work fine in those rare instances when a print was successful, so that's something.<br/><br/>My other printer is also a Monoprice and, after doing the usual minor tweaks out of the box, it has worked well.  My copy of the Cadet, though, appears to be possessed or defective.  Bummer.</span>

<span>This is a great little printer with many serious problems.  1) No documentation: Did not work when it was first set up and the printer did not come with documentation to help troubleshoot. After we watched many user-posted videos, we realized that the z-axis offset needed to be changed. 2) Outdated/incompatible slicer software: The included software is very outdated, and is incompatible with current OSs on mac.  There are no other software options. 3) Wifi does not work:  As I was warned by online reviews, the app is useless and the Wifi does not work. 4) Broke after 4 months and 20 prints: After 20 high quality prints, the printer no longer levels itself. Because there is no support, no documentation and no way to update software, it is essentially bricked.</span>

<span>I am a software engineer. While I did my own 3d cnc router in the past. I was not interested in DIY 3d printers and wanted a problem free printer with good prints. I chose Sindoh for ABS-ready printing.<br/>Printer has good build quality and designed well. It mostly works well too. I had some issues which I wanted to discuss:<br/><br/>1) ABS printing is not perfect yet. problem is bed adhesion. Sindoh bed is good but I think I have a quality problem since ABS warped itself and also seperated bed surface from metal. This shouldn't have happened.<br/><br/>2) Again bed has issues and Sindoh should make a better bed. Look at photos. This happened when I try to stick ABS at 110C. I don't know if this is under warranty and maybe I should replace it. I am also experimenting my own sheet over PEI bed which worked fine so far.<br/><br/>3) Firmware: It needs to fix certain annoyances like don't try to go home position if I try to take control of XYZ. Also had filament sensor problem which looked like software related.<br/><br/>4) Slicer software: Windows only! Sindoh should make things easy for non-Windows users. There is Cura and Slic3r. How about you fully support them?<br/><br/>Also add presets for  best options for non-sindoh materials like PETG ASA ABS etc. I will be using open materials only.<br/><br/>Windows software is also keeping per-file settings in addition to profiles. That's just confusing. Make it simple. Also options and mixed with limited text information.<br/>I really think Sindoh should support and open source project like Slic3r or partner with Cura? Many people use simplify3d anyways but I won't pay for it.</span>

<span>This was my second 3D printer I purchased, the first was a Crealty that I returned. I am also returning the Sindoh, but for very different reasons.<br/><br/>Out of the box it printed great, it took very little work to get the printer working and I was pleased with the ease of use. At first I started with simple items with shorter print times. Then I moved into overnight prints and things with more complexity.<br/><br/>For the first three weeks, the machine printed without any issues, except I could not get ABS to work. PLA worked great and while the filament was expensive and you really needed more cartridges it you want to use multiple colors, overall I thought I had found the perfect 3D printer.<br/><br/>At week three, I started to have problems. I had several overnight printers create a stringy mess. Then problems with adhesion to the bed, then cartridge errors, then a problem when it ran out of filament I couldn't get it out of an endless loop of replacing the cartridge. None of the issues by themselves were unsolvable, however added up I started to get concerned with the long term cost of running the machine.<br/><br/>I tried tech support a few times, and while I did get some useful articles on possible solutions, the general answer is try a, b, and c, if that does not work let us know. Tech support takes 24 hours for every response, so troubleshooting can take 3-4 days.<br/><br/>Overall I liked the printer, quality was good, and for the most part easy to use. The software used does not have a great UI, however it does have a few features that work better than Simplify3D. Optimize Print is very handy to make sure you are printing with the least number of supports required.<br/><br/>It is a good printer and has it's place, for me I need something that is more robust that can print without issues all day, everyday.</span>

<span>This thing prints 98% of perfect. There are some subtle defects in the first few prints due to moisture/gas trapped in the filament, so I can't fault the machine. The 1 star is lost because the "app" or mobile interface is very weak. The sole purpose of it is to inform you of the time to finish, and the ability to cancel if the print becomes unstable/ruined. This is unsatisfactory. The app should contain more data. For the price, they could have embedded a higher resolution camera as well. You also only get 1 out of every 30ish frames. I will probably mod my printer and embed a better camera with internet capability so I can view it anywhere. As far as I can tell, the mobile app only works if you're in wifi proximity.<br/><br/>So to summarize<br/>Pros:<br/>+Accurate Prints<br/>+Easy To Setup<br/>+Easy To Load/Unload<br/>+Quiet Machine, like, I can't really even hear it over my mini fridge and PC unless it's doing very intricate stuff... but it still doesn't even whine like you expect to hear the servos on other machines. Very quiet.<br/>+Automatically adjusts the nozzle temps to account for flow as it prints... ensuring the highest quality print possible with your settings/filament.<br/>+Illumination | the lighting in the machine is stellar.<br/>+Very responsive via WiFi. I've had other Wifi enabled machines in the past, and they take forever to receive instructions. This one works fast. Managed to cut the wire clutter from the last machine and put it on the other end of the office from the PC.<br/><br/>-Flexible Filaments are not printable (according to the software) this should be clearly indicated in the product description pages on Amazon and their website.<br/>-Webcam isn't a webcam, it's a closed-circuit cam that works on your local network. A net-cam? And the framerate is trash, resolution is trash. It's a terrible feature and should just be excluded to avoid reviews like this.<br/>- The "retaining bar" or whatever you want to call it, assists with proprietary cartridge loading blocks the loading of "open" material i.e. your 3rd party filament spool will not fit. There are tutorials online that show you how to mod this piece with spacers, but you risk voiding your warranty and potentially breaking the tabs on the housing that hold it together.<br/>-Instructions or some indication on how to replace the nozzle is something I cannot find anywhere so far. I will keep looking but it's kind-of a big deal for avid printers such as myself.</span>

<span>So I bought this last October to replace my old Flashforge Finder, and I've been running it ever since.  It was, as another reviewer stated,  "A BMW of a 3D printer".  It was the most reliable and QUIET printer I've ever used.<br/><br/>I used the included cassette of white PLA to make some test prints when I got it, and everything went great.  I went to open source filament after that and had ZERO problems.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I decided to try the cassette, and upon loading it, the printer jammed it and kicked it out so hard the door flew open.  In the process the filament inside unraveled.  So I tried going back to open source filament, and the printer smoothly loaded in the filament.... until it got to the nozzle.  The filament jammed and I heard all sorts of horrible grinding noises.  Long story short, I got the filament out of there.<br/><br/>So, I did the usual checks:  cleaned the build plate, leveled it, checked and verified the Z offset, cleared the filament tube, etc.  I manually fed some filament through the nozzle to check for clogs, and the filament flowed nicely.  I managed to load some filament and tried jogging the extruder, which worked fine, filament still flowed freely.  I started a simple print, and as soon as the nozzle began to move towards the build plate, I heard those grinding noises yet again!<br/><br/>Once again, I got the filament out of the tube, did my checks, and tried one more time.  As soon as the filament reached the heat sink of the nozzle, grinding noises........<br/><br/>So now I'm sitting here with a giant paperweight that makes horrible noises.  After going through Sindoh's automated contact system, I did some research and found that Sindoh's cassettes have a history of causing problems like this, and I've yet to hear back from Sindoh.  I feel really bitter when I look at the warning on the 3DWox's screen "using open source filament may damage the machine"  In my experience, Sindoh's own filament damages their machines!<br/><br/>I'm sorely disappointed, this printer ran flawlessly and brilliantly for the first couple months I had it, and now it's just taken a crap on me.  If I could send this thing back to Amazon and get my hefty chunk of money back, I would.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I reached out to Amazon for help through their "Get help from an expert" service, and explained in brief what I've discussed in my review.  Much to my pleasant surprise, the representative was able to process a return and refund my money.  Sindoh finally replied back to me the following day.<br/><br/>This printer really left a bitter impression.  It was so nice, so reliable, and while the camera wasn't super smooth, it fulfilled it's purpose:  To let me check on my prints without being in the room.  This was the first printer I trusted to let run overnight, and it did that reliably.  Then a sudden failure that, while small, rendered the printer useless.  Sindoh does have instructions on working on the nozzles, but I think this was a electronic failure which caused mechanical damage to the extruder.  I'm sure it could be repaired, but I'm willing to bet had I started pulling panels off of it, Sindoh would have voided my warranty.<br/><br/>I've said it many times before, and I say again resoundingly:  KUDOS TO AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!</span>
