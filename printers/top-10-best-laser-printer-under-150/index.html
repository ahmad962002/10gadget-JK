<span>I bought this printer 3.5 years ago after nonstop issues with our inkjet. We didn't need anything fancy, but for the occasional form, or return label, or school assignment, we needed SOMETHING that would print when we asked it to, without telling me to update the drivers or replace the Cyan ink.<br/><br/>3.5 years later, I think we have replaced the toner once, the printer has jammed less than 10x, and it has never once asked me to update a driver. I press print... and it prints. Five stars.</span>

<span>First, I have purchased 3 of these printers:<br/>- One for child in college.<br/>- One for my home office (use it for PCs, Macs, iPhones, iPads)<br/>- One for some elderly relatives who had to futz with their old inkjet printer each time they used it (they're printing from PCs and iPhones).<br/><br/>We all love them. And let’s face it … 95% of what we print doesn't need to be in color. This printer is fast, prints duplex with ease and the ink cartridges last a long time and it doesn't get gummed up like ink jets do after a period of non-use.  It has saved us $$$ by not needing to purchase as many ink cartridges.<br/><br/>I’m only giving 4 stars since in the beginning I had issues with iOS devices not finding the printer. I’m not intimidated by any technology as I've been around it a long time - but this took a lot of digging to figure out. Now that I’ve finally got the iOS issue resolved these printers are perfect for our needs.<br/><br/>This is what I’ve done to make these printers work well with iOS devices:<br/>- First - Do Not use the WPS connection mode. Use a Printer USB cable connected to a computer to set up the wifi on this printer. Make sure you find your SSID and enter your wifi password.<br/>- Turn off Deep Sleep Mode (see the review by Winnie NG for instructions or other instructions for this printer)<br/>- Extend the sleep time (mine is at 50 minutes)<br/>- Set Auto Off at 1hr (not sure if this is needed but I suggest it anyway, it will not power off since it will be asleep before the hour comes up)<br/>- Once all this is done … power-down the machine and restart it.<br/><br/>The second reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that despite changing the printer's drum and following every set of instructions provided by Brother and others, the beast still says "The optical photoconductor needs to be replaced."  According to Brother a new drum replaces the optical photoconductor, therefore the photoconductor does not need replacing a second time and all Brother's instructions to turn off this incorrect error message fail.<br/><br/>****** Update *******<br/>I found that the printer sometimes goes away and is not discoverable by my Apple devices and the printer must be rebooted.  However there seems to be a fix for this as well. If you enable IPv6 Protocol on the printer it is always visible to my Apple devices.<br/><br/>Warning this is not for the faint of heart, but should be is easy enough for the average user.<br/><br/>Step 1)<br/>First you must find your printer's network IP Address. Do this by printing out the Printer's Network Configuration.<br/>On the Printer:<br/>Push the Up Key (+) until you see Machine Info. Displayed and Press OK<br/>Push the Up Key (+) until you see Print NetSettings and Press OK<br/>A Network Configuration Page will print. On this print out you will find the printer's IP Address. It should be something like this 10.0.0.XXX<br/><br/>Step 2)<br/>Open a Browser on your computer and input this URL: http://&lt;printer_IP_Address&gt;<br/>This will open up the web configuration interface<br/><br/>Follow this navigation to enable IPv6:<br/>Network Tab &gt; Protocol<br/>Click on the Advanced Settings link for AirPrint<br/>Click on IPv6 (Wireless)&gt;&gt;<br/>Select IPv6 as Enabled and make the selection to Enable this Address (no need to fill anything out) and click on the Submit button<br/><br/>The printer always shows up as an available device in all our Apple devices.<br/><br/>See https://www.amazon.com/Brother-Monochrome-HL-L2350DW-Two-Sided-Replenishment/product-reviews/B0763WDSYZ  for Winnie NG's instructions about sleep mode</span>

<span>I purchased this printer to replace my beloved 20 year old HP 4000N with a duplex attachment that I got at a garage sale for $25. I wanted lots of bells and whistles for not a lot of money and this printer seemed to fill the bill. I'm old school and would have been happy with a printer that hooked to my PC with an old fashioned printer cable rather than the wifi/ethernet only option but that doesn't seem to be a "thing" anymore. It printed the first day and then stopped with an error indicator. I had to jump through all kinds of hoops to get the thing to print including going in and doing a factory reset before it would let me proceed with the installation and complete it. Once it was done this printer is a dream. It is very fast and my prints looks great. I would buy this printer again, I just wish they made installation a little easier.</span>

<span>Price: I was little confused with various model extension dwe and dw and the ink subscription feature etc.. I could not understand why DW model is $100 more expensive. I bought DWE at $168 and only thing it requires is internet to operate because it works with HP smart app. I have no issue so this is perfectly fine for me.<br/><br/>Quality: the look, feel, size, sturdiness everything is better than I thought of. flatbed glass scan lid has the perfectly smooth surface so when you scan document you do not have to put plain white paper on top.<br/><br/>Setup/Use: note that it requires to download the HP Smart app to setup the printer. It took me total 5minuts to download the app, finish initial set up over the wifi and print fist test page from my phone as well as from the laptop. Scanning/Printing right from the phone is the feature I like most and it cannot be easier than this. App itself is well guided and great user interface. and yes, it does scan documents in color.<br/><br/>This model does not have any usb/memory card slot which is fine for me. everything you can do right from your phone.<br/><br/>Ink/Toner: Biggest criteria for me to buy laser printer was Ink/Toner cost. for inkjet printer most times I do not have enough usage and once the ink is opened in 4-5 month it will dry out even w/o much use. I will see how this laser toner works out and how long it lasts. I did not sign up for 6moth free ink program because I am not good at remembering and canceling such things. The price for the normal toner (134A ) is about $50 and $80 for high yield toner (134X) which is fine with me.<br/><br/>Warranty: 2 years of Manufactured Warranty. :)</span>

<span>I have owned just about every desktop printer manufacturer over the years. I have always liked HP printers- until now. This particular printer was a pain to setup. It REQUIRES you to use a wireless connection to set it up. The process was confusing and cumbersome. No longer just plug and play. Even after setting it up on my computer (mac), it required me to download an app to my phone to finish the setup. WOW!! The machine has a small control panel that is hard to navigate as well. I should have done better research before I purchased. I won't say don't buy, but if you do be prepared for a set up process that is not plug and play.</span>

<span>I loved this printer when I first bought it. But, in trying to register it kept saying they could not register it to me because<br/>It was already registered. Weird, but ok. I could still use it. I added new toner, HP and it printed a Lilly’s but has now stopped and say there is something wrong and it will not print until I get this fixed. It does nothing tell me what is wrong nor a number to call. I access the HP app and it just asks for the serial # and product #. When I put these in it says it’s wrong. I cannot get ahold of support through email, phone (waited 45 mins) the first time and it got stuck in a loop of that’s the wrong serial, provide a serial number. Drove me crazy.

<span>Not the easiest to setup like other instant ink printers since there’s no display screen.  Ink can be pricey, but the convenience of having it auto-shipped is great.  For simple Black &amp; White printing it does the job.  Not that easy to setup wirelessly.</span>

<span>I needed a laser printer that would handle large documents, print on both sides, and be easy to transport in the car. It gets five stars for all that. However, the instructions assume too much intuitive knowledge of the part of the user and technical support is hard to come by. My son set up the wireless at my home, but when I had to use it 1200 miles away I did not know what I had to do to get it to print. It turns out I needed a USB connector, but I did not know that and nothing like that came with the printer. Also, I didn't know enough to pay up for a model with a touch screen, which also provided some frustration. After trying without success to get help from HP, I finally called Amazon support and they got me a phone number to reach HP support. That's where I finally learned I needed to purchase the USB connector. There was no way I was going to change all the wireless settings I would need when I got home. I experienced a lot of angst before I got it up and running, but once I did it worked like a dream.</span>

<span>I bought this printer for home use, primarily for our son's homeworks, activity sheets, etc - which goes to say that we did not use it everyday and when we did, we probably printed 2 or 3 sheets. I threw the printer in trash after using it for 13 months because of HP's evil business plan. I am judging this wireless printer on these aspects - print quality, software, wireless and printing cost.<br/>This printing aspect of the printer is OK. It does as well as any laserjet printer would do. For what I used this printer, I wasn't looking for business quality print anyway.<br/>The wireless aspect is terrible. The printer will not want to connect to wifi and when it does, you will find it offline everytime you want to print something. Which means that you will have to walk to the printer to wake it up, wait for that to happen, then print.<br/>For the software, the app that HP will make you install is for 1 purpose only. To push you to purchase more cartridges, paper, etc from HP. This app was not designed to enhance the printing experience in anyway. In addition, HP will push you to create an account so that they can monitor your usage and push more products.<br/>As if this were not enough to make money, HP has an evil business model. Regardless of how much life is left in your cartridge, the firmware in the printer will refuse to print once you have printed so many sheets. IT IS ACTUALLY BASED ON THE COUNT OF THE PRINTED SHEETS. Please save yourself some heartache and stay away from HP printers. I just upgraded to Epson EcoTank (color inkjet) which gives you complete control of the ink.</span>

<span>After years of dealing with an all-in-one inkjet printer I finally got my wife a stand alone photo printer.  This left me with the inkjet to do all of my reports from the home office.  It soon became aware that this was not cost effective at all for just black and white printing so I purchased this Canon.  I have been a fan of their printers for years due to the quality, price and support so I had high hopes for this.<br/><br/>I have had it for about a month now and it has functioned flawlessly.  The print quality is great (you may have to darken the default setting like I did), not to mention fast.  It can hold a lot of paper reducing reload times and it has a minimal footprint which helps in small places.<br/><br/>Overall I appreciate the quality of the unit and its printing and look forward to using it for years to come.</span>

I was looking for something to keep in my workshop for printing things like wiring diagrams and patterns and things like that.  This is something that is infrequently used but I need it to be convenient.  The wireless connectivity works fine so I can keep the printer in the office area away from the sawdust and metal shavings.  It lacks the ability to scan or photocopy and it's monochrome.

First one died a horrible death by sucking in a zip-lock bag into the infuser when printing.  It was a few years old and when I looked around this summer after it succumbed I could not find a smaller one to replace it with.  One thing of note, is the new versions say the Serial number is the password for web access to the printer.  After being on the call for an hour with their support folks.  I tried it without the Alpha character and finally got in.  In every document it says it must include the alpha characters, and so did the support tech.  They were incorrect.  Hopefully they will fix that in the documents and tell all their support techs.<br/><br/>Cons:  The lid on the top needs to go so it can fit in shorter height cabinets.<br/>  The paper tray needs a cover, so things cannot be sucked in and kill the printer</span>

<span>I've researched this purchase carefully. I don't need color, I print and copy only occasionally and don't want ink cartridges that dry out. It was a simple decision to get a "home-office, all-in-one" laser printer. The HP Laserjet MFP M140we is the sweet spot for price/performance/features/size/convenience in this category.<br/><br/>I studied the "HP Smart" registration and installation process when analyzing this selection. It is somewhat intrusive, but comprehensive (be careful of what you sign up for - there's lots of fine print). This is where some reviewers get hung up. That said;<br/><br/>The MFP M140we was installed by carefully following the instructions in the HP Smart program. I had to jump through a few hoops to install HP software on each device I wanted to print from. It takes an hour, or more, to set up completely if all goes well. But now I have a nice printer that is compct, economical and performs well.<br/><br/>Text quality is typical 600dpi (it looks great). Photos are rendered in very fine grayscale gradients. You will find a little graininess in some near-white areas (snow). But the detail is very good.<br/><br/>If this is reliable for the next few years, I'd give the printer 5 stars for price/performance. The HP registration/installation process, I rate 3 stars. Bottom line: 4 stars.<br/><br/>If you don't mind diving into a complex registration and installation process, the HP Laserjet MFP M140we is a great home printing resource.<br/><br/>Updated:<br/><br/>After a week with this printer I have some concerns.<br/><br/>When printing from an Android tablet or phone, the page layout may not be correct. Part of the first page may get appended to the bottom of the last page when printing from some muli-page emails or .PDF files.<br/><br/>When printing from an Android device, the HP M140we printer is listed four times. All but the top selection is "not available at this time".<br/><br/>When printing from a multi-page .PDF file from an Android app and selecting just one, or a few pages to print, all pages are printed instead.<br/><br/>After installing the "HP printing service" on a Windows 11 PC, I've seen the screen display of GoogleMail show page layout source code instead of the correctly formatted display.<br/><br/>Printing from MS office, Google Photos or Adobe Acrobat has been fine from both a PC and Android.<br/><br/>Whether these problems are operating system errors or it's the HP printing service, is unknown. But, the bottom line is:<br/>The HP printer interface is not robust. Cannon, Epson and Brother print systems have not performed as poorly on these devices.<br/><br/>And, reporting these problems to HP has been prohibitive.</span>

<span>This LaserJet is a replacement for an OfficeJet I had for ten years that finally gave up the ghost. I went back to laser because I print like 1 thing a month and I've spent more time unclogging inkjets from disuse (because no one really needs a  printer or paper these days) than printing. Lasers are a safe bet because they don't clog up and ink doesn't dry out. So, it's perfect for my once-a-month printing needs.  Price is right for the most part.<br/><br/>For some reason, buying printers today is as fun as an all-day trip to the DMV. It's a dying market but there is always a reason you need a printer (usually when dealing with some out-of-touch business owned by a Boomer), and man printer companies just hang on like Dracula at the blood bank with grift after grift. HP is probably the worst of the bunch. The HP Smart App is a horrifying joke. HP Smart Ink is just a desperate cash grab for a dead business (pay us a subscription for that antiquated thing you don't really want to own in the first place)... But HP still makes a quality Laser printer when you push past the BS.<br/><br/>If you just print a couple things a month for those people who call their grandkids because they can't figure email and you don't need color prints, this is probably a solid choice.</span>

<span>Overall the printer seems fine. However, it was problematic setting it up.  If you go the Canon site to download the printer driver Windows 11, there is no printer driver. Being a non-techie I did not even notice and just downloaded what they had listed, a program to use the scanner.  However, it would never find the scanner because the driver was not installed.  I eventually figured out that I could download the printer driver for Windows 10 - but it seems like Canon should have made it a lot easier.<br/>In addition, the scanner seems to scan pretty light. I have tried to adjust settings but it still scans lighter than my past scanners.</span>

<span>Update 06-3-2017<br/>Since I have been experiencing so many problems with this printer, I bought a new printer which is working dramatically better than this one. Here is the link...</span>
<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/HP-LaserJet-Pro-M402dn-Monochrome-Printer-C5F94A/dp/B013SKIBL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HP LaserJet Pro M402dn Monochrome Printer, (C5F94A)</a>
<span><br/><br/>I originally had problems with Duplex Mode Issue, however once setup properly, the Duplex Mode worked for 8.5 x 11 size sheets. Smaller sizes will not work in Duplex Mode and it jams or fails to feed properly. The problem with Duplex Mode, has to do with the instructions sent to the printer. If you are printing from Microsoft Word, or Adobe PDF, or using Foxit, they give you an option for printing a booklet, or printing 2 or more pages on each side of the sheet. So as an example, if we were to try to print 2 pages on the front, and 2 pages on the back, then two plus two equals four. Then you go into Properties for your Brother Printer, and set it up as 2-sided/Booklet and now instead of two plus two equals four, you get 8. You have told the printer to print two pages on each side of the paper two different times and it thinks you want it to print 4 on each side. To make matters worse, there are 4 options as follows:<br/>1-Long Edge (Top)<br/>2-Long Edge (Bottom)<br/>3-Short Edge (Right)<br/>4-Short Edge (Left)<br/>None of these apply when doing multiple pages per sheet, so that was my mistake, and not the Printers fault. I was setting the wrong parameter. Once you know the correct parameter, it's very easy. Remember these parameters if it is printing upside down, because in that case it becomes relevant. So how did I fix the setup problem? Here is the answer.<br/><br/>-----------------------HERE IS HOW ITS DONE - For 2-pages on each side of paper---------------------------<br/>Set it for Single Pages in whatever program you are using, and then go into Brother Printing Preferences and set it for--- 2-sided/Booklet---Left Binding---All Pages as Once---<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>THAT'S IT - VERY EASY!!! Once you know how to do it.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>If you don't want to use Duplex Mode, you could remove the stack of sheets from the top, flip it over, turn it around, and put them back inside the tray, and then print the other side, however that sort of defeats the purpose behind buying a Duplex Printer. If you set it wrong, you will get Page 1 on Front and Page 3 on back, and one side will be upside-down.<br/><br/>Toner Save Mode, and Reduce Paper Curl, are excellent features which work extremely well. I'm impressed by this aspect of the features. If you use cheap 20-lb paper it curls, and then you set the feature, and it fixes the problem like magic. However be aware it introduces a problem with Card Stock, so if you are printing a cover for a booklet, it will fail to fuse the toner properly, but no big deal, this one is easy to remember, and switch back and forth from. Toner Save Mode is a very valuable feature because with cheap paper some of the printing will show through, and by reducing the amount of toner applied to the paper, it helps a great deal, and is a great feature.<br/><br/>First page prints in less than 85 seconds, according to web site, however, that's way too long to wait. It has a Problem with memory, with only 8 MB onboard memory, and with graphics, it only prints 1 or 2 sheets at a time and stops, sometimes it prints 3 sheets and then it stops. Then it makes you wait a second or several seconds and starts up again. This is infuriating to see it constantly stopping and starting. The spool inside the software setting does absolutely nothing. On my HP Printer I could spool the print jobs and have dramatic performance increases, but not with this printer. The feature seems to be disabled and is completely useless. I looked into buying more memory for this printer, and that is not an option for this printer, so you are stock with that very limited 8MB of onboard memory. But wait, it gets worse. This problem became painfully apparent with 300 dpi resolution. When I set it to 600 dpi and 1200 dpi, the performance was ridiculously slow, almost unusable. If you are printing a booklet, you could go to lunch, and come back, and when I did this, something hung up, and I had to start all over, Totally useless printer for any kind of heavy duty printing. It's just made for someone who prints a few sheets now and then, or you can print up to 50 pages with 300 dpi, but it is infuriating slow as you try to push this printer to do anymore than that. So I would print 50 pages at a time, duplex mode, and print the graphics separately, page by page using 600 dpi or 1200 dpi, and then assemble the booklet, one at a time, inserting the high resolution pages within the others, truly not the automated process I was looking for.<br/><br/>Problem with thick paper such as Card Stock. It keeps making messy printouts intermittently with card stock, and then when switching back to plain paper, it contaminates the clean paper with specks and dusting of residual toner. So instead of getting clean printouts, you have to waste a few sheets before it cleans up and prints normally again. Thick paper tends to skew, and I have thrown in the trash many unsuccessful attempts, till finally I got one that didn't have skewing and excessive toner dust all over it. The Drum is supposed to wipe clean the toner but fails to do what its supposed to do when you use Card Stock. It just wasn't made to handle the cover of a booklet.<br/><br/>A little bit of a problem with the manual feeder, obviously it is metric, and has slider to adjust for 8.5 x 11 paper, however it occasionally feed the paper at an angle and binds against the guide.<br/><br/>So far I am impressed with jam recovery. The designer of this product made it easy to clear paper jams and to recover from where you left off. I found this feature impressive. With my HP Printer the entire print job was out of order after the paper jam. With this printer, so far, each and every time it recovered without causing a secondary problem. That's a very good feature.</span>

The ink stays right where the pen leaves the ink without feathering or soaking through.  Yet the paper is absorbent enough that the ink dries quickly.  The paper is thick and opaque enough that writing on one side is not visible from the other side of the paper, so this paper can be written or printed on both sides.<br/>This paper is remarkably inexpensive for the quality at only four cents per sheet.<br/>This paper does not have cotton content and is not watermarked, but is non acidic and lignin free.</span>

<span>Bought this cartridge for a new Brother HL-2270DW.  In less than 2 or 3 hundred pages the toner light started flashing and the printer refused to print.  I did not believe that the cartridge could possibly be out of toner, so I searched the web and found the following instructions to reset the out of toner condition:<br/>===================<br/>- Open the front cover and leave open while completing the following steps.<br/>- Turn the printer off.<br/>- Hold the 'go' button (or "start' button) while turning the printer on. All panel lights should be on.<br/>- Release the 'go' button (or "start' button).<br/>- Press the 'go' button (or "start' button) 2 times.<br/>- Pause. All panel lights should be on.<br/>- Press the 'go' button (or "start' button) 5 times.<br/>The toner light should be off. (error may be flashing)<br/>The paper light should be on or flashing.<br/>- Close cover. The ready light should be the only light on.<br/>====================<br/>The printer functioned fine after the reset.  I have no idea how long the "fix" will last.<br/>A pox on companies  that build devices like this.<br/>====================<br/>ONE YEAR LATER April 16, 2013<br/>So I have had this printer for one year now and I must say, that except for the above problem, it has functioned flawlessly. In retrospect it has proved to be very cost effective and efficient.<br/>====================<br/>ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER February 9, 2014<br/>Many readers have suggested that I should reconsider the one star review.<br/>I appreciate their point, especially as I am coming up on two years of ownership and the printer is still performing well. (Subject to an occasional reset.)<br/>But I just can't get passed what I take to be intentional misinformation by Brother to their customers causing them to buy unneeded toner. That just seems dishonest to me. But I will say this, if I were in the market for a similar printer I believe that the HL-2270DW would be a good choice as long as one knew about the bogus out of toner problem.<br/>I have received feedback from many people who have saved a lot of money by extending the life of their toner cartridges. For that reason more than any other I believe I will let the review stand.<br/>====================<br/>ADDENDUM April 9, 2014<br/>Yesterday the printer decided that I should replace the drum. The drum light would flash and any attempt to print resulted in an error. The last prints looked excellent so I was not about to replace a good drum. I tried a drum reset but it did not work so I did a Brother HL-2270dw - Factory reset and now all is fine.<br/>This is how I did it:<br/>1. Turn off the printer.<br/>2. Hold the GO button while you turn the printer on. Hold the button until all the LEDs light up and the Ready LED light turns off.<br/>3. Release GO, all the LEDs will turn off.<br/>4. Press GO ten times. The printer will now restart.</span>

<span>I only use Brother cartridges in my Brother printers and copier and have had ZERO issues in doing so.  They may be a little more costly, but in the long run, I'm happy with no issues and no stress.  Longevity depends somewhat on your machine's Settings.  I set mine for a little lower quality to extend the life of the cartridge.</span>

<h3><h3>What's the best laser printer for the money?</h3></h3>
    

There is no one "best" laser printer for the money. Some factors to consider include price, features, print quality, and printer speed. Some popular laser printers include the HP LaserJet Pro, Brother HL-L2340DW, and Canon imageCLASS LBP252dw.
