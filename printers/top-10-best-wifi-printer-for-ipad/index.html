<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Went to set up the printer and was having a slight problem.  Sent support a question and they called me on a Saturday!  Great service and great printer.  This is my second Rollo printer.  Love them!</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>This printer prints high-quality on very thin and sticky labels that adhere to most services. However, it can be frustrating to print one label quickly. I almost always have to reset the printer once or even twice which means turning it off opening it up and waiting for it to reconnect vis wifi and having it reestablish the label size.  Once it is recalibrated it prints great.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Product works as advertised.  I also used Rollo labels with the printer.  The blue tooth feature works great, but definitely was a big price adder to get this option.</span>
</span></div></em></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><em><div class="a-row a-spacing-small review-data"><span class="a-size-base review-text review-text-content" data-hook="review-body">
<span>Not sure what I did before purchasing this great scale.  It’s so easy to print shipping labels without ink, super quick setup and printing.  Shipping was swift.</span>

<span>For the price, and for a home printer that’s occasionally used, it meets our needs. I got this printer a few weeks ago and it did take some time (an hour or so) to connect it to my laptop and cell phone (for the remote printing capabilities). I am not tech savvy, and I did get frustrated during the process. It also lures you in with “ink for 6 months!”…more like 1 month. I print the occasional paper for my kids school, a recipe here and there, and maybe a few sheets - it’s out of ink and I’d guess I’ve used 30 sheets. Definitely not 6 months worth, and definitely not if you’re using it as a primary printer. I’m disappointed because I think that was false advertising. For what I need it for, what it does and the cost, it’s fine for our home desk option. Don’t purchase if you’re using it for college kids who will need to print a lot, or for business/office use; you’ll run out of ink constantly. Let’s also mention the ink is $30…after 1 refill, I’m going to donate the printer and buy something else, or else I’ve spent more on ink refills than the device cost!</span>

<span>Very happy with this printer, it’s easy to connect to Wi-Fi, and in general works well, scanned document quality is good, easy to change ink cartridges, quiet printing and scanning, easy to restart printing if a piece of paper miss feeds<br/><br/>The only con is that the paper feed tray is hard to put paper in, you really have to be careful to get it lined up correctly.</span>

<span>This honestly has to be one of the best printers i’ve tested so far. Its fast and reliable. I was looking for a printer to use in my home office and came across this and gave it a try and honestly don’t regret my decision.

<span>I spent MONTHS reviewing budget printers for personal use at home.  I needed color, wanted something fairly small in size, didn't want to spend an arm and a leg, and wanted to keep ink replacement costs down as much as possible.  Just kept finding myself going back to HP, and finally settled on this one.  I found it pretty easy to set up.  Am using wifi to connect with printer in the same room, and so far no problems.  This was purchased just for home correspondence and color photos for making online sales.  For the price, it's pretty sturdy and I'm happy with the color quality.  The only thing I DON'T like is the fact that Hewlett Packard is now twisting the buyer's arms, restricting them from being able to use generic budget ink in HP printers, so that, over time, you're basically spending more to keep the printer going than you paid for the printer itself.  HP, SHAME ON YOU!!!</span>

<span>Bought this to replace an old Epson printer. Light weight. Small footprint. Installation through the HP Smart app was acceptable. Had to contact HP support for assistance.  There is very little documentation included with the unit.  Both color and black and white copy quality is good.  Wireless works very well once it is set up.  Scan quality is good with multiple options.  The scanner option is single page feed, but additional pages can be added through the app.  Both document and photo printed quality is good.  Print speed, however, is slower than it should be.  This unit is best for light personal use.  Would not recommend this unit for business use or heavy personal use. 1st set of inkjet cartridges through Instant Ink program arrived promptly.  Cost of the program and multiple options is a cost saver. This unit will serve my purposes very well. LCD panel informative and well designed.</span>

<span>Addendum 29 November 2020 (purchased in February 2020).  The first several months with this printer were serendipity, printed great, but I only needed it a couple times a month.  HP sent a spare set of ink cartridges early on as my first refill under its Instant Ink program.<br/><br/>Went to print after a couple months of non-use in October 2020, photo colors were washed out and striped, like the heads had lost all control (more on this in Addendum at bottom).  After several attempts to remedy it, printing test pages that all counted toward my Instant Ink quota, I gave up and installed the new ink cartridges, all was good again.  Now, a month after that, went to print a letter with photos, back to the same problem.<br/><br/>This printer unfortunately is no longer worth the pain and suffering to work through it.  It was great at first, but then it let me down, bigly.  My guess, someone who uses it regularly would have better results, as others reported the inkjet heads dry up if not used often.<br/><br/>And a word about the Instant Ink Program.  A reason for having this small compact printer is the ability to stow it away when not in use.  However, HP sent frequent reminders to plug it in and get it on line so it could report on the 0 pages it was printing.  I tried to do so for a day here and there to suit them, but the communications got more aggressive.  Plus...the program of free monthly quotas up to 15 pages now has a nominal charge.  And more, once I sent in the old inkjet cartridges I was hoping for HP to send replacements.  Did not happen, apparently I have to print their target threshold of pages, which isn't going to happen with bad printing issues.<br/><br/>Summing up, I had high hopes for this for my minimal use, but those hopes were for naught.<br/><br/>If you are a potential buyer, here's some longer term experience, but if you are a frequent user, I encourage you to read below at what I found out of the box after a couple weeks of use.  It's not all bad, just didn't work for me.<br/>-------------------<br/>My 8 year old HP OfficeJet 6700 finally gave up the fight —  would not load paper.  It was originally purchased to print from iPhones and iPads, but gave way to a mono LaserJet Pro M227fdw, which is a workhorse (if you want a reliable mid-level all-in-one).  Both excell(ed) at duplexing, which was a main requirement for my printing at the time each was purchased.  As I defaulted to the LaserJet, I used the 6700 for color printing only, which was done in spurts, probably not averaging more than 10 pages a month, plus expensive cartridge replacement.<br/><br/>Once I lost the color printer, I did an exhaustive, paralyzing search for a replacement, since the need was essentially just for simple color printing.  The DeskJet 3755 was attractive in compactness, style/color, and price, but came with so many negative comments on multiple facets and no duplexing.  Yet, no matter what I looked at in the less-than $200 variety, everything had similar faults, almost as if the same group of reviewers wrote the same reviews for every HP, Epson, Brother, and Canon printer out there.<br/><br/>I eventually decided a $50 cost was worth the risk, even with reported slow performance, scanning issues, connectivity issues, and an ink-guzzler.  I was also turned off by the reported “must provide credit card to set up” reports.  No, you don’t, I did without it.  But I later provided a credit card to join the HP Instant Ink program, which once you do the math, is a no-brainer at low volume…or actually any volume, with the flexibility to change or back out at any time.<br/><br/>After a week or so, I can report it is not slow (in general) at normal quality, and the print is crisp, even with photos embedded in documents.  Scans are crooked if you put them in loosely, as opposed to square against the right-side guide, and then the scan is as you would expect a proper scan to appear.  No, it doesn't have a flatbed to scan books, ID cards, etc.  I don’t care that you can only feed one page at at time, since I’m using my LaserJet for scanning.  If you are copying voluminous ledgers or reports, anything other than loose pages, don’t buy this all-in-one.  I have not and don’t intend to do color nor B&amp;W copying, so maybe folks are right that it’s not great on this printer, though with a little patience, it probably isn’t that bad as reported.<br/><br/>As for connectivity issues on initial setup, I was prepared for a mess, but was delighted by the simplicity, which I accomplished while on eternal hold with another company needing customer support; you could call it “distracted setup.”  Perhaps the confusion for some users comes in the variety of ways HP offers for setup…through a downloaded mobile platform app, direct cable, or internet connection to your main computer, in my case a Mac OS.  I opted for the mobile platform app.  It was not always intuitive, but with few little hiccups, it connected well.  I would offer to be sure your main computer downloads needed drivers, and once I did, I had no problems.  I didn’t realize that until I went to the downloaded app for my Mac, that drivers still needed to be loaded, which took less than 5 seconds to do.<br/><br/>For the record, those reporting they had to print 11 or more pages in setup...you pushed too many buttons that can give you status, etc, but really didn't need to be printed with setup.  With initial setup I only printed three pages, one being the print alignment tool, which was optional (it was pretty much okay without doing that).<br/><br/>I can only surmise that those reporting connection problems either had a network system that was tweaked for their purposes beyond normal configurations, leading to compatibility issues at first attempt to connect to this printer, or they possibly tried to mix steps of the options for setup if they encountered what might have seemed like non-response, in which case I discovered give it time.  There are occasional blank screens that don’t show loading/setup action, which was working in the background.  That’s one thing HP could fix.<br/><br/>What actually scared me were reviews of poorly printed text, photos, and the like.  As one or more reviewers have noted, that is likely a firmware problem. So upon initial setup I checked the firmware status and confirmed the latest was installed, likely when first connecting and registering.  And as mentioned, there are a couple tools in the app to help you fix that.  That said, there are no issues so far with print quality — text nor photos.  It is what I was expecting, and surprisingly, not much different from the good old OfficeJet 6700, Rest In Peace.<br/><br/>So I have a printer that I expect to meet my low-demand color print needs as well as ink resupply, that will hopefully be delivered without asking, just-in-time at low or no-cost.  I decided I really don’t need auto-duplexing, I can just turn the page over to print the flip side, and I love the compact size and color styling.  If it starts to let me down I will amend this review, but for now, 5-stars for a $50 unit, with pleasure!<br/><br/>Addendum October 18, 2020:  One thing another reviewer pointed out, that the inkjet heads dry out or clog up from dust over time, or a variation of that, just happened.  After 8 months of very low level use, I went to print a color photo that at first printed normally but too small, resized it, reprinted, and the colors where very much washed out, almost negative-looking.  Cartridge ink levels looked to be more than half on the HP app.  I did a couple routine troubleshooting attempts like reducing pixel count, realignment test, and the like, but no change.  I removed the inkjet cartridges, wiped the excess ink from them, and tried again, no change.  So I installed the new jets the HP program had sent upon signup and everything again worked fine.  I returned the old cartridges in the prepaid envelope from the ink program.  Hopefully HP will send replacements automatically as they did before.  But the foot-stomper here is use it more often than I have been and you should be A-OK.  Still 5-stars!</span>

<span>Installing this printer was a little glitchy. I first removed the packaging material and plugged into power. I installed and ran the full software, not the HP Smart thing. When I ran the installer I choose to setup via wireless, It did not find the printer. I figured, whatever, and connected my USB cable. After installing the printer software via USB, I was able to double check the manual from HPs website to locate the option to change wireless settings. Under Tools &gt; Device Setup &amp; Software &gt; Reconfigure Wireless Settings. I was easily able to switch from a USB connction to wireless. It did prompt to remove the USB cable after though. The biggest annoyance was me not paying attention to the pictures. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it only had the top paper feed tray instead of an actual hidden paper tray drawer. I had to tell myself it's a cheap printer. The main reason I purchased this printer was for the multi page scanning ability. My old HP Photosmart 6510 was only a single page scanner and took forever to scan a multi-page document, then the file size was enormous. For as much as I'll use this, I couldn't justify spending $250-500 on a nice full featured printer. It's a printer, it prints, it does what it's supposed to do.</span>

<span>When my HP 8610 died, I decided not to pay the $87 for a new print head. Afterall, for $12 more I could buy a new printer, right? Well, I bought the inexpensive HP 4100, and boy, do I miss my old printer. This new one just feels cheap. The plastic seems to be thinner. It doesn't have a paper tray but a slot, which on one hand you can see how much paper you have left, but then the paper gets dusty and has to be lined up in the slot. There's no memory card slot which was great for cameras and tablets but the instructions say it has a USB port for transferring info, not for installation. I came to the realization that I didn't need a fax machine; I don't have a land line, and who does. Scanning is just another word for printing unless you're making pdfs. So, I really didn't need a more advanced printer. This one will print my recipes and letters just fine. I have only printed one page and it was perfect. This little machine will suit me just fine. My only disappointment is that is doesn't have a sleep cycle. I left my old printer always turned on and it would cycle itself into a sleep mode. This one doesn't.  I'm anxious to see how long the ink lasts. I enrolled in the HP Smart Ink plan, six months free, and 99 cents a month for 10 pages. Would I buy this printer again? If I had the money, I'd have probably upgraded, but for the kind of printing I do, I just couldn't justify spending the extra bucks. And yes, I love HP printers because of the tech support and service. I've never owned a bad HP product.</span>

<span>You can scan and print with this and that's what you need so why pay more.  Also your printing cartridges are cheaper with this brand and you're able to get generics which makes it even cheaper so you get good to excellent printing excellent scanning and you also get good deals on printing cartridges.  So winning situation.</span>

I checked to make sure it was NEW and purchased it at that price. It arrived missing several packing safeguards, showing smudges and scuffs, and two opened and dirty ink cartridges. I could not connect it to my computer via Wi fi but that was most likely a computer issue.  Fortunately I had a USB cable (not included) and connected the printer directly to my system.

<span>You cant go wrong with Cannon, many say it is hard to set up, it was a breeze even connecting to wifi.  Many complain about the starter ink only able to print a few pages, so far, i've printed 8 Amazon return labels and a complete word document with the ink included and still more to spare.  Great bargain.  I've tried other brands in the past, but nothing compares to Cannon.  UPDATE  I've had it for over a month now.  I had to scan a photo and accidently printed it in full res blown up on 8 x 10 photo paper.  I've printed a 25 page document,  in addition to the things i mentioned above, I still have over 50% of the factory supplied INK.  Love  Cannon  UPDATE - Still using factory supplied ink  Well, its a few weeks later and am printing some photo's, I finally have to replace the ink, so all in all what I can say about the Cannon Printer  BUY IT!!!!</span>

<span>I wouldn't say set up was easy but it was doable. Android app (necessary to print) is not user friendly at all. No print quality (resolution) settings. Prints washed out right out of the box. Cleaned heads 2x, deep cleaned 2x - 2nd time after 24 hrs as instructed, replaced ink cartridges that came with the printer with brand new Canon cartridges and STILL get washed out prints. In the attached image the 4x6 was right out of the box &amp; the 8.5x11 is after all the above steps completed. Extremely disappointed. Today's Labor day so can't speak to a customer service rep until tomorrow. I'll update this review if &amp; when this gets resolved.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>Okay, returned 1st printer &amp; received replacement quickly (even before they received the 1st one back). Again the Canon print app is not user friendly for set-up. There is no "register product" or "set-up" option identified anywhere on the home screen.<br/>To register your printer:<br/>Tap the printer icon with the + in the upper left corner of the home screen then follow the instructions.<br/>To set-up the printer:<br/>Tap the printer icon at the bottom of the home screen then "check/change set-up." Follow instructions for "printer preparation" and then "network set-up."<br/>NOTE: I also found how to make the printer "identifiable" for setting up the network on the paper instructions included.<br/>Once you've done these steps the printer will remain connected even after turning it off and on again.<br/>At this point the actual printing process is a breeze. I've included an after photo of the same image.<br/>All said and done I gave 4 stars, it would have been 5 if the app was more user friendly.</span>

<span>I figured this inexpensive printer would be just good enough for a student, but it turned out to be better than my old Epson for general household use.  Crisp paper printouts (example below) and decent snapshots on photo paper when needed. Duplex, cop, scan, print, wireless or wired: everything I need in a compact printer, and at less than forty bucks a bargain (yeah, yeah, they always gouge you on the cost of replacement ink but I don't print that much so it's OK).<br/><br/>Setup was easy for me, but I can see where some low-tech folk might get frustrated because the instructions aren't particularly user-friendly.  All I did was plug it in, install the app on my iPad, click the "register printer" option from the app, follow those instructions. Our permanent setup is wireless with a variety of devices---Apple iPhones and iPads, Mac desktop, Windows laptops, Chromebook---and everyone can print with no problem. A cable for direct connection isn't included, so buy that if you foresee situations where wireless isn't an option. I have had past issues with connecting other brands of wireless printers, so I understand that some people might have problems with this one; I guess this time I got lucky with installation.<br/><br/>There are some minor annoyances. The paper tray isn't completely enclosed, it hangs out the front; dust-o-phobes I guess could load paper only when they are ready to print. There is no display screen for error messages, and no paper manual is included (you have to go online or through an app).  The power cord goes into a recessed area in the back and if it jiggles loose you can't really reach around blindly to get it back in. The printer makes a lot of weird noises, both before and after printing.<br/><br/>I haven't had any of the issues I read about in other reviews. No paper jams (although often I am printing single sheets or just a few). The printer appropriately "wakes up" when a job is sent. Black and color ink cartridge usage is better than my Epson (it had separate cartridges for every color).  Doesn't drop off my wireless home network constantly as other printers have. No major complaints (yet)!<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have knocked off another star simply because it is very aggravating to troubleshoot problems (low ink, no ink, wrong paper size, paper jam, wifi issues, etc.) when they do occur. Since there's no display screen on the printer itself, you have to rely on the app and the online manual to decipher the flashes/error---and the info there is very generic. Canon should have at least included a tiny display screen for numeric codes to show so you could easily look them up, or have the app check status and then specifically say what the problem is. For this reason, this "easy to use" printer isn't a good choice for people who want simple printing functionality.  Too bad, the printer has been great otherwise---nice crisp text and pictures, good color, decent ink usage.  I originally planned to send this printer to college with my kid, but now I'm keeping this one at home and researching other options (so I don't have to get late-night tech support calls!).</span>

<span>Had a Canon printer before this one and was happy. This one seems good so far too. The one call out, similar to other reviews, is that connecting to wifi was not straightforward. My Mac Air and my iPhone would not pick up the printer. Here's what I found 1) make sure you connect to 2.4 GHz wifi, not 5G. 2) press and hold the wifi button until the power light flashes, then hit the Color button, then hit the wifi button again. After figuring that out setup was easy.</span>

<span>It would’ve saved me a great deal of time to pair my iPad with the printer using the router connection (not direct connect), if directions EXPRESSLY stated that the printer uses only the 2.4ghz band.

Once paired and set up, I restored the 5ghz option on the router<br/><br/>Canon iOS app is excellent, though I had problem signing in to the admin interface using iPad with iOS version 15.6.1.<br/><br/>Ok button did not work after entering the admin password. Worked OK on my iPhone and another iPad with iOS 15.4.<br/><br/>Once configured well, you will be amazed at what it can do for such a small price.

<span>I have been using Cannon Pixma portable printers for the past 15 years, and wanted to get a smaller design, with a built in battery.  The Epson Workforce WF-110 fit my needs to the tee.  I purchased the unit on June 1, and have now owned and operated the machine for 45 days.  Based on this usage, it is strikingly clear that the operating expenses for this machine is much more than what I had with my Pixma printers.<br/><br/>1- Even when printing at the lowest draft quality, the ink cartridges do not last as long, and I am having to change cartridges about 50% more frequently than with Pixma.  It used to take me about 6 weeks of use before I had to replace my Pixma cartridges.  These cartridges last only about 4 weeks at the same level of use as when I used the Pixma.  For the Epson Workforce, it costs about $40 for a combo pack of a single black ink cartridge and single color cartridge, while for the Pixma it costs about $41 for a combo back of 2 black ink cartridges and 1 color cartridge.  So not only do the Pixma catriges last longer, they are cheaper, considering the two black cartridges.  My rough estimate is that my ink costs have gone up by about $20 a month, for an annualized increase of $240.<br/><br/>2) An annoying feature of the Workforce is that when the low ink notification goes off, its prevents the printer from printing.  With my previous Cannon Pixma, the low ink notification could be overridden, and thus I was able to override the notification, and continue printing until the cartridge was actually empty.  Since I cannot override the Epson low ink notification, I am being forced to change the cartridges even when the print quality is not suffering due to low ink.<br/><br/>3- The Epson also frequently generates lines in the printed document.  This requires printer head cleanings, which means that I will have to reprint the effected pages, which of course wastes ink.  Also, even when the low ink notice has not appeared, but the ink level graphic indicator shows low, print head cleaning is not allowed, and requires a replacement of the ink cartridges before the printer head cleaning can be done.  It appears to me that the frequent print head cleaning wastes precious ink, further accelerating ink use.<br/><br/>4- The Epson Workforce 110 features a removable "maintenance box."  This appears to capture excess ink.  When the box is full, it needs to be replaced.  The cost of the box is about $12 after sales tax.  Under my use, the box fills up after about 4 weeks.  Extrapolating over the year, this comes to an additional operating cost of $144.  The pixma does have a system to capture excess ink, but under my use, it takes about 4 years for this to fill up.<br/><br/>If I knew back in June what I know today, I would NOT have purchased this Epson Workforce WF 110 printer, as my operating costs are about about $380 more a year than when using Pixma.  Given that the printer itself cost $350 after tax, the extra operating cost is more than the cost of the printer.  It is now past the return date for this printer, and I am now stuck paying for overpriced ink.  To add insult to injury, it appears to me that the printer is either poorly designed to allow optimal ink usage, or purposely designed to maximize ink cartridge sales, with the added benefit of maximizing sales of maintenance boxes.</span>

I checked toner refills pricing, and those were also reasonable as long as you avoided OEM.<br/>I found these printers had more value than a cheap inkjet because print quality is much better than any inkjet out there in this (or any) price range, and refills are cheaper than inkjet refills, even non-OEM.<br/>These printers do support Airprint and other wireless printing, but I recommended against that to my kids to avoid getting spam prints, or possibly inappropriate things from other students as a prank.<br/>The USB cable is included and is plenty long to plug a laptop in for a few minutes to print an assignment.<br/>My third (who is a few years away from college) will get one of these too, if they're still available then.</span>

<span>There is a lot of belly-aching in product ratings feedback by Mac users who’ve forgotten how to install drivers. On my Macs, I found the video tutorial on the Canon site, downloaded drivers, installed them, selected printer in Settings and I’m successfully printing on the cheap over Wi-Fi. Don’t listen to the complainers saying this printer doesn’t work on Macs. It does 100%.</span>

<span>This is does not install the drivers automatically. The installation does not go smoothly. The disk is almost useless.</span>

<span>Not as sturdy as the Canon it replaced but does the job. Only two ink cartridges vs the 5 in my prior printer, time will tell how they hold up.  Only negative so far is the paper tray is flimsy and prints will end up on the floor if not fully extended.</span>

<span>I switched from HP to Canon. This printer prints well and offers affordable subscription plans. It is very easy to set up if you follow the instructions in the box and on the screen. I like the fact that it has wireless connection. The printer prints fast but 'moves'. The quality of the photos is excellent. It prints well on papers as well, but depending on the picture quality or paper quality, it sometimes prints papers as bluish with gray. As a student, I use it mostly for printing research papers.</span>

<span>I needed a small printer, and this one is perfect. The set-up was pretty simple, and we printed from laptops and phones. I am still trying to figure out how to scan to the computer. I tried a couple of times, but it wouldn't work. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.</span>

<span>This did a very nice job printing 8x11 photos but it did use a lot of color ink.  Since there are only 2 ink cartridges, black and color, I will need a new color cartridge soon after printing 15 pictures which makes the cost about $2.00 each. It is quiet. I don't like the paper holder (I feel like I am going to break it whenever I close the drawer) or the eject area. Awkward design.  I have only had this a few weeks but so far so good.</span>
