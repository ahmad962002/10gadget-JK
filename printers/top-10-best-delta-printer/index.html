The Mini Delta V2 is an update of the bestselling Mini Delta 3D Printer from Monoprice™, the world's best selling brand in 3D printing. We've gathered customer suggestions and feedback since the original Mini Delta's release and are proud to offer a printer designed with those customers in mind. The adaptive touchscreen makes it easier to navigate through the updated and simplified user interface. The updated auto leveling system makes starting a print much faster and simpler. The Wi‑Fi® setup is now just as simple as the rest of the printer. Thanks to quieter driver motors, the Mini Delta V2 operates at a whisper quiet 30dBA. Use the on‑screen prompts and the PoloPrint Pro Wi‑Fi app to get started printing over Wi‑Fi in no time. The Mini Delta V2 still boasts the features that experienced users are comfortable with, while making them accessible to new users. USB Connections make for stable and fast prints, while slicing can be done using Cura or many other open source slicing software packages. The small and compact size of the Mini Delta V2, along with it's high‑level functionality and solid build quality, make it the perfect companion printer to larger and bulkier 3D printers.

<span> This is going to be a long one.<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>This printer comes in an ok box, with minimal protection. The box arrived damaged, so I was worried that the printer wouldn’t work. The printer was wrapped in bubble wrap, and came out of the box assembled. It includes an SD card, micro USB cable, (awful!) 3D printed spatula, and some Allen keys. Keep in mind that this printer doesn’t come with any filament, so make sure to buy a spool at time of purchase.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Setup was easy. All you had to do was remove some packaging, attach the spool holder, and plug it in. The instructions weren’t the best, but they gave some general tips. You loaded the filament, and pressed a button. The printer would then automatically print a test file. While you do that, you install the latest version of Cura, and import the profiles for the printer. It really wasn’t that hard. From there it gets more complicated. The bed is self leveled, but you need to change the offset values in the firmware (reasonably easy) to test and get it just right. I would definitely say that this printer is not as beginner friendly as it suggests.<br/><br/>Design:<br/>This printer is well designed, and made out of aluminum. It is lightweight, but it is pretty sturdy. The interface is a full color screen, and 3 buttons. Don’t be fooled, it IS NOT a touchscreen. It looks so much like one that I kept pressing it expecting it to work. The buttons are a bit clumsy. The printer uses a build-tak like surface, but you may still need to use some glue to make prints adhere. The print head uses a Bowden setup, which is ok, and works pretty well. So far, I have no had any jams with this printer.<br/><br/>Overall Review:<br/>This printer is NOT very beginner friendly. Sure, it was so easy to setup, but dialing in settings and firmware issues are a hard sell for an absolute beginner. There is an amazing wiki and I would suggest you look there for any problems. There is also a thingiverse collection with upgrades. The print quality blew me away for the price of this machine. It is on par with even an Ultimaker, a $2000+ machine. There were some hiccups in getting the bed level right, and it sometimes has glitches and jams the print head into the build plate. The main upgrade I did was replacing the bed with a piece of glass for better first layers. Again, the Wiki was an excellent help for this. As you can see but the pictures, I got some amazing prints with this machine. I was overall very impressed by this machine, especially for its price. It has features usually on found on $1000+ machines. I have to appreciate all the work that has gone into this machine. I would recommend this printer for anyone, but if you’re an absolute beginner you may find it tedious/time consuming to get this completely up and running.</span>

<span>I bought this with my eyes wide open. Learning 3D printing from 3D parametric design to meshed .stl file to slicer programs with final g-code files to a printer has helped with my appreciation for this little machine. I originally purchased it to print with ABS because the sides are so easily enclosed. I used some pieces of plexiglass with velcro straps around the machine, to enclose the print space. I found it works well with small prints, but prints that use the entire build volume cause the extruder's mounting hardware to bash against the plexiglass. This wouldn't be a problem with a domed cover. I haven't yet broke out the heat gun to make that happen.<br/>With a build volume about that of a large coffee cup this machine is limited, but with 1/2 of infinite possibilities it still has infinite possibilities.<br/><br/>P.S. The bed doesn't get quite hot enough for ABS so you'll want to use a good layer of glue stick. It helps with PLA as well.</span>

<span>While 3D printing isn't exactly new to me, this was my first 3D printer. The initial setup wasn't too hard and the sample prints came out perfectly with some minor difficulties (one of the barriers folded over somehow and kept getting caught in one of the belts so I basically had to remove it). The issues started when I started using ABS filament. I came in knowing that the printer as-is wasn't exactly the best at printing with ABS so I had to fiddle with the settings a bit: I found that the bed only heats up to 79 degrees (anything higher and the printer freezes after a while). If I tried printing at the highest temperature for both the bed and the nozzle, then the printer would basically crash and restart (which makes sense since the stock power supply is apparently notorious for not being powerful enough or something). If a print was finished or canceled and I went back to print something else, all of the files on the SD card would disappear until I restarted the printer, which meant I couldn't exactly do back-to-back printing.<br/><br/>I accidentally deleted the delta-specific software from the SD card so I had to search around a bit before realizing the SD card's contents could be found on the website. This may have been obvious. It still would have been nice if the manual mentioned that the SD card's contents could be found on the purchase page, especially because I didn't purchase the printer from that page.<br/><br/>After some more fiddling, I finally managed to come up with settings I could use for decent ABS printing... but then my printer crashed after I cancelled a test print. Now, whenever I turn the printer on, the logo shows up but the menu never actually appears; the screen basically freezes on the logo. I figured it was because of all of the canceled prints or crashes. It's also possible that the firmware didn't update properly: I updated it to the most recent version during the initial setup but the printer kept telling me there was a new update. However, whenever I went to update from the menu, it would give me an error of some sort and wouldn't let me update again until sometime later. This cycle would continue.<br/><br/>Doing research on this thing was near impossible since there's little to no information on this specific printer. I thought about replacing the mainboard until I found out that it wasn't sold anywhere. Apparently, it's better to just replace the entire printer. I'm not entirely sure how that works since I've never had to replace a product I've purchased before, so I hope I don't have to spend another $200 or so on a new printer. In either case, I should probably contact the company first before doing anything more. If all else fails, I'll just switch to Ender or something. I'd rather not considering how much time and effort I put into this particular printer.<br/><br/>I'm a little disappointed in how this turned out. It started out promising but basically fell apart once I started using ABS. It's likely that I wouldn't have had any issues if I stuck to using PLA but that's not what I bought this for.</span>

<span>Loved the price and the quality of construction, and if I can figure out a repeatable procedure for leveling the bed, I expect I will get awesome prints. I got spoiled by my mini.

<span>1st one I got had a wobbly bed, and no matter what I did to the eccentric nuts it would not tighten. Then the replacement I received had a huge hole in the box and also looked like it was re-taped on one side. additionally the garbage sample filament was missing( not that I care) AND the screen was missing as well. So I took the screen from my first one and put it on the second but if it was my first I imagine I would of been extremely annoyed.  To be fair this is prolly not the fault of Mono price and more Amazon. as both boxes I received were pretty banged up. both with openings that could allow parts to fall out. the 1st one I was merely lucky I suspect, as there was loose parts inside it. I also suspect both were refurbished and not new. as there were scuffs and dings on both. The second bed also has marginal amounts of wobble, I can prolly take care of I just not have done it yet. The y axis endstop needed to be modified as well to actually touch the bed and thus trigger the end, first home it just crashed into the back and ground the belt. I do like the magnetic hotend as it will make it really easy to maintain and repair in the future. The spool holder is ok, prolly on the better side. The menu is a bit bare, and minimal. The extruder should be metal tho for an originally 400+ printer that's pretty inexcusable.  For what I payed 190, I think its a very good printer for the price, but if I payed full price for this, I would be very upset to say the least.</span>

<span>Typically have never had issues with Monoprice products.

I was very careful seeing that I am new to 3D printing.<br/><br/>I purchased 2 spools of Hatchbox PLA 1.75 filament, 1 red and 1 orange.<br/><br/>I went through the auto leveling with no issues and preheated for the filament insertion and everything went smooth. I start the test print on the SD card provided (16BG) and I am only having 1 issue, from time to time I get an "Out of Filament" error but there is plenty of filament. I don't know if it is the color, bad sensor or something else but if it continues I will be contacting support.<br/><br/>Other than that, everything has been pretty smooth.

<span>This was my 4th Monoprice printer (Maker Select V2, MP Mini V2, Mini Delta, then this) and I've been happy with the preceding ones and was pretty darn happy with this...<br/><br/>....until I needed help with a hardware problem.<br/><br/>The proximity sensor failed (that's used for auto-leveling) so I mailed the tech@monoprice.com address the manual tells you to with the details of what happened (including the diagnostics I did).  No response.  I filled out their support form on monoprice.com and...  no answer.  I filled out a customer service request on the site asking for help...  nothing.  I even tweeted to them and again, radio silence.<br/><br/>My printer has been down for a month and a half and I finally just ordered a replacement sensor out of my own pocket from another site.  I'm HOPING it's the right sensor (it looks right, it's on the Malyan Mini Select V3) so fingers super crossed) and now I'm out about $16 for a part that should have been provided under warranty because Monoprice.com technical support ghosted me.<br/><br/>I like the printer, the part that broke could have broken on anything. but the way they treated me afterwards makes it so I can't recommend this otherwise fine printer.  The hardware is only part of the purchase, we're also buying some assurance that they don't seem to offer.<br/><br/>UPDATE: After two months, I got ahold of someone through their live chat (no luck through the recommended 'correct' channels) who was able to help.<br/><br/>The Good: They also determined that it was a faulty sensor and I had a working printer a week later.<br/><br/>The Bad: They did not stock the sensor so I had to figure out a way to box up my whole printer.  I had lost the box in the months so I did my best to safely get it to them in a monitor box with a bunch of packing stuff, I hope all was well.<br/><br/>I think there's much to be said about having a sufficient stock of replacement parts to be able to avoid the requirement to ship an entire unwieldy printer in for an inexpensive sensor that could be replaced easily with a screwdriver, but I am satisfied that Monoprice did meet their obligation to make things right once I reached a human.  The printer is working great again and I think it's a good deal overall.</span>

<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>Not worth it.<br/><br/>(Not one for reviews but...) Quick overview:<br/><br/>• Hypothesis: HP Printer is only able to be “installed” on (1) device, Customers are unable to adjust wi-fi passwords/or providers, and potential un-successful client services offerings and spam risk.<br/>o HP “Customer Support” OR “Home Support” is located within various regions.

Packages are presented with various price ranges to the customer - boiling down to a per ink cartridge and anticipated number allotment of the number of pages being published by the owner, every month.<br/><br/>For the first 1-2 months, hadn’t experienced anything alarming. However, had unexpected technical challenges which shortly developed upon updating the Wi-Fi password.<br/><br/>– Out of security purposes, it is recommended in general to update passwords and login information ~ about every 90ish days. -<br/><br/>When attempting to re-connecting to the Wi-Fi, customers immediately might experience unanswered questions; “bot-chats” that provide additional links to articles within the website that do not directly answer the question originally situation; and when finally getting in touch with “HP Support” (via phone call) are then confronted with irrelevant questions - unrelated to the product malfunctions - and then are continued to be ridiculed with various recommendations of “security systems” packages. Whether this is purchased or not, they have “control” or “access” to the computer.

Highly would recommend considering alternative replacements for the Product, Engineering, and Human Resources departments to be able to hold the brand standards and values we have all longed for when purchasing a product, especially one so accredited as such.<br/><br/>Additionally, if the machine is unable to correspond with basic security policies and password updates - the potential buyer and customer need to be made aware of this within the original description before moving forward with payment and further “challenges”.<br/><br/>Best of luck.</span>

<span>My HP 3 in 1 printer that I bought a long time ago finally died. So first and foremost HP products are awesome. The printer I had before which had the copy and the scanner I actually bought it at Costco and I'm going to say I had that machine for 10 years.<br/><br/>So when that one died I saw this one on Amazon and noticed the price had come down and I had to have something so low and behold I bought it. It's a nice little machine they have a program where you can buy ink for the machine at a discount rate if you join this club thing I think it's for 6 months. For me it just really wasn't worth it I would just rather buy the ink on my own. But it may work for you. I like to get the remanufacturing. And there's a couple of places that I buy it through online. I actually haven't checked here on Amazon but I will do that.<br/><br/>The scanning feature works perfectly I have no complaints. The copy feature works like a charm! And it folds up nice and neat. You pull out a little flap and it has a paper guide from when your item is done printing or copying and then it folds nicely back up. She don't have any flap sticking out that will break or anything like that it's nice it's perfect compact I love it. Also the other thing that I like about this machine is that instead of the paper being fed from the front there's actually a paper guide so you can only put in so many sheets of paper which prevents it from getting stuck into the roller. So if anyone has any doubts I would say go ahead and get this it comes quickly it's pretty easy to figure out. I highly recommend this.</span>

<span>For the price, and for a home printer that’s occasionally used, it meets our needs. I got this printer a few weeks ago and it did take some time (an hour or so) to connect it to my laptop and cell phone (for the remote printing capabilities). I am not tech savvy, and I did get frustrated during the process. It also lures you in with “ink for 6 months!”…more like 1 month. I print the occasional paper for my kids school, a recipe here and there, and maybe a few sheets - it’s out of ink and I’d guess I’ve used 30 sheets. Definitely not 6 months worth, and definitely not if you’re using it as a primary printer. I’m disappointed because I think that was false advertising. For what I need it for, what it does and the cost, it’s fine for our home desk option. Don’t purchase if you’re using it for college kids who will need to print a lot, or for business/office use; you’ll run out of ink constantly. Let’s also mention the ink is $30…after 1 refill, I’m going to donate the printer and buy something else, or else I’ve spent more on ink refills than the device cost!</span>

<span>Let's start this by saying I am not new to 3D printing. I have a Kossel Delta and a Prusa i3 clone, and I have printing for about three years. Our nine year old daughter wanted her own and saved up enough to get a budget printer. After two months of research, I chose this one for her and she approved. She was more excited to open this printer up than to open present on any prior Christmas. Onto the product itself.<br/><br/>The printer comes *almost* full assembled. You have to put the spool holder on yourself. It was difficult to do (not). This printer is solid. It is made from heavy steel that does not want to flex, and the build quality is solid. The bed comes with a BuildTak like sticker already on it, and has gripped the prints very well. There was a .gcode file on the SD card to get you started, and ended up being a Chinese Lucky Cat. It printed amazingly well. The layer height looked to be set to 0.1mm, and the surface was so smooth that sanding would have done little to improve the finish.<br/><br/>There were no zits, minimal missed layers (I've seen a $27k printer have more than this one), and no easily visible sign of where the layer change occurred.<br/><br/>I am quite jealous of my daughter for this printer, and I am now looking at one, but my other half is saying no, three printers are enough (I have a CR-10S on the way) and I cannot buy anymore. Darn.<br/><br/>I do wish it came with more info on what Cura settings to use. We're trying to print a butterfly, and are dealing with all the normal issues that have to be ironed out in the settings. I am trying to solve the stringing issue. That happens with every printer until you dial in the settings. When I do, I'll try to post them here.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Stringing is only on the raft now, which I don't care about. Otherwise, this prints like a dream. I really wish the Mrs. would let me buy my own, but she still maintains three printers are enough for me for now. :-) Our daughter has been printing off glow in the dark butterfly wall decorations to give to her five year old cousin for Christmas, and they have turned out great. The only issues with the prints are due to the model geometry being affected by scaling it to 78% of original size. My printers would produce the same gaps.<br/><br/>To load the settings the factory used for the included cat model, open Cura 15.04.6 (included on the SD card) and go to File &gt; Load Profile from GCode and then select the cat.gcode file on the SD card. This will load the factory print settings.<br/><br/>Layer height. 0.2<br/>Shell thickness: 1.2<br/>Bottom/top thickness: 0.6<br/>Fill: 20%<br/>Print speed: 40mm/s<br/>Print temp: 195 (this varies based on what brand and style PLA. Typically between 190-210)<br/>Bed temp: 50 (PLA glasses or softens at 60, so setting lowers helps adhesion without risking slumping on longer prints. Adjust as needed, but don't go higher than 60)<br/>Platform adhesion: Raft<br/>Filament diameter: 1.75<br/>Nozzle size: 0.4<br/>Retraction speed: 10mm/s<br/>Distance: 10<br/>Initial layer thickness: 0.3<br/>Travel Speed: 100mm/s<br/>Bottom layer speed: 20mm/s<br/>Outershell speed: 20mm/s<br/><br/>These settings should get you started. If you have printing issues, Google: "Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer v2 (insert print issue here)" to find out how to fix it. There are a lot of people with this printer, so there is an abundance of help available. Odds are someone else had your issue already and received help resolving it.<br/><br/>The printer does not come with an SD card reader or a MicroSD to SD adapter, so you will have to provide those. Many laptops have an SD card reader built in, and if you bought a MicroSD card for your phone, it should have come with an adapter. Otherwise, the readers are available cheaply on Amazon, and some can read MicroSD without an adapter.<br/><br/>For less than $200, you cannot beat this printer. Heck, unless you need a bigger build plate, you can only beat this with the Pro version that has Wi-fi, a touch screen, and auto-bed leveling. Otherwise, this is as good as my much more expensive printers, if not better, just with a smaller build volume.</span>

<span>Update:<br/>My original review is below.  I originally gave this printer a 5 star rating, but due to a design flaw that became apparent after printing about 2KG of filament, I have reduced the rating to 3 stars.  The heater and a temperature sensor in the heated bed are connected to a circuit board in the base of the printer through cables inside the bed plate which flex as the bed moves back and forth.  As the cables flex, they rub against a pully which can damage the cables after a time.  Flexing of the cables also eventually caulses them to weaken and break at points where they are secured to the undside of the bed by cable ties. This is what happend to my printer.  This flaw is well known now, and I followed instructions I found on the net to fix it by routing new cables from the bed to the circuit board  in a different manner.  The fix took some time and some soldering and drilling skills, and is not esthetically pleasing, but it got the printer working great again.  However I would not have bought this printer if I had known about the design flaw.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>I was new to 3D printing and was expecting a large learning curve so was surprised to find how quickly I started getting good results.<br/><br/>3D design software<br/>There is a lot of free 3D design software.  I used the on-line  "TinkerCad" site to create a design for my first project,  a tiny (120x70x80mm) internet radio that includes 3D printed chassis, front and rear panels, control knobs and a dial pointer. TinkerCad is easy to use and has built-in tutorials, so it only takes a few hours to become reasonably proficient.  TinkerCad lets you separately export each component as an  OBJ file that you can  convert into "g-code"  3D printer instructions using "slicer" software.<br/><br/>Slicer Software<br/>The  Monoprice printer comes with an SD card that contains two slicers you can use to convert your OBJ files to g-code, "Cura" and "Repetier-Host".  I tried Cura first because it looked easier to use and it worked well for my first printed componet, the simple knobs for the radio, but it would not process the file for the large chassis. So I switched to Repetier-Host slicer, and it worked well.  In both Cura and Repetier-Host there are many settings for controlling various aspects of the 3D printer, so you should do some internet research to find out what setting to try first.  The manual that comes with the Monoprice printer  includes some suggested settings.  See my recommendations below.<br/><br/>To use Repetier-Host, you load the OBJ file of the component to be printed, select the "slicer" tab, select the slicer type "Slic3R" (the Cura slicer is also available in Repetier-Host),  select the "Configuration" button to make any settings adjustments and then select the "Slice with Slic3R" button to convert the OBJ file into g-code.  Thereafter you can select the "Save to SD" button to save the g-code file to an SD card, insert the SD card into the Monoprice printer and then start the printing process by selecting the g-code file for printing.  If you connect your computer to the printer via USB, you can bypass the SD card and sent the g-code directly to the printer from Repetier-Host.  I tried that but found the printer behaved somewhat unpredictably.  In any case, printing from an SD card is preferable because it allows the printer to act in a stand-alone mode without relying on continuous communication with your computer during the printing process.  Since printing can take  a long time (the radio chassis print took 22 hours), any glitch in your computer or USB connection during the entire printing process can cause a print fail.<br/><br/>Bed Leveling<br/>For 3D printing one hurdle to overcome is to get the first layer of melted filament goo to stick to the print bed.  To do that you need to set the print nozzle to an appropriate height above each portion of the print bed using the four level adjusting screws on the print bed corners.  Turn on the printer and use the control knob on the printer  to sent the print head to the "Home" position with the nozzle in the lower left corner of the print bed just above the print bed.  Then turn off the printer and adjust the screws to lower the bed at each corner enough to  slip a sheet of typing paper under the nozzle with slight resistance.  You can manually depress the print bed and push it and the nozzle around to test the nozzle height at each corner of the bed.  Although the instructions say that the paper should slide with slight resistance under the nozzle, I found that for printing with PLA filament, I had to lower the bed by an extra 1/4 turn on each adjusting screw in order to get the goo to stick well on the bed.  Test print a small component after leveling the bed and adjust the bed height if the goo is not sticking properly.<br/><br/>Bed Surface<br/>The other thing you need to get the goo to stick well is a suitable bed surface.  People use painter's tape, or  glass with hairspray or glue stick on the surface of the print bed to aid in goo sticking  Although the Monoprice printer in the past apparently came with some painter's tape on the bed, my printer arrived  covered with black plastic looking material on the bed.  I think is  "BuildTak", or something similar.  Whatever it is, it works exceptionally well.  Once I got the bed height properly adjusted, the printer has had no problems getting any print to stick.  No other sticking aids needed.<br/><br/>Printing Controls<br/>The Monoprice printer has a single knob for navigating the menus on the printer's LCD display and  and initiating various functions.  I mainly use the Home function to level the bed and the Print function to start the printing process by selecting a g-code file from the SD card. I also use the Monitor function  to heat the nozzle and use the Movement function to lower the filament when installing a roll of filiment and to raise the filimant from a heated nozzle when removing the filament from the machine.  You can manually set the nozzle and bed temeratures using the Monitor funcition, but since I configure the slicer to specify the nozzle and bed temperatures in the g-code file, it isn't necessary to manually adjust those temperatures using the control knob before printing.  If you set the slicer to specify the temperatures in the G code file, it automatically heats the nozzle and bed to the specified settings and homes the nozzle before it starts to print.<br/><br/>Slicer Settings<br/><br/>Temperature:<br/> I use PLA  filament fro 3D Solutech.  In the slicer settings  a 220 degree nozzle temperature and a 60 degree bed temperature setting worked well for this filament.<br/><br/>Retraction:<br/> When the printer moves the nozzle from one place to another without printing, it retracts the filament to avoid depositing any filament while it is moving.  The default setting is 2mm, but I found a 4mm retraction setting was necessary to avoid depositing wispy strands of filament when the nozzle re-positions.<br/><br/>Speed:<br/>Slower nozzle travel speeds make printing longer but decrease the likelihood that the goo will not properly stick as it is being laid down.  For PLA,  I use 15mm/s for perimeters and first layer, 40mm/s for infill, and 50% slower speed for external perimeters and 20mm/s for gap fill  These setting make for very slow printing, but I have been getting reliably good results.  I have not experimented with higher speed.<br/><br/>Skirt and Brim<br/>You can set the slicer to adding a small beak-away brim on the to the first layer of a small part to increase the surface area of the component that contacts the bed thereby helping the first layer to stick to the bed.  This would probably be necessary only for printing fairly small components.  However with the bed surface that came with my copy of the Monoprice printer, I  have not found it necessary to  add a brim for even very small parts.<br/><br/>This is a nice machine for the money and I have been having a lot of fun with it.  I'm sure you will too.</span>

<span>I bought this Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer for a young friend for Christmas and I am completely satisfied with it as an exceedingly affordable entree into 3D printing.<br/><br/>I've owned  Monoprice Maker Select 3D printer for 2 years now and my young friend has printed quite a bit on my printer. When Monoprice came out with this smaller, highly affordable printer, his experience with my larger Monoprice printer made this Select Mini a natural choice for gifting him. He was here for Christmas break so I helped him set the printer up and he printed non-stop for 2 weeks and I had the opportunity to work with the printer closely during that time.<br/><br/>The features of this printer are quite impressive considering the price. It has a smallish build volume - 4.7" x 4.7" x 4.7" - but larger models can be split up into pieces or sized down. And really, the recipient (a 16 year old) has not found the build volume to be especially limiting. It has a heated bed. It's quite compact for people who are short on space. This would likely fit in any dorm room. It also comes fully assembled and ready to print. This is especially nice for people who have zero experience with 3D printing. You can print via a microSD card, a USB cable connected to your computer or over wifi.<br/><br/>There is a 3.7" color IPS screen on the front and the user interface is very friendly and easy to use.<br/><br/>I am writing this review for people who are completely new to 3D printing so experienced users will likely want to skip this. First of all, 3D printing is about as hands-on, DIY as you can get. For example, every filament is different - even from the same manufacturer. There can be variances in diameter, variances in printing temps, etc. That will affect your prints. The settings in your slicer are also critical and tweaking those settings is a part of the process. Your print bed must be very level and on this printer, that is done manually. It will seem daunting at first but soon, you'll be able to do it in your sleep. The main thing to understand is that there is a constant learning curve. Especially with a budget printer. However, there is a vast community of 3D printing folks who are extremely helpful and have posted countless videos and blogs that are filled with helpful information. There is likely an answer out there for any issue you will encounter.<br/><br/>The included user guide is pretty good for setting this printer up the first time. It's also available at the Monoprice website for download. The printer ships with a plastic spatula for removing your prints, a tiny Allen wrench for leveling the print bed, the filament spool holder, the power adapter, a USB cable, and a microSD card that contains important files. More on that later.<br/><br/>I suggest that if you purchase this printer, you order at least one spool of PLA or PLA+ filament because it only comes with a sample amount of filament. I have had great luck with Hatchbox brand. Be sure to order 1.75mm PLA. This printer will also print other kinds of filament but PLA is the easiest to print and is best for beginners, IMO. Also, I suggest buying some filament cutters like these </span>

<span><br/><br/>The microSD card comes with the install files for Cura, free slicing software you install on your computer that allows you to adjust your printer settings and send the model to your printer, as well as monitor the printing process. It also comes with a model of a cat to print. The included sample of filament is enough to print this cat model. Cura will need to have certain values entered that are specific to this printer and that is covered in the manual however, there are updated Cura settings available for download from the Monoprice website.<br/><br/>I suggest after ordering that you watch a number of the great YouTube videos that demonstrate how to set up and print with this printer. It will make it even easier to start printing right away when your printer arrives. You should also read on various 3D printing websites about the basics of 3D printing that are common to all filament printers and then pages that are specific to this printer. There are also many videos that cover the modification I suggest later in the review.<br/><br/>I purchased a small, tool bag for my young friend to keep his tools and supplies handy. I added a box of gallon zip lock bags to store his filament in because PLA can absorb moisture from the air so should be stored in something air-tight. I also place my printers on a single, ceramic tile so that I am sure it's on a completely flat surface. A 12" x 12" tile or larger is plenty big enough for this printer. You can buy single tiles at Lowes or Home Depot.<br/><br/>Straight out of the box, the first print was quite decent (and looked fantastic to some other friends who had never seen a 3D print) and we had no issues with printing at all. We tweaked the settings a little for the filament we used and the next print was even better. Again, 3D printing is a hands-on process. We immediately printed a replacement knob for the printer which is easier to turn and it looks great and fit perfectly.<br/><br/>I do have a concern about the gantry, which the print head moves along. It is only attached on one side and I can see at some point that it could begin to sag, which would definitely affect printing. There are already a couple of modifications that require only simple, 3D printed parts and a metal rod and some linear bearings. The parts cost ~ $25. This mod is next on my list. Search "MP Select Mini X Gantry Support + Camera Mount [Reinforced and Realigned] by svideo" on Thingiverse for the 3D printed parts and links to the necessary hardware.<br/><br/>I also added a piece of glass to the print bed because I'm used to printing on glass and it provides a mirror finish to the bottom of prints. Google and you will find a template someone made to cut the glass the correct size. I just used glass from a cheap, Dollar Store picture frame and a thermal mat to adhere it to the bed, but you can use small, bulldog clips instead. </span>

<span>I'm really happy with this printer so far, at first I was skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews but after actually having the product and getting my hands on it I feel a lot more comfortable.<br/>First the negatives<br/>1. The build plate is bent it is clearly bowed in the center higher than it is on the edges, when I first got it the filament wouldn't stick to the bed because of this but after I screwed in the 4 hex screws it worked just fine. The slight bend wasn't enough to affect my prints but maybe not everyone will be that lucky.<br/>2. The build plate is covered in masking tape, while this works I would much rather see something like a PEI Sheet or BuildTak.<br/>3. This product comes with sample filament, at the $220 price point I think it would be smarter for them to just not include any filament at all, its a waste of money and it adds unnecessary confusion because people read that it comes with filament so they think they don't have to buy any. Besides it's not like filament is even expensive anyway at only $20 for a 1kg roll.<br/>The neutrals<br/>1. It only includes 1 sample gcode on the sd card, while this really isn't a big deal I wasn't able to print anything else out during the first night I owned this because cura wasn't working properly. I followed monoprice's instructions but none of the files I downloaded and converted to gcode worked, the day later I looked online and added a whole bunch of settings to cura that wasn't mentioned in the instructions and everything worked fine. It's a lot of stuff that needs to be setup in cura to get the device running perfect so I excuse their instructions for not being clear but If they included some more gcodes on the sd card I could have printed those in the meantime instead of printing out half a dozen cats.<br/><br/>And finally the positives and this is were the 5 star rating comes in.<br/>1. The quality of the parts on this device are great, I read a lot of negative reviews of people having issues but I can tell by looking at the device that it uses quality parts. I think the problems come down to the manufacturing, they used high quality parts so to keep the cost down they skimped out on the manufacturing process.<br/>I feel like you will have a much higher chance getting a defective unit if you buy this 3d printer over other ones on the market but if you do get a good unit I have no doubts that it will last for years to come and will preform thousands of prints just fine.<br/>2. It only costs $220 seriously that's cheap for a 3d printer and after a few dozen prints this thing will pay for itself. I mean stop and think how many times have you brought something from the store that you could have just as easily printed out? flowerpots, cookie cutters, small containers, figurines, the list of stuff I could have just printed out instead of just brought is endless. Also how many times have you broken plastic and had to throw something away because of it? Instead of throwing it away now you can just print yourself a replacement part and fix it.<br/>3. It looks good on a shelf. I know that isn't really a selling point for most people but I still consider it a positive. Not all 3d printers are this attractive looking and it doesn't take much room on a shelf so you can put it almost anywhere.<br/>4 it has a build in os and you can print straight from the device itself, I know most 3d printers if not all have this but at the $220 price point they could have easily skimped out on this but they didn't. It's nice to be able to load a bunch of future prints onto the sd card and know I can print them later without ever having to turn on my pc.<br/>5. It can print abs, while I hear it's not easy to do and may take using some tricks to achieve it some people have been able to do it and it's nice to know its capable of it.<br/><br/>Overall is it a prefect printer? Not at all.<br/>Is it a good first 3d printer? Not really unless you are tech savy and are willing to spend time to make things work with it.<br/>Does it print great looking 3d prints, absolutely which is why despite all its quirks and problems I think it's worth every penny of the $220 I paid for it.</span>

<span>I have been using FDM style printers for years, but never wanted to get into SLA printing due to the cost. This printer, at the sub $200 sales price, made it easy to jump in. No need to level the platform, just add resin and print from the SD card.<br/><br/>At $200 this is a steal, but I still had issues:<br/>-I have not been able to get the wifi working so I haven't been able to change profiles (although you can change them live during a print).<br/>-If the file name of any file on the SD card is too long, the machine crashes with no warning (I don't know the file name length max).<br/>-I haven't found good slic3r settings for prints that need supports yet. I haven;t had a successful print with supports yet.<br/>-Kit does not include things like a metal scraper for removing parts or a plastic scraper for cleaning the thin plastic bottom on the vat.<br/>-Additional vats are not yet available which would be handy for improving workflow.</span>

<span>I'm new to SLA printing but am an Electrical Engineer so I figured I could tackle all the various issues.<br/><br/>Ok, just the facts: Setup was very easy and the first prints went well but after Vat cleaning and new Elegoo resin everything went downhill and I never had another good print.  I have currently returned the printer but may take another swing.<br/><br/>Details:<br/>This printer is cheap so your expectations need to be set accordingly.  The user manual only covers the minimal information, so this is an exercise in problem solving.  If you don't do this well, spend more money and get a different printer.<br/><br/>What they don't tell you in all the various SLA Printer marketing descriptions is most SLA resin is toxic and how you need to protect yourself from exposure.  So you have to research all that stuff - gloves, processes, disposal - before you even start using the printer.  This is not explained well and I did a lot of YouTube to learn how to be safe.<br/><br/>I ran some test prints using the provided "pigs" files with their 100mL of Resin.  The pigs went very well and so I moved forward with one of my precise prints.  I needed 100 microns of resolution so this printer's specs indicated it can do sub-fifty micron so I should have been able to achieve that precision.  My print came out ok with the stock resin but when measured with digital calipers it was off 1.5mm.  Very close but not good enough for my requirements.<br/><br/>That's when I learned about cleaning.  Properly cleaning your prints after they come out of the printer is a critical step.  You can swish in IPF but for precision, you'll need an untrasonic cleaner to get all the loose resin off.  I got one for about $30 but I never got to use it.  There is also the curing process - for me, I just used the sun which worked ok.<br/><br/>After my last print with the stock resin, I followed the instructions to clean the Vat.  This was a pain because staying clear of the resin, straining for particles and cleaning the FEP takes practice to do it efficiently.  After cleaning the Vat, adding new resin and reprinting all I had were failed prints.  I'm still unclear why... potential causes could have been particles in the Vat preventing proper leveling (this is critical), however, I did come to understand why my last prints failed.  On the Vat there are 2 thumb-screws to lock it down.  At some point, the left screw was cross-threaded and although it got tight it did not get tight because it was against the Vat, it was tight because it is difficult align the Vat on the printer, no alignment pins or outline marks you just have to fish until the screw fall into the holes, and the holes in the Vat for the screws are so big it allows for them to be skewed just enough to cross-tread the nut in the printer if not properly aligned.  So, my final prints failed because the Vat was loose and I couldn't tell because both of the thumb-screws were tight, but because of the large amount of slop in the Vat holes it allows for them to be misaligned.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I do believe this is a functional design but requires a lot of learning for beginners and there's a lot of slop in the mechanical implementation.  For me, this is Strike one but because of the initial success I may try it one more time, I think, with care, this could work just fine.</span>

<span>The power socket had a short in it before I could make 1 print.  Amazon support said an exchange would take 2-months due to backorders. So, I disassembled the printer and replaced the socket myself. Its all good now.<br/><br/>As for the printer itself, you get what you paid for. Everything seems to work as advertised. The assembly was easy but I did my research and watched an assembly on Youtube first.<br/><br/>The baseplate is tiny compared to the FDM printers I used before this but adequate for small chess pieces, jewelry, or other gadgets.<br/><br/>Unlike many reviewers I see no problem with the firmware or software and find using Chitubox a delight.<br/><br/>So far so good after a choppy start.</span>

<span>This is a good little printer, has some minor z-banding issues due to the spring coupler used on the z-access, but can be solved if it's noticeable.<br/><br/>The biggest issues I found is that unless you join the community support forums you are going to be pretty lost. You will need to immediately flash/update firmware, change slicers to something like ChiTuBox, and then experiment with the settings. Remember, this is a cheap printer, it's not going to last forever or be a workhorse, but it will be fun to toy around with, and tinker to get better settings out of.<br/><br/>Personally I am not new to 3D Printing (FDM), but incredibly new to SLA. I figured for $200, might as well try, and see if I like the results, knowing it all might be a failure. I was pleasantly surprised, will probably get a different printer as a workhorse now that I know I like what I can do with SLA.</span>

<span>I am not a happy adapter of new technology.  When my printer finally gave out, I searched for an unused model of the same kind, no longer manufactured, and used it.  It had actually been free as an Apple Store promotion when I bought my computer.<br/><br/>But the color function never worked, so I was limited to black-and-white.  It was somewhat compatible with my newer MacBook, but I found it easier to use the older one.  Finally, I realized I needed to move forward and purchased a new printer-- which was immediately returned because it was so complicated to install and never actually worked.  So, back to the old one for a long period, until I decided to be brave and attempt a new model again.<br/><br/>Researching online the best models for my computer, I found this one was rated highly.  My previous printer was an HP and, although the quality was never quite as good as my previous model (and I can't even remember the brand), it was good.  Most important to me, it can be used with a USB connection, as I have had terrible luck with wireless anything.<br/><br/>When it arrived it sat in the box for at least two weeks, as I avoided the presumed hassle plus endless waiting for tech support.<br/><br/>I was thrilled to find out that it was actually quite easy to set up and install.  The ink cartridges separate the three colors, which of course means you aren't paying the exorbitant cost to replace a triple cartridge when only one color is depleted.  But they install as my old HP cartridges had, so not a challenge.<br/><br/>The happiest aspect is that connecting the WiFi is as simple as entering the password for the modem.  I was absolutely thrilled to find it instantly functional.<br/><br/>In fact, I did not rate the tech support for this review as I had no reason to contact them<br/><br/>I have thus far only printed, and haven't attempted to use the assorted other functions, like faxing or scanning (I have a separate scanner which I have used for years and doubt that the smaller version included with the printer would meet my needs, though it could be fine for various documents).  The printing quality for scanned photos is so-so and a bit streaky, but I only have attempted this with garden variety copy paper as a trial for modifications before taking it to be professionally printed.</span>

<span>Spoiler alert: I just buy HP printers but my review is not biased in fact the device in question has an initial defect that can provoke lots of headaches during the setup process.<br/><br/>HP always provide great products for the price paid, and you can see that the printer is very well built, the display is very convenient and easy to read. The touch screen is very responsive, however at times I had few issues where I was trying to type 2 and was recording 1. But other than that the touchscreen is really useful especially if you do not plan to use it at all with a computer - something that can be accomplished easily and quickly.<br/><br/>If your goal is to set it up straightly as a wireless printer, do not do that immediately, there is a very big issue in the firmware shipped in the printer. You will lose WiFi connectivity and none of your computer will recognize it as connected. Good news is that it can be easily fixed. Be ready to have an ethernet cable instead and connect it to your router, then perform a network setup and turn off Wireless.<br/><br/>What you need is the included HP Web Server active, then log in into the web panel and from there trigger a software update. It will take about 5 minutes to complete, restart your printer, activate the WiFi and pair it to your WiFi Router, disconnect the ethernet cable and voila! You will be ready to use your printer everywhere in your small office or home.<br/><br/>The printer receive data very quickly and it's able to print a regular color or black white document in just seconds, and the default regular quality is really good for all purposes printouts.<br/><br/>You can obviously decide to print using photo paper and the quality of the printouts is astonishing, you won't expect such quality from a OfficeJet and I was a bit concerned but after printing a photo with both the DeskJet and the OfficeJet I can see that the difference is really really minimal, I may see that the DeskJet print a little bit sharper, but it's not something you'll notice unless you have a good eye or a magnifier in your hands.<br/><br/>Something that I am really liking is the total full-duplex feature, meaning not only you can print 2 sides easily, but you can get 2 sided copies using the upper feeder. That is a very nice addition and also you can scan double sided/multipage documents easily also using the upper feeder.<br/><br/>A difference I noticed between the OfficeJet and the DeskJet is that the software provided for this printer is bare-bone, nothing to scream about. The only mention I may have is the OCR, which is a nice addition but nothing really big. Also, the drivers and control panel design is really "office" oriented, there are not the same amount of options that you will find for a DeskJet. I know, I understand that HP meant all this to be easy-as-possible to avoid distractions to business-oriented-minds but it's also true that regular retail users and home users may buy this printer thinking about "home" usage... Maybe HP can learn and offer different drivers depending the situation, but this is not topic of this discussion.<br/><br/>It is important to underline I successfully configured this printer on a Mac, 2 Windows laptops, 1 Linux laptop, 1 ChromeBook and 2 Android devices. While it's frustrating the fact that the interfaces are all different, it's nice to know that Google Cloud Printing is fully functional and supported, and that I can print photos of my outdoor escapades from my android device and finding them already printed when I get home!<br/><br/>Inside the box you won't find an ethernet cable nor a usb cable, so if your plan is to connect to a router or directly to a computer via USB be ready to have such cables with you, also do not use the CD to install software to your computer because it's also outdated, once you got the printer connected and you are ready to install it, in your windows pc or macintosh, visit the following url [...] - Follow the simple instructions and you will get the all the required updated software. Notice: The printer itself will recommend this step from the display.<br/><br/>Another nice addition, not really useful but still an addition. This printer has sound, yes. Each action is accompanied by soft tone. In the eventuality that you don't like to listen any noise coming from the printer you can just disable sounds and activate also quiet mode, which will slow down the operations but will make the printer extremely quiet.<br/><br/>It has a FAX, I tried just once to send a fax to the office and process is really easy, straightforward. You can configure it to work on a dedicated fax line or sharing it with regular telephone line. If you select the second option, the printer I suppose will ring along with your phone but as I haven't received any fax, I cannot say how it rings. Being an HP product I suppose it will just work fine and as expected.<br/><br/>All in all, although the installation process is a bit tedious the printer is really top notch, good printout quality, easy of use (once configured) and a plethora of useful features make this a great catch, a printer you should buy for home or for your small office!

<span>I bought to use with foiling and paper crafting. Hubby decided to upgrade from his 1996 HP monochrome laser to an expensive color laser and he refused to let me buy generic toner drums for it and continue to use the old and true. However it did have some probems as it did not handle cardstock well. In the end rather than fight it I ordered this rather older model though still being made brother laser monocolor printer. And it has not let me down. As cheap as some of it feels overall it's wonderful. My two favorite things is it is a SMALL FOOT PRINT working next to my huge 19" color inkjet printer it's tiny. And it allows me to do straight passes which so far have accepted all cardstocks I've tried. I used a color 110# card stock and both 65 and 85 special smooth extra white cardstock I buy here on Amazon and everyone printed well and then laminated well when foiling. Extremely happy. Did I mention the TINY size. I intend to travel with this gem in a class b mini motor home so to speak and so continue to enjoy my hobby on the road trips too. I also splurged and upgraded my older legal size flat bed scanner with also an older obsolete fashion model by cannon that allows it to sit upright and feed upright or laid down for a flat bed but only 8.5x11 inch standard sheets. Again I'd been stuck with the albatross of over sized scanner cause hubby wanted this and when it arrived he rejected and stayed with his orginal even larger scanner. In the end he now is taking my reject and actually his all along and I'm finally enjoying the smaller sized officee hardware and more desk space. Love it. Now I know I could have gone with the color for less than 100 more in very similar size and Brother too but really I wanted to keep it simple. I want to test the waters without spending too much and leaves the bank account to spend more on FUN stuff like more cardstock and more foil patterns to play with. Look up H&amp;H signs for finding wonderful toner/textile foils they have a huge supply at great prices and note textile foil is what works with toner. Not all foils work the same way. So make sure you know which one  you are buying before buying or using the wrong one and ruining a project. (I have foils for glimmer hot embossing that is not the same foil. I have permanent vinyl foils for just that hardsurface applications, I have heat setting foils for just that ironing onto hard surfaces, paper and even fabrics. Then I have foils for toner work and yes they also work with some textile applications with special adhesive technques you may use with it. That I do not do just the toner to date. There also is foiling an foil flakes that work with tacky glues and pastes on cardstocks and fabrics too. So a lot to learn about foiling and that not all foils work across the board the same. I keep mine in different drawers labeled to insure I don't use the wrong product. Also to insure I get a good foil when it comes to fabric I always write on a flap or smaller to be applied piece of fabric rather than take the chance of ruining a tote bag etc. I spent hours sewing and damage it with a messed up foil job. Better to get the foiling done right before full assembly. So this printer I highly recommend if you know you are happy with no color other than BLACK print. It will do shades of gray by the way so it's possible to kind of play around with pencil drawings and get some lovely prints..I haven't tried to foil those however. Of course not. Meantime it does do two side printing but I don't do that. I don't want to worry about the interior getting dirty because I printed both sides. And with foil work  you don't want any extra toner specks on your work sheet to be foiled. If you do a brush that's great but if you go over the toner area you want to foil you can mess it up by removing too much and can't tell until it's foiled and little missed specks show up. Not sure why in Q/A they said you could not do cardstock. The bullet points say clearly you can. I proved you can. I would buy this printer again if something happens to this one. Should last a long time if I take care of it. And we take care of our hardwares and often my printers last well over 10 years and the scanner was over 19 years I just replaced. I also work with a windows 10 and a windows Xp machine. I do most of my graphics on The XP because a lot of the software I use and rely on is no longer supported sometimes no longer made and not for the W10's. So far the printer works flawlessly by either machine. I did not go with the Wifi version but my husband now wishes I would have. We got our comunications mixed up on that. No matter I'm happy and we've been married 50 years last month so we're fine and used to wee bits of nickering to keep us aligned and well. PS he hates his NEW COLOR Laser. He's got his eye on this Brother and that's ok too. He sneaks into my office area and uses my STUFF all the time. Ok sneaks not so much...he loves my big paper cutter and my Carl paper tirmmer and my various 4 different binder equipment. He used to offer to take them off my hands in fact. Silly guy...he's got his own. He's got the bigger office room with tons of drawers. But I've made my area work well with lots of clean work surfaces to lay out projects small and large. I know have embossing machines too. This little guy is going to get a huge work out and already passed with flying colors.</span>

<span>I bought this printer to replace a 14-year old Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer. That printer has an Ethernet connector that I used as well as USB and LPT connectors that I did not use.  I needed a replacement printer that I could access on my network from various computers around the house.  This Brother HL-L2300D had everything the Brother HL-5250DN Duplex printer provided, but with only a USB connection.<br/><br/>I can report that I have installed this new Brother HL-L2300D on my wireless router USB port and have it printing flawlessly from my desktop and laptop.  I used no additional software other than what is built into the router and Windows 10.  The new printer's print quality is excellent, both the duplex printing and all other printing is quieter than the old printer, and it has a straight-through paper path for manual feed which improved envelope and label printing.  I have Continue Mode set ON and Auto Shutoff set OFF.  I have the new printer in a switched AC outlet, and only turn it on when I need it.  Using the switched outlet, the printer powers up and is ready to receive print jobs without having to press the Power button.  When I leave the switched outlet on and the printer falls asleep, the printer wakes up when the router sends it a print job.  This is exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>I hope this review will provide anyone else who has similar requirements with a way to test their system to make sure that using a USB-only printer connected to a router will work for them too.  I read about using the USB port on my ASUS N900 RT-N66U Wireless router to set up a network print server and wanted to be sure that would work, so I used the old printer to test that.<br/><br/>I decided to use my desktop for this test and make no changes on the laptop until ready to install the new printer.<br/><br/>Still using the old printer, I disconnected the ethernet cable and connected the printer to the router with a USB cable.  Using the web interface to the ASUS router (192.168.1.1 by defaults), within 60 seconds I saw Brother HL5250DN appear as a USB 2,0 connected device on the router.<br/><br/>Because I already had the Windows 10 driver installed for using this printer on an Ethernet port, all I had to do was add a new TCP/IP port to the router for the USB connection following these breadcrumbs:<br/><br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Brother HL-5250DN &gt; Manage &gt; Printer Properties &gt; Ports &gt; Add Port... &gt; Standard TCP/IP Port - New Port... &gt;<br/><br/>The Add Standard TCP/IP Port Wizard will appear.<br/><br/>Click Next<br/>Enter your router IP address, usually 192.168.1.1 in both the "Printer Name and IP Address" and the "Port Name" text boxes.  If you already have a port named 192.168.1.1, Windows will change the name to 192.168.1.1_1 automatically.<br/><br/>Windows will then try to detect that port for about a minute, then show a screen "Additional port information required".  Select Custom &gt; Settings to see the Port Settings dialog.<br/><br/>Change protocol from Raw to LPR<br/>Under LPR Settings enter a "Queue Name" such as LPRServer1<br/>Click Ok &gt; Next &gt; Finish and the new port will be shown in the ports list and selected for use by the existing Printer driver.<br/><br/>When I got the new Brother HL-L2300D, I used these breadcrumbs to install it on the desktop and laptop:<br/>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; My printer isn't listed &gt; Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings.<br/><br/>I followed all the screens in the wizards to install the new printer.<br/><br/>On the desktop, when I reached the point to define the port, I just selected the 192.168.1.1 that I had set up above.<br/><br/>On the laptop, when I reached the point to define the port, I followed the same steps as above to add the new port 192.168.1.1<br/><br/>On both the desktop and the laptop, when the Wizard asks you to select the driver you want, the Brother HL-L2300D will probably not be on the list.  Click the Windows Update button on that list page and Windows will download all the printer names for all printers for which Windows 10 provides drivers.<br/><br/>Hope this is helpful.</span>
