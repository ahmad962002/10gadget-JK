<span>The two on the left were printed with the Epson while the one on the right was printed by staples “photo quality”. I love the ability to set up the print file myself and that it prints at full-bleed flawlessly on a basic 8.5x11 photo paper!<br/>I printed 2 to test the satin vs presentation matte paper and the colors have little difference! You can see the Staples print does not match the color and appears darker than on screen. I didn’t do any color correcting prior to printing and it only took 2 minutes to print a photo. It’s pretty spectacular for the price!<br/>I’ll update in about 6 months to see where we’re at with quality.</span>

<span>I spent 3 hours on the phone with Epson customer &amp; tech support. I bought this printer mainly for the auto two-sided printing...I really wanted auto two-sided printing (plus the larger sizes). Monday, I spent 4 hours trying to get it to print on both sides on its own to no avail.<br/><br/>So I called tech support. For an hour the support guy tried to help, and failed. He said it was hardware malfunction. To get a replacement though I would have to let them put a ~$250 hold on my card. I said that was unacceptable [I get that their POV about sending a $400 printer to someone who already has a $400 printer, but I'm not giving you *more* money when what you gave me doesn't work and not everyone has $250 they can just "hold"... thats like a tank of gas for some of y'all right now] So I asked to speak to a manager.<br/><br/>The manager said the printer only auto prints for letter and legal. The website and all advertising online just says auto two-sided printing. The only caveat is anything bigger than 8.5x14 has to go in the back tray and that tray requires manual flipping. I was trying to print 7x10, which fits in the front tray. I explain that the company needs to be clear about what the printer does and doesn't do, that their website is MISLEADING--it's borderline fraud. Dude tells me it's in the manual ('cause I totally had a manual before I bought the printer???) and says I should have known; it's not their fault....<br/><br/>After I went off, he transferred me to customer service so I could make a formal complaint and they admitted the wording should be more clear.  They started a case/process for my complaint.<br/><br/>But I'm an engineer and I was not satisfied with the notion that it didn't work. Mechanically it didn't make sense. So I played around with it some more last night and as long as you choose a preset size that is close to your actual paper size (I chose JIS B5 since its closest to 7x10) the printer *DOES* auto 2-sided print for non-letter sized documents. The techs and managers just don't know how to use the products...which is understandable because it took someone with a PhD in Embedded Systems 2 days to figure it out...</span>

<span>I had an old Epson 2880 that I have had for years. It was starting to have issues so I bought this printer. I am so glad I did. Great printer. The only negative is that the normal tray that you pull out for the printed copies is automated. I can see in the long run of it being a problem.</span>

<span>Excuse the long review.  When my old Epson died in the middle of a print job, I was so excited to be able to purchase this model printer.  It was the last one available.  The dealer got it to me quickly; no problems with shipping.  However, the printer itself proved to be a big problem.  According to the reviews, people love or hate this printer.  I myself was totally exasperated before asking for a refund.  Why?  First, the power button is hard to see.  When going through the installation process, my first hiccup was that I  could not see the power button.  I kept hitting the home button instead.  Realizing that the home button did not have the proper icon, I got out a flashlight and hunted around until I found the power button.  {Yes, I wear glasses but they correct to 20/20].  A small irritation, really, and easily corrected once I found the right button. The rest of the loading process went smoothly.  Ink cartridges were easy to install.  Synching with computer was a breeze.  Test pages on plain paper and fine-tuning print nozzles took time but were easy.  The test page on plain paper looked sharp.  However, printing on photo quality paper was a disaster.  First, pages hung up in the printer. I kept getting an error message saying to reload paper when the paper was properly in the tray.  Had to keep opening and closing the tray. Double checked to see that the type of paper was properly entered.  Check.  Paper installed correctly.  Check.  Print quality on computer and printer synced.  Checked.  Right side paper up.  The problem?  When printing on photo paper--high gloss, matt presentation quality, and semi-gloss, I kept getting smeared looks--the results reminded me of watercolors.  Tried printing on top of the line Ilford paper--worse.  After more than four hours of checking, retesting, recleaning, redoing, gave up.  [Incidentally, I have used Epson printers for years.  Never had this sort of problem.]  Finally gave up and called Amazon.<br/><br/>Amazon to the rescue!  They did have to connect me with Epson to see if Epson could help me solve the problem.  That call was a disaster. Summary:  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  Did you try this?  yes, 2x.  You must be loading paper wrong.  No, I have tripled checked....After over an hour of repeating the basic steps over and over,  my hero Amazon person stepped in, ending the call, and allowed me to return the machine.  Repacked and had machine picked up.  Hurrah.<br/><br/>Looking back, since I had problems with the paper not loading as it should, perhaps it is some sort of roller problem.  Don't know.<br/><br/>Several folks have spoken highly of this printer.  I did much research before ordering it and it was generally highly praised.  The test shots on plain paper which I printed as part of the loading process have fine detail and great color gamuts.  I think I just got a lemon.  However, with Amazon, the pain of the lemon is now gone.<br/><br/>So...I have to give this individual printer a one because while it prints great on plain paper, it is useless for printing quality pictures on photo grade paper.  I give tech support [EPSON] a two because the person I spoke of did not seem to know much except how to start the printer going.  I give AMAZON support a 5!!!They were my hero in this situation and did not jack up the price because of scarcity.  I also give the seller a 5 for they got the printer to me quickly in great shape.  I give the printer a one for "touch screen" because it didn't have one.  It had buttons to push instead.  Not a big problem but would take longer to set settings than a touch screen would.<br/><br/>If these printers were widely available, I probably would reorder and try another, but as of 9/1/20, decent printers and photo printers are not available as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.</span>

<span>Have had this plotter for a couple of months. Our company is actually ordering another one for our other office today. Plots clearly and does not seem to be flying through the ink.<br/><br/>The plotter does have a couple of slight flaws. It is rather slow when printing multiple sheet jobs. Also, the plotter does not seems to allow for plot jobs to be queued. One print job must complete before successfully beginning the plotting process for another file. Would also like the ability to scan existing prints into computer.<br/><br/>Overall, would buy again for a large-format plotter in my price range.</span>

<span>We have had nothing but problems with this printer since we purchased it directly from HP.com a few weeks ago. Page alignment issues, HP ePrint security problems, outdated documentation, and ignorant support agents who can't speak English have made this an awful experience for us. Not only has no one from HP's foreign call center been able to help us but they seem to know even less about the printer's functionality than we do. We would return it, though HP does not accept returns on printers this large. Unacceptable service for a shoddy printer. Avoid at all costs.</span>

<span>This plotter was purchased to replace two older, outdated HP plotters (parts, support and ink cartridges not available any longer) that is now part of a small home business. Everything works as it should. The wi-fi setup took a bit longer than anticipated. Not sure why - all steps followed, but the connection took a few tries. The only thing I can come up with is that the plotter was too close to the computer and it was getting a swamped signal. Once the connection was made, it works flawlessly. I can even plot from my phone which is something I had not planned on. Overall, HP plotters (I used to work there, but I liked them before then) do the job as well or better than others on the market. Supplies are readily available and tech support (if ever needed) is as close as the internet.</span>

<span>I originally had an older version of Canon which was a great printer.

<span>I have searched for years to find the best printer for thick card stock and I think I finally found it. So far I am extremely impressed as I have been able to print on 5x7 130 lb card stock without any issues. It prints very clean, no streaks and exactly "centered" on the page (previous printers would print too high or low or too far to the right or left which caused lots of wasted paper, ink and having to "shave" part of the page to make the image centered). I found the installation to be very easy- within 20 minutes or so of unboxing the printer I already had my first print out. It doesn't seem to be using up ink any faster than my HP inkjet. I purchased remanufactured ink cartridges that we recommended by another reviewer but I have yet to try them. I will update this review after I've used the printer for a few projects and have a better idea of how quickly it runs through ink, if the manufactured cartridges work and if its still printing nicely on various sized card stock.<br/><br/>***update after a few months of use- the printer accepted the re-manufactured cartridges without any issues which is amazing. I have run into a little trouble with the rear feed. If I’m printing on thick card stock I have to manually feed every sheet which is extremely time consuming. It will print beautifully but when I have 100+ pages to print it takes so much more time than it would if I could put in a stack and walk away then come back to replace it. I still love the printer but I have to make the time to call canon and see if this is a common problem and see what I can do to fix it.</span>

<span>I lime this printer the way it looks but the printing is ok sometimes the color looms to opaque lines in pictures are better defined tho. If you can deal with the way it prints color you gotta also deal with th prices, I ran put of the magenta only  and that 281 cartridge was 29.99 so 32.57 with taxes now think there's another 4 cartridge in that printer, especially if you do crafting and or use 12 x 12 paper. Coneectivy is only ok as sometimes you have to connect the printer again after it goes to sleep (shut off) it won't be online no more in your system.</span>

<span>ignore all the bad reviews - this thing is so inexpensive and easy to use and set up, I had it going on 3 devices in less than 15 min. I am not tech savvy and I’m usually really bad at reading instructions. I used an iphone and two macbook pros. I did the initial setup on my phone then it was immediately searchable on my laptop. very user friendly. also I tested with expensive paper but wow, i mean- you can’t tell, with the quality that this is coming from a less-than-$100 at-home printer. It’s crystal clear. one little delta so far just seeing that the feeder kinda takes the next few papers with it a little bit but printed about 10 pages so far and haven’t had it jam or anything- just keep an eye on it while it’s printing i guess and align the papers while they go so they feed correctly.</span>

<span>Light weight and compact enough to not get in the way. Prints fast for me. Easy to assemble but to setup you will need to install the App on your phone or PC for it to work. If you have trouble printing right with Windows 10 it is due to MS update and there is a patch for it, the link in the app so you can install the driver. Wireless and you can print from anywhere to the printer. Also an option for HP+ and Instaink so they send you ink when you are low before you run out, you pick your plan on how many pages per month you use or change it whenever. Never run out of ink. The basic low end is only 99 cents a month!  You can choose to opt out of it. Cannot comment on durability and life because I just go it the other day. But with HP+ there is a 2 year warranty included.</span>

<span>It prints so it's fine. I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.<br/><br/>You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.<br/><br/>The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.<br/><br/>I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.<br/><br/>I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4/month.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.</span>

<span>I have installed several of these, but this one was difficult to get all the correct drivers and get it up and running, however, I finally got a phone number for a live person to help. He logged into my computer and installed the correct drivers. I mainly print from AutoCAD or from PDF on size C and D architectural paper. The Tech got me up and running in 2 phone visits (about a week).  So, I'm happy. Had I been swamped, this would have been very inconvenient, however, I had the number and could have called back later in the same day, so I'm sure we could have solved it in 24 hours.  It prints nicely.  The paper catching bag makes the paper really roll up (especially the smaller the fresh roll gets).  I synched up the cloth basket that catches the paper with binder clips to make it less deep and that seems to keep the pages laying more flat so they don't get smashed down by newer prints. You will have to babysit your prints if you have lots to print. (would be nice if they would just stack flat, but I suppose that version of the machine costs a lot more. It would also be nice if you could use a 300' roll of paper, a 150' roll only does one print order (size D) or 2 print orders (size C) of blueprints.  So, you can't just leave when it's printing, which is a bummer, but alas, it is what it is.</span>

<span>Confused why anyone had trouble setting this up. It was near effortless when following instructions.<br/><br/>Removed packing materials and tape<br/>Loaded app on laptop<br/>Signed up for HP+<br/>App automatically connected to printer (took a few minutes but I did not need to stay with it)<br/><br/>That was it.<br/><br/>Also, Instant ink is really easy. First shipment of free ink doesn't come for 7-10 days, but it did come with some initial ink. The people complaining about the free ink weren't paying attention. You can set it up for 700 pages/month for free for 6 months (that's 4200 free pages). After that you can change it to whatever you would like, including very cheap options that cost way less than buying normal ink cartridges. The ink cartridges they send you are significantly bigger than even XL cartridges.<br/><br/>The only way that the instant ink is bad is if you are printing rarely ever or printing a lot of almost entirely blank pages. You use 'page' credits by the page, so a full color page costs the same as printing a page with a single word on it.  The more ink per page you use (especially with full color prints) the more advantageous it becomes.<br/><br/>This may not be an ideal use case for everyone. I'm printing lots of full color pages, making it an incredibly good deal. Not here to advertise for HP, but this is the best home printer I have used.<br/><br/>Will update if anything goes wrong. I don't normally post reviews but I am shockingly impressed.</span>

<span>Installing this printer was a little glitchy. I first removed the packaging material and plugged into power. I installed and ran the full software, not the HP Smart thing. When I ran the installer I choose to setup via wireless, It did not find the printer. I figured, whatever, and connected my USB cable. After installing the printer software via USB, I was able to double check the manual from HPs website to locate the option to change wireless settings. Under Tools &gt; Device Setup &amp; Software &gt; Reconfigure Wireless Settings. I was easily able to switch from a USB connction to wireless. It did prompt to remove the USB cable after though. The biggest annoyance was me not paying attention to the pictures. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it only had the top paper feed tray instead of an actual hidden paper tray drawer. I had to tell myself it's a cheap printer. The main reason I purchased this printer was for the multi page scanning ability. My old HP Photosmart 6510 was only a single page scanner and took forever to scan a multi-page document, then the file size was enormous. For as much as I'll use this, I couldn't justify spending $250-500 on a nice full featured printer. It's a printer, it prints, it does what it's supposed to do.</span>

<span>I usually spend a few hundred bucks when I buy a new printer just to be sure I'm not buying junk.  Well, after coming across this particular printer, I was pretty surprised by its robust functionality and decided to give it a try.  Long story short, they way underpriced this machine.<br/><br/>It's extremely easy to set up, first of all.  I had another (more expensive) printer that was a complete headache to get connected to wifi because it wasn't programmable.  I had to follow all of these wonky steps to try and get it connected, until I finally just said eff it and plugged in a cable instead.  With this printer, you can program it right on its handle digital touchscreen.  I had it connected in probably a minute tops, and was already printing out a test page.<br/><br/>The print quality is outstanding as well for such a low cost printer.  And the printer ink is only $25 (for black *and* colors), which beats the pants off my past machines where I was spending twice that.<br/><br/>I also picked up the FOUR YEAR protection plan for only $30 and I recommend anyone to do the same.<br/><br/>(Note: I rated their "Tech Support" 3/5 because I haven't experienced their tech support as of yet.  In fact, they shouldn't even pose that question to brand new buyers, because how would we know unless we have a problem right away?  Or is that what the question is suggesting?  If so, not a good message to send.)</span>

<span>I love this printer. I recently replaced another brand of printer and I was a little worried because I’d never used this brand before. After reading good reviews about it, I decided to purchase. I’m so glad I did…I love it!  It was easy to set up. I was a little nervous about it, but I just followed the provided instructions and everything worked perfectly. I use it wirelessly and that worked great; connected immediately. I’ve also printed to it from my iPhone. The print quality is excellent. It’s super fast - printing, copying and scanning. I’ve used the one sheet copy and scan on the glass, and also used the multiple-page paper feeder on top. It saved me so much time from my previous printer. The printer utilities app that installed on my computer is straightforward and easy to use. It also has a fax machine but I’ve not used that as I haven’t had a need. I’ve used the print on both sides feature and that works fine. I also needed a printer that would both load paper and print to the front and this does that. I have this printer stored on a small rolling cart underneath my small desk in a kitchen nook where I do most of my work. I couldn’t be happier with it.</span>

<span>This printer is sent from the gods of tech. Installation is flawless. Set up for mobile printing smooth as silk and it only take one time for the set up rather than having to reload and call hp support and stay on the phone for hours. The print quality is superb. Prints photos in accurate color without a border. Two sided printing is a single toggle and it will revert to your settings after printing. Easy. Reliable. Accurate. You could not give me another brand of printer after this experience</span>

<span>Sick and tired of HP, I decided to switch to Brother.<br/>The printer arrived quickly, packaged adequately, and was super easy to install. I've always had problems connecting HP printers via Wi-Fi, so I've always wired them to my computer.<br/>This Brother connected via Wi-Fi seamlessly and has held its connection since the initial install.<br/>Print quality is fine, scans are a touch on the slow side but that's ok, as long as it stays connected to my computer.</span>
